front of you nope loudest thing you ever heard is it going to be dexterity checks i was going to say yasha can take out the magician's judge and start cleaving machete-style through the brush making it far easier for us to move advantage or straight up oh she's rage-clearing 21-- 22 oh there's six of these i thought there was three there's two dozen of them i don't want to get that close 23 for fjord 20 for yasha jamedi oh shit (laughing) that's amazing i can try to assume the form of one of the lizard people in case they make eyes on us i have no spell left to help yes oh no 12 for fjord

yeah yeah volley that shit oh so sick caleb and i are picking them off eldritch blast and-- no no oh my god why did we not take a short rest right when we started (laughter) i know i know i didn't think about it damn it that was gnarly oh fuck me that was a teacher that was a teacher no there's also smudge and-- fmiller8 yeah man can we just automatically get a short rest just because that was the most-- heinous strenuous-- no we're still wearing ours are-- it was bad luck uh huh there are imprints being left on that chair indeed such a mighty display on the way back i feel like i would be left wanting if i didn't try and pursue the same sort of glory captain may i ask you knew of this location already do you have a lead on another indeed we would certainly entertain that very notion it's hard to think past any sort of a rest of course could we have a conversation near the bow of the ship perhaps away from ears is it empty towards the bow i should start by thanking all of you for putting yourselves in harm's way again i did not expect that to go the way that it did but that seems a repetitive notion at this point yeah i knew when she showed that exuberance at diving down that it was a matter of urgency and i just couldn't catch her we made our way down this well into this open spherical room at the bottom underneath some algae there was a recession it looked like it had space for an orb like the eye that's in my sword in my dullardly moment of trying to figure how the fuck i would get it in there she reached out and she has the same sort of thing in her hand she put it in before i could put the sword in it ripped the eye straight out of her hand pulled her hand back and blood was coming out of it i thought it had done something to her that's when i saw these arcane-like symbols light up and they shoot across the floor and straight up toward you guys right above the water you saw them come out what happened that seems like a lot but no recession i can't remember when we found the actual cat's eye the sphere it wasn't in a recession was it just resting at the bottom of the well from three different creatures no it was the amber one yeah that big serpent with all the eyes like in her captain's-- amber yeah yeah i mean they're yellowish-amber yellowish-orange just depends on the way the light hits it yeah the same that she had decorated around her office that's uk'otoa you saw when we were in the boat she closed her hands and you felt that surge in the water yeah i think because she got there first and offered her orb she was rewarded with some sort of oceanic control or power over water i think so no back when we were in the rowboats i think so yeah i don't know why the water surged out of the temple like that you said they were protective in nature this is some heavy shit that would be a choice no i'm not a crazy person all right a giant serpent from the calamity yeah that's some medieval shit that is bigger than anything i've ever heard of i know and caduceus i know your experiences with water have been less than thrilling i'm all for trying to get knowledge out of the captain she seemed to act like she knew who the third person was or had been i see that as well thank you for the lookout frankly between us i actually tried to keep her underwater after she got away real fast yeah and then i had to act like no look at the ground it was terrible fucking failed i agree i'd like to find out what she knows about the third and then maybe ask for a bit of respite before we continue i actually do not feel very comfortable-- see i would be all for that given the circumstances of what beau just outlined big consequences looming that are age-old timeless things but if she can control water now i would be concerned that that effort might fall short and then we'd be super fucked i don't know what her abilities are yes i need more info caleb i need more data more knowledge you read books on this stuff there has to be someone out there that knows more about this before we just charge in if we have what she needs she'll have to play nice i think she's only interested in the one creature so she's only interested in this type of eye i don't even want to start to think about the onyx eyes or the ivory eyes thank you yasha i understand your concern caleb i do i have a small curiosity from the things that i've seen i have no interest in dealing with matters that predate time as we know it i'm pretty simple these days i've spent with you are the most exciting of my entire life i'm not looking to end them or the world by frivolously giving up something that i barely understand i'd like to try to ask if we can go separate ways and if she says no i would play that we would join her and her voyages in the morning and then sneak away i'd like to try and do it amicably if we can for sure i think either way we have to make it to darktow and we need a second ship third if she doesn't have a specific location two ships find that thing faster than one what do you say we'll have to play along until we get to darktow and it is not somewhere that you normally want to go if you're not of the pirate variety i think it's a pirate island it's a hideaway you don't go there unless you're looking for trouble or unless you are the trouble shit yeah yeah yeah i suppose i should to keep relations up yes all right i'll see you all underneath in her face i think it just burns is it magic acid okay did you make this thank you ooh okay all right thank you caduceus i'm going to make you a fan of water before your life is done i swear you're going to be my strongest acolyte you're going to preach the words of the water it's really not i mean look how good you're doing right thriving surviving your whole life yeah okay i'll get back to you on that i'll make my way towards the captain's quarters i do i'll try the door don't rush on my account to your success one can hope it's only fair you've been on this journey far longer than i have not aerated i am as well is it everything you thought it would be sword of fathoms can you tell me more about this person who wielded it this vandren you say he told you about the sword of fathoms or he had a sword of fathoms the same one was there an area a destination a direction that you last knew that he was going is it in our interest to try and find him how did you find if you don't mind me asking yours i'm sure he did i'll stand and just pace around the quarters looking at the various iconography of the serpent i don't we should find him (nervous laughter) 23 (long sigh) this sword came to me in a very unusual way i've been a sailor for many years myself and was lost at sea during a storm when i woke up i found myself on the shore and there in the waves next to me was this sword i don't know how i got there but as soon as i grasped it it changed everything the sword however did not have the eye the eye we found later my companions and me various other sailors our captain captain twitchwood do you know him (high-pitched) a 23 level skill okay then i'm sure you can understand the need for secrecy for a small circle i do i remember where we found the stone the storm yes i feel like you know the rest of this story and i am at a disadvantage (sighing) yeah yeah yeah-- now between you and i-- there was a storm-- do i remember darktow's over here right we're over here okay okay okay yep fuck it yes i do remember where the ship sank i agree i believe that will have to wait until we find ourselves on darktow though (laughter) i would agree (stuttering) yeah i'm going to go for it i'm going for it i will-- (noises of distress) oh god okay yep yep yep i will keep avantika's hand and walk around the desk and i will try the old lean-in and see what the reaction is yeah 16 an adrenaline-- do i make my way back to quarters before sun-up i don't know if i want to stay the entire evening there oh okay no i'm not going to stay you don't walk out of the captain's quarters at sun-up plus i'm super tired i will leave and try to stealth back to the quarters of everyone else hopefully you're super asleep come on copper dice gods 18 i'll let yasha roll for hers d8 for me right five
