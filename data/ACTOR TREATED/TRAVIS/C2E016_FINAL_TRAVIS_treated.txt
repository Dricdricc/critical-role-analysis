appreciate-- yup i pull down my lower lip you see very short nubby teeth with scratches and divots and chips on the top just on the-- yeah i did that would have been a better excuse when i was younger they used to make fun of my teeth kids can be cruel so i decided to take away the target that was most easily available for them yeah at the time there weren't any others like me i feel like i was especially picked on for my teeth not necessarily it became a habit i'm sure i don't have to it's like people who chew their nails i guess they are persistent not super fast no i think i bit my lip yeah right and then you bite it again the next day bod mod no i did not no i didn't have that sort of a streak in me then i was a bit tougher than most of the other kids i felt like i could take the physical poking but the jeering i-- you know it's not even really that intentional i'll find myself picking at them every once in a while like to grow back liam and yeah there are times i've seen them other half orcs with the teeth he did yeah i feel like it's a trait that exemplifies the rougher side of my race so sometimes i wish i had them and sometimes i'm glad i don't i think it's how i'd like to see myself you saying i should let them grow out all right fair how about you see me picking at them or chipping at them or any of that shit you just say the word and i'll stop laura and yeah eyes
