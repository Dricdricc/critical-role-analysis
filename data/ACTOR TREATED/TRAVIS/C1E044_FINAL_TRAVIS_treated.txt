of holding you want to mage hand onto my swordy and then we shish-kabob it into the bag yeah no i think a little treeline rest would be a good idea before we go anywhere else happy-one-year-anniversary extended edition the best part of that was that you were totally out of the blast range and you were like i want to go be there when they open up the sarcophagus (explosion)
