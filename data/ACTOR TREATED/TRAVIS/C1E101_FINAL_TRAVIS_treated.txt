why i said stay but that's all right i do have just a regular pickaxe okay pike i want you to warm up this spot for me and then you're going to jump on my back and then i'm going to hit it no no you

you're writing a book are you a colonel a general a private yeah rolling eyes that was a fucking awesome physical reaction yes i'm in the kitchen i want to see if they can make a salad with meat in it okay i'm not very up to-- this is far greater than anything i could have hoped for did you invent this just now chef this is going to put you on the map we need to name it what fine tender meats are in this dish please yes i'm talking to myself i'm just free-dripping saliva in and on the plate i mean did you even like salt it or nothing it's just all these beautiful animals in my own private ark of a bowl well because it's got goat fish beef and pork in it i'm going to call it the gofibepo but like you seem to have an accent so let's put a little flair on it when you say it the bowl of gofibepo i like it and i must decree there will be no utensils used when you dine of this sublime dish approval this just gets better and better submit whatever paperwork is necessary see that it's done (laughter) gofibepo even better and i'll just start hand-smashing into my face this delicious salted meat collection you should not be able to make up food that delicious just on the fly like that i literally felt like i was at a fucking restaurant that was absurd meat salad you're welcome yeah after every battle we'll get all the protein we need and we'll just fart our happy asses off all night long boring yeah great name are ziggurats always pyramids the thing we fought the beholder in so collapsing the tunnels didn't really do that much so all the bodies that were hanging under whitestone right they were all stapled to the walls was that the army was she trying to fill them with necromantic energy yeah the bodies weren't feeding the thing she was trying to imbue them with-- why were they throwing magical things into it though it was magical items into-- we don't know that any of this is right we should just go through we did let her regroup a little bit but we didn't know what we were doing do you want to mess with the stones try and duplicate them we have seven right tary's staying if we take damage going through the portal with the stone does that mean we might take damage if you plane shift us there yeah yes tally-ho which ones make the call i would eat there all the time the open palm 30 souls just sitting in a rock you think my shit's weird that one i'm game i also thought of something overnight all right it hurt because it's kind of brilliant can you hold your breath for-- (whispering) what's higher than ten 11 seconds why don't all you bitches just hop in the bag of holding i jump through take all the damage for us and then you just (popping sounds) pop right back out what could it possibly be have you ever been in one but it has to be able to hold its breath if we throw a dog in there-- yeah there's no air i don't think if you want to do cpr whatever we should find out are you going in i'll go in all right i just wanted to put it out there we can all take the stones and go through i bet it's not going to be that bad of a deal just wanted to put it out there if you wanted to live on the edge of life but no we'll just do it the boring way that is a face that says i'm giving you nothing (groans) garlic chicken i blew it that way though it's probably me let's go we've got a mansion let's go down to the ziggurat yeah if we put on the robes we've got to pull out an eyeball each too we're going down to the ziggurat that's a lot of dice i'm game i'll go nine really percy the rand mcnally guide yeah the structures to our left and our right are they solid do they have focus any of you with the eyes can you see what that is up in the air 18 (nervous laughter) what the fuck oh my god it was an otter i love otters can i pop my head
