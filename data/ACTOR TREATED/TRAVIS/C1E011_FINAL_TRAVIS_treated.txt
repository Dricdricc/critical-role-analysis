engorgio no fuck we should drag him over there just in case he wakes up kick him in it's 150 feet should we put a fancy robe over his nasty eye so he can't give you the-- we have eight fancy robes i take one of them and i put it over his nasty pirate eye they were in the closet nobody wanted them but now they're coming to use so suck it up while they're chaining him up and everything i'd like to walk up and put my great axe just under his chin just as a reminder classic line they all work on me there's nothing in there i keep drinking out of it there's nothing in it right i speak two languages no but not no no good yeah yeah you got it back of the throat a man of few words christ temple (laughs) jesus (laughter) i didn't even understand what-- (laughs) awesome will you inspect it (singsong) i have something that's magic penelope but what if he just controls the giant i also have an idea ice cream and peanut butter mixed on a cold stone i've been thinking about it for days i told you i don't like thinking right doesn't that sound amazing i'm just saying we could leave this fucker here go mix some peanut butter and ice cream everybody's happy liam we need you to stealth in and get some awesome recon but that means you'll be at risk i think pike's onto something we have four acid vials plus that remember the argument was also that it will be magically treated to withstand simple acid yeah here you can have it here how about a sapphire my fine blue sapphire that's been in here for a year and a half you can have it it's coming back to me don't reach for it i'll take the sapphire back i could just jump on it (high-pitched) yeah that's all right yeah i like that more yes one question if we break the thing at the top and the upside-down christmas tree falls into the elder brain pool thing are we going to kill all of the illithids in the city in one fell swoop i'm full of those but let's hear yours who wants to go up on top who would want to go down like phantom of the opera are you looking to me to bend it i was like can you metalbend this is awesome but you want me to get my sweet hands on it how do i get to it though i mean if we break-- no i can't it doesn't carry me i could be like that pilot at the end of independence day that's just flying up into the-- (laughter) randy quaid which i've always aspired to be i'm in i'll do it we're talking about a chance to gamble with his life let's let him do it let's do it nap we nap and rest grand merci without your shirt on yeah yeah like five minutes max matt and i offer him a sip from the cask of ale right just a sip don't do this to me don't do it i will fucking kill you i would like-- (grunts) 12 i run up his fat chest and i headbutt him in the face it's my cask of ale natural 20 you don't fuck with grog's cask of ale hey it might be like a fomorian thing he might like it you owe me a cask of ale i'm grieving now leave me be (tearfully) my cask of ale all right i've had that cask for two years man thank you tiberius thank you woobie it is henceforth it shall be called woobie yes the stealthiest of the stealthy go yeah a little recon and then we-- yeah is it just dexterity you can enhance or anything it flashes sentries puberty's a bitch tiny and i had a meeting of the minds we could provide a distraction i don't give a shit chaotic neutral baby yeah there's going to be collateral damage we don't want to go in yeah they did exile him so are we saying we want to go up to the top we want to try and weaken the cross with the yellow and the acid we want to drop titmouse the giant on the thing hopefully if it breaks if it doesn't break then what do we do let's do it quit tip-toeing into the ocean let's run into this he doesn't need doors right he can make portals and shit no we're trying to keep him from calling in a fucking dragon or something he can't dimension door in a dragon and be like just kidding but he can't-- i think hotboxing is now-- no i could give the four acid vials to whoever has the yellow liquid who wants that responsibility the yellow liquid so who wants to pour the acid on the cross i could do that but it's-- i'm at everybody's disposal we do yeah i give him a glass vial sorry one last question so his eye cancels out magic right so the more places we make him look the more of a chance we have to get it away from the magic users right laura and so instead of just two people why don't we do all three if there are two doors and the skylight why don't we have three teams so he has to pick which one he looks at i mean i can take one of the doors at the bottom and try and keep people from coming in okay what else were you going to say is anybody interested in going underneath the pyramid with me okay and just scatter to different areas so he has to look around we can't stay together no no yeah butthole only which it's bound to do yeah we're all in different places but if we're all around the room let's say we've got in there and it's fallen off and we're all around the thing you can't all whip us out of there we have to be in one area right no no no i was asking you can't teleport a room out we have to be together right but we have to be near you right we might not have that luxury should we have a run-away word a safety word like oklahoma or something yeah you are so one problem is-- we're still coming in-- i know i know we're all still coming in through one area though it's like the fatal funnel it's like a doorway if you all come in through the doorway you're all in one spot this guy has like 12 dick-finger eyes it's all bad it's all bad all right i'm all ears okay he'll read our minds he's already in our heads no i-- all right yeah anything that'll just split up where he looks that's all i wanna do okay good good no no you levitate me right that's true we don't want to sacrifice that yeah why not can we make two trips we have-- we have two carpets two carpets we're going to make two trips and come back for seconds okay yeah she means it yeah it's not like you'll be there to collect on the you know props if you die and we'll fly the carpet back right so we'll fly and then we'll fly the carpet back he's going to drop me off on the first trip take fly off of me he'll get on the carpet come back for the second group and fly trinket that's what i mean once i'm up on the temple you take it off of me and then you can put it on trinket because i'll be chilling on the top which you can't do how the fuck do we get him up there we are doing shifts right i mean i weight 645 pounds so a lot okay

wooden handle yeah it's not weakened enough yet is it we get him in place and then try it and if it makes a noise we just drop him shoot him up and have him come down we need him to fall like king kong from the empire state building what if we-- if we give ourselves away what do we lose a lot i don't think it's worth it well we'll give away-- so if like we try and weaken and the metal makes any noise anything right jig's up yeah at least it's going through like we won't have even gotten through-- and even if it doesn't it might be better than trying to crank it yeah why not wouldn't hurt are
