less attention the better norda i like it as soon as other crownsguard arrive with norda and the rest of whoever you bring to the scene maybe i can go with you and help return toya i think beau makes a very good point without toya's testimony we're in trouble unfortunately the authorities think that gustav and the circus are responsible for what happened actually it's just kylre he wasn't what you thought he was i'm afraid it's sam good it might do for you to apologize okay i'm going to hop off the boat and break eye contact with the captain of the boat so that i can disguise self into a
