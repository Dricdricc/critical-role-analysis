look at him flittering around you're shaking it oh my god how you ever snagged it with just a kitchen garbage bag is beyond me no we asked you just don't pay attention to email (laughter) clearly we're going to talk to el jefe (laughter) yeah it's not like he wouldn't know where we went if we left anyway a little more mid a little less treble we can head over it's like a step in the way out then we'll have to make it worth our while yeah we'll make a decision beau is in her element how have you been kutha yeah me too all right the first guy's name was louis from the research facility should we stop this (laughing) okay you just got this third level is like 5d10 with this flash of action i mask my voice and go i've got five gold on the horny one she's cracking it out i walk over to the other side of the crowd and go i got ten gold on the one with the bandages trying to whip up a betting frenzy on who talking super fast all coked up nah we're walking out of this city miles that's us always down for a scrap of course it didn't seem like our options above ground were all that plentiful we were more than anxious to hear what you might offer oh indeed i assume it doesn't mean overthrowing it more manipulating it to your individual gain yes a tantalizing offer you said you had others could you describe your friend vabron marisha liam and no grill busted eye okay would we have the same sort of timetable for this mission a month anything else well perhaps we'll partake of some beverages and discuss anime sparkles your one busted eye is wandering we'll learn him it's all right give us some time to discuss and we'll get back to you shortly is there an open booth or-- yeah the darkest corner well what do you think shadycreek run you have no preference any preference to water versus perhaps an abundance of dry ground plus if this is as aggressive as they say it is an attack on the border i'm sure that legionnaire's job will be there when we return anyway price might have increased better to bet on the underbelly rising up than the top maintaining what it has remind me what's in hupperdook hupperdook okay definitely stopping in hupperdook so we're going to take that shady underground river out turned on are you crushing on him how many of us are uncomfortable hearing that word yeah it's gone dark right so either remove whatever's in there and get it back up and running again that's a pretty good printer why yeah yeah yeah we've held up our part of the bargain yeah if he's there i just don't want to go out of our way looking for him and all of a sudden have the guilt of you know i mean don't get me wrong i like our efforts here in the city i think we've done good hard to keep track of parties outside of our purview yeah just over it huh plus it'll give us time to leave maybe things will change by the time we come back or maybe not we'll see never know what happens outside oh really you're more nomadic okay let's do it yeah we'll pound our drinks keep them away from beau because she'll drink all of them all right we'll leave molly and jester here to nurse their drinks and their short rests and we'll go back up and speak to the gentleman no yeah anybody that's not nursing a short rest is sorad the female goliath sorah is she present in the tavern at the moment nice i will approach indeed we have good news we have decided to take you up on your offer the lebenda swamp the lebenda swamp is what we've decided to take you up on oh i thought we were doing the beginner's course oh we're doing both apparently our ambition has no limit both it is (laughter) by water or also on foot do we still have the cart and the two horses we're unfortunately a little short on transportation we could use a few horses outstanding jester did have an excellent question we'll need certain remedies especially near the water anything that you can provide that might put us in an advantageous position would be most appreciated do you know what is also as valuable as resources is knowledge in this swamp area are there any particular hazards that we should keep an eye out for that your men have seen repetitively i wouldn't presume to be as lucky as to have louis have tried this mission before and fucked it up as well has he hey louis fuck you yep he's a winner swamp pun fucking shit this is very exciting two missions at once well it's still a really good time in the day we should go ahead and make preparations make our way back up as we pass that big ogre on the way out i say kutha keep it real all right that's a big hand fucking kutha can't catch a break i mean we can head over to the cart and horses more okay there's nothing there but you can finally kill him if you want to (laughter) as you run off i say meet us at the cart and horses i do who's riding on the cart first yeah we got like five horses and a cart two horses pulling the cart or two and three solos how many horses do we have okay two horses pulling the cart and four solos who else wants to be on the cart okay what that's right sorry i'll take a horse as well keep that demon cat away from me el gato es el diablo all right the feywild is it like another city one thing at a time what's it sound like only rats that they ate pure death fucking anaphylactic shock i guess i'll take the lead and we'll make our way out the city heading northeast right to the bronchial byway i think we'll go at a regular pace until we get to the bromkiln byway at the amber road we should be all right are there any tree clusters or rock clusters or boulders or anything that provides shelter i'm the wrong person to be doing this i'll aid you just off the road is fine at this point i'd like to see the road as well that way we can see anyone coming i have a torch as well

brothers and sisters or you and your children or parents oh but you're not super tight with them no favorite brother or sister or playmate or-- do you fight any urges when you see a small child walking through the city to go up and i don't know i don't mean any disrespect but to snatch it yeah no i'm being honest because if i know there's a little kid running around and if you're fucking tracing the damn thing i want to know that i can put a hand out just checking i haven't met many that do so pardon my you know-- in your belly all fjord sees is a little kid's hand like chewing on a

quarter way around the house so i can see yasha and molly and i'll say go ahead i'll keep an eye out i can see both i can hear it but i can't see it i'll start making my way over to their horses having heard them go inside i think who was that what was in there oh nice fair enough was it just the one guy in there what did he have just meat and-- nah shall we good call i'll look this time ten

between these two trees if i can towards this direction can i get within melee of this guy oh really five ten 15 20 no i'm going to come this way over here if i can great i will use eldritch blast against those two goblins hiding behind the tree i haven't pulled it yet i now have two bursts of eldritch blast that's a 12 for the first one natural 20 that's four plus four is eight plus four is 12

excited (counting) eight so 18 points with booming blade is that just one of my two attacks per action lesson learned and i'll use the rest of my action to get up on the back yeah i'm sorry the rest
