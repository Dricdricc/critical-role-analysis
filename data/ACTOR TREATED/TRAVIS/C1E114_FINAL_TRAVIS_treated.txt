tactical things i watched that's right it was the death knight how did we fix that last time i like how he's surrounded by swirls of aquafresh and mourn that breaks concentration right what don't look at that what was it he has used two legendary actions and a resistance right don't be afraid of rolling ones man 11 did it move reroll it was lower since we're being honest what size would you say vecna is oh i can't grapple him (laughter) it's a cantrip my despair is growing by the second with those words that you just uttered that's a weird feeling he has cardiac arrest and dies now we're at

seven so i heal nine points and then with my second action my second hasted action i'm going to use my second wind to heal 1d10 plus my fighter level ten plus three is 13 so i heal 13 more points and that will end and i will sit (sipping) the rest of the ale and wait for something keeping my mind on a small leather pouch in my bag (laughter) what the fuck happened interdimensional chess with the

he's so high up it doesn't matter right now yeah he has one more legendary action one more legendary resistance the fireball the meteor 66 if you saved speak for yourself grit farm do it ale solves everything how high up is vecna above the deck would you say i've seen buffets that are uglier than this what does that mean disadvantage did you really you got it you got it count your death i've

media accounts we have to roll higher than a 22 what do we hit the trammels in with our strength that was attack of opportunity so we're ten feet below him oh fuck yeah that's right i'll use my bonus action to pull the sword back so it's in my other hand i mean i could roll for it-- no i'd probably hold my attack if i hold my action i can hold one thing so i'll hold until i'm within melee yeah just get me to him don't drop me just get me there we've got to pull out all the stops it's all or nothing yes were zahra and kash petrified or-- is that a concentration but we're like 400 feet up
