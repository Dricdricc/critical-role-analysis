fjord's going to take a steed and start heading south by himself while he heads south i'd like to adopt various disguises as i stop in inns taverns places of trade and carefully hear if anyone is

with that yeah it's where i'm from indeed father dwondaff pierce i bring many gifts indeed i wouldn't dare after all you do have a little way of keeping track of where we are and what we do i appreciate your help in this matter hopefully we can be of some service to you down there please do you can be assured that i will thank you for your time i'll leave you now (stuttering) hm tell me about these dreams oh god oh that's good 18 (whispering) god why was i gone for six weeks okay (normal volume) yes unfortunately your dreams may have some merit i myself was missing for most of our journey and it seems unfortunately that lucien befell a terrible fate i'm sorry to be the one to let you know if i was there i could give you more detail but i found out much in the same way you are you said he left before and then came back if you don't mind my asking the last time that he left do you remember the circumstances of his departure and then you saw him here for the first time in quite a while yes two years two years are you-- and forgive me if this is too personal-- are you expecting to see him again indeed maybe it was you have my apologies and my condolences i hate to leave you with such sour news but i must be going fuck then i'll head back to the leaky tap it's a gift your anarchist's cookbook a negative three to your deception you can reappear ten feet away it's either ten or five but you have to roll for it but you've got to roll 11 or higher for you to even blink out in the first place you got it 11 or higher no problem are there you can kill him get the fuck out oh here we go (poof poof) don't mind that do you still look like the lord of the-- two steps that is easily the most fucked two characters have ever been to a full reversal that is the deepest fuckage we've ever dipped a toe in keyleth getting arrested i don't give a shit you guys were fucked (laughing) secret cabal because there are so many of them yeah feed the baby give it life an uneventful two weeks for everyone i assume oh that's good new books right beau you look like you got a couple new little marks and stuff yeah i never even met a ghost how would you punch it okay nott how was your-- yeah nice caduceus how was your time have you met more than one ghost before you don't have to tell me any more it's fine i'll just imagine the worst possible-- i have a request upon further inspection of this here letter quen'pillar is the month that we're in which we all know right it is how time flies while i have no idea who marius lepual or evantica or any of this is this was supposed to be delivered by the end of this month to the wayfarer's cove it's back in-- help me the menagerie coast where jester and i are from i have nicodranas is where jester's from i'm from port damali i don't i don't i don't i was thinking about it i journeyed a little further south i'm actually looking for someone and i had been meaning to head back that way anyway if this is taking us in that direction if it'll teach us anything more about the you know (grunting) yes it was either way i don't feel very comfortable with it residing in my person nope i just feel like me it was the vision that came with it that fucked me up a little bit no but i just kept replaying it over and over it was dark for so long and there was nothing really to distract you i just kept seeing his face and him holding the orb and pushing it into his or my chest and the body on the ground yeah does he say stuff like that a lot sure yeah it's warmer and there's certainly less snow who are you drinking i previously wanted to go north to the soltryce academy but i feel like that's another step in the direction that's not pressing for right now yeah there's no telling that they're going to share any information with me anyway i'm fucking absorbing things and shit just appears and i'm getting stronger by the day and it has nothing to do with the things that i'm learning there's no books or knowledge it's just happening what if they look at me like you guys look at me sometimes what if they don't let me go maybe that's not where i need to be like weird shit is happening it's hard when you're the only one experiencing it it's hard to relay i'm certainly open to that what do you want to know no i don't believe so i did tell molly before we were taken about a crewmate of mine named sabian he was the one that ambushed the ship that caused the explosion that threw me overboard the one that probably sent vandren to his fate after i woke up on the shore afterwards i found the sword and i wasn't quite sure where i was i found a road and managed to hitch a ride back towards port damali and when i got there i went to vandren's storehouse and i planned to go through his things i was more high up on the crew than sabian was but his place had been ransacked gone through torn through there was a local butcher next door that i walked into and he had said that he was glad to see at least one other of us that no one else had returned i said who was the other one he had said sabian so i feel like he somehow survived he knows what happened why it happened i can't bear the thought of something happening to me because i'm pursuing this and i summon the sword i don't want to be focused on this i want to be focused on that plus i feel like if those events led to this maybe there's a remedy for the whole thing or just kill him that'd be fine but yeah maybe some answers first he and i have a long history but after he-- so we were in the storm he ran belowdecks and he placed a bundle next to a lot of the crates that we were shipping that was unusual for him so i followed him down and i saw him with a lantern in his hand and when he turned he had lit what looked like a fuse i called out he threw a few daggers at me they hit i went down he ran past me just as i made my way back above decks i called his name and i saw him at the bow of the ship and it looked like he was preparing to jump overboard which in a storm like that is insane that's when the explosion hit it ripped into my back it threw me over and i remember going underwater and seeing parts of the ship fall and flames above the water i could see things falling and some of it was cargo and some of it looked like me i just feel like he was prepared to get the hell out of dodge no my teacher and my captain vandren is the one i saw in this vision and he had the same sphere i saw myself through his eyes and he was holding the sphere and pushing it into his chest he was also standing over a man i saw his reflection he seemed younger so i don't know when it was but i didn't know that side of him he was an exacting man firm but fair and it just leaves more questions than i have answers to i honestly don't know i've thought about what it was like before i had this-- i'll make the sword disappear life was simple but i don't feel like i had the ability to affect my surroundings i was not a proponent of change it's selfish but i feel like i can do things now i don't know if i would get rid of it but i want to know what happened to him i owe him that much yeah i was thinking that if you wouldn't be opposed we could go back to the menagerie coast stop by your mom's place in nicodranas yeah i was telling them i feel like instruction isn't exactly what i need it's not going to get me anything yet i just feel like i need to take steps in the right direction does that make sense feels like i'm stalling yeah the letter does say the wayfarer's cove and it says it's supposed to be delivered by the end of this month so i feel like there's some urgency if we're going to capitalize on intercepting this oh i hadn't realized what if you show up with inherent abilities no certainly not yet if it will help me find that fuck then i'd prefer to hold onto them i don't know how i'd give it back poop it out then i ate the poop stone yep didn't wash it off or nothing it was underwater though so-- canon (laughter) (laughing) i poop out my pee-hole yep i would hate to go without all of you just to be clear we can meet your mom but you can't you're just not supposed to be seen coming back got it oh speaking of-- before you came down-- no destination that's a big-ass road you can see that and mountains shit got that paper what level are they boosh hey invisi-cart
