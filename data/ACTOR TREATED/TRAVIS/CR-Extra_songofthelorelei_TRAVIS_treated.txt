here or just the hand brought in later no 11 it looks like he was killed perhaps sitting here at his desk is it not fairly common to the eye yes but if he was here at his desk it begs the question why was he not on his feet and fighting or someone he knew possibly do we know of any enemies immediate enemies close to the family that father might have had quarrels with sitting in his chair is not the way father would have gone wouldn't you agree lucius agreed someone will pay for this damn it's more than father was able to what did the letter say the crypts do we know what the fastest way to the crypts would be let them bury her yes portia benicio and i shall check the rest of the floor and then meet you in the courtyard by the weapons (gasps) may i ask the firmness of the mattresses in each
