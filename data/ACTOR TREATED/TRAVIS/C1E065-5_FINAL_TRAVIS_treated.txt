obby and i work together a lot so we're familiar with each other wouldn't you say anywhere delweth i've been learning a little bit more about dren not quite so sure what it is that you do good how do you like to assassin people with your hands nice a little range action delweth would you mind sharing with devan what exactly you do to people like her in case she thinks about running off or leaving-- no it's a hypothetical deal you'll enjoy this you know what dealer's choice this is violence not the other stuff that was lovely thank you for that yeah that's really nice yes oh did i not mention that in the clasp yes if you betray one of your own we will turn you inside out and wear you as a hat but dren knows that you knew that already didn't you does anyone have a preference marching order into the pipe really i mean i do you want to tell them i'm going to die i wasn't ready for this brick in the wall yes dear i do hmm you think it's trapped maybe we should have dren touch it you will did you want to give it a touch oh how does it work upstairs good job devan proving useful was that our only torch hat remember she'll wear you as a hat could i check the partially open door i would like to check it for danger oh perception seven they sure do well keep it up we'll follow you obby we found a secret door we should leave him up there no you can come down from the number one and number two place devan those dancing lights are awfully cute do you mind if i ask you how you came to be in the service of the clasp no why you're indebted to the clasp dren boy golly gosh that sounds so nice do me a favor gamble on your own time don't gamble with our lives we work as a team here so those dancing lights down here are fine but you check with dren or her or him before you do that again we clear good give obby a hug for checking out that dangerous pipe for you i would like to stealth into the doorway and moving forward be on the alert for traps i don't normally stealth so that's a weird sentence for me i'm trying not to speak as grog 18 i'll be first through the door i suppose you're right obby maybe you should be the one to let her know that she can yeah 16 nothing yet my dear a haiku obby sure dren we'd love to hear one don't move i stepped on something that clicked what do i see real quick everybody check the walls ceilings floors see what this might unleash 18 the duration of the hallway maybe not dren i like your enthusiasm though yeah devan you have some tricks about you right any favorite spells that you like to use the holes one could say you can certainly try i appreciate your concern objections i like your idea devan how about you use your ray of frost on the holes so that if anything decides to drop out of them it meets a little stopper sure devan i would like to do that shall we as it appears we'd like to do the old indiana jones like foot off-- obby son of a bitch like trickles of acid or like a shower of acid yep you 13 13 seven oh jesus i miss grog right now oh you know i need a word with my good friend obby just a quick chat would you mind waiting here for one second will you keep your finger on the button can i make my way up to obby hopscotching over the puddles of acid that i can see obby hey obby you did panic why that is a good question since you're so eager to make your way through the hall would you mind leading the way for us at a good 20-foot distance from the rest of us as he goes off i will also check the grounds around him 14 you know obby before they get here it was opened earlier by devan cutting her hand really really deeply i meant to tell you she cut it a couple times nicely done very useful does this look familiar to you at all are we looking for the basement in the basement can i insight check devan 12 she's nervous because obby is so attractive the clasp we like to do things quietly if we hear any rumblings of trouble hide fair enough good what's your relationship with her by the way good terms bad terms really dren dren you have pockets if we find a room of gold you can fill your pockets no worries your perception's zero there is no one more jinxy than laura no one more superstitious she runs up her dice more than a professional athlete it's crazy are there any records or binders ledgers things like that not sure yet do i recognize any code or a cipher in the writing nine okay dren stay with her wolfman slider sundown we will go to the door and we will see if it's locked no obby just grabs it is it lit by light or torch just leads to a stairway wood brick do we hear anything up the stairs dren you're up be as tiny as you can be and sneak up those stairs and see what you can see there's a fox bat flying all right i motion for everyone to go up the stairs wait a minute did we check for hidden doors or passages sam and yeah there's three of them let's take the one on the left and we'll push it the one on the right there was nothing on the desk no switches no-- i thought you've never been in this room all right as we go back up towards the stairs can we check the walls for any secrets up the stairway 22 great dren will you check that door at the top of the stairs for traps (meowing) you recognize this room excellent delweth dren go with her and explore wait who can check for magic yeah that was bad it's not on alarm here we go we got a

you what's that currency like more than platinum glad you're all right do us a favor remember that thing we said about gambling with our lives oh i wouldn't tempt her-- dren i promise we will fill our pockets on the way out because this will certainly be the way that we leave fair enough we don't want to have a little jingle-jangle-- other than the-- shit sorry other than the chests in the room are there any bookcases or other paperwork like there was in the other room would you like to check no how about we each get one of those nice pretty stones and then we don't reach in any more booty until we leave how about that sure let's search the chests check them for traps before you open them 22 obby do me a favor will you cut some holes in all of her pockets please i did i move to the door we're checking it for traps and seeing if it's locked so if you have been to the basement then you're obviously familiar with this room this is the basement wait a minute those bookshelves-- delweth will you pull those away from the wall the floor is stone wood does this door lead upstairs the wine cellar 23 yes dren you didn't see any up there right you read my mind we're certainly not going to find anything in here what is the floor made of in the room that she looked at yeah i'll go to the doorway yeah yeah can i see any animal hair or any saliva dried on the floor any claw marks 14 what about the ceiling can i see the ceiling at all how high is it no light fixtures no chandeliers i step into the room are there any windows or doors in this room obby will you come up here how do you feel

delweth with the wet bar do you want to go knock on it it's hollow devan to the desk please search it no keys no books no binders books or binders an almanac i'll take the almanac can i check the underside of the desk and the chair for hidden switches 16 pick up the book common and orc the globe is a planet globe or is it an orb if i open up the almanac and flip through the pages really fast are there any markings or things that are circled or anything that might be a cypher or codex for the letters no want to give it a whack it doesn't seem like it may have a support function all right lead the way devan please yes 19 be my guest obby check the painting did you kill him i trust your judgment do you have a haiku for this dren in which room this might be a strange question why is it called the funroom her magic stuff i wouldn't mind that do we want to check out the rooms on the right and the left super fast i'll move to the door where the guard keeps walking outside and crouch underneath one of the windows if he comes in he's dead and i'll let delweth go with devan and dren goes with obby one can check out the library and one can check out the tea room armed she'll die does it look like she's standing sentry and doing a guardsman be quick about it search come back and let's move on anything and you two i quickly check the window to make sure she still has her back to us we make our way to the stairs that lead to the second floor the one on the right yeah we would like to stealth 17 i got the whiff of some number twos no interest in your room shouldn't we visit it for nostalgia let's take a look let's see your room i reach up and take the cloth that's hanging over a large portion of the furniture and i pull it off we take the last tarp and pull it off i take a dagger out and shove it in the cushions of the love seat and drag it across open it up those dogs get all over the place and ruin shit all the time all right fine we'll leave this room now it's just a hallway and the funroom door yeah up to her place but on this floor is the funroom you know what i don't know if you can control yourself in the funroom so i'm going to take the rope that i have and i'm going to bind your hands behind your back before we go into the funroom oh dren you said you wanted to tie her hands behind her back for me that looks a little loose tighten it up for me in this hallway and outside of the doors are there any of those sigils okay does the doorknob look different than a normal doorknob the levers no i got it i'll open the door and i push it open we don't know
