it could also be like a fro-yo factory i mean that's not-- there's a lot of work going into this you can tell i mean there are xeroxed copies oh man that's a good one winner that's a blue-ribbon echelon we got to rest up right i think caleb has a little booby trap for that don't you add some distance yeah laura and i only saw like five no but i got pretty fucking sharp eyes all right they call me eagle-eye fjord where i come from (cawing) crow fjord or maybe raven you don't know it is i don't know if we leave the tree yeah and we know where the entrance is also very popular that's right kiri bird-eye fjord it's sticking no we make our way up the rope into the bottom of the tree but the entrance is still open i'll take first watch if you want i can post up outside and do a little illusion work oh my god i can't believe you said it go fuck yourself yeah about what time is it anyway light still coming in from the outside of the tree all right yep shoot you're not good at apologizing yeah i'm fucking with you you reckon you need to apologize you know a great place to start with apologies is to mention the stuff you just said no after that right one dos yeah that's a really good apology yeah however right be genuine don't be embarrassed to apologize it takes a big person to apologize for something little people are the ones that make mistakes and just let them go no like small on the inside that's big of you yeah i think he deserves that he's been good to us all right i think it will you can actually leave the smile out of it this time just to be clear no that's going to set the tone in a real weird way there's a thing called sarcasm that you ride a line with sometimes no beau and i are up first yep five with an arrow in our throat i didn’t see-- (choking) what what hit the wall against the hole right we'll take either side of it either flank no because we still want to go down there molly i want you to get right on the edge of the hole and keep an eye down the shaft let it come all the way up if it does grapple it fall flat kill it quietly it came up the tunnel that was already there i did eldritch blast and a 20 and a 24 ten and a nine 19 points of eldritch blast monstrous or-- i will yeah same yeah you and yasha go nein but he's got to stay awake for it oh my god (quietly) yes so boyish nice work yasha indeed take the rope we start lowering it down there yep i think right before we go under the water we should oh yeah this is an amphibious assault like five amphibious yeah there's a sea “anenome” under there as well why aren't you good in water you can hold your breath right listen when we get down there i'm going to swim a rope under the water to where we're going it's going to be like a guide line so whoever you ride with can pull on the rope and you’ll just hang on fuck you kiri no she can't we could leave her in here with you if you want but if you see trouble you're going to have to get in that water and come across yep yep one or the other all right i'll take the other 50-foot section of rope and i'll start wading into the water and i'll take a swim back the way i went (high-pitched sound) it's like aqua velva what do you mean don't worry about me i'm just swimming over there and coming back and then we can cast it it's a guideline 12 apocalypse now 60 feet where is that class features-- racial traits darkvision 60 feet do they have an eyeline on me if they were to look over this way could they see my head above the water can i wade forward and look for any stones or pillars that i might be able to throw the rope around and tie a knot on that's a two yep that's amazing i'm in the water man okay great i'll give it a gentle tug does it seem like the structure moves at all i'll take a deep breath and i'll use it to pull myself chest up towards the surface yeah still five of them i tied it off everybody should be able to pull their way across no problem but we got to be ready to rock when we get in there they're a little distracted yeah or distract away from us and then go or if we want we could cause a commotion and have them come through the water at us and use the hole as a funnel thoughts i'm a very fast swimmer i think it's 60 feet actually is my swimming speed with this damn mariner’s armor ignore what i said regular speed yeah (laughter) well then yeah it’s 30 feet well with it it’s my normal walking speed nah could i guesstimate how far it was from entrance to portal where the rope is 13 i'm back so you want to head over there okay i see the validity in that argument pass without a trace first okay i don't know about 45 50 seconds how many books you got there shall we pass without a trace shit balls ass let's do it kiri's got to die thousands of artists are like (gasping) yeah i'll go first distract and attack if they don't see us as i go in the water i'm going to go about halfway and then stop and tread and make sure that everybody gets along the rope fine thank god for that pass without a trace 19 oh shit we got smoke that's the one that was distracted they rolled really high yo what's up 20 to 15 oh fuck oh shit what oh my god you guys jester caleb molly i'm a big fat three we got the surprise round so it's fine this is the surprise round okay good it's acid man that thing does not make up its mind yep i'll make my way towards the

sequence in blade after getting so fucked up that last round-- the scratch the bite and the trident in the gut-- i'll put both hands on the falchion and say do not see me and i'll cast blink it is not that's my turn whoosh worcestershire sauce i forgot to do the 2d8 of booming damage on the gentleman behind molly so that's a big one and three so four points of booming damage oh was it ah they do-si-doed fair enough can i appear right next to this gentleman on his reverse there you go i will break my-- that sounds dandy great i will break my hex and i will use a hexblade's curse as my bonus action on that gentleman i will make two attacks with the wastehunter falchion against him with the monstrous-- flanking gets-- what does it add does it do anything okay so first attack 15 great and the second one neither of those are a crit but that's a 24 on the second one (counting) 17 for the hexblade four points of damage so 21 on the first one (counting) 17 on the second i'll shift in right

two eldritch blasts at the one that's engaged with molly and yasha which is 18 to hit hexblade's curse that is 12 points of damage is he still up then i'll send the second one in his direction as well that's 22 to hit seven points of damage i'll pop up and be like fuck the first time i do it son of a bitch and i'll go (magical buzzing and whooshing) and send both of them over there as molly looks over i'm like (blows) 13 it's important to remember that you don't-- (laughter) i got you i got it right here if you got that right that's some fucking beautiful mind shit you know what it's okay

right oh roll to see-- i disappear (bamfing noise) you guys are doing good-- (bamfing noise) come on yasha nein it's shallow priest discretion what will he do look as the dm muddles his choices considers consequences plans his retribution as his hair dangles beautifully in front of his face thinks-- (singing) i'm in another dimension so if you hit with your sentinel does that mean its speed is reduced to zero wouldn't want to be ya can i blink back in and go stop (panting) can i make my way over and up the steps good shit man good shit think of the baby stay calm seven points of healing roll low can i pick up his big trident that has the cord attached to it is it wrapped around his wrist or anything is that how he was pulling people is it attached to his person in some way i'll take the trident and unhook it from his armor these guys were big yeah y'all look for shit i'm going to meditate for a hot second where did you leave her are there any stairways or doors or gates or anything that would lead upwards from this cavern yeah i'll take a closer look 14 natural 19 for 21 you guys come up here there's a ton of arms up here there's battleaxes and swords but there's all these trinkets and holy symbols careful yeah i actually wouldn't mind if you check for magic and nott actually there's this four-foot long box if you want to try and open her up for me i think so it looks to be latched shut in some way the four-foot long one the iron one and the wooden one yeah sure we're kind of in the middle of a short rest anyways he's still doing his magic circle or whatever is this on the priest the shallow priest who are you talking to jester do you feel the traveler in here it's actually a little discomforting these symbols there's also some very dark deities here asmodeus asmodeus asmodeus bane the strife emperor tiamat-- laura and can you describe what the bane the strife emperor symbol looks like here it's just this little handheld thing can i toss it into the well did any of the shortswords longswords battleaxes-- any of those register under caleb's magic sweep or they're just nicely made oh put that shit in the pile i'm not going to interrupt but that sphere looks very-- yeah famili-- do you mind if i-- is it wet if it fits the gash in the side of the sphere while he's concentrating on it can i sit down next to him and touch it yeah how do i feel i feel funny what happened into me i felt like i'd seen it before i just wanted to touch it i don't know you ever see something you felt like you'd seen in a dream before but you don't know why or how i'm sorry i felt compelled to-- i felt like there was half a chance i'd touch it and it wouldn't be there i saw things people i knew a man he's very dear to me i don't understand it but he was-- i was him and he was holding the sphere the eye again you ever have that dream where you look in the water and you see another face looking back at you like you're someone else sam and 50/50 you said i put the sphere in my-- i saw him do-- i saw me as him doing the same thing he was standing over someone covered in blood and he put the sphere inside of him he was my mentor a captain of mine a man named vandrin yes i haven't seen him in quite some time i don't know what any of this means but i'm not a fan of losing track of time like that i bend over and put my hands on my knees and-- i don't feel anything i do feel pretty tired though i'm not exactly sure he may be dead he captained a ship that i worked on for many years and there was an incident i believe so there was an explosion and we were in terrible weather there were waves we were being thrown about and i was knocked overboard i never saw what happened to vandrin but when i woke up i was back on shore and i didn't see anything of the ship or him or any of the other crewmates i would like that i would like that very much he was very good to me when a lot of people in my life haven't been but he was holding the sphere-- how could he be holding it if i was (demonic voice) i'll tell you how i survived did i recognize the body that was lying in blood no no details i knew this man very well he was almost like a father to me and i never saw him holding anything like this not that i remember do i ever remember seeing anything like that in his quarters in his offices anything it's unique i'd remember i'm not leaving anything out i'm not entirely sure i remember getting thrown overboard the waves overtaking me it was a hell of a fight and i'm a real good swimmer but you’d come up for air one second and your mouth would be full of salt water the next i remember losing track of which way was up it's funny when you're underwater and it's dark the only way to tell which way is towards the surface is by blowing bubbles i did that as hard as i could with all the air that was in my lungs and those bubbles disappeared i remember it stinging filling my chest and the next thing i knew i was face-down on the shore yeah i've heard a lot of tales of men drowning being brought back they say that same thing but no one was with me on that shore i was alone just a merchant ship he had many there was a bit of sabotage on the ship i wish i knew if i'm lucky one of these days i'll find out the pool water but good and evil deities on the edge or around it right not in 16 for what laura and but you can't see it i don't have it laura and how big is the well oh shit that's not a bad call i'll check my reflection in the well (coughs once) try again (inhales) i'm tapping like a motherfucker (coughing) anybody want any of the weapons shortswords longswords battleaxes who's holding onto the broken-off hilt do you mind if i carry that no i'm not we have four sticks i just said we have two sticks okay all right climbing the rope back up top to the base of the tree why would they do that (whispers) genuine not too tight nice job (coughing) quit while you're ahead drunk-ass fucking nott dwelling on old shit he bleeds death and stuff we'd have to hit him from afar it might not be worth it
