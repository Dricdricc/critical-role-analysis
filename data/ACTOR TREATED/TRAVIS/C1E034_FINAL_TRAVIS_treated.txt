give it a poke we're obviously not equipped i'll grab lady briarwood and drag her out of the room towards the doors orcus bury it like the pharaohs of old we can't kill her in here she kept talking about a sacrifice we can't kill her i think she understood she had to give a life for it and then you can bury it once we're out of the way i drag her out of the room and toward the steps not yet not until we're out of here do you have to be there to do it well let's all get to the point where it's not going to collapse on us it's like three little acid vials we all leave so if you had rolled 76 points of necrotic damage
