since i'm the tour guide do you have any plume-y hats you know 'cause if you take like a campus tour they have a flag and they're like over here in case you get lost or like when tourists walk around and they're like don't get left-- mm do you have anything like that good it'll be good it'll be like karate kid with the toy when he starts spinning it oh bells in my face (laughter) i have a question for astra best name ever new favorite asterix look is there anything in whitestone that you would fancy like do you have any particular interests whether they be art or education or geometry or buildings right did you want to see just the castle or did you want the grand deluxe poobah tour which is around whitestone as well that's what i mean yeah that was a really good deal okay let me confer with my subordinate and we'll put together a tour package okay hey percy so asterix says that she wants history of whitestone and the castle so like i need a hotlist of things that we're gonna show her but can we make it sound like i thought of it okay good just keeping you on your toes mate i like him shit we don't even need the servants for that i just pop out the chalice little morning beer sunrise oh shit oh god years he is he's very grown yeah you fucked up gohan what happens when uncle ogden has too much you know (drinking sound) life begins anew in whitestone does ogden seem to grow younger as he finishes the beer okay never know never know oh you did oh great when do i get to see it that's lucky wow this is-- it jingles it jangles this is an official whitestone tour hat yeah now is there a long history of distinguished tour leaders before me yes percy you should tell them the short names for my titles you know what was it like silly bean and sweet chestnut yeah (laughter) please rise rise it's going to be a lovely day we have a lot ahead of us we do please is it like well-balanced i have to hold it i'd be worried about circulation up there but it's not really a concern ooh fuck you (laughter) i was cool until the strap came in i hate those fucking straps it is time for the tour of whitestone oh that's okay i like it when they're loud actually i relate yep all right percy time to learn about your castle and i take off in a walk where you don't bend your knees your legs just stay straight that's the walk i'm adopting for this whole tour i've decided no like you kick your heel forward like-- like a military no i'm doing it i'm walking oh this foyer of whitestone castle was defended by myself and these fellows against the onslaught of dragons giants and hordes of undead it has been in the de rolo family for millennia is that what the word is yep yep (laughter) natural beauty it abounds it all comes from the sun tree in the center of town (whispers) percy help asterisk is interested no no we don't we don't nope no enough with like the boring shit do we have like an armory that we can bring them where they make weapons okay we now venture along these roads cast through the ages of de rolo descendants as we make our way to the annals of firecracker alley (laughter) go on apparently this is the official tour hat of the house of whitestone and apparently i'm the first how it's not covered in dust or decay i have no idea does it fit well i feel like it's a bit small oh it's got a little swagger yeah i am pretty tiny these days i have not been lifting like a maid cafe i like the derby analogy that's what i was going for all i aim for in life (whispers) the guy that owned him wow (laughter) been out for a week show 'em the dice on the back that's the house voice when we go home it's all that yeah that's what we call the bailey switch got home and it was like fuck the old gnome diabetes yeah either that or it's like a pub crawl through whitestone one or the other it's all right it's all right it's all part of the tour no it's all right oh man it's okay this is firecracker alley all right these my people luck as you can see firecracker alley was constructed after the revolt of the haybales of 1874 39 so how do you feel your tour has gone so far are you feeling educated enthused hey percy i feel like we should end with like a big bang like you know like the goods of whitestone really we're not loading it ourselves i am a self-made man i would like to try that's gonna be negative something-- (laughter) not going to need it seven five plus two was that the sun tree i'm so sorry i could go stick it up and cover it with tape and stuff okay i take off running (laughter) i'm a hundred yards away shouldn't he have to roll to see if he shoots me from 300 yards away i yell (muffled) it is not the sun tree (laughter) yeah (panting) i heard shots what's the problem (whines groans) mine (laughter) do we want to
