yep you know if we're just going back-- pumat sol what was the name of his spot marisha and no it wasn't oh yeah how far away is the invulnerable vagrant is it late evening like pre-midnight or you know what never mind i'll do it another day are we still in our rooms or are we downstairs (boom) (exhale) damn it i believe they said there would be more i mean we don't really have anything until this evening remember there's that meeting that we have it's going to take place in the cellar you guys are going to join this time well you don't all have to come some can stay above i just wanted to put the invite out there you know i wanted to talk to you about your fjord disguise it is just a little obvious i would want to see what your range was in case you wanted to i don't know perhaps mimic one of our other companions maybe just one of them maybe you've got a patch over the other bald on top and red hair on the sides overalls with polka dots and a real big bow tie and shoes bigger than you should be wearing no not at all (laughter) just mull it over add it to your-- you're rolling your mind's rolodex sometimes having a pupil teaches you something about yourself just saying give it a shot thanks jester i appreciate that you're not going to do the cloudy-eye thing when you're down in the meeting though right you go all static channel on us we might be in deep shit that's not until this evening right yeah i do i enjoyed his company so much last time feel like we've got a little more coin to spend might be smart to stock up on items why oh thought your mom was going to pay for it oh good point that's very smart of you jester should we set out to our various tasks then i'm going to the invulnerable vagrant yeah you will love him oh that's three do i hear four four four (speeds into auction chant) (laughter) can i grab my mariner's studded leather armor out of my room and bring it with (mutters) vulnerable thought it was the invulnerable oh got it nice we go in good to see you again boy it is sure coming down outside wish there was a way to dry off real fast i am (quietly) fuck (clears throat) what does it smell like sour cream and onion chips we'll see what we can do that is much better thank you pumat that is wonderful i had a question for you we found this armor down in the sewers and it seems to have some-- right yeah have you seen this armor before yeah here's the thing i spent a lot of time by the water when i was growing up and when you live by the water too much water theme in your design is overkill you know it's like the person that has the beach house and everything is shells and water and lobsters-- yeah i feel like this has some unique properties to it is there a chance that i could i don't know in some way transfer or copy some of that onto what i'm currently wearing i have a little bit more intrinsic value with what i have they're not really attached i'm sorry i don't know if shells fall out so be careful i forgot to tell you there are multiple versions of pumat apparently the other ones are called me me nott hands in your pockets all right okay is there any chance you could tell me how much it might cost he's really very nice and accommodating i'm sorry a little-- 80 eight zero or one eight 18 right okay let me think on it a bit nott you had a request that's mighty good you get a fucking concussion you know pumat i think will take you up on that enchantment 80 gold it's a bit more than i was hoping to spend i could overhear you offering an incentive for being a return customer i did enjoy most recently unfortunately one of your healing potions perhaps if i purchased a healing potion and the transfer of the enchantments we could find some sort of a deal get it get it boy 12 it's not terrible i understand healing potions were how much again 70 gold 50 gold wow i got to work on my fucking memory great i will take a healing potion and the enchantment transfer please 30 okay thank you yeah i take the breastplate part of my leather armor off and leave it with you yeah that would be-- it's not that bad you don't have to act like it-- new leather that's amazing it gives you some bonus yeah we all do super squishy-ass crispy tacos i think you only have to kill the one this conversation did not happen in the game by the way got to attune to it yeah i mean we've got some good momentum right now right what could possibly happen it looks incredible it's found a place pumat before we go i wanted to ask you i know that you're an annex of the cerberus assembly how do you feel about the governing parties here in town are you happy with the way things are run right yeah i think it's great that you support the barracks do they come in for regular purchases every week or every month or find themselves in your store more often than not the members of the cerberus assembly that's wonderful well thank you thank you for your time oh really they're not as protective of certain knowledges as other parts of the government might be but they might be a bit more open-minded to people sharing in that knowledge if they were the right type of person say i'm glad to hear that nott molly you have everything you need did you want to bring the mirror with you i was joking give pumat prime our best fuck thank you for not making me stand out in the rain for an hour without top pieces thank you oh oh oh maybe you know it your hands are going to be all sticky before you handle the books yep detail four score-- my shirt's gone back up (laughter) (straining) a squared plus b squared equals c squared angels and demons breasts or breaths heaving breasts in a hole in the ground tumblr is so happy right now the gauge of his pipe yeah you were doing it is there a mailing list want to see my toys good luck adding that shit can i pull molly aside hey i wanted to ask you when you stopped nott from rifling through my shit last night what was she looking for she wasn't grabbing for anything in particular she going through your stuff too or just mine just can't help herself i guess fair enough i'm going to wander around the back side of the leaky tap i didn't actually i happened to ask pumat sols the plural and he happens to be like an annex shop of the cerberus assembly so he supplies goods to all parts of the kingdom but he says they keep a good balance in check from the power of the empire keeps a tight leash i didn't ask about any religious uprising or anything but he seems like such a nice guy and doesn't seem the type to rat nobody stopped you you got in all right oh good how'd that go well i was just thinking for this evening maybe we should double-check there aren't alternate exits coming in and out of that cellar yeah that dwarf didn't really give me a very good feeling right you want to walk around the back to see if there's another way in can we go around the back of the tavern and look for back doors floor latches i'll help you make it which ones did you roll with the plus locked off chained does this alley have a lot of human traffic or are we on our own i mean i have a crowbar yeah i have a crowbar can i try and pop the lock is it like a chain and a lock oh shit that's not as good yeah that's true that is what she does you want to go snag her i'll keep an eye i do a quick look both ends of the alleys and on the windows around the area mine's okay 16 shh i cover her mouth no windows no windows facing that way i have my orc-- go for it yeah might as well use that that's cocked i come down at the mention of a skeletal wrist are there any other bodies in this cellar well i'm going to leave because we're all three down here and go back up to the top and keep an eye no other ways in or out huh close the door up run the chain back through put the lock on it but don't lock it not really because if caleb's going to be down there with us-- i think if we start screaming or you hear a ruckus-- see down there i'm not so worried marisha and yeah somebody outside the leaky tap another person on the inside to run interference because you can buy us a couple seconds yeah couple layers right nah i'm so happy i remember my 12 and 13-year-old excursions into the back of the comic book store with the 18 and up section oh man how old are you kid pretty old yeah a risky 14 areski we don't even know who he is yet right i am too yeah and i was thinking so the three of us are down in the meeting the three of us nott if you could be outside letting us know if any crownsguard or other surly types look like they're coming in to raid the place you send a message and then you two run interference if they actually make it inside the doors in case we haven't made it out yet yeah whatever you do buy us some time i believe you these knights of requital (laughing) damn it son of a bitch what you reading there jester of course you are in size 38 font in your fucking notebook does it no leave it alone stop sick did we recognize the other human male that he's with does he seem to be armed or shady or have lots of scars on his person 13 how were his shoes that's right yeah dolan's last name sure any reason why taverski sure is this guy from where you're from or something old mate of yours taverski would he know you if i was like hey friend of ours named nott-- i'll find out his last name i'm sure he won't mind that's right crownsguard rough-looking types people that are armed right you keep a fucking swivel it's your best disguise yet nott oh i'm sorry i forgot it was you for a minute oh tton tton yeah t-ton you ready let's see what they want to do it's these three jackasses yeah i'll take a seat we haven't said too much but we thought that he might be somebody you'd be interested in very clever has no love for the empire thought we could let you decide for yourself caleb this is dolan dolan this is caleb dolan do you have a last name well i have one question this lord sutan what's to keep the high-richter and the lawmaster from just going and snatching him up and putting him in chains yeah well we're going to forge this letter from lord sutan right saying that there's an assassination attempt against the richter we go to the richter's place we tossle it then we deliver a letter from sutan saying there was an attempt of the richter's life so if i was the richter and i went to the lawmaster i'd just go disappear lord sutan your richter will stay in his seat and you'll be short one lord if i'm not mistaken horris if you don't mind me asking what was your practice as well i'm not shy of a conscience i'm afraid i'd need to know a little bit more about this high-richter prucine hopefully he's a terrible individual i remember you saying that i mean i hate to say anything else without seeing something for ourselves you seem to have a good plan for getting rid of sutan but it seems you might need some further measures to get rid of this richter as well do you feel like the empire or the lawmaster is onto your group your knights of requital do they know your name i have a proposal for you are you one hundred percent sure that they haven't heard of your name knights of requital how attached are you to that name if you ever want someone to stop looking for something-- they'll stop as soon as they know that thing is gone or dead so how about we frame high-richter prucine as the head of this knights of requital and let the law handle it the way they will and we'll take care of lord sutan at the same time i hate to do away with a great name but you work with what you have you could workshop it do you have any secret symbols or stamps or seals that you use for communication that we could plant in the house or the place of dwelling of the high-richter a ring a piece of jewelry if we frame this the right way it sure would do a lot for your ambitions to become that high-richter dolan if you were the ones to turn in the evidence i think it would be yeah this will work is her name kara kara i like the enthusiasm you had about your plan what sort of skills could you bring to this equation are you stealthy sneaky that can be done we have other associates upstairs we didn't want to encroach too much on your space we'd like time to confer with them over the night perhaps meet again midday tomorrow we should find a new spot though repetition is a recipe for disaster we're actually quite new maybe you could provide one consult your paperwork song and supper inn how far from here how much time to travel not far fair enough shall we call it just after noon tomorrow the inquiry it's got a nice ring to it thank you for trusting us i believe we can make quite the impact with these movements you gotta pull up pull up you see fjord shift his weight would you like to exit first or should we much obliged i head out wow louder than i thought it would be thank you nott yeah thank you for keeping an eye out would you like to join us inside nott would you like to-- hello thanks for keeping an eye out caleb impressions well my takeaway is that they want to unseat some of the corrupted seats of power here in the city if that's true if there is an abuse of power i'm all for removing those corrupted seats and putting people of worth in their place i'm also not keen on taking the word of someone else without getting some evidence of our own we don't while we're following them perhaps we should try and find out what we can about this-- lean in closer closer this high-richter prucine i don't know i couldn't see it yeah it should be every time it's a rule you can drop that uh-- you know what we also need i want some eyes on this high-richter we should find out where she lives and how she treats people see if the stories are true sure we might need to find out where she lives tonight though i should have asked but i forgot no the high-richter is just an official not if you have official business with the richter it's very urgent business exactly what i was going to suggest well we don't need to caleb-- to answer caleb's question we kind of forgot to discuss that part we're new at this we will address that tomorrow for sure before we proceed any further you're right there should be compensation no i think we should all go they should get a look at us as a whole see who they're dealing with just in case there's any shady shit what would you like to look like it's at your discretion anybody feel like finding out where this high-richter lives this evening let's do it how do we do that (laughing) that's a great idea jester charm him ask what about that big white dragonborn maybe he knows yeah perhaps we should rest tonight and plan this little needy-folk charade in the morning we can always take the sewers into the tri-spires caleb you've mentioned you tried to get into the tri-spires and you had a disguise on and it didn't-- do you think it was just in that passage way or do you think it's the entire tri-spire area the entire tri-spire that'll be it we use the sewers to get in disguise ourselves avoid detection find out what we need to know shall we retire for the night marisha and i'll head up to my room first and i'll pull molly up with me because i need to have a word with him molly listen i can't get over the fact that nott was going through my stuff i want to set a little bit of a trap yeah i just want to see if she's learned her lesson or not i'm going to put an object in the middle of the room with our door open and we're going to hide out of sight you game great i'll use minor illusion to put in the middle of the room a bundle of buttons with a tall shiny flask covered in jewels right in the middle of the room i mean i guess so once she's in we're going to shut the door i want to figure out what the fuck she's sneaking around for okay 16 you've been reading too much smut (laughter) it's just an open door with a bunch of buttons and a flask in it as soon as she comes in the door the door slams shut molly get the window nott-- no we are going to have a talk don't try any funny business why are you trying to sneak through our stuff molly told me molly told me you were in here rifling through my stuff what were you looking for do i believe her natural 20 that's why i brought you in here my letter but nott why well why what would caleb do with it you wouldn't want me to have that sort of ability you'd rather caleb have it you do why nott why do you need him to be powerful nott what do you need to be saved from absolutely (clears throat) nott i hope you will learn to trust us and rely on us like you do caleb we may not be as powerful as he is or has the ability to become but certainly we can help you are you worried about something or someone in particular finding you i understand i'm sorry if we've upset you not for some reason i'm just cool in general nott i'm just cool in general nott this shit is amazing just for now though promise me that you will not go through my things anymore when i'm not around and that the items that i have belong to me change you (clears throat) i understand i know what it feels like to be ashamed or worried about what you look like i do you think so well i didn't always look like this i wasn't always a handsome half-monster thing a kid just like anyone else yeah yeah stumpy short big teeth little bit just sort of mis-proportioned listen if we get to the-- if my myspace is still up you could see them goes back a tick nope no i did my own dental work listen if we get to the soltryce academy and that letter doesn't do me any good i promise you could have it and we'll make sure caleb has a shot most definitely you look out for us we'll look out for you you cannot have my stuff okay easy easy open up the door i open the door and i slowly open it up like trying to funnel a rat out of the room here you go remember what we talked about i stick my foot out right when she runs by you should be fine man that was more than i thought what do you make of all that are you praying over your swords tonight all right can i join you great yeah the hard turn killed it in one night damn yep downstairs oh that's the worst would you call it a blue balls feeling morning nott so we set out our plan sewers make ourselves look like poor folk make our way into the tri-spire upper middle medium well do we know if the high-richters normally rule on or govern over or stolen by the baumbauchs i mean if we do something that a family within the tri-spire needed representation the law upheld but the richter turned an eye because a more powerful family was winning out then that person is shit from the brewery that we took in session zero i don't know if he would hold sway but if he doesn't pursue justice for someone of the tri-spire that should tell us enough the baumbauchs are very influential and powerful what do you think molly doesn't timalt make hardware if the high-richter doesn't say you're right this is injustice let's take it to the lawmaster then that richter sucks puppy crime so they stole from our invoice and they took all our saint bernard puppies okay what time exactly of the day oh god yeah we have to well let's pick up your cloak and make our way why didn't we try to forge a writ damn it i could have one of them beat the shit out of the other one let's do that i cast crown of madness on one of the guards hopefully from an area where they don't see me casting it oh no 14 oh i have advantage nah yes it is 14 kick his ass sea bass nott quick let the lock on the sewer thing let's go i thought it was locked 14 everybody in 14 yeah i might've fucked that thing up he might get demoted a couple day's pay no come on ten did not think about what to do once we got into this part of the plan right yeah yeah i cast disguise self very long black cloak with gold trim like a nice trim goatee and slicked back jet black hair piercing blue eyes nice looking human cloak gold trim great analogy fated to do well hello sir excuse me i'm sorry to bother you we have business with the high-richter is there a chance that you could point us in his direction-- her direction i really don't care we're just delivering a parcel wonderful thank you for your time nott your mustache is much nicer do you know what a mime is you just mime this mission ask for an audience yeah maybe if we say that we were sent by the lawmaster for the high-richter to make a ruling good instinct what do you think jester i'd like you to come nice molly what do you want to do indeed what would your name be in this situation i'm just trying to think ahead lovely lawrence are you staying out here with nott caleb or are you going to come in if we make it in that's right wish us luck i walk up to one of the two crownsguard outside the door yes please look lively unfortunately we've been sent here from the lawmaster we have some very urgent business with high-richter prucine please if you wouldn't mind would you fetch her natural 20 oh high-richter it's so lovely to see you again i know it's been quite a while brantley we met-- must have been years ago now you remember the gala yeah 14 plus four 18 i understand a bit of terrible business actually our family has been unfortunately at the poor end of some corporate espionage and i'm afraid the baumbauchs isn't that who they are in trostenwald just a wretched fellow they've made off with quite a bit of our product and we have some evidence against them we tried to take it to the lawmaster of course we didn't want to trouble you but-- absolutely i'm sure justice will be swift but unfortunately much of our family's finances are wrapped up in this at least you have the diamond right i'm sure you can understand our situation we have already done that exact thing we wouldn't waste your time with such rudimentary worries but– well frankly the lawmaster in trostenwald seemed to show you very little respect when we mentioned your name and being that our family is so influential around here we're going to be tossed to the wayside if justice isn't found surely you understand that was that what you said it was merely a few pennies for your time yes i mean certainly if you feel like doing justice on its own– i would like to see people taken care of that take care of us well of course yes i believe we are thank you for your time we're most gracious but since we're inside of that seven-foot wall windows doors security measures how many floors shuttered wooden shuttered closed i mean they're kicking cats in this bitch so it's not that far off you embarrass me please make sure she's beaten as you lead her away i apologize for his fuddy-duddyness thank you for your time good day yeah that was good well we walk a fair distance away from the crownsguard and we see caleb and little pallbearer like a small morticia addams well i mean she said that dogs should be fed to the larger ones right but imagine if she had gotten her eyes on you i mean don't know what she would have done but that means she's got to die is it just the tri-spire or is it everywhere certainly your fears are founded if there's not enough pay then obviously it's not worth the risk but i have to say that even after meeting them for the second time i feel like these people they're good folks i think they just want to see their city bettered honestly that dolan fellow i think would do better in a seat of power than this current wench i think that's fair and there's still many things to figure out we have to look after this lord sutan but first we should see to that afternoon meeting about the coin we should address that straight out yeah i guess we do we're meeting them at the song & supper inn just after noon i was not specific yeah don't make me say it i'm trying not to it took us 45 minutes to walk here the rest of you are welcome molly keep an eye on the room (whispers) we've got to look for that motherfucker more often sure we did some casing of the high-richter ourselves she's not the most savory type i believe some of my associates have a question of well the unsavory topic of payment that's about the same as the king's hall yeah would anyone of your group like to be joining us kara or ulog yourself i tend to believe him just because we haven't seen him did you happen to draft up any of those knights of requital documents i asked for symbols that's actually nice work i hate to burn it though got dolan drawing it a moment for us to confer if you don't mind i don't get that impression do you maybe not just yet i like the offer though they'll get their return back if he's high-richter afterwards though we're just being paid to empty the seat not to put him in it nott caleb i know you had reservations we'll see what kind of plan we can come up with we have a day you hear thunder we have a day right when we will strike jester how do you feel oh okay we can call them back over til tomorrow i actually like what molly said i feel like tomorrow night before we go you should do your thing on ulog that would work great i think they'd understand too if we did it too early i think they-- cause you to cause suspicion after all we're only trying to make sure that this isn't a trap set for us make you feel better if we had the answer what do we do this evening to prepare well i was thinking more along the lines of checking out lord sutan they just left and we forgot to ask where the fuck he is twice can we run out after them marisha and oh god oh 15 one sec (panting) you dropped this money (whispering) where do we find lord sutan just take it and say thank you (whispering) okay don't worry about it (panting) they don't know yeah they know where he lives in the tri-spire yeah maybe that guard got his job back i'm sure he's fine well we got to figure out where the lord sutan's estate is get a wax seal a writing forge his hand fair enough yeah at dawn we plan yep we got pumat sol back man we need pumat every once and awhile that's right
