i have the hiccups i will we're both in telltale's the batman series which is great laura plays catwoman i play harvey dent episode two released last week or the week before i think it was last week it's really great it's on major consoles ps4 xbox one you can get it on your phone now too so check it out and watch us be a part of the batman rogues' gallery yeah and save harvey dent don't worry about catwoman she's a piece of cat poop you can look forward to that kind of writing it's pretty sweet i played it a bunch it's really great we're basically in all the video games you guys yeah we're going to come to the line that you would go to if you vote because we know which ones you're going to be at we'll shake your hand we're going to be there for each one of you individually like santa claus i move behind keyleth you're sure that thordak has a cure for you what about the white dragon which side is it all right i love a good story so do you have a plan i have a question do you want to talk to thordak's dead spirit or are you after the big shiny jewel in the middle of his chest insight check to see if he's lying 18 yeah sure he's telling the truth she's telling the truth yeah do you wear his clothes and use his soap and brush with his toothbrush that's a lot of attitude to what i feel is a simple question it's gross please go ahead sounds like a job for me (spits) come on spit smells funny you know wait will thordak know if we do something to vorugal why i would also say that if she wanted to set a trap with three dragons on us they would all be here right now no don't provoke-- come on even my simple mind sees the advantages here you're going to get yours you're going to get it oh yeah wait a minute why the length and bread of whitestone are you fully aware of what lies beneath whitestone yeah if you've seen it tell us what it is how big is it if you've seen it (laughter) shit she's seen it we can kill her whenever might as well use her i walk up very gingerly to keyleth and i grab one of her antlers very gently and i say look if you want to go we're with you but if you exercise a little patience i think we'll get more out of this and you'll still get yours in the end don't get me wrong i want to crack it open right now but we'll get more later wait you said he's building a volcano and you said you knew thordak before he was trapped in the elemental plane was he in any way on what is now known as glintshore before the elemental plane maybe if he can heal you i'm confused go ahead or do you want to save it no don't i say we agree on principle we agree-- i agree hands to fight with raishan you're abstaining i really wish you would vote your vote matters no you actually sway the vote in greater ways than you can possibly imagine very important i'm sure the internet has all your answers we need a moment i feel like the emotions in here are a bit raw can we please let's be honest there's nothing-- that's not a 20 holy shit i was alive for that i was alive for that just now the glasses didn't help either drop it on them no tell them your plan how many vestiges are left liam and yes i got this all those yanks barely heard you coming that time what would be wrong with summoning it what if it's really bad i have something to confess i farted yeah what are you talking about we're the masterminds of this portion of the adventure i've got nothing yeah ask him about a giant fiend-beast i'm sure they know all about it yeah we've got this on lock wait i don't know if he's cool man maybe you should check him yennen you keep your hands where i can see them just keep them where i can see them all right as you were don't worry can't be too careful we're actually hoping you have some information on a fiendish beast named lucas named victor or tell us what you know of goristros right now we are totally up to date on how to fight these things but we are also part of a group that's making sure you are at your best in case they come round here if i were to ask you how to fight one of these things what would you bring an interesting answer might you be a little less vague for my simple friend here i expected more really i did i don't even know if it's worth it at this point i expected more you want to protect whitestone right see its people to prosperity all right then maybe you should learn more about hellish fiends look what you've done well done you've got to lick your fingers and then wet-- it's all right we all have room to improve i suppose we know now where yours lies you have your orders don't make me tell percy about this 24 not a bad idea you've done lovely work in here by the way the rebuilding effort looks great i'd like to see that passion in the rest of your projects that's all shit just curious do you need any money for these homes or anything right shit you should know we've been taking surveys around the town like a b c people most important in the rebuilding of whitestone and role models and you're always the first name isn't that right scanlan i'm just trying to make him feel better it's you you're doing good work (strained) all right we clearly got the most info out of anybody you'll be in the chat room you'll get all the goodies what why wouldn't you make it in front of her and then it's way less conspicuous i do two pistols two rifles really long skinny guy and i've got a greatsword i don't want a pistol how about you take one no it's not as intimate as what i do i need the connection it'd be like a little gi joe handgun do you want a pistol i do i have 185 rounds so i take out one of the two pistols do they look the same which one are there i'll give you the super bloody one yeah i toss it to him and i give him-- (laughs) 15 rounds of ammo i'm pretty sure if you look into it-- yeah that's where the expression comes from right down the barrel yeah right yeah we need to-- (sniffs) you need to clean up the guns who has those guns i have the guns what you have are you joking for what yeah no we are what does it do it's a cloak of smashing deal all right i will trade you that for the long barrel thing in a minute what about your glasses do you give me your glasses just let me hold them show us some faith how many fingers am i holding up was he right i don't know why you need the glasses how many fingers am i holding up is he right very well you passed glasses and i give him the two rifles no this is very important for me out here i have a position of power and i'm not about to give it up what else have you got take note scanlan this is how you get shit done i'm listening yeah i have one other pistol i have 170 rounds for the little bitty guy and i've got 26 rounds for the (belches) rifles do you want the full plate armor and the greatsword too (belches) okay i give it all over what's my title yes my humble servants are those all official names well look let's keep it on the low-low right i don't want too many people getting jealous so like only in private quarters will you address me by my official title yeah which i look forward to learning it is right man i just keep coming up in the world coming up against all the odds i feel like an eminem song in the background right now eight mile bitches let's go inside i've got it can i find vax while he's looking for the gun i'm sorry i meant vex yeah you hey so remember when you showed me your boobies during the fight with kern only out of the peripheral i wanted to say thank you on a very delayed timeline by giving you this potion of superior healing (laughter) yeah so if they ever get jacked up again heal them because i fight better with boobies around okay cool deal wow what's that a picture of oh what are the other ones are they all together or is it the one guy like it burns when you pee risk or it's going to fall off in three months risk are we talking about your penis still that is terrible we can't bring them we'd have to tell them that raishan's with us should i call for a guard (loudly) guard oh (stage whisper) guard yeah no please don't use my official title if you would could you go see if lady kima and lady allura are around yes go forth quickly with haste so none at all can i ask a quick question i really like this plan to use the gate thing and go attack vorugal i don't even feel like we need raishan for it shouldn't we lure her away to somewhere and then fucking kill her but we'll be weak and she's on the fringe because remember she's barely helping out we haven't decided i like tricks but ripley got us pretty good and i don't feel like walking right into another trap one week before another fight i guess we couldn't get her anywhere with a low ceiling where her dragon form doesn't have such an advantage no i mean a cave or something what about the little cave in glintshore i picture thordak going raishan use your treachery and intellect and go kill vox machina all right so we buck up we go through with it i'm down and zahra 5000 gold better make it work then better wait did kima and allura show up yet kima shows up kima it has yeah you little badass oh yeah the thinkers are inside the room whoa wait do you have a use for it in mind in particular how long does it take to copy down the scroll a couple seconds what is this voice i'm hearing no bindings on what comes through you might get more than you bargained for okay but will its friends come through probably is good enough for me allura thank you so much for your time please don't let us disturb you any longer pretty soon we only save you for the big fights quick before she comes back what it would be the best bag ever come on yeah look when we start attacking seeker asum then we kill kima what she's probably a dragon too look we don't have to tell her as soon as we hit raishan she'll reveal herself anyway that was our agreement not tell right yeah she didn't ask i'm with percy on that plus kima is a total bash brother and if she gets to find out she gets to kill two dragons instead of one i don't think she's going to be upset yeah did see her though she's sweaty she's working on the outside of houses you saw how excited she was it's her choice if she's our friend and ally let her choose yeah yep what he said oh my god honestly all right to a vote whether we bring kima or not i want her to fight a dragon all those in favor of kima not going to fight a dragon raise your hand all those in favor of kima going to fight a dragon raise your hand i grab my earring i'm like vax where are you can you hear me oh my god removing an ally from a fight taking one of the guns and going nah i want that gun to trust me there could be ears listening by the way that two-week time period we had how far into that are we okay just checking i know that's what i said hear him out all right look the dragon is actually poisoned by a curse she's very weak we plan to take advantage of that oh we made a deal how about you just don't say anything no we're good yes we leave tonight yep pretty much that's it dear diary-- turgid vax let it be it was a good swing are you hungry at all i'll find food for you i go for the kitchen i'm in the kitchen if you leave the safety of the mansion you have the chance of being ambushed at any time by a fucking dragon all of us you know the dust of tracelessness you sprinkle behind you and real quick we've got to tell tooma that we're coming you don't think if we start attacking her dragon she'll be like oh it's those fucks from two weeks ago it's a horror theme this month you guys friday the 13th halloween nightmare on elm street texas chainsaw massacre (laughing) his hand was like all right did you hear the garment of the reaper as he walked past you (laughter) and we set ourselves up for it
