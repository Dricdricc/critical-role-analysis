that's what we do dm o'drien why doesn't it wrap around to the back pull it down a little bit just give it a little tug there it is brad pitt keep going thank you matt thank you except there won't be one 'cause you're going out of the country they're going to-- where are you going the north pole y'all are dating (laughter) it looks like mercer's eating the table what are you pointing at me okay okay i'll start because i single-handedly established peace across exandria i found myself bored in need of action and so i sought out where the fight would now be i looked for scanlan a little bit along the way i didn't find him i looked for like magical items along the way i didn't find them so i went to vasselheim which is where the slayer's take is and i think before i left i wanted to get some personal things like done to my body so i had the bear tattoo that i filleted of off kevdak and i had it tanned and then i got a copy of that tattoo on my back because that shit's behind me yep totes much better idea i also took kevdak's skull the top of it and i had a new cup a new mug made out of it with metal bits and stuff with a handle i don't understand how but it looks really great it's like metal and bone and i (drinking sounds) that's me i just choked on a peanut so i went to vasselheim and i defended my title in the crucible multiple times kern the hammer he came back with that monk shit nope i forgot no yes i said yes i said no (laughter) i said no i said no because i was like you've got to drink all the time and this and he just wasn't up to snuff that and i should not be teaching anyone anything so then i went to the slayer's take right in search of big game and i had fun with that for a while but it just wasn't quite the same it wasn't crazy-ass you know ancient dragons or nothing it just wasn't quite up to snuff but i did have my curiosity about the deck of many things piqued so at some point along the way vex's warnings ringing in my ears i found a nice drunk sap to-- yup hey you you you look like a mighty warrior do you need another drink yeah i do i have one and i pour him a little bit from the keg hey do you have like a wife kids attachments anyone that would miss you i'm going to take that as a no cool hey look i don't know if you're interested but i have in my possession something really cool and i take out the deck do you know what this is great great we're in the street right good follow me into this alley and it'll be a deal just follow me over here 19 plus one well listen i am kind of like an evangelical spreader of good news and i found this and one time i pulled a card out and i got a magic weapon it was amazing and i just figured like you look like a guy that would appreciate such a weapon so-- -- and i open the deck i thought maybe you would like to draw a card yes yep sure yeah just draw it and-- actually just hold it and don't tell me what it is it was a fucking year did you not think this was going to happen (laughter) lot of problems lot of drinking lot of fighting ran out of shit i'm not he's drawing the card could it i'm not really sure on how this shit works but i need another card to come out of that deck oh you raise your hand to pull from the deck thats some bullshit ooh ooh no i don't remember it was a face card though could you describe to me how you feel right now grog grog grog strongjaw maker of kings yup are you fucking serious (shouts) wait what was your name did i get his name i should just pull all of these right now (groaning) that is way better he's double-checking you know what only one person picked that card from the deck so it's not really my fault it was the queen of diamonds right yeah clearly nobody in my group knows what they're talking about this deck is a mighty gift and i put it back in the bag of holding i want to really bad but i have an open bar tab okay lord of the crossroads quadroads good deal that happened that's all i wanted really just cheer him on maybe have a little better counterweight for my expectation of the deck but now i just want to pull one every day nothing but good shit happens magic weapon fucking wishes no i mean oh god why do i have to be so fucking true to my character i will probably wait to take it back so that i can open it with my good friend pike because she'll understand that this is an awesome deck i did yeah i was curious about the werewolves so i went to go see the nymph in the frozen lake you know the one that's all about grog so i had a conversation with her and i felt really bad because i wasn't as affectionate as last time so i gave her this palm-sized ruby that was at the bottom of the bag looked really pretty so i gave it to her she did we hit it off and i asked her if the werewolves were just in the feywild turns out-- well i didn't fucking know that it was in vasselheim yeah to kill each other nope yep ashley -- and we knew both of us were just too powerful-- two monsters of a feather stay in leather just a little yep (laughter) doody with a y i'm tired now you ate raw meat with me you did like a champ what if some shitty 11-year-old kid just runs up and hits it oh smart

all of emon's treasures were in this one place and everybody was like meh we want to heal and i found these little gifts and one of them was this little itty-bitty deck of cards i know right now here's the thing it was in a really pretty box wooden box with gold all over it i tried to open it and it wouldn't so i smashed it like you do and i took it out and i drew a card from it and this magic sword appeared in my hand yeah do you want to yeah so i also went and i was journeying around i went to vasselheim now here's the thing vex was like no don't pick one it's dangerous mm well no she's afraid that it's dangerous right because the sword it turned to rust and i got a headache afterwards whatever but i think i didn't handle it right but i went to vasselheim and i had this other guy pick a card you know and he picked a card he got two wishes just like that and he made himself-- i know he's the lord of the crossroads yep he's rich he had a servant who appeared out of nowhere all of a sudden he had fuckin' dope-ass threads i mean i feel like we should i've seen nothing but good things happen (laughter) well i don't know so it was a magic sword right i was going to be able to throw it and it would fight without me like it would just fight things that i told it to no i tried talking to it and it didn't say anything we have a history i know i have a history of you know nope yep yeah pretty much i think it's a deck of fortunate things i think so i mean i haven't really looked at it too closely do you want to look at it with your knowledge yeah all right i give her the deck really oh or you make a bad person a king really but we're good people so good things would happen to us i know right and think about my previous experience there is nothing bad that has happened in what i've seen so far i don't know i mean like i kind of want to i mean so like like bad things how could it just outright kill you well if you die i can't do a spell we should flip a coin okay do you have a coin oh you do that was lucky do you want to what if all the good ones are gone heads because that's all bad in the heads but the tail is the booty so yeah what do you feel like
