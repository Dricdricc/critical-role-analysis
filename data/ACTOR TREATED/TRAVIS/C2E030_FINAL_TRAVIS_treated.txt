lorenzo's glaive his weapon did we get that yeah i'll go grab it and give it to caleb if it had spelled the end of one of my closest friends i know i would want it so we should probably keep it for yasha when she wakes in the bag of holding it's pretty big we don't have to do that glad you guys are keeping track caduceus can i ask what your involvement is how you became involved in this he makes what you make dead people into tea should we wait for yasha to wake up or do we bring her with she's got a day and a spell yeah i figured kind of already was but yeah let's do it i put her in the bag of holding and-- (laughter) it's not the tarp that's the source of the illusion we'll take it between the stealth cart and the dome we're going to be rolling dirty caduceus and caleb that's right i'll ride a horse reunion that was almost forensic today there's no branding we have to worry about oh shit you can do that too huh well i don't want to be the only one i'll make myself a disheveled brunet-looking guy with a sick-ass goatee birds galore what are we doing we've met with her already how did it go i hope you have some extra hands we're going to be picking up very heavy equipment and lugging it all the way from the house back to the gate if we can't bring the cart in i don't mind it's just-- (coughs) i would tell this cart that we'll be right back stay put cart i open up the bag of holding and pull out lorenzo's glaive what in the hot fuck is going on with her yeah okay we were supposed to escort her back i'm sure she has more business with the gentleman no we were going to stop on the way back though weren't we no it's not bit off more than we could chew by us saying yes to both dusk maybe we'll wait for her outside the gates with our cart the guards or the people that she has working for her are they wearing any sort of face protection head protection or is it open can i ask in your previous engagements with her how far are we trusting her liam and no superficial

before but i'm sorry we weren't here to help we haven't known each other that long but you've shown us incredible kindness and care and i'm very grateful for that i will return the favor if it's ever needed i've never had many favors done my way out of game how long have we been gone when did we leave zadash we've been gone for-- feels like a year you got a lucky rock oh hey man old trick's the

impressive cheers yeah it-- more the disappointment i expect better of myself let you guys down i let jester down i let yasha down i'll never be able to shake this no i don't no i get that i do you don't understand though my whole life was trying to blend in trying to keep an eye out for someone that was looking to take advantage that was going to exploit i got comfortable i felt relaxed there's no reason why the three of us out on watch couldn't see them coming out and raise an alarm fast enough i'll drink to that yeah it puts everything in perspective though i'll tell you that much i was floating around trying to find my way to the cerberus i don't know if that's what i want to do anymore i felt like i almost died and i hadn't taken care of any of the shit that got me here in the first place i was so worried about trying to learn about these new abilities that-- i felt like i got distracted i have people i want to find and things i want to remedy i mean fuck it's really disturbing like she came out of there like a little kettle of popcorn just no problem i mean-- can i see jester is she nearby i was worried there were really dark times i would hear jester singing to herself at night and then she'd change lyrics and then my name would be in the lyrics sometimes every morning she would try and cheer everybody up that was around her but she had the muffle so i couldn't tell if my brain was playing tricks on me or if she was just-- i don't think there's much that gets her down it's kind of inspiring an act it is kind of fucked that there's no music right now and she's just-- that was well placed you've heard it before did you have a lot of cemetery folks that were good for good-natured ribbing yep how's your face feel he's pretty tall he's a big guy oh you know what you're going to be good for when it's cold fucking hot toddies i bet you make a great hot toddy out of some dead folks' feet (singing) oh life is going to unfold in front of you hear
