request i have a bit of a chip on my shoulder would you mind terribly if i maybe went out to the street and picked a fight i want kern i'm sure i can't do it i have to do it by the rules yeah is there a tavern downstairs or anywhere they'd have cups or wineskins oh thank you did you say you encourage my violence i take off running out the room (laughter) was there a window in the room okay just checking (shouting) kern and the star trek reference is good his name's kern it's fun bring me the body of kern aye you heard right aye where everyone can see and he can't hide nope i don't yeah my belt of dwarvenkind is the only thing but that's all it's all right i turn to the bookie and i take out my entire coin purse and i throw it at him i throw him the coin purse and i say i expect to see that doubled when i get out and i jump into the pit before kern even arrives according to this it's eleven-- that can't be right can it 1363 he's missing a lip (laughs) that's an excellent bet that is an excellent bet keyleth i reach into my belt and i pull out his upper lip and i give it a smell and i say i've enjoyed it very much i've come to collect the rest and i fling it into the pit hold surely a man of your stature would honor me by sharing a drink before this battle how much is left in there (sniff sniff) i don't drink such piss water i pour it out i take out my own wineskin that i filled with the stone giant strength and i chug it down or the stone giant yeah i got it down already (laughter) (singing) we're going to need a montage a montage no philip is dead there is no philip there is only grog the vengeful (cheering) enough words toothless let's do this oh i get advantage don't i that's better 20 20 i race towards kern and i duck down as if i'm going to go into a form tackle towards his waist i take a step to the side at the last second and wrap my arms around his waist from behind pick him up to ddt him over my shoulder (cheering) okay (laughs) 25 18 plus seven six right with that action i would like to go into-- does it take an action to rage which is what this is i would like to rage (cheering) that hits yeah that'll hit too okay he got nine points of damage no problem all right i would like to enter a frenzied rage and i would like to-- since he moves off to my side i see him move and i throw a back fist into the concave area of his nose 23 great that is-- motherfucker six yes i would like to then reach forward as he's reeling back from that hit with both of my thumbs and throw them towards his eyes 14 if he knocks it aside i take my right leg and i throw it to the outside of his kneecap trying to snap his acl or mcl that's a 27 why didn't that happen before that's seven i would like to move to flank his right side that hits that hits that misses okay okay all right (grunts pants) i see you've been taking some ballet how very cultured of you and i rush forward i'm between him and the wall okay (laughs) i rush up and get him give him a little nasty-- of the last time for a double thunderclap to either side of his ears that is a 13 that's all right since i didn't find any purchase i'll see where his ears are try and grab them and i'm going to attempt to rip his ears off of his head his nice pointy ears 16 (sighs) third attack 14 i would like to use my stone's endurance that's 16 oh fantastic i'll keep that leg up in the air i'll move it over to my shoulder take both my hands up and bring it down on top of his kneecap hyper-flexing the leg (yelling) that's better 26 (cheering) that was my first what's the matter ballerina i thought you should be stretched out and ready for this and i reach back and i drive my fist into his nutsack (laughter) 25 eight my first eight oh that's right okay with that last one can i take my right leg and in an effort to shoot for that same knee i've been kicking at aim for the knee or sweep his feet fuck that'll miss it's a 13 that hits in an effort to keep my distance i run towards him i jump up in the air and throw one thrust-kick towards the side right towards his chest just to see what his defense will do well that was a natural 20 but 19 total 19 can i add the inspiration to the-- no just to the roll right that is an eight halved so half of three is one and a half and we're rounding up right so eight i leap forward again and try to throw my thumbs into his eyes 21-- aw 15 that's a 22 24 with the four six can i move i just back straight up oh really i'll move along the wall to his left side yes yes and back up just a little bit yeah all right you seem to be rolling pretty high you could use the dice that i threw misses okay that misses all right i want to move-- no i'll stay right where i am can i reach forward grab his head and his shoulder and go in for a bite attack at his neck (growls) yes aiming for the jugular 23 all right eight yeah plus six this is halved no we halve the die i eat bar stools for dinner i pull back from the bite and i whisper into his ear i was wondering what was going to break first your spirit or your body and i would like to try to pick him up over my head and bring him down on my knee bane-style okay that's 25 do i need to roll on advantage to see if i get a 20 oh it's a 19 it was so close 26 son of a bitch seven so 14 (cheering) matt reaching for things is never good i reach up with my fingernails and i carve these scrapes down my face and i leap up with both feet and i jump down on his head (yelling) that's better 23 you know what just three of them (battle cry) 20 15 did i roll it's good eight and eight that's a one

a 17 wait that was just my one attack i broke the grapple no i'll stay there hits (sighs) misses okay i reach forward throw that leg towards the right knee again still working on the same spot miss that's a 21 and i miss that's an eight that hits misses that hits okay am i back to the wall i'd like to take a step back put my back foot on the wall and then push off into the air with a huge overhand right that's a 22 eight points of damage and then i say you were supposed to be the only lipless one and i soccer ball the shit out of those dimes between his legs (laughter) that is seven is he still standing is he bent over what did you lose something no you'll lose it now and i do it again 19 eight thank you percy okay it's 18 oh that misses yeah sorry right it's my turn i come back from that knee to the solar plexus i reach out and grab the back of his head and i drive my elbow straight into his chin 25 yes eight as it carries through i'd like to come back with a back elbow same spot boom 16 last one since i'm standing and i probably whiffed i see that knee that i've been working on and i throw my heel out and try and pop it in yes 27 eight hits hits ten points okay okay right okay so that puts me at negative 13 i use my relentless rage 21 one hit point i look at my arms i look at him i spit blood into the sand and i say well well where have i seen this happen before time's up and i run forward and in a massive arcing uppercut i drive my fist under his jaw with everything i have oh damage okay oh shit 18 i look down and i say (sighs) very well respect and i take my elbow and drive it into his temple 15 (laughing) don't no i've missed the uppercut missed the elbow i take both of my fists up over my head and i just bring it down 13 okay misses i want to leap at him and try and grab him around the waist i get three-- no all right fine fuck it with desperation that this might fall away i throw my goliath fist at him 19 nine 17 22 eight (chuckles) as the fist connects and he starts to wobble i reach over i stand above him and grab around his waist with his back facing towards me i lift him up over my head so that his head gets to come up and look at the crowd one last time before sending him straight back onto his shoulder blades and neck and smashing him into the earth i put my foot on his chest and do my best king kong (yells) i run over and grab my lip and pick it up and go just between you and me is there anything we can do with this (laughter) right or growing a beard on it-- oh that's already on my chin i'm actually sweating grog's not
