weaponry do we want to crack out the mansion fuck yes also awesome supply for days general just because like i'm an inquisitive mind what is the travel time from here to emon on foot on a beast those two wow cool good deal no i was seeing if i could run there in a night and back no i'm not fucking running over there are you crazy i was just curious that mess hall-- is there a gathering quarters for the soldiers general please don't take this the wrong way do you trust your men and there are none that you worry about none that have expressed a lack of confidence none that you're keeping your eye on giving you a weird feeling i like that answer shit they've got a 300-year supply (laughter) yeah takes the water skin and just-- right keyleth is necessary to get to the feywild so it's going to be keyleth and one of the twinsies go to the feywild right i don't have it you know there is that fire elemental plane with the last vestige eh why what's life without a little risk and they've got werewolves in their woods you howl yeah i don't know how to reach my herd no they wander to and fro the herd the platinum dragon that's what i'm saying no no i said the word platinum i was there and you robbed me of it i did it right didn't the werewolves want to leave the feywild right they wanted out and as far as we remember the people of vasselheim their general temperament is vasselheim takes care of vasselheim right we could go talk to that earthbreaker groon she is he fucked some shit up spike ukurat laura and kash kima gross yeah yes we go in emon right now full ball full blush why are you so anxious to go to the fire plane all of a sudden insults cheese bruised bananas hey pike did you know that we have all the vestiges except for the one in the fire plane and you'll never guess what it is what is it i forgot it's some plate armor just pure death and destruction that's true did we establish a way to contact her oh we did she was checking on-- it was two things it was asoon and bassoon whatever and what was the other thing oh shit nails oh she was going to emon to hold up the bluff that everything was cool was thordak right she was going to bluff and then she was also going to try to bring back seeker asum thordak what if we go mess up something on the edge of emon and then we're like yeah fuck you and then we take off or like bamf back yeah to balance that out is it a bit of a practice round if we go to the fire plane let's say we get there and it's a total shit show right nothing but death waiting for us we change our mind we leave but at least we see where thordak's been all this time yeah just give it a look-see yeah i've got a timeshare there it will be killer true it's just a myth though right and that was probably written a long time ago which means shit could have totally changed never tell me the odds all right vax do you have a suggestion in place then i'm okay with that but how do we get in touch with her let's go to a different plane vorugal aye no that was four they're pansies and won't say anything with their voice let's go even if it sucks we can just come right back right no cows eat hay do we hold hands again yeah yeah i am a big fan of the tour guide let's hoof it i need to stretch my legs anyway told you i put pike on my shoulders because i'm getting ready for my rocky training montage let's do it i mean everything we do is right i mean every time we've faced a dragon we go find another vestige it feels like the rhythm is right on this let's go we're alive high-five scanlan yeah she'll figure it out and we've got an amazing tour guide it's set up for us can't fail 0% apr yeah i'm good with that i mean you'll take us there right you'll give us a couple of warnings maybe point at something if it's terrible and then you've got to go because it's going to mess with you now why is that like you've got feelings about it or you're afraid of it or you'll be powerless there powerless you've been before we're good speak for yourself pull the trigger travel agent yeah i'm standing there with my eyes closed and my hands out i'm showing my willingness to go sure i chose @couple_cosplay for his white muscular version of
