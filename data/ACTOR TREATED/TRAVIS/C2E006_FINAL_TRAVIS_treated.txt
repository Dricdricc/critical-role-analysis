yeah we do you hit randomize your character what is your name panalanalam-- pana-- there are four n's in that name i am eomita deephollow lightfoot halfling fighter no no no no because i'm awesome you're in big trouble that bed was not my favorite little stiff you use a pillow or are you just on the floor do you have to pray over your swords or anything this morning yeah well we were sharing a room one night and molly has a ritual i think it's part of his custom yeah he performs over his swords no stop it yeah i mean for fear of your life you ran i understand that sentiment trying to find a little respite a little peace you're in control of it you're using it for yourself i'm tempted (retching) nah i seem to have missed my calling i know what you're asking i didn't have any other dreams it was fairly restful none i care to speak of anything left we couldn't quite see it at night that's true maybe we should go down he said he was going to bring the rest i think later hey molly didn't you say bryce said it would come later jester we agreed not to put anyone in harm's way in an excessive manner did we not maybe i thought that was an unspoken thing i think i'm fine fair enough actually i think they'll find us we go downstairs a-rating for the city of los angeles you just give us all diabetes that's great coconut shrimp did you just out-talk jester yeah no i knew where you were going with it though how do we ring the dinner bells is what you're saying how do we get them to come to us well they done took it all i think why more so now well they took all the luby's cafeteria with them so i don't think they're going to be hungry for a bit then we would need to roast some meats who yeah he was hungry all of a sudden you thinking some of them gnolls had some fiendish qualities perhaps right shit i forgot all about that i have some weird dreams what did you have in mind other nights marisha and oh nothing i got shit in my teeth yeah fine did you have a plan did you want to do something to wrangle them-- oh sorry well maybe we'll follow them to the barn broad broad barn i was fucking with you yeah that's all right seems some people handle pressure better than others he doesn't seem like the handling type we couldn't help but overhear that you were asking for some aid how long were you thinking you might need these replacements well i think i speak for all of us we're certainly up to the task for a bit well maybe for a little less than a bit can i ask are there any other threats to this town besides those gnolls things that come on legs and with weapons i mean why do both of you know that do you know what area they might have gone to more of a pamphlet actually advance hey caleb was that a character-dm inside joke caleb in my personal holdings-- i don't really remember putting this there-- but apparently i have five sticks of incense that i have no intention of using will that do you any good i think it was part of a thing i don't know it's d&d beyond i don't know i think so yes changed your day didn't it everything's coming up flowers now don't mention it as he walks away i'm like ow (laughter) only you would put poop in a jar jester yeah insecticide pesticide herbicide yeah but you ever chugged a bunch of insecticide that's a bad day it's like visine just the juice it is with a little whiskey like cheeseburger in a shot glass what do you need to do for the rest of the day caleb i think if we were a little spread it would help well i would follow the direction they left last night see if we can find a trail yeah you just stay behind caleb you'll be fine yeah you know i love that idea small thing though time again is of the essence right dry aged really get a good hickory chip under them problem is people might be dying in the meantime so if we could find a more expedient solution beau had an idea get them beau you tell her-- beau had a fantastic observation if we happen to see one of those beasts of burden on our way out tracking maybe we could wrangle one up and use it as a bait to bring people back i think you're right extra horse we need the cart i think we'd be making a best guess at this point my best hope is to find out where they are what it looks like where they're staying and if we can without confrontation get some survivors out of there that would be ideal i'm just putting it out there maybe survivors before ears i thought you said you weren't a tactician look at you caleb's plan let's do it c-man i thought i was the seaman fucking get your titles right come on brother you know you want to i'm a proud son of a bitch do we see any crownsguard around in the street i'd just like to find one if i could howdy sorry to bother but we've been commissioned by bryce to make a little expedition to go after those gnolls and we're going to need an extra steed if the crownsguard has one where would those be are you concerned about the people that live in this town clock's ticking on their lives and you want me to go get a steed from another stable instead of saving their lives i sure would hate to have to report this to bryce i think they'd be pretty upset about it 13 your name reggie i'm disappointed reggie i don't know what else to say let's go (laughter) fuck yeah now very nice we make our way over to where we left our other horse and cart i don't know why i thought you were going to say they left behind poop if that's the direction you saw them head off in check it out yeah that is bad news are the carts all heading in the same direction or would they split up tall grass on these rolling hills picked by beasts or-- the grass is it dead or vibrant green is it still the morning hour or about midday high noon oh no don't do it oh no (nervous laughter) it was right there mm-hmm right king of the world yes by foot is how we should proceed no would you want to be the one person that got attacked with the horses by yourself yeah i didn't think so we stick together yep now i'm ready to die (laughter) that would give away our stealthy approach holy shit no rocks around right no stones or boulders in the field i was trying to get it in the depression of a rolling hill and just-- we haven't seen anything yet kill the horses oh to use as-- that's right we could let's find out what we see first and then we'll decide everybody fan out in a firing line just one straight line-- just within eye distance right but keep a line keep in line we're going to move towards the cart we're going to use the tall grass yeah i'm open to it if you have any yeah let's do that people's lives urgency clock time all that stuff we're all even moving forward i don't mind being on an end how about that you want to be in the middle 15 can we see how many entrances there are to this mine yard i could make a distraction nott beau are y'all fast quick and quiet who else there's three of them right all right about how far from the edge of the grass where we are to them can i use minor illusion to create a plump little bunny and have it hop out of the grass but its front leg looks a little lame now i did would you like to go i don't want to like make y'all alarmed or anything but that was kind of fucking efficient hands are sweaty you're right quick perimeter check to see if we alerted anything anything's looking at us natural 19 move to the cart quick check of anything left behind clues there's no bodies just blood spatter oh we've got to figure out where we're going first do it you're a lot stronger than you look yeah boy sure did you're anxious to go you want to go first frumpkin is still just a sweet little bird so i thought maybe a little quick flight in-- oh oh smash canary in a gnoll mine i don't know if that's something frumpkin can do unless nott you just wanna go in there and go kamikaze oh shit oh shit oh yes we get her hammered and she's the most fucking badass oh no my only concern is if we draw them out there could be more than us right i just want to get a quick peek if we can you wouldn't mind consonants are gone that my lads was a dragon eldritch blast on the other one yeah i rolled the first one which was a 24 but with advantage that's less so 24 oh yeah i'm sorry 24 for the first roll oh balls that's-- eldritch blast oh that is a 12 sorry my bad old habits they die hard nine points of damage oh shit 14 four points damn you broke its ribs to get to its organs what happened how'd they find you right i will keep an eye down the tunnel that they came from while they pillage casks well what've we got are we happy are you going to carry the sledgehammer not for you beast mode yeah i'll take it i'll tuck the rod into my belt you can maybe we view this an opportunity to grow and we look for those now great yeah anything that looks out of the ordinary out of place on the wall on the floors-- are you still shithoused are you fucking hammered still okay she needs another shot yeah i know the feeling do you want to check air current temperature nothing anything temperature equal on both sides you know what could be really handy in this situation is some of that fancy fucking thread of yours yeah i don't mind commiting to one of these tunnels i just want to make sure nothing comes behind us or comes up from the other way because you're hammered yes you sussed it out 15 don't make a sound how many total i don't like seven on eight i am not a fan good thing we're metal i mean i hate it but-- plus we're in a mine there's a big column that's in between them right is it a column or a stalagmite do you want to throw the rod at the column there's another path down behind them and make them turn away from us because we're in a fatal funnel up here at the top i genuinely feel like we should go the other way there's a whole other path no do you know can i use this planning moment to cast armor of agathys on myself spectral frost collects from the air on my armor i didn't give myself enough cold damage if we need to close it off light the tip of that little wick and throw it what kind of a check was it i'm ready can you point to one of them that is not undead just looks like a regular gnoll or i can just pick one great did you aim at that one okay i'll take that far one can i focus and summon my falchion into my hand can i use my bonus action to cast hex at that right gnoll can i reach back and fire eldritch blast into it 16 six plus four ten 1d6 15 points of damage can i use my distance to move over here if i may am i in your line of sight jester does

little bit of a beating we have the silver thread up top right oh it took a few minutes didn't it i think it's in front of us a short rest doesn't get us spells back does it i'd like to volunteer that perhaps we move forward until we can see whether there are any living people that we can help and we make a decision then that went far better than the village but also that big armored bastard wasn't
