lighter people will you go get those two please but why would you do that because you've gotta put two people on that carpet we're trying to put them on the carpet right you know if you get hit by something that falls yeah we're just kind of watching the fucking show i think we just leave 'em i had a question so i take one of my five empty jugs out of the bag of holding and i go to the edge while they were up there doing all that shit i look down and i just throw it straight down as hard as i can does it immediately go whoop right so if you did a jump i will pull you all into the chasm can't somebody fly the carpet back over and then-- can't pike fly it back over and then she and scanlan can bamf over and then i can just try and make it across with the carpet yeah and then what it is somewhere doesn't have a range sure i'm down with that 30 feet no i'm not attuned to that i've got the little hammer now oh sorry the hammer yes how far across the chasm is the thing i mean i can essentially attach it to anything i think no sure that really seemed very easy i don't see what the big deal was (laughter) it's going up but we're not what's on the ceiling just flat 16 well we could pour a bunch of water in the fountain oh i just meant pour water out of the alchemy jug i do what do you want for it what you got for trade (laughter) is that an ascot you're wearing i'll take that i don't care i want it i want to be dignified here's your jug how high is the ceiling okay we don't wanna pour anything into the fountain we did nothing to this thing that's right here magically pouring water out i love buttons i just feel like i don't know nothing more sad than an empty fountain well yeah i feel like that's what a fountain does i mean like if you came across an empty fountain kind of a worthless thing i dunno yeah kinda allura it's just an empty fountain right it's gotta have a purpose i never really get that far allura you're all smart with magic and stuff why is this horribly terrified face giving water upwards on an emerald in the ceiling yeah okay what do you want for it we are running towards vax and vex that was so white that was amazing so white piano riff to the right or the left
