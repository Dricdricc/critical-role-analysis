it's got the logo on the back too is that the kind dm shirt or is that the evil sarcastic-- yeah pretty much bright and early anime weekend atlanta we're there friday saturday sunday come down see us and throw things in our face that'd be great when he walks back yep that's him no they took it and ran it was part of the penance we fought bravely it's buck naked from here on out i have a question should we ask the sword of kas since it's fought vecna before does it know of any weaknesses sorry i need to sit (gasp) that's a good idea percy oh my god yes wait wait if i pull it out of the sheath to talk to it-- can i talk to it through the sheath i might have to draw it and then it's going to need the (glugging) you look listen i made a promise to your brother he was very adamant that i'm supposed to stick it-- do you want just a hand slice or do you want to up the ante and i stick it in your thigh i do have to bathe it it has to be quite a coating okay cool come on percy buy the ticket baby so can i unsheathe kas do i get to pick where okay i reach around to the back of his knee and i pull along there yeah when you shave your legs the back of your knee is the tricky part right respectfully kas i had a few questions because i am on board to satisfy your maniacal desires to fuck up vecna and all that he stands for right oh no kas oh thank god might need more blood soon do you know of any weaknesses that vecna has or opportunities that we could explite apparently he's really smart and is arro-- aromatic he likes to put on a show i think yeah doesn't make much sense apparently he builds whips out of plots oh right he strings things together like a web you know like a dog makes yeah oh god he's really adamant about cutting the webs yeah i guess vecna has spider abilities pro-tip any physical weaknesses or things that he is vulnerable to that we should know him okay cool i think we've got everything to him all right next time i pull you out in the light it will probably be to kill vecna or someone that i don't like how's your knee is it okay i got a whole bunch of more hit points it's like i don't know but i was thinking i have all three trammels right and i need to get real close to do anything to vecna is it stupid for me to have all of them so we don't get paralyzed i reach over to pike i spin her around are there any wings on the back i don't know how to break this to you they're not there yet i turn her upside down look at her feet i turn her back just keep wishing they'll grow in okay thank god because i don't have any more do i have to attune to them does my speed translate to going up things as well i have the feral leaping boots if he's more than 20 feet in the air i'm fucked yeah but i'm not using the axe or the hammer i'm using the sword yeah but it's only one attack per action instead of three what are you planning on doing here's the thing last time we fought vecna he went higher than 30 feet he was up where vax was before he fell oh it's just jewelry boring yeah so good no truesight no seeing through this no no on we're going to pull it over on vecna we're fine this is a great plan do it man do it we're overthinking it and we're definitely doing the pillars no i mean are we or are we not okay cool we're doing the pillars no just do it man it's okay isn't wish instantaneous you want bracers of defense plus two to your ac i'm real excited actually like you know you always want to test yourself to see what you're made of what is your mettle really like we're going to find out we're really going to find out nobody else excited yeah together right sam and yeah i love all of you (snores) (snorts awake before returning to snoring) boobies and we sleep yeah what are you holding over there first roll first roll first roll 11 burning it already six points brothers in arms yeah no i'll run in save it for battle this is what we do what's that plus a d10 to my initiative now 22 yeah i run up i'm going to run up and grab it by the head and neck and lay on it shock collar if it barks it activates she has something that makes her less clanky-like aw yeah no way okay maybe not the best reunion time how high up good pitch wait you can't die well he said like she thought i was dead but my queen-- thank god he's wearing that armor huh when do we want to do freedom of movement stuff not yet does anyone know that you're here i smash (stumbling) mitheens (drawn out) mitheens what oh 19 let's find the crystals that's okay matt let it happen i'm not really so keen on making doors as opposed to knocking them down i'm a craftsman all right i'm just me oh fuck yeah don't share it oh yeah not only should we back up a little bit except for me we should also have an area that we're going to run to right because i'm sure this will bring the noise marisha and arkhan's going to stay just in case it needs like a double-- yeah you know sky's clear actually well hold on you got to stay here right because of the-- i would like to rage and i go tiger uppercut and i just punch the roof of it yeah destroy 23 that is 15 just by itself so one more laura and 24 i'm standing there like a catcher ready we're coming around that planet i got this guys don't worry three we're going to hide if he spots us we scatter and spread but oh 16 no 18 i did plus we have one extra ally two (shouting) oh this is it oh no sam and most amazing 2d10 roll ever take it okay come on come get some thanks to kas 27 18 17 i always do this it's just not that intense of a fight vax what were you again vax it's me already raging let's see there's a window right can i run upstairs and i jump out the motherfucking window is that my full 50 awesome so i'm going to double dash with the spider boots that percy gave me and i'm going to run up the tower and just go straight yeah one dash yeah why you making me feel dumb am i within melee of that skeleton dragon the bone dragon perfect that's my turn with my bonus action can i make it a frenzied rage i don't know where vax is i forgot his number percy arkhan pike i get all names wrong i know when there are too many dice to roll the phone comes out the deliverance of the death the method chosen we've got a dragonborn paladin we're fine i'll make it reckless i believe it's arkhan it's a 34 this dragon would be considered undead yes so with the sword's 2d10 slashing damage to undead that's 32 points of damage you've got this focus in you got it walk in the park i thought it was bugs bunny but you did woody woodpecker did you rage i did you have to hold it we don't do math fast ever dump it dude legendary action incoming does he have advantage on wisdom something in the clutch it's what earthbreaker did toothless which one are you prime or two really wow your reverse math was super fast just then that would have taken me five minutes keyleth that hits with advantage oh wait that's a d10 natural 20 (relieved noises) i told you it's the jam can i jump to the top of the bannister here so i'm looking down at old tangled-up delilah (sighs) may i leap off the tower and straight onto delilah's prone body 25 i fucking hate this dead bitch and i raise the sword and start swinging down in these huge arcs at her the first two attacks at her are they with advantage because she's prone so not reckless natural 20 (cheering) should i roll the second attack (counting) 21 plus 14 help me 35 35 35 okay so that's those let me make sure i'm doing this right oh that's before the modifier just 35 51 no i mean my brutal critical i roll the damage die an additional-- two times yeah two damage dies at this level three 62 i rolled pretty low did you want it out here let me help you out (yells) and put it back in that is a 32 24 i was going to do something to sylas but fuck it we're going to hit her 33 to hit 23 nope nope 23 plus-- i wasn't even adding-- i was so excited about the sword damage i was forgetting my rage damage i did yeah the d10 plus 2d10 slashing damage to undead right oh she's not oh shit i figured she was dead then not dead-- 22 24 but i hadn't added my-- okay fair enough shit i'm so sorry so that's 21 yeah yep i thought she was undead just figured oh really sylas is undead the dragon's undead are the gloomstalkers undead not undead hunter's mark no you don't like done were her hands her own hands his first one yeah through all material atta boy 6d8 holy shit (laughing) that's bad oh man come on now i did not know that what if i made this a reckless tripping attack i don't know i don't know if it would ground him for one second or not i don't know that's why i'm asking the dm i'm going to do reckless trip attack 34 he's undead right oh no please no you were up first i insist arkhan please yeah 17 and then i roll a d8 or i add a d8 it's my first one i've ever rolled five shit what did i say it's a trip attack oh i'll pull it up i've got it right here does his hand turn into a bat with him or does that fall-- plus we're still in initiative order can he use a legendary resistance on a grapple i want to see what the inside of them looks like when he was in the gaseous form y'all we recruited dead delilah testosterone poncho i don't want to overthink this but i feel like the sword said that it wanted to cut the webs of vecna can i just cut the tower down i take your laugh as a sign of-- i could couldn't i perhaps not that's a big fat no can i take one of the fancy robes that remains in the bag of holding and drape it over the trunk coming out of her chest so it's a little more hidden behemoth is it dead undead if it doesn't work we kill it he might you got it 22 bring them into the cru you got them vasselheim was just out the window beacon of hope 2d8 16 are we doing a group thing right now yeah we're at the gates all right do it do the short rest just do it a quarter or half of vasselheim is-- don't take your superior though one-sixth of the pie vote as a group hand up if you want a short rest no hands just put your hand up if you want it keyleth put your hand up i'll tie-break it it's super fast natural one because he also turns people right i barely made that save i think this is the verge she has a death ward who wants the death ward but who wants it who needs it i've got my one hit point regenerate regenerate regenerate sealing of what oh the trammels you've got to put it on scanlan what does your speech do keyleth again i take out the immovable rod and have it in my hand we would need dispels his dead brother and-- i'm sorry i thought you know-- got to pay respect come on buddy come on come on yeah i'm not worried one bit i did do you want to cirque du soleil this thing we'll hold arms and i'll walk on the ceiling yeah i will walk up on the wall so that i'm sticking out because i was inverted bullshit top gun thank you treat me like your fucking dragons-- french girl whatever hand wraps get some aviators it'd be totally cool i'm still raging 25 not a problem what happened to you guys is there anything else to catch fire that would travel upward toward us as we're climbing a towering inferno any weapons or items besides the chains and manacles on the floor call it out i got it i'll pick it up and start reading actually delilah is last one i have you got it they're facing away from us there's no chance you could remove the stone from the middle of the floor and have them fall if we don't think the room or the setup will fuck us up the big boys can go in and probably handle it or we can follow your attacks i would send in the dragonborn because they're all alive jocks machina does not get hazed no we don't know anything yet no there's no way don't do that this is some seven shit right here i'd almost rather him stay and fight me i'm a fan of adrenaline with pleasure haste (gasps) what did you do you kevin spacey from seven mother fucker what did you do (terrified laughter) oh my god you're welcome any time you've got surprises and then you've got that shit thank god you rolled a one
