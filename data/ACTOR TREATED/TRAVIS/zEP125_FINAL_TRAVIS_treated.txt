that's something what would you do every week without sponsorships you would explode as a player of far cry 4 it was amazing i have higher expectations for 5 yeah it's real good atvs baby sorry but good friends never let you forget matt yeah let's get our own sea org and we'll give out ranks i like girl scout cookies how'd you do lots of gifts then he's in zadash like staying here isn't that hard since he's not technically recognized he plays lots of local clubs yeah up and coming enjoying a resurgence were you with anyone when he showed up do you think he'd want to meet us or introduce us maybe perception check first one that's an 11 yeah (whispering) i don't think he's here that is problematic well a hood yasha do you have any kind of communication with your-- yes i don't think it was more than a few days i don't recall exactly do i recall exactly by a few days i mean a couple weeks i think that's more of an appropriate estimation oh yeah jester that's got to take a while to get there and back of course now is she supposed to send you stuff here we'll have to hang out until it shows up then you're shabby yasha makes a good point though just in case a simple wipe-down was enough to gain you entry we've got to tackle this job at some point yeah it's a sewer nexus with a beast with webs yeah because we'll have bank and then we can get room service and shit did they give you a hall pass or something is it just a key or is there a thing that dangles from it something we could mimic and make more of jester can i see it real fast oh thank you i take a real good look at it in case i want to fucking minor illusion that shit later it gets real turnt up when this here starts playing a silver fucking start small man now the beat's all off yeah i've been looking at some of the folks around here i think they're over-exaggerating the importance of this beast yeah i think we should at least go down there and take a look nah i don't think so i'm not a super fan of the sewer during the day i figure i'll like it even less at night ooh yeah do we know where that guy is the guy that came running back that voloshin said that one of them ran back from the task yeah good thinking how long does it take to get over to the tri-spire area find us a manhole is it early afternoon or late afternoon we'll be fine yeah why not we're definitely going now hey let's do it you'll walk your buzz off not with your nerd goggles how about we casually make our way over and as we're doing that we can keep an eye out for kingsguard and see if they know of this guy one of those shitty dueling shawls that they throw off warren t rat in american tail oh jesus please no yeah this is your opportunity to shine get 'em explain what we're doing oh seems reasonable enough do you know if the sewers flooded any time during the day any sort of unexpected water flows when people ask you who were those brave souls that ventured into sewer you tell them the mighty nein sam and who's first yeah get in there tank yasha no he just closed it jester what do we think go up or down up right i put the glove of blasting on my left hand what the fuck did you just draw if you ever make a road sign people are fucked that is-- yep that's some old fucking street fighter combo shit you really want to go south you two i like that logic bobby tarantino territory let's do it let's go south asshole (laughter) nobody is going to ask you why you know that just so we're clear you don't need to explain anymore i think maybe we should head back in the opposite direction since you're tasting hemorrhoids in the water it's probably coming from that direction let's do it the curved surface of this area can we see the ceiling clearly or is it way above us dust yeah swords in the middle i'm going to go ahead and cast armor of agathys get on the spectral frost armor it's the snowcone variety scratching sound's a rat and we're all like (whimper) it's actual shit 20 as well natural 20 zero i'm a limited fucking warlock i turn to see where all of them are in relation to the party are there any sons of bitches over here that i can't see okay great i turn around and i see caleb being flanked by two of them and i know he is super squishy can i run towards this rat can i reach back with my hand and-- that hits the rat takes ten points of frost damage i reach back to strike the rat as my hand comes down i'll summon the falchion into my hand and strike down no it was one-handed so 1d8 ten points of damage oh shit yes it does i got nervous (gagging) (laughing) i have reservations about killing a sewer dog you could flip it blade-up it's in my mouth that shit doesn't work punching the fuck out of rats fuck you you dirty rat it's down here it's rats we're not using that shit (laughter) ray (laughter) save you got it smash it you're rolling the bad dice again you gotta look in the camera oh good yeah yup nostrils are burned right the fuck out you know this really isn't what we need this is only the appetizer maybe we should try to find the main course yeah i think stealth would be a good idea to the right or just don't disturb them 18 you normally touch a spider's web they come running can we see a past that into any further clumps of webbing 14 do we have to break any of the planes of webbing to get to this cluster quite a while but i'll remind you that our mission is not to retrieve any guards it's to kill this beast that was dark and angry shall we move forward to the first plane of webbing that would hinder our movement does it interact with the environment what do we like more poking the webbing or sending it up in flame might as well-- my way of thinking is what if that web is sticky as shit i don't want to get caught in it how about a poke and then a flame that way nott doesn't have bad dreams that we burn some people that are still alive and then we can set it all on fire oh right so they're dead huh firestarter how about four on one side and three on the other of the tunnel i'll take the front of the other side of yasha since i've got some armor wow fucking betrayal okay hey nott will you do me a favor and make sure nothing sneaks up behind us could be can i search for puncture marks stab wounds bite marks ten on the medicine check so big fangs probably fucking pincers you know (clicking) yeah so watch your shit how's the ground that we're standing on now but the stone is unim-- not tacky the worst kind of candy or if we go up to the grate and try and get someone to open the hatch in case we need to beat a speedy retreat yeah do it give her the writ of law thing is there an a in that if you had to ballpark the distance to the halfling or to the very end of it i am going to join nott at the back and keep an eye

endurance i come back to one hit point sorry i'm half dead oh fuck what dice are you using yeah this is the second fight fuck yeah beast mode as you rush towards it with a large arc slamming down like (whoosh) you carve through part of its carapace two of the eyes are cloven through and are now bloodied and ruined i'm going to take a healing potion yeah it's my turn with my bonus action can i cast hexblade's curse on the spider with the fucking glove of blasting that we took off the thing can i go (grunting) and fire all three of the scorching ray balls at the spider that's a nine plus two for 11 that's a one 16 that's right eight points of damage plus two to hit that's it no damage two proficiency thank you ten thank you yeah you just got to kill the spider and i'll be fine woo crit on

recognize any of the names of ships or any imagery ugh 11 yeah insight check (laughter) one way to find out i'm just waiting nott oh well wasn't the plan to have a what did you call it oh jesus christ garmin over here if i may you raise a good point nott if we for some reason get caught being where we're not supposed to i think that writ only allows us to kill this beast and return it for the coin i would not want to gamble with our reward of 700 gold perhaps we should leave and collect our reward and then find our revelries elsewhere this is a good point we can walk yeah the king's hall dinner yeah mighty nein stay back nein (laughter) yeah indeed in fact it would turn invisible when it wasn't trying to stick its fangs into all of our gang with that accent all those letters disappear don't punch him don't no nein oh yeah i'm moderately okay at this oh no okay deception where the fuck is it oh it's 11 who picked up all those items anyway we're staying over at the-- although some of us were taking up at a room at the-- 700 gold of course we appreciate the law in this town and the services you provide you can lean on us for any further needs you might have yeah a shitty hole (laughs) a shitty hole yeah but it hasn't changed at all if anything later in the day it gets worse i'm just letting you know we do have some extra coin maybe he's got some fancier shit to buy for someone who knows the exact time of night you are shit with directions agreed should we head back clean up yeah sure if you'd like i'm not repeating that word wow wish i had that before yeah i think a trade would be fine but i'll trade you for a story of why your past is so checkered with flame you seem to trust in me enough to tell me about it that's too bad sure you know we've all harmed people but i hope that you will learn to trust me in time and i appreciate you sharing that here i'm fairly certain that you will do far more damage with this than my shitty attempt did of course thanks for the armor what does it look like (laughter) all good things thank you for this yeah you're welcome we're going to get clean first because good god we're going to clear out that fucking tavern but matt-- i'm certainly not trying to hide it grumpy-ass wingman makes me look better in comparison who which one i shuffle in with like a towel nott what the fuck (laughter) shoo shoo (laughter) oh with the buzzed head of course (quietly) don't talk well we come from all sorts of different backgrounds i happen to be very handy at sea know my way around a merchant area beau at times we can be quite quiet i would say it's safe to say that they don't have sentiments opposed to yours just letting you know that coin always helps but we did see the posting outside the king's hall about uprisings against the empire
