want to go in oh my god we're in the feywild we're about to pull a bow out of a tree and you don't want to see what's in the creepy cave i know i'm looking at the scandalous one over there that's always trying to get little goodies for himself all right you went (boop) i'm just saying all right fine i'm happy what if we run touch the back of the cave run back we don't even have to pick up anything just to say we did it what all the bad shit already came out of it what do you say i know he's got the raised eyebrows i'm not sure if we should do it or not what ten or higher we go natural 20 i put scanlan on my back and we run straight into the cave i don't want any torch i've got darkvision jackpot we are the greatest ones in the group are the candles standing up or are they laying over we have not said anything to the rest of the group can i do one as well yeah there's nothing that moves in here in that circular area is there anything on the back wall more candle sconces and the skull is big like the size of my chest does it look like it could have been a bear skull well no but look at it we're in a secret chamber i bet they worshiped it are there a crapload of footprints on the ground around us 13 want to take a candle as a souvenir yeah well let's do that then i can throw you taking it back to the old school that's a little careless that's like getting your hand on it right away it's pushing the button ooh yeah okay okay (laughing) perfect are you ready to go we take off-- wait you've got to cut me wait where are you going to cut me yeah right in the middle like the bruce willis cut okay but not too deep right i want to be able to still make the ladies swoon why not you were going to cut me with a vestige (grunting) are you ready let's sell this shit and i put him on my back and we take off running (yelling) oh it's horrible we burst out into the sunlight and i intentionally trip and eat shit scanlan goes flying boom oh my god it was so vicious no there were bodies everywhere children women they were stapled to the ceiling and then there were just horrible-- 15 and a big skull we reached out to touch it and it cut my face yeah there were a ton of candles and a skull there's only one show in a day we don't want to miss it well since i touched the skull and i cut myself could you do me a little (clicks tongue) no don't you have a thing if you care about me oh that feels so much better we're good i agree yeah it couldn't hurt and he wanted a hat how bad could he honestly be girl you can always ride lead something right to us hold on are you saying you don't hear anything right now we should check it out have to cross the river right but we got to cross this river to get to it he said it's lazy right it's just going along but i call bullshit 'cause we're in the feywild no i wasn't if i got into a rage i can't be charmed hey i've got an idea how about you race in grab scanlan i'll kill the other two-- have you no mercy back-to-back before you let me off the chain there are trees right who's benefitting from this charm there's not somebody in a tree hiding out you're going to let me go i would like to rage i don't know if i've killed an elf in quite a while so i'm going to aim my axe at the throat of the elf that's dancing they didn't get back up sweet i'm just grabbing scanlan and running straight through 25 20 20 vax (laughter) 22 like a little dog on my calf so the fire's out instruments are gone should we loot the campfire yeah that's it roll a d20 we're moving towards the gilded run oh you told us about that earlier we make people sigh a lot are we trampling anything as we're walking can i jog up to garmelie and vex real fast you said that there were lycans at some point and you said they move through the trees right would that be these trees right have you seen a lycan great we should be keeping an eye on the trees well they're here shit i match his step i'm super restless have you fought a werewolf before have you fought a lycan is it just brute strength it also bears remarking that garmelie said we're not supposed to side with either right no we're destroying one of their relics let's just go over there do a little recon and then we'll make up our minds go see the pixies we send in garmelie if he dies then we make a choice do you have a revision to that plan wow you're so brave they're going to be pixies with giant dickbutts everywhere how tiny well let's go get eyes on them shall we i feel like cute is the last word we should use for this should we look for perimeter alarms or traps all right pass without a trace that was awful 15 what i hate spiders i like the latter of those two did they say to bring one back or to break it the relic you ever stepped on an anthill right it gets real nasty real fast like forest wasps what if we asteroid-dropped keyleth from 500 feet you'd be in your stone elemental form it'd be no problem for you i vote we don't fuck with the pixies never thought i'd say that what you'd waste hallucinatory terrain when else are you going to use that third option we say fuck the lycans fuck the pixies and we just keep going all in favor of hallucinatory terrain raise your hand weren't you dropping little green rocks so we can find our way back to the lycans right okay let's do it are we running back to the lycans or to the shademirk i've got garmelie natural 19 i'm looking for lycans too i'm just being honest 24 fuck that little bastard wait you can go invisible is it magic can you tell yeah have a look cut me real quick can i take out my bloodaxe and go up to the magic barrier and hit it as hard as i can 22 how do i do that i forget i'm kidding 16 sweet natural one ow i just don't think we can go this way (belches) oh that's true it didn't hurt us when we just ran into it i have a proposal why don't we make our way back to the pixie dome and say oh we were chased by these horrible lycans we wanted to kill them but we got stuck when we hit this invisible wall could you do anything to help us get rid of the lycans and then we play both sides of the coin all right you take first watch we're going to zonk out is this shit on camera we're recording right twice in a fucking row what are the chances do it again it's like a plinko machine they saw you what did they do to you i'll stay up you can cuddle with me i know ten yeah fireflies what the little lights oh i freeze in an exotic pose eight a six and a two one look and they ran what yeah pickled herring and i've been grabbing stuff as we walk through no look we've got to talk to them anyway right we're not going to run how yeah just keep sleeping no i actually go back to sleep too the cups are bigger than they are oh you made drowning pots for us all how lovely it's going to be a threat yeah don't go through that wall but bidet no it's cool please do as you will let them feel at ease go ahead natural one (laughs) i'm stoned beautiful that was too good how many points of damage was that 15 i can break somebody lost an arm that way i tried to be diplomatic yeah but i thought we were all-- never mind people were preparing tea you were being cordial i was trying to be disarming next time everything dies no way fucking golden snitch i'm looking at it what is the deal they made it didn't they the cutest swear ever diplomacy really isn't that bad i'm going to throw my weapons in the river hold on i'll be right back why thank you all the wolves are back what happened oh really oh so something happened didn't it really they fought hard we're going to kill more now any tips advice don't think that's a problem are we cool with the wolves now absolutely i walk up to lord pup the gray ground that's been burned is it just not everything else i feel like we just killed ferngully oh we're here why is reaching the gilded run a bad thing like rapids must've been a cool fight with werewolves in tow not the rest of them he's going to steal our shit i was trying to be diplomatic all right i checked off the box next time napalm i even gave willingly not yet we haven't
