happening sun bad sun very bad can i look at dani dani why are you wearing a sign that says drink me not wearing a sign chris is why are you wearing a sign that says drink me father said you had to we should kill chris nope this chris chris do you want me to kill you we shouldn't kill chris the wedding's done liam we got to get liam out of there i kick eric dead in the chest just for good measure he was coming after liam just strength six successes no failures (coughing) i back out my shoe changed i kicked him in the chest and my shoe changed i got out of it though his chest gives you new shoes is she still sitting down dani show me your hands yeah i kicked eric's chest out and he started laughing unpowered laptop just black screen she's typing furiously hey should we bring one of these drink me guys with us i don't know like a decoy no offense chris chris do you want to come with us you don't know that we're all a bit of our characters he burns bursts into flame (yelling) oh god he rolled something (singing) it's a good vibration which teeth began to grow the buck teeth or the canines we should go to the twitch set fine we'll leave him what the fuck i'll actually use my heightened senses i see hunger roll is perception plus investigation liam's whispering and sam's talking in a normal voice they're saying if things go pear-shaped they're going to fuck us and take care of each other we've been to the front door we've been to the bullpen we've been to the server room and there's that area beyond the twitch stage that i never go into you all died so fast yeah cloaked_roamer can we make our way back to the twitch stage (laughs) oh no it's all upstairs some people know this actually definitely the safest way back to the twitch stage is through the nerdist office sam you should lead us just right through this long passageway can i do the same oh three successes take a red die three successes you got distracted you're left behind so what's the versus mean so this is the intelligence one and that's two successes and the willpower is two successes and a failure but not a red it's four successes hey man you are actually the person i'm most concerned about so you stay close to me i'll keep you safe look what i found through the nerdist office nothing let's go let's keep going to the twitch stage wired it doesn't really work none of the laptops worked you were playing with nothing okay this is obviously some sort of puzzle right i would high-five you right now a heart a sun a face a cross in a circle in the circle or-- if you're a vampire yeah those are a problem test-tube babies when she stood in the sun did anything happen why don't you take the stake that we were given and stab the heart with it okay so heart and stake not cohesive that's true should we check the little prop closet can we turn the light on i hit the switch i do have heightened senses do i smell anything coming from this room nothing tasty or spicy or interesting i mean spicy is the wrong word it's always spicy in there does it smell delicious you guys are okay here looking for rats right i'm going to go with liam chris arcade i'm standing behind liam holding the prop knife to the rest of the room is there anybody moving towards liam what are you doing are we eating people what's happening is there a little coagulant in liam's spit at least i know they do so liam and i make our way out are we sharing with the others what just happened laura and we canvassed the offices and found-- yeah i found this dagger it's not super sharp but-- yeah did you find anything out about the puzzle ooh wait a minute mercer died by the sun right don't we have his ashes in the power rangers helmet i pour the ashes of mercer onto the sun square silver chalice you have the silver chalice holy fuck take notes plus matt key's head was in the office i don't see any other clear connections how about we continue reconning the bottom of this floor so who's going to take the audio booth you go in the very back i'll take the audio booth who wants the three bathrooms what are you going to go i'm the closest so i'll go into the recording booth area well it's locked so-- it's pretty solid with a fire door well let me try it can i back up and try to run through the door so that loads me up pretty good that's a serious door yeah it's no joke that is a ton of success that's five successes and no failures it really is yeah yeah right in the doorway with my heightened senses can i see anything in the darkened room amy josie jody sorry are you guys okay yeah i broke the door can i come in the room okay i walk in the room a little bit i'm still holding a giant sword i don't oh shit i was like i know this fucking game can i tuck the sword behind my back real quick it's not for you so i'm in the little engineering room right is the booth clear is there anything in there you're sure do you mind if i look stay right where you are please don't move can i walk over to the door and look through and see what's in the booth nothing not even food or drinks laura come in here oh shit can anybody hear me yeah that wasn't that loud can i try to open the booth door can i peek my head in and look behind the door check the corners just make sure it's food and drink can i use my aura perception to see if there is anything else in the room it says hunger roll perception plus empathy minus manipulation plus willpower no versus manipulation versus plus willpower let me get a notion of how amy is feeling since jody is just writing she's on the other side so i roll three of these right three successes no failures manipulation plus willpower liam and amy i'm going to ask you to move back into the booth until we can make sure it's more safe can you tell me what you've seen and what you were hiding from we've seen the vacant eyes and mouths as well we put down two ourselves they laughed afterwards that's really disturbing okay i can't promise that it's safe outside of this room and i'm sorry i broke the door will you just wait inside the booth that's my normal knock but okay that sounds fair enough can i make a look around the room before i leave for anything that might be used as a weapon it's pretty bare right i'll pick up the door back out of the room and pull it back there with the handle yeah that's a great question ivan amy damion-- what from where yep should've taken your head out of your ass let's go quit blaming other people for your weakness cleanly does blood explode fragments amy fragments are you marking it off i really do yeah (laughs) yes oh shit how loud that's-- i mean you're way back there i do have heightened senses can i hear her i mean if you want to be a big girl about it (laughs) this has been going on for a while i'll say i pulled from the middle before and it was the void ooh like a surgeon i've made my way back to the back at this point hey hey ivan that's fun i gather you did yeah how bad could it be you know what ivan i'm a fan of card games i am i haven't i'm a fan of card games i hate to rush into anything too hastily yeah you don't look so great maybe we'll check out the rest of this floor real fast and then i'll come back do you need us to send in chris or arcade fair enough sam yeah laura why don't you stand up and come with me and we'll come back is that right ivan's here and has electrical powers how many chairs are there of the three of us only two others can play you draw a card she drew a card and learned something i don't know given my general feeling of our environment i think almost all this shit's fucked up just a fair bit of sprinkling of that just about everywhere i look yeah i think so that's a good idea actually sam why don't you go snag-- max max is back in the office he's wearing a drink me sign why don't you go snag max oh two of them max sit down at the table now before we leave i would like to see a card drawn yeah max pull a card what's upstairs max beast-like max the last thing we remember is leaving after the last game how long have you been here when i look at ivan does he look disappointed or pleased with the outcome of this card pull all right max come with us i thought that might be happening yeah i'll tell you what max sit tight we'll be back for you ivan we'll try and find you another player i mean he has a good point tell him to pick another card you're right you're right sam i mean you had the inspiration one of us should pick a card it's you yeah as long as max is at the table how does max look you're fast as shit can i run over to max and check his pulse with my fingers on his carotid we were going to get fucking knowledge first we were supposed to get knowledge max died for nothing he was already up out of the chair you do i like the impulse to violence is he bleeding profusely you know what they say about shit that doesn't bleed ivan my wife is very careful about these things you try to screw over your-- ivan are you like us can i go over to max's corpse and pat down his pockets to see if he's carrying anything cool damn it max so aside from upstairs we know pretty much everything i make my way out of that room occult two successes what you needed i'll take the cage and open it up there's a steak in there is it a real steak or a rubber steak i was going meat steak i will take that stake and i will also take-- wait can i take my shirt off-- taliesin liam and and can i throw the shirt over the cross to try and pick it up yeah when my shirt is off does my skin sparkle at all oh god you look handsomer does she gain an additional blood die or anything what did you find babe what did you find but what did you find up there you found a book what does it say or we could try and solve this puzzle sam and i will make our way out to the puzzle laura where are you going upstairs is dangerous in case it's dangerous why don't we try and solve the puzzle first see what happens i'll take the cross covered with my t-shirt and without touching it dump it on the lower right-hand corner of the circle don't you need that to eat more disgusting rats with the whole time no have you try the book okay fair enough i also have a fair amount of hunger so between chris audrey and arcade should we call dibs they have a sign around their neck that says drink me it says drink me how about laura checks out the scuttling well i just want to make sure that we're safe so much undying love yeah give it a look i'll be right behind you is this warcraft sword made of silver or anything that was the fart liam are we calling that a performance small talk and then business do we hear a commotion can we hear any commotion don't look at us follow your heart (laughing) for your strangulation from the where other end the front of the building bipedal wait let's try and communicate three successes and two fails one of which is red another wits just wits they're all red that's a success a ten and a one the wolf with the tattoos and the other one with the shaved sides i don't know how to burn will but i'll do whatever i'll add athletics come on athletics five successes and one red failure what are you talking about that's so funny he kind of said something similar to me can i use my aura perception to understand what liam is doing it says interplay of colors in an aura provides insight into the subject's emotions okay you have to roll manipulation plus willpower versus my perception plus empathy four successes it means insight into his emotions motives and nature i'd like to know why he's asking everyone to protect him you're asking my wife to look out for you if it comes down to it what about me right yeah makes sense where are we can we take a look around i'll use my heightened senses to-- fucking don't jump out and scare me i will attack whoever comes out here if you jump out on me it's not going to go well for that person which way did you go to the left oh you went to the right oh we recognize a few of the corpses i'll make my way toward the command center where all the computers and tricasters yeah i was entranced i keep going up more the person that i can't see hello excuse me we just made our-- do we recognize his face that is two successes of three dice i just rolled academics nothing else i'm sorry to interrupt you are you responsible for the puzzle lock on the door my name is travis-- pleasure and you are the gary gygax thanks liam we found ourselves in a bit of a situation do you happen to know what's going on around here is there anyone else in this studio at the moment outside forgive me this is all very new to me but isn't the sun up outside right sam liam laura mr gygax i'm not really sure what comes next can you tell us a little bit about what we have to look forward to he turned to ash in the sun yeah unfortunately-- matthew mercer opened a curtain near the front of the building and was struck by a ray of sunlight is that not reversible it's not just matt i think it's past that a little marisha turned to mushroom there was tea apparently and she had some was he calling us-- dunked on by gary gygax posterized the burn is real sunbeam what happens in 60 seconds we would love to sign whatever it is we're very particular about the metallic colors it's right over by the computers now mr gygax there's really no need to grow shit out of your hands i merely want to sign whatever-- what do you have for me to sign i think that will be fine i grab the vecna statue you don't happen to have a pen on you do you where no he said there was a studio downstairs we run down the tunnel gary does or matt does i take the vecna statue and i go ah i have not killed any humans yet what that's five you were great that's right if you haven't tried it give it a try
