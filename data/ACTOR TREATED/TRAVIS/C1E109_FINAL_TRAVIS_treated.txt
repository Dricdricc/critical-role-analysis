of a nice way to use these and i slide one between each of my fingers and i hold it up (shink) okay back in the bag of holding no i haven't been biggened for a while oh wait by the way i believe you said that if i successfully did all of these trammels that you had something for me thought i wouldn't remember did you (laughter) this is weird war room we're going down to the war room which is a sand pit yeah that's me yeah you pranked his ass and he caught the bug (laughter) i don't know what that is yep taco i don't know a lot of big words but i feel like i need a little bit of clarification just for the record i had no doubts about where that conversation was going none you have a deal i don't know how or when we are going to pull this off but if you don't make time-- fuck it it's tonight (laughter) nope me neither we never have those so listen maybe while we're eating some of those shitty salads that this fucking place makes now you can drizzle it on the top or does he have to drink it with a drink who do we make him fall in love with i fucking love it (laughter and cheering) yeah but look the hunter does not go after its prey in an isolated environment the hunter finds him in his natural habitat let him roam free i say (laughter) well look before the rest of the group starts wondering what we're doing in the war room let's go back up and whenever your sneaky ass thinks it's appropriate you (drip) in his drink how about that i do i know that part and we head back to the group (yells) who wants a drink (laughter) (clears throat) scanlan man great teamwork today everyone really please no it's not is it really we fucked up oh man so we rest and then we go hunting or do we try and rally allies ooh wait first things first do we know where he is don't you have the ability to like-- so we should rest and head to vasselheim scanlan where are you sleeping tonight do we need to post guards outside (laughs) it'll be great we rest and then we go thank you i don't have to kill you now (applause) 'night yeah he hasn't obviously gotten there right where to in vasselheim up and out to it up the volcano up the water-- wanted to talk that one out the trial forge no one's going to even notice me yeah they were ringing the bells and running around and getting prepared and stuff yeah and if for some reason somebody's like that guy punched me in the face we'll just punch them man i'm fucking slick right but we can only either spread the word that we're going to resist or spread the word that it's about time to fight we can only do one or the other pike yeah (whispering) we got the stuff scaldseat no keyleth hey whoa take it down with respect there are those among us that can tell where he is moving we will i guess my only question is do we wait for him to come to us or do we try to take the fight to him yeah he's been spying on us for quite some time now little shit really right now we're missing one she's a moron no fuck that we are not shopping i'll quit i'll leave what is wrong with you first shopping and now we give up what the fuck (shouting) what the fuck (laughter) j'mon i'm coming with you these people have lost their fucking minds yeah quitter oh my god well look if there are undead cannibal dwarves or whatever in the crypts don't we need clerics to deal with them it's the best we can do all right so what the crypts or the silted veil so the crypts (shouting) fuck yeah buddy (cheering) you as well that holy avenger getting some action lately god i love kima so much i feel pretty encouraged i don't know why say it a couple more times these words are all great and everything but it's not going to change that we're going to have to make it up when we get there so why don't we go ahead and fight this fucking fucker (cheering) well we're really in for a fucking fight huh when the game gives you eight superiors what direction is vasselheim from us now anybody else think we should fucking hop on a big-ass brass dragon and try and catch him before he gets there what are we going to do here there's nothing to do here either that or he goes and sacks the city and we're like what does this tree tell me about this area (laughter) yeah we're super lucky and it's just a turtle (laughter) (laughs) how much is it holes hey you got that big fucking turtle you wanted at least six times if it bleeds we-- we're going to die (laughter) can you detect if we're making up any ground on your target i'm talking to you vax oh my fucking god just a note these were made from the heart of a felled titan i don't think it's that one that was sarcasm but yeah oh yeah beat him up with his heart (stammering) do i notice anything another note to be clear these were carved from the heart stone of a ruined earth primordial when they're doing their thing they make me resistant to fire cold and lightning damage so that's good or destroy the city and replace it with that one listen i know it seems really dire right but the only other option besides attacking it in my mind is trying to get its attention maybe lead it away from vasselheim it's all right buddy i know we bamfed out here but do we have any idea how much time we have how far away from vasselheim we are don't make me make it no i'm ready let's go negative two (laughter) okay we've got time not a lot but it's like godzilla right it's like (groaning thud) i mean if he starts skipping we're fucked we'd be in the air and not all of us are so awesome in the air that's enough three and four i can't add invisible or change us one or the other a grape juice bottle (screams) six natural 20 that sounds like us
