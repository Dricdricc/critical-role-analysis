makes tea out of dead people i know like it sounds how did the vision of these islands come to you the stormlord you commune with the stormlord the stormlord that's significant we have missed you we don't mean to pry interact with that fucking weasel tide peak it's midday this guy's like fucking money tourists nott why don't you get up on a table and get everyone's attention and ask the room if they know anything about algar everybody your attention please (claps) every fucking last one of you we've threatened them with goblin tactics i love that monologue midnight lepual i mean it couldn't hurt to do a drive-by and just see if we could see anything i thought they were too i thought the entrance was underwater well yeah everybody can swim are you strong enough to pull us up got to start somewhere yeah but i mean at least if we're heading towards the docks where the entrances are i'm sure more people in that area will know-- should i secure us a rowboat pretty sure i can is there a ship shack or something that would lease vessels it's an official term guys 13 old timer i'm sorry to bother you i don't see a mariner's office around here is that your rowboat fjord jimmy absolutely little bit little bit my friends here were hoping to explore the coast a bit and if i could put some coin in your pocket i was wondering if you would mind parting with your vessel here for a little bit tales of the worst greenhorns you've ever worked with that is most kind of you we are much obliged is it big enough for all of us actually that's not a terrible idea i was going to volunteer to be pulled by-- it's tied up to the dock caleb seems very comfortable since it only fits a few folks i-- no you have to come with i was going to volunteer to trail behind the armor helps oh that's right what you get smaller what do you mean is that a disguise self thing does it change your physical weight and stuff oh it is a firbolg thing well fuck that's awesome i think you'll be fine actually if jester and i are trailing behind some people aren't scared of the water nott it's actually quite safe look nott and i reach down into the water and touch it with my hand there is absolutely noth-- (yells) i just fall right into the water just churning bubbles and stuff i pop back up see totally fine you'll never know have you been here a few days already oh well somebody's got to ask if anybody has any idea where the entrance to the-- the entrance i'm in the water with you i'm covered in armor okay price of a good joke i'm afraid are you knowledgeable about the entrance to the sluice cove sluice weave well thanks yeah he was telling the truth because i know sailors why don't you threaten him with a trove of goblins around the wharf while-- is there anyone else on the docks anyone else that we can see are there any crownsguard-- or i'm going to say zol-eezzo zolezzo thank you hey beau you know those people skills we've been working on you want to ask the zolezzo if they mind telling

around just make sure there's no-- anything coming around 17 go yasha go yasha go 40 down 40 across 30 up i think that's a good place to start however if you wanted to test your strength i would be very careful remember it was an intake so you could get down there and all of a sudden the suction and the water would make it very difficult for you to back out i'm just saying it could be unpredictable it could turn on turn off okay who is going down yeah it does what about the damn puppy beau's holding onto a lead line big breath (deep inhale) i'll take it oh shit really fuck did not think that was going to work damn david blaine up in this bitch make a summer home underwater my swim speed is my regular speed i'm staying at the mouth with the other end of the rope you guys are going in that's why i'm at the mouth of the-- they can just come up it yeah yeah since i saw them go up i'm going to swim forward to where i saw them disappear and seeing the grate gone i'm going to come back out and make my way up towards the boat to let them know they made it through yeah they made it through the second grate oh why am i even coming back (inhale) (splash) the bottom rope is

your back god damn it yeah okay i'm a little shook it's cool i'm going to use my speed to just peek in the doorway just to get a visual on the hallway i don't actually need to see them i'm going to use my last of two spell slots to cast hunger of hadar 20 feet into the hallway with just the brim-- just so it gets the-- yeah so i pop in the doorway and i reach up and grab a little bit of reality and i tear a black hole in the hallway yup you ain't going nowhere motherfucker everything in it is black so they're blinded they can't hear anything 15 dex save or they take 2d6 cold damage six seven so seven points yep algar does yeah nope yes-- yeah i'm going to use the rest of my movement to just come back out here like the flowers she collects nice every little bit counts we don't i don't think he was clear on that and when you drown do you then have three death saves or-- or are you dead or just two rounds in for two more rounds dude i was sweating i forgot something when algar starts his turn you take 2d6 cold damage so he was-- yeah he'll be at two instead of one i did 2d6 for both of the bodyguards five points of acid damage sorry full damage full damage they do take-- if they do their dexterity saving throw they take half again it says that if you-- yeah their speed is halved it's a big ass sphere yeah nope nope just blind e'rrybody blind okay oh nice he's currently face

still see the water thing and i'll send two eldritch blasts toward the water where clay is i don't give a fuck about algar no okay because you're in it but if i hit the wave it'll hit them let's-- let's not do that i'm going to drop hunger of hadar and i'm going to send two eldritch blasts at both of the bodyguards that is a 12 for the first one and 16 on the second one nice that is ten points of damage five ten 15 and i'll use the rest of my 30 feet to get as close as i can yeah yes yep i have a question for you after her turn let's think about what's important here i have a question so it says no action when you slay a humanoid you can cause its spirit to rise as a specter that gains three temporary hit points it says no action once a long rest so can i do that for the bodyguard that i just slayed i'll just reach forward and say let none pass i didn't know it was going to do that do not move (high-pitched) come back to the water park yes yeah fucking true lies (explosion) no the szundie fuck ooh yeah you should just kill him because he's never going to work again what is there to live for ooh that's a good roll not what you want to hear i look down at algar and say i'm only going to say this once unless you want to end up like your friend here i'm going to need that bracelet i'm going to cut his hand off and take the bracelet no i'll take the bracelet off i'm going to cut his hand off (cheers) with advantage this will be fine 17-- that's even better 21 drift up towards us not if i put that fucking slap bracelet on
