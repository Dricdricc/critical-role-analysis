it's called the underdark plus you guys were super happy about what you found i think i wrote five weeks in a row on my legal pad i don't trust clarota i don't trust clarota it was pike scanlan and grog were the ones who were like that's a good name we'll keep it that way oh grog has no idea yeah i mean grog's idea of family i think growing up was just his father stonejaw strongjaw (laughter) to be fair i didn't make that-- did you make that did i i did make that name up matt and yeah that's right yeah that's right on course that's right you dealt with him when i wasn't there that's right thanks for that he was a bitch (laughter) i don't know what he just said liam would have probably killed that-- (laughter) yeah that's right you went invisible and we were like (screams) every week we'll get it all right that just blows my mind good question damn that's what you get for having all of those fucking dice time to cull the herd fill in the story from what happened before that wow well mike that was a pretty hot moment shaving ole groggy's half-beard while he was asleep that was a new level the mechanical pencil bends to rage really easily that kicked off months of me trying to get you back actually it was a new echelon a new world order had started that's when i realized how damn slippery you are because i could never get my damn hands on you to do some shit i kept trying to pants him or trip him or whatever but i kept failing it was pretty gnarly could you not feel the 100 degrees kelvin pouring off of my person really we shouldn't have killed them (high-pitched voice) i will speak with this-- (high-pitched voice) hi-ya what the fuck man the power of christ compels you get out of here oh man i didn't even know what a sentient weapon was i had never even heard of that he just described it as some big gorgeous greatsword and i was like i can wield that i'll take it and percy's reaction of reading the first few lines of the card and showing a little dismay having just been cured of his current curse i was like give it to me it'll be fine so when matt started talking it was a total shock reading it was only half of the story what did we have to do identify or we had to do something else-- yeah the rest of that card is super important that's a big part of it so i think he was enjoying this new friend that talked to him and helped him shish-kebab people really well threw it at the-- and we almost got rid of tary ain't none of us coming in after you keyleth see i heard a great comparison on el twitter which was the game of thrones fight between the mountain and the sand viper staying on the outside and all of that stuff until i get a hold of you and then i squish your head like a pumpkin we saved him when did something being personal ever kept you from snagging something you used it a billion times (as grog) it is not okay if she gets knocked out ah no kaiju no nothing growing out of the tree you almost desecrated a grave ashley can't let it go yes he is real i had no idea i just know i wanted to face him head-on to start with even if it was going to go south super fast like it did i just wanted to get an idea and i was woefully unprepared especially when matt was like you realize that he is not taking as much damage as you think he should i was like oh shit it was nice that everybody had taken up positions and everything and then i knew it would be a good chance to just call in arms and just trying to set a little bit of a trap but he got to face him on his terms and that's all i really wanted the rolls were not happening he pinned me on a spike disarmed me i only hit two times out of five turns yeah it was not going well and we were learning what the knuckles did i remember matt saying you remember seeing kevdak reached out and crushed a guy's skull with his bare hands and i had no idea he would enlarge that the bloodaxe would also add all of this stuff and i was just like oh god what did i step into the sword is a gift how is that bad (incredulous) oh you got it oh the old digital device oh my god you're getting laid tonight by yourself you can't open it unless you die ashley did you feel bad for reading that early everything that we had life finds a way what does that mean 86 rages dang planetar that hurts use your words no sam and so the only people in the room that know the answer to this is matt and i and the answer is no (gasping) he has gentle tendencies underneath i think he just wanted to let you guys wonder for five years what's the difference i think it came out during previous talks and the show i was there because i'm super important (laughter) and i really tried i don't know why we're a bunch of big brains what a dick his life was already fucked no i was not mad at-- or grog was not mad at scanlan until he came back with the illusion and the wearing the disguise and everything it was instantaneous rage from pike and i a that he had to pretend b we had been worried about him and then c brought this jackass that was like a half-orc imitation of grog an idiot a barbarian and grog had the biggest jealousy issue of all time i was ready to pick scanlan up and just smash his brain into jelly and just paint on the wall yeah i don't know anything just (noisy crying) tears luck i cast something oh enlarge thank you i forgot yeah i had a spell we did good we didn't want to ring the dinner bell that was one thing we were trying to be as stealthy as possible interesting option though ooh between that and the one if i had punched thordak in his jewel in his chest knowing that would have shattered afterward i was like oh i've got to explore these things better why are you looking at me oh i think he just wanted to get smarter it's been 300 years oh man there was a shitload of silverware there were some candles stones i had a shitload of caltrops and handcuffs yeah the dried poo disc broke though i had a nice solid cow frisbee patty there was some armor the big black sapphire i gave to scanlan to get married to old pikey-poo with a shitload of expensive-ass bottles of wine basically a bunch of other random shit it was like a busted-up home depot at the end percy probably could've made something from it all i was just randomly collecting shit there's 10000 pieces of platinum in the bag dropping on kevdak from the necklace bar none they are hear hear yeah we get to go back to the beginning
