was going to do something else i don't think the chain's long enough 50 feet long is the chain of returning long enough to get to him (laughing) i'm going to hold off i would like to hold off and maybe he'll come closer since i seem to be an intimate sort of fellow 13 can i take that turn now now since i shook it off i'm like that's lovely and i would like to try for the first time intimidating presence on a creature within 30 feet (yells) (all laugh) 13 wisdom saving throw that's right bitch he's frightened until the end of the next turn knock it into the water let the shark

hundreds in the temple i go over to the water and scoop some and pour it over my head (all laugh) did it work presents for your friends that's a good gift i've got to pee right listen up if you have ale then you have a friend in grog strongjaw a goliath of towering height and size this barbarian has an appetite for the two great loves in his life combat women and ale (chuckle) (record scratch) wait easily the brains of the group grog is often consulted for his vast knowledge of shapes colors and (chuckle) shiny things also ale in his early years armed with his two handed great axe grog often enjoyed proving his might amongst the ranks of his family's wandering herd but after coming upon an unsuspecting elderly gnome in the woods he objected to the killing of such an innocent life a creature of impulse grog felt only pity for this-- well this terrified little thing and his disobedience cost him dearly (weapon crack) beaten bloody and banished by the herd leader his uncle kevdak grog was abandoned and left to die exiled from his herd it was then that the relative of the very gnome he fought to save saved him it was the kindness of a gnome cleric named pike that healed grog bringing him back from death's edge and they have remained close friends ever since most nights grog can be found challenging entire taverns to wrestling matches ha or accompanying scanlan to the nearest house where you pay for lady favors also ale gifts gifts for your friends and family your pets while they've been sleeping i took my axe-- oh no i thought we rested i start digging a ditch with my axe in the sand don't worry about it to inspire keyleth with her scrying spell i hop in the ditch i've been digging and start going look i can do it too (laughs) and i start paddling in the ditch is that inspiration are we hitting each other now could you tell me what a beholder is first because i don't know with finger eyes worst possible scenario imaginable yeah he's got lots of teeth let's brush 'em not the beholder among other things it seems like he's super strong it is glass on the top so we could try to sunlight the head up how would we free the prisoners first of all eff you brass cross yeah it took months we're also forgetting that the second that he sees us or we get close enough he could control all of our minds that sounds awesome let's go there yeah i like that let's go take over a little shanty-town it'll be a little victory we'll take over the shanty-town no i don't either yeah baby steps i've got a big axe i'll paddle the boat towards the island i've been practicing in the sand to impress keyleth working on the elevator i haven't figured it out yet because i don't know what that is so who's in the boat with me percy keyleth pike and trinket so we start paddling in the boat yeah we'll take kima (singing) love boat watch your mouth that's squid for no but you're on the boat yeah we're already paddling the boat's going too we're fucking fast oh yeah

little scratchy would you care for some ale why i will not forget that i rolled 15 holy shit we're getting better plus my inspiration from paddling (laughs) do i see him can i do a simple recognize

having a motherfucking aneurysm oh back in dallas like right out of high school we were in the same talent agency with the silent extra talk [no audio] we thought we were superstars this is the greatest job ever she totally fell for me (laughing) yeah no joke do you ever want to be a player and not a dm zac what was the most recent picture you shared with the community somebody is asking to see it or asking me to ask you to see it yeah like 40 years pike does scanlan have a shot how did you and trinket become friends did you eat the cub oh the cub is trinket there we go watch this thing light up stephen colbert there's a laura emote if grog comes across his uncle yes he would definitely want to kill him bad relationship with his son yeah my cousin let him go yeah well my childhood affection was the only thing that let him live but if we see him again maybe a different outcome why are you asking the dm don't put ideas in his head in this campaign you don't know what happened when i went through the portal a barbarian never kisses and tells we did summon a pony and chop its head off and smeared its gore all over us we had a dried poo chunk disgraceful or amazing minutes after that was pretty bad he needed to be motivated he was a little clumsy but he got through didn't he yeah and then i slept on the couch for two nights (all laugh) tiefling what's a tiefling i think this might have been covered but how did the campaign start is trinket's intelligence higher than grog's no okay it's not yeah suck it best and worst (laughs) does your full name fit into a tweet don't let them have it (laughs) did you ever consider doing a longer episode what's that matt sam and why do you want us to die what a shitty question he lunged and-- tell them scanlan's never killed anything (laughs) when are you guys going to do a drunk episode you looked excited so why did scanlan take a dump on that guest room bed (laughing) has the worst day there's a video of it you went under the table i pick mercer nobody else can take it you're many characters is it oh keyleth fucking burt reynolds burt reynolds the customs officer we haven't been to gilmore's they were pine cones you had a good initiative yeah you are fickle on your dice though come on we intimidated this-- i love it nothing zero nada oh yeah we've got to go on honesty hour now give them the whole shebang ride the feels we got the last six guards that are totally awesome baratheon yeah give us something you're in love with the dread pirate roberts were you guys ever playing during the d&d scare of the '80s whatever that means no we're all much younger important how sexy is grog as sexy as you want him to be can we have a kima wedding i'm working on her oh yeah you and a wiener onscreen (laughs) do you design specific things for an hourglass are there particular scenarios that require it somebody asked how i became a goliath because it's not an official race in the book is it not an official race now it is i think i asked matt what the bigger creatures were in the world and he said orcs and other things and he also said there were goliaths that were half and half and i was like can i be that he was like sure that was a thing i asked marisha once during our first game was wait i can do whatever i want kind of you can try how do you handle percy crafting things no we thought maybe one or two things and then alcohol made its way in somebody asked if you accept fan art would you also accept someone making fight music for the game no personalities are fucking great people asked if this will be on video on demand or if people miss it how do they see it wow
