we play dungeons & dragons (screaming) i'm sorry that was not supposed to be for the public that was something that i sexted to liam it was not supposed to be released i can't unsee that i am doing the forward lean all of our pages are blank where in the world is-- no disadvantage the whole game we forged those documents right what was the ship's name okay just checking that makes sense that's right ignus i will mask of many faces and give myself a bald head with a nice little red flavor saver right here and very expensive red and gold-looking flowy stuff not ostentatious or attracts attention at all someone might try to kidnap you this is the balleater it's been quite a while since we were in nicodranas i'm captain tristan we will probably be here for i don't know an extended period of time we might make our way up into the empire do you have any extended rentals on the dock here oh yes thank you orly i'm so forgetful yes be well orly carry on that is very thoughtful of you thank you access the memory banks (warbling) i think caleb had something to say sure i'll go to blacksmith with caduce north of the dunrock mountains would you say that's fucking way up there we are here and we got to go there hundred miles so one two-- in a straight line-- three four five six seven eight hundred miles if we fly i mean truthfully yeah you could yeah then it'd be beau-bo-bows bo now that is something beau's bo's bow ugh is it bigger you assaulted a seven-year-old i thought we were playing if it's pink i kill it shame on you sure unless you want some privacy long established yeah i'll drop i think we're good very gracious of you hurried circumstances i think would sum it up we did have to borrow a boat a ship that's true we'll be landlocked for a while are you familiar with darktow isle your daughter was very brave our adventure took us over there yeah i don't think the plank king leaves very often without a doubt our travels took us far and wide and we are all the more excited to be back on land and to explore this beautiful city that most of us haven't had a chance to really peek about very much that sounds like what we've gathered before interesting i think that's where we want to go next you notice as you walk towards it and walk further away it looks like it grows and shrinks well i was going to say like a telescope you know it goes up and down it doesn't lay over on its side and shrink up and then extend itself i'm sorry yeah we got sea dementia it's really rampant we rip it out of her hand what's the first chapter say jester makes a valid point we actually probably should go first thing in the morning so we're all nice and rested and i would enjoy a nice meal i dig it may the paint be with you i'm sure there are some stores that might have healing potions and other things we could stock up on before the sun goes down and they close up right might as well take a gander ms ruby do you have any sorts of shops you might recommend that would have stuff of that nature that's beautiful i'm sure either of those will do nicely shall we a little light shopping yeah maybe not into the stores with things that break and then we have to pay for it he's certainly your dog jester it's your call yes and bitch (laughter) the seafloor bounty is over by the-- i don't think so i'll buy one a real spitfire i got a feeling she had more fight in her than you'd think so before the sun goes all the way down-- i was going to say let's go look at the tower everything's chill let's make our way over to the what was it mm-hmm sure do if i look up is that balcony that we saw before about 15 20 feet above our heads did what make it appear and disappear do a quick speed round and we walk around the perimeter looking out for fucking windows and balconies and we meet around the other side oh how high up 50 to 60 yeah that's too high i mean i can get up there but it makes a real big noise i mean i don't know what's inside there yep and it would hurt a lot i imagine just from my simple knowledge of basic physics yep but hey there's nothing that says if we come back in the morning that son of a bitch might be in a different place i'll bet you crackfire slopdolly (spits) yeah pick wood there's no way that's not possible and it just looks like it grows and shrinks and grows and shrinks maybe i can't get up there without making a real loud ruckus so tomorrow morning's our best bet what about the tree what about the tree but how does that work immediately yeah that's a shitty plan well there's no rule that says don't ride up a tree and jump on a fucking balcony try it can i turn around and look at the storefront-- unless something happens when she knocks i turn around and look at the storefronts are there any that are obviously still open right across from maybe that are facing the can i just jog over and try and find somebody that might be working a desk over there what knockers young frankenstein just to be clear i'm at the fish mart i'm at the fish mart you don't see a particular door that appears every couple of days or is there a pattern yeah all right you're an observant one anything else that you can share that might help me understand this structure more pigeons really unsanitary for these fish how much i'll flip him four silver wrapped in the paper stuff right or is it just the fish oh thank you very appreciative you have yourself a fancy fucking evening success yeah it's a red snapper anybody a fan oh good what are you talking about haven't we been through enough that the jokes are unnecessary at this point what little guy i grab the snapper by the tail and i start gesturing let me get this straight i went to ask questions you knocked and some goblin came out of what the balcony and started answering your questions and then disappeared is it still there you motherfuckers i don't need this shit i toss it like seaworld ducey did this happen really and you just knocked and a door appeared it just seemed so fantastic no i don't think that's it let's not do that so we come back in the morning-- what information uk'otoa uh-huh we walk in and we say are you missing anything that might be okay though jester what if we give it back and he answers us some amazing questions or-- well maybe we don't offer that right away yeah and we really should go back and get some good dinner and some sleep so we can get back here toot-sweet run double-dash back towards the wizard's tower i want to see the inside uk'otoa yeah you better watch yourself i'd like to know what he knows if he knows more about uk'otoa or maybe how to counteract him maybe he's up for a friendly conversation i don't think we're your average fisherman i mean we've seen some shit yep of the utmost importance check off a bunch of boxes yeah fair enough you're there so who did the knocking last time did you do anything special can you replicate it today then get after it power-walking grabbed her elbow damn it we do have earl we also have news of grave import we all bum-rush it no i'm good i'm not fucking with this one that's true you plus one three notes are ask about uk'otoa i trust you make good decisions yep what is it you've got some high charisma right yeah go in go that's your fate yes good excellent (nervous laugh) fuck a bright green dragon did that door just fucking open (falchion summoning) jester nott fjord caleb i'm fjord i'm assuming he's talking about the happy fun ball i have no objection is there anything that we can do for you in the short term well i think if he knew that it helps us on our exploits-- which thereby helps him i mean we are sharing aren't we (singing) give us a helping hand yeah now (laughter) in the hands of an assassin yeah she talks to him and you die just him and caleb right hey caleb what happened in there (laughter) you expose yourself she has a good point i thought we'd hurry back so that we could check sounds like a deal we go through the wuyun gates trostenwald zadash are we going to felderwin village yeah i mean it'd be alfield really zadash is west of felderwin yeah trostenwald by way of alfield and then we'll take the rillway road to felderwin it's a straight shot of course do it nope i think this is just a regular cart how many words that's 22 friend of mine vandran how do you know that is this the same as jester talking to the traveler you hear from the wildmother you asked about him for me he was making amends thank you off the path i'm trying to sleep what are y'all doing aw fuck veering right underground were they able to repel these attacks felderwin indeed we should be on our way a bit quicker than we thought i'm afraid good to see you do you have any deposited checks or bank statements well done virtuous indeed thank you bryce thank you we should move quickly nott give us a hyah there we go the rillway road and we're going to get to a bridge before we hit felderwin you said they look like someone we met previously was the blue flash from him apparating yes we are nope i get two letters in and that's all she wrote sam and lady ve derogna lasagna what is it vess-- nope not there yeah lady vess derogna that's a 19 is there another way out of here second set of stairs into the house yeah i'll search with him 21 and a picture and a picture we have a tripod hundred percent we sent a message once is it worth trying it again anything else in this room that we need to turn over before we get out put everything back in the chest and bring it with us put the chest in the haversack how was it locked from the outside you didn't see anything when you sat in the chair right why the chair why in middle of the room why lock it we need to not use that dodecahedron anymore you could send them to alfield if you wanted i'm sure bryce could take care of them if you don't feel comfortable here you should tell them-- worst case scenario they could go south you could send them to nicodranas i'm sure it is i don't know how far or fast this is moving why the chair though
