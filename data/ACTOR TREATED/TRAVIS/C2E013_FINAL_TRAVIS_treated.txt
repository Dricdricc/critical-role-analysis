don't have to get him out we just have to give him the chance to get out i think we should do that he's given us everything we removed his armor we should give him something to leave in so he's not just walking buck through the city no he just said he's going to kill us if we don't give it to him really why don't we leave it up to him we untie him he comes at us bros we take him down we're giving him a chance at freedom he doesn't get the beacon he'll come after it i know yeah let's do that no can anybody else concentrate on it agreed i won't speak for anybody in the group but i'm not taking his life so if someone feels motivated i'll just walk over this way and i start walking back the way we came well i don't know what it is and if you're not going to look what use do we have for it and what do we do with him and it would endear us to the city i'm good either way leylas krynn fair call i'm all right (whispering dramatically) yes he's going to take it unless you really want to huh do you do you open the door (singing) take a look laura & we're giving him everything but the black boots the sword and the sheath and his money yeah we gave him the armor yeah not the boots not the sword not the gold yeah we should get back to the song and supper inn song and supper see if dolan’s there we are short one you know end it yeah ulog oh yeah well in the fray of the richter coming in he lunged at her and put a little gem in her mouth they exploded we've got to get out of here yeah we retreat back the way we came be quiet we're being followed are you drunk nott we should stop by the song & supper inn see if we see a friendly face yeah i don't know if you saw but his eyes and his nostrils flared when we mentioned ulog i have a feeling our small dwarf friend was involved in quite a bit more than we were aware of yeah yeah down in the basement when we were talking we didn't get it yet even more reason to find dolan it was part of the pot yeah how many gold is a platinum marisha and damn i am 13 oh my god we're going to try and get it now we had it in our hands what is the matter with you yeah just full ah does that make it drop (stabbing sound) molly and i are running after caleb since we saw the other guard nein sorry molly and i are trucking after where caleb just went through a lead box let's split the party it's always the best idea no but seriously we don't need everyone for both yeah how about beau and i will go to the song & supper inn and we'll meet you at the leaky tap song & supper nobody here sure feels like it doesn't it not that we're looking for them we're-- i don't feel very well and i don't have money for a proper physician i'm sure we could find someone else yeah have a good night yeah want to check his house you feeling that double oh good that's good i just-- damn that was impressive yeah beast mode you want to go by dolan's house and a 16 yeah well i'll go up and knock you want to go around back yeah i knock and say it's fjord with the mighty nein open up yeah it's all right take a breath is there a back door to this place beau's going to be coming around the back make sure she gets let in you're leaving why take a deep breath friend listen ulog is dead he sacrificed himself in a very brave moment he threw himself at the richter threw a gem in her mouth and exploded in a fireball listen i think-- i think-- i don't think any of this leads back to us we still have to complete our mission we got to make sure that lord sutan is implicated in this but right now we're clean the richter's gone you have a chance to ascend to her seat wasn't that the plan stop don't be a coward in this moment if you want to help this city if you want to help make the empire better you're going to have to stand strong a little risk is going to come with this job especially in that position you knew the risk going into this didn't you to put your money and your lives at risk 15 i understand fortunately in this situation you don't have much to lie about you were here you weren't at the richter’s you weren't involved in it in any way the knights of requital are going to take the fall for this that would be the only tie-in ulog is dead you have a chance to do some real good here we'll keep an eye out i promise if anything needs to be shared between you can rely on us to pass a message are you in the house yet that's beau you love him or you hate him dolan i know horris and you both are worried we're still going to need that payment our efforts have incurred some damages anywhere you prefer is there a hiding spot fair enough we can do that beau has experience with this area i'm afraid ulog may have had a larger game to play why do you say that horris he left us in charge of finding justice for his wife and we intend to do i believe him 11 all right let's help horris get out of the city stay low stay here have a drink it’ll help with that of course we'll have to regroup and we'll get back to you as soon as we can we leave do i get anything from it you creepy bastard we got a quesadilla shady motherfuckers that cuteness man who are that not downstairs convene in the girls' room it's bound to be cleaner yeah where is caleb he's down there babysitting our item okay what spinach that's my bad yeah he did yeah we forgot to qualify that yeah jeez man no sense of humor right now he's in shock all right horris we're going to get you out of the city as soon as possible is there a destination you wanted to send him to or point him in the right direction have any spots in mind that you can lay low for a while they were understandably rattled it's understandable but dolan's going to try and stay to make the city a better place horris is going to remove a bit of the risk for himself for a bit it is lovely by the coast i think what beau is trying to say is that you've made a wise choice in removing yourself for a bit did you happen to know the owner of the leaky tap she's apparently selling it she's selling it yeah did you want to get out of town tonight or did you want to wait until the morning perhaps not at all we have room in molly and i's room yeah i'll lead horris to our room and let him get comfortable i'll be back (gravelly) red rum yeah you're going down there wow fucking pay day what kind of sword is it does it look like it has any magical aura emanating from it not officially cay-cay not to be confused with kiki what do those do molly put those boots on you get an extra spring in your step what's it do window-seal window-seal why are y'all staying in another place tonight oh because of the thing you need any help backup right nott why why are you going to-- yeah to be honest that evening started to take a turn before the richter showed up do you know caleb to be sticky-fingered like yourself well remember we were trying to leave no trace caleb was the architect of the plan and there was a scroll that looked like it might have some magic to it and he wanted to take it with we were right there at the end we were at the finish line nott it's just a little reckless wouldn't you say we're looking out for you i mean you know nott you count on caleb to keep you safe right to achieve greater things than you by yourself can achieve think how many things you could do with all of us by your side i'm not saying you don't have to be selfish and i'm not saying that you can't go after treasure and coin okay if i may thank you for sharing that nott that changes things i admit that i had the wrong idea about you two i know what it's like to feel responsible for someone nott we want to take care of caleb we do we pulled him out of that house when that fireball went off we didn't cut and run even though it might have saved our skins we care about you two i hope in time you'll learn to trust us just a little bit more maybe think about protecting us as well because you seem to do a great job taking care of caleb i appreciate that so when are you planning to go down to keep an eye on your boy nott how about you take those items to caleb and call it a vote of confidence i think he's got the point are you fucking serious natural one i'm just eating bar popcorn yeah what the fuck nope you're not there yes just wait pick up and walk i have to say it because taliesin said it (whispers) don't die oh okay a d8 right seven yeah really con modifier i just forget 11 points i'm going to see horris horris do you need an escort out of town or do you think you can find your way of course have much coin do you have on you oh you'll be fine molly molly wake up i think i'm going to escort horris out be back as fast as i can all right stay casual stay calm just turn and we're going to slowly start walking back just act normal there always is and if all else fails there's the sewers you're not opposed to getting a little dirty to get out of town are you we'll want to wait until we have more of the others just in case i'm afraid the sewers might be being cased as well so stay put for a little while longer we'll find you a quiet spot in the leaky tap but let me check with the others no we found dolan last night he's going to stay put in his house low we're going to try and assure that he's safe so that he can you know put his name up for that high-richter seat but listen the gates it's not a joke it's sealed there are crownsguard swarming all over it it seemed like they were doing personal interviews pat-downs the whole smash so even an enchantment might not hold up to scrutiny we didn't see her last night she wasn't at dolan's well she saw-- yes she did yeah perhaps indeed i was thinking that we might try and get horris out now that way if a crownsguard finds its way here-- maybe we should take him into the sewers get him out of the city i imagine indeed i did too sam and also there's the gentleman and also we need a lead box oh my god there's so much to do horris we obviously have a lot to decide on perhaps it would be better if you stayed up in the room “very sweet person” level four let's go (laughter) (computer voice) you are leaving the combat area chat's like fucking idiots the leaky nip what's it called pumat's got to have a-- have we been there yet i rolled a natural 20 i know magic some not enough dm says have you not been to the invulnerable gentleclerk (belches loudly) (laughter) to be fair he did say that pumat or the rest of the equipment let’s do it he’s pretty nice he seems like a nice guy plus we’re returning customers attacking us i think if you give him a chance he'll do you right pumat we'd like to introduce you to one of our friends this is beau pumat we came into a little extra coin recently and this is our favorite place to spend you don’t happen to have any articles of protection do you a necklace a bracelet a ring it was expensive right that sounds fine here’s ten platinum well should we go oh we're looking up something forgive me i couldn't help but wonder have you ever had a chance-- pumat prime rather-- have you had a chance to exercise your arcane abilities yeah if you wouldn't mind these are all-- what's the correct term they're all copies of this fine gentleman pumat i wanted to ask we're such fans of your store did you ever find call to i don't know use your magic for combat what led you to a store like this that's great how many years have you had this store congratulations it's really a thing shake it out of the corners of the giant flask thanks for your time pumat he's actually still here i would like it let's get that thing in its box are you fucking kidding me oh my god bestseller or used book pumat thanks for your time we will not be bothering you any longer we double dash back to the tap no why 22 plus four yeah i say that it seems like a different sort of arcana than the type that i've seen what else we got that's pretty dope pretty dope although that greatsword she has is mighty fine yeah certainly i just have a preference with mine i'm just real comfortable with it you know when you get a feel for something you don't want to change it up too much big-ass tall doc martens my initiative bonus is zero just saying (exaggerated cough) no you keep them (whispering) just smile and say thank you nott (whispering) very good so we should-- ugh just look at them we should probably do something we still have to wrap up this deception of ours you sound like the general car insurance yeah i think that's right actually i forgot that part did we plant something in lord sutan's house are they going to find the letter from-- we did i don't know if he would report a robbery if he had a rug of attacking and you triggered it we could certainly go by oh shit i forgot that's right we got paid already how much did i get paid because it was minus kara's i did mm-hmm i don't know if they'll send anything back on dolan but we should find a way to get crownsguard into lord sutan's place we can't have dolan rat on him hmm let's try that yeah let's try that yeah we fucking follow him into the room yep marisha and (shouting) insight check insight check on taliesin insight check look at taliesin right now just look at him i didn't say anything
