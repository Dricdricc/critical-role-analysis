a natural one (cheering) yeah i think we just need to get closer i remember they said they threw an explosive behind them and dropped even more so this won't be the first rock slide well let's get in there wait we're in the spiral staircase and it goes-- we can't see around the bend to how far down it goes right is it an open spiral staircase or just a wall we can only see as far up as the curves go in either direction unless it lets people know when something crosses in front of it we're going to head downwards yeah please i'm right in the middle where do you want to be that's cocked as hell why are you cupping the balls under your mouth ah i'm running yeah just things to shoot you in the fucking legs is that triangular piece of stone raised off the floor how big is it if we're just coming into the area which edge is pointing towards us the flat or the point from your brief life (whistling) going to have to get back to you perception intimidation investigation 21 oh shit so i don't know why i know this yeah it feels like the triangle is down here is anyone on the platform fuck it i'll stand up on the platform can i look down into that black hole in the center of it i have darkvision oh yeah i'll take the torch i will put my finger in the hole actually i don't know how big the hole is but i want to feel if there are any grooves on the inside or any sort of indentations i put my little pinkie in it solid walls well it's short there anything around here that looks like a staff or a pole or rod the floor around this triangle shape it's flush in the ground right there's no circle around the triangle platform so the ground's not going to move maybe the ceiling has to move right we're not going to be able to turn the floor caleb do you have anything to draw these symbols oh yeah jester please both of you yeah just to get a rendition of the ceiling in relation to the ground i think maybe we need to see where those stairs go up wait you're going to wait until she disarms the-- redemption is fucking painful you want a toe i can get you a toe ten feet ahead is fine yeah we start heading up with frumpkin ten feet in front everybody is there any sort of door at the top of the stairs that leads into this chamber or is it just open i'm walking in lifeless no let's see what's on the other side of the room first cool i start walking towards the other side of the room the little metallic glimmer that we saw can we see about a half inch in diameter would you call it these are trash urns can i try and move some of the rubble off of the bronze rod okay i think that's a 15 does it wobble does it make any noise if i swing it harder does it 17 i got a question you said ten minutes on the boat as we were moving forward ten minutes for him to cast detect magic and another ten minutes for detect magic to run out so it's been about a half an hour okay great so my armor of agathys is still up so can i bonus-action hex the glob-- the wispy thing right next to me nice great can i take swipe at it with the wastehunter blade wastehunter that is 15 to hit wow can i use all of my 30 foot walking speed to run towards the door there where we came out of that is the plan here it hits and it take ten points of cold damage beautiful i've got that gold rod by the way i'm getting the fuck out of here which means you roll with advantage but they get advantage on you plus half your barbarian level nice dude nice ugh it's in my eyebrows themostjost no i don't think so either they're fucking ceramic pottery pieces we should rest right now we're still resting are the eye holes about the size of gold coins i'll take two gold coins and put them in both of the eyes on one of the faces i'll do that to the other two eyes in the other face was not anticipating that he always gets his due that's an eight yep me too are things moving yeah there's a bunch of old clothes it smells awful down here i haven't really looked i still got this damn bronze rod with me too so i got to find my way out of here okay falls in the clothes i start burning alive can i look around see if there are any weapons or objects oh that's great natural 19 that's a 21 okay i'll take some of the nice jewelry and stuff like that and the little vial are there any other doors or entrances or shoots you can tell me what it is now when you drink this potion you gain resistance to necrotic damage for one hour nice cool yeah i'd like to yeah shall we make our way back downstairs to see what this rod does in the little hole yeah we're going to go back downstairs oh yeah give him a shot we're hoping that we'll get it to turn i refuse your command and i give it to schmidt willingly counter-clockwise rocking upstairs yeah okay i'll walk up and i'll grab the rod it doesn't move do we think we need to cast unique spells into those bowls for each of the three schools of magic which is what jester said i'm trying to figure out how do you cast necrotic damage on a bowl you want to inflict wounds on one of them other two or maybe not did we pick the form of our killer i think so seven number five tonight great zero speed or slow speed so it's zero speed it doesn't go anywhere is this considered a monstrosity an ooze there is something in it 22 24 it's a big cube of sludge novocaine hands like ballistic gel ladies first i'm going to use my speed to run on this side of the cube closer to you as far back against that wall as possible 30's perfect eldritch blast at advantage that's cocked that natural 19's not bad though great ten plus four that's 14 points of damage it's a hardy mallow yes it does no i thought it was going to stay there shit how many hit points does it have bigby's dirty dirty cat paw (sings) it's right next to me now i'm coming for her i'm leaving her behind last is that your first one oh i'm stepping in it i'll run over and i'll kneel down next to jester and pick up her head and pour a health potion there fjord it's fjord
