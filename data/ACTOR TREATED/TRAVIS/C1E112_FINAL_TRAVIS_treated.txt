yeah man it got foster in front stay turnt we've been reading it out loud pretending to be those characters awa next weekend friday saturday and sunday in hotlanta come see us we've got panels we got autograph sessions we got chances to take pictures and eat food and we're going to run through the quad streaking tequila yeah so that stuff cry hold each other i think it was the other side of your face last week i liked the new way this is old i know this face just a little bit okay (laughter) i think it's a chunnel actually yep small difference i guess i'm all right look i know we haven't said it much but pike i am glad you are here i just felt like saying that yeah no problem love you pike yes sneaky fucks in front pike and i got the rear but we are being sneaky vast space big wide open could be a rick and morty portal to the shadowfell that's further than i thought they are a couple hundred feet away hey twins how do our flanks look if we move forward is it just trees is it buildings (laughing) super slow (laughter) yeah but we're in here it's a tiny ball make a ball-handling check same option as ten minutes ago what is that yeah (gasping) they're right here (laughter) look through the scoop look through it what do you see pike's so brave so brave death knight i didn't even think about that he doesn't know who it's from he probably detected it but he doesn't know who or where said the barbarian about the god couldn't scanlan look like one of the mages we killed and walk up and be like all clear everybody go home it's all done he had a name yeah you could walk it up real close and be like-- the people who are guarding the archways we trap them with explosives and shit always the tone of surmise yeah we heard rumblings down there oh this actually sounds like a plan which means it will go terribly look odell went to vecna because his wife left him because she's like oh you're not very powerful and he's like i will find and show you power so you went to vecna and you gouged your eye out but then your depth perception is off now so then you're like i'm going to work my way up through the ranks pike smack scanlan let him know do you want to know his backstory (laughter) we could hide in a house one of the ruins pike can get on my back you're the only one who'll be saying jenga pretty much 22 but they can both see the middle because we don't know what it is do we have a way to alienate these three that are walking to go see odell do we or do we not but we don't know what it does you're in a fever dream are you talking about collapsing the middle tunnel should we entertain the idea of collapsing the tunnel that we sent everybody to but all the danger the majority of it is behind us even if you can just get the one all of them coming back or chasing us is going to be a bitch even if it just slows them down make a run for it if they're all in there 19 times two is what sure i wait until everybody's through and do i see a crack or nice weakened part in the archway that i can smack hold onto your butts 13 i like the maybe i rear back and hit the fucking shit out of it reckless that's nice 24 what do i roll 1d4 oh that's a one nine i pick up pike and we start running i have advantage on those it's okay 17 23 i reach over to scanlan and i rip his hair off that is a great hat i like parties i don't know how much further we have but we really need that sword right we still have not seen the sword of kas oh good oh because we haven't seen it yet i think the death knight was holding the sword of kas oh shit you about to ride the matrix girl you about to plug in big black sword (laughter) you can admit it it's okay come clean is that what you call big do we really need it we had the ability to tunnel through earth but this guy let it go unless you wanted to hop in the necklace and give it to her in the elemental form that's probably what they were looking for but they were going the wrong way in your ethereal idea do you leave your physical body and your stuff that's not a terrible idea if your stuff works that way it's also super loud and moves a lot of stuff and shit collapses-- all in favor of the ethereal idea raise your hands all in favor of the earthglide elemental raise your hand is gate stone immediate you've got to let vex go you're talking about going in the open air risking the open air to get closer leaves a lot of room for a bad roll so how long can you tunnel and how long in each tunneling thing or tunnel back pike and i charge out of the tunnel did you say 40 feet sam and and we've got three of those so we're going 120 feet two dozen plus things flying around pike and i are going to roll some stealth checks it'll be great if there's anything around that sword when you get there you're on your own (laughs) this is craziness i think there is an upside to pike and i not having to roll those stealth checks even with pass without a trace but if there's anything around that sword it's going to be up to you to either fight it and get the sword or get the fuck out you want to do that corner three do it even if it accidentally hits it it's toast i've got pike in my hand i had to roll for both of us but i had advantage i think we're okay that advantage saved that whole thing from going tits-up because that first roll was (explosion) 24 wait don't high-five shit yet why are you high-fiving what the fuck what's wrong with you people jesus started i hold out my hand to vax and i say good luck i hold out my hand to vex and i say take care of him (laughing) right out of the gate wow make it worse that's a one no she just breathed come on you got this let's go just drop it out your hand and watch as-- is it cocked it looks cocked it's a dm call on him i think or how he wants to translate it that makes sense i don't know keep going keep doing it she's currently in ethereal form drifting down we should see what happens with that it's like lsd isn't it it'll take eight hours to go away (laughter) why is it always green he's an astronaut without a ship you could just wait it out we discussed this say it oh god jesus immediate perception check around us oh 17 17 you all figure out what we're doing next and i put the bloodaxe away and i start concentrating on this giant greatsword well you always remember your first could you be a little bit more specific (laughter) are you hearing anything aces (laughter) the witch oh the lich yeah are you talking about vecna then yes we do share similar goals i don't know if you can hear me very well your voice is barely there i'm attuning i'm locking it in hey hi i'm not even trying to hide it this time yeah anybody else what oh it was saying that we have similar goals and that the witch must die the lich is vecna lich the lich it's very emphatic about the lich meaning vecna and it's going to die apparently i'm going to be an instrument he's going to play me to topple the followers and his secrets that's a good question pike (whispering) what do you require from me in return he really doesn't ask much just average run-of-the-mill fight stuff be true to thy friend this one is nothing to worry about oh reception problems hold on yeah i'm proficient yeah but minus two for my fucking curse 12 it's great guys i don't feel so great that's who i was going to attack i didn't say reckless would he make them reckless 21 1d8 not raging the damage or to hit it's worse 18 that's way worse that's a 16 i'm going to be totally full front here the sword needs blood i feel like it's trying to take it from me you jumped in front of him 27 ten that hits oh that's only a nine it's actually ten because i had to reroll ones and twos d√©ja vu now listen this is an ally you're all right yeah you're okay is it minus (deadpan) ow (laughter) what this is the biggest card ever oh shit good totally good as with all good things comes with a bit of risk yeah all the time even pike would say this is worth it i got the feeling it needs to be fed blood often funny thing that's what craven edge used to do as well oh what do i call you vox machina meet kas kas try not to hurt them he makes no promises he's very forthcoming this is really nice compared to the last guy he said hi he's like i like your freckles keyleth okay can i put you back in your scabbard oh yeah we're going to rock that body real hard holy shit i mean there's motivated people in the world and then there's this totally rocking motherfucker he's of a single purpose it's incredible just wants to fuck him up swiss cheese style and his whole family it's good that you have me here vax my experience with these sort of weapons they are fueled by various-- i need a big word-- various fuels and i feel like he needs blood to be good yeah that was my plan but we could do it right now just to be careful you want to drip some on the blade and see if he likes the flavor guess he digs the other white meat no i've asked that before man you don't want to go that way yeah it went all anime yeah in fact any time i take him out of the scabbard why don't you hang real close i might have to plunge him into your thigh or something i don't know how hungry he is do i need some eye drops yeah we got this blue crystal i take out the blue crystal is it still pulsing oh yeah yeah you want to and spray it with perfume it's going to put me a lot closer to doing that the only weapon that does as much shit as this does the closest thing to it is your staff your vestige this thing is bonkers and we certainly don't expect that to be accomplished without something given in return of course we fought of a bunch of ancient dragons we've established order back in our realm very true (laughing) amazing oh my god vex be quiet that seems most unfortunate i think that's a fair request it's like a dog you got to pull him off your calf we got an eye we'll keep the rule of law vax i want you to know i've never been more proud of you than i am right now i might i'm just saying you're about to buy the ticket and take the ride of a literal fucking lifetime you're not here anymore how do you feel are you nervous can i put my hand on his chest is the heart still beating is it beating any faster because he's nervous still pretty chill do you want us to hold anything do you want to wear your clothes all right what about after you're dead no touch at all no pickle oh oh okay yeah right yeah everything in your life has been leading up to this point this is the pinnacle this is great fair enough i step up behind vax in case he has an involuntary reaction to reach up to his arms just to keep his arms down i don't this is your head man are you hungry right now (laughter) oh god okay i'm going to look at scanlan were you expecting this at all i'm going to grab the armor if you don't mind oh thank you let's go away from the group into the trees hopefully that won't kill us and we lay it down you're not there i wanted to shave half of his head because he shaved my beard that one time but there's really nothing left of him right now that's the thing about dawn it takes a while out here doesn't it wasn't expecting the ashes part i expected the crash test dummy weekend at bernie's i had a whole fucking theme park lined up (laughter) we don't know i do have a question are you familiar with the werewolves that roam these lands right are they around this part that's all i'm just saying just curious some sweet action with some stuff maybe you haven't seen before one-eyed prick named vecna that guy knows how to relax think so yeah probably nude probably put clothes on to be nice around us what did you say briarwood no i was eating all the food in the mansion didn't you evaporate him with a sunbeam or something and then we like killed him in a coffin is it a big spell for you or actually that last one is pretty dope get all your turns all your everything two times whoever you make do that one fuck the flying thing yeah i know he hovers and flies but can you cast fly on somebody no the option of having a second caster like you is way bigger than making me fly if they know it's magic i still like that idea better can you cast haste if there's two of you and you could cast haste on me i'd take that over the flying creature it's nasty it doesn't get me off the ground but at close speed i'd have a hundred feet of movement yeah plus an action surge you've got a decision to make we've got sleep to get oh and he died in the material plane (gulps) oh shit (cheers) for the second time butt-naked ending fuck no that was-- it was the best thing i could have ever hoped you said ashley thank you marvel puzzle quest
