i got the numbers wrong totally it's super flexible slavic listen i have not bathed a short sword in blood under the cover of dark in so long i want to sneak up and i want to take their bowels and pull them out while they sleep but we have to take care of that one that's watching guard first who's sneaky naw are you sneaky can you look i do i like it yeah or you crack a branch right (cracking noise) can i aid her can i aid her with my minor illusion let's make it like a two-headed owl (hooting and gurgling) (harmonizing) hoo i take the crossbow and i try to put it right in the back where his head meets his neck 20 okay natural 20 okay d8 plus four eight (counting) 16 19 22 i can cast sleep oh shit shh i thought he said quietly i'll cast sleep on them yeah with like sleeping powder and herbs i untie the top of it and i go (whoosh) oh shit well i'm sure-- 32 the other three are that's the best i got and i choose i choose which one-- it says i choose-- 21 i need to be a little intelligent bastard from now on i'll take the nearest one with my crossbow and fire is he within melee range of him for sneak attack probably not because he's working on the guy with the throat right 15 nice that does seven points of piercing damage are we hopping off down a cliff or are we running in toward where they are i'm going to stay up on my perch but i can only hide or disengage or-- oh well let them see me how far 25 feet down plus anything oh no oh no way you are slaughtering today frustrated dm there's the make-up there it is what's it look like being pushed around in a circle the last one that remains un-asleep crossbow nice is he now within melee of him 17 so i'll use my sneak attack 12 that's an eight 12 16 20 yeah now quiet-- i'm looking at you-- quietly kill the other and leave one for questioning re-roll that that'll do sucks the thumb how do i get down i'm tiny don't let me fall oh no oh hey 17 trickster rogues man okay oh that's not good that's a six grab him no question him as one sam darin and you strong people grapple him all together right one two-- not me nine oh my god are you serious give him pain pain you said he works for the bright lord pig-skin so ur-gram works for the bright lord and can bend anyone to his will you lead us to ur-gram we'll rest for a minute and then when you lead us we'll let you leave i'm going to bind his hands first and then i'm going to stick some dirty garments hanging off of eden in his mouth to gag him up hold on i take out the-- i should gag him back up i walk back over to eden and i tear off a bit of cloth near the groin area yeah i put it back in okay should we take a short rest because you have those hit dice once per day oh man pet names pet names for our captive you've got a gag in your mouth now hold on oh why are you untying his hands they're on his hands now i've made him a nice bit of jewelry for his wrists let's leave it on so he feels like he's part of the group okay i tie his hands back together in front those were never tied do it you are huge oh my gosh is that what the mark looks like can i make an insight check to see if he's lying natural 20 i've got an idea what if we untie him and he brings us in as new recruits to ur-gram we'll get an audience with him and we cut his head off and then we bring it back and we'll cut you in on the spoils that's me man i actually have deception for once make him naked ferocious warriors we are painfully 17 location location location i hope are there trees around us yep just thought i'd ask you know some ashen trees you hear caragors prepare to fight and i hide that's true we should 16 look and see if we can make it past them you stick your head out oh my god please throw it a mile i could use mage hand to create a better distraction yeah i think you were thinking it was like a dog really terrible it's like a giant liger yeah only four-legged greyhounds of death 15 we don't forc around skak because it's laying prone i probably can't see it from below right i'll aim to the other one that turned at the sound of pain and i will use my crossbow to shoot at it that's terrible 12 (whimpers) bonus action hide okay fair enough 18 on stealth get its attention you can do it all the dice come out just all the dice action surge wow double ones both times relentless damage do we see him under this giant caragor i'm on my way (panicked noises) can i not help him at all i pop back up out of hiding can i take aim with the crossbow again as a bonus can i smash a poison vial on one of my arrows to make it a poisoned arrow i'll keep that in mind crossbow natural 20 six is it sneak attack is he within melee of the other ones excellent oh god 16 24 26 that one's supposed to be doubled too right okay 26 oh are you okay mozuu can you can we see if he's killing him or having a chat nope two he's killing him i nock an arrow oh shit 25 that's terrible eight nine 13 heal him oh you fixed him up oh or you can take that as a sign of things to come if you do it again prepare to feel the-- oh not terrible 20 boy don't you call me point making all right inside wait should we make him look a little better you almost killed him what i have a crowbar yeah 17 so the doors lie ahead but i see off to the side a little quagmire it's like mucky muddier earth and liquid-- we could yes or we could see if perhaps there's a way under the wall so we either go in through the front door-- (laughs) oh yes literally oh jeez oh gosh (laughs) okay yeah it does shrak yeah okay do we send him first no because if he gets in he runs away i'm just saying which one of us five total 21 the guy walking towards the brazier yeah but there are three longbows above us and we have the low ground okay i eye the guy walking with the torch towards the brazier does he look like he intends to light said brazier i will draw very quickly the crossbow and try and put one in while he's not looking rolling with sneak attack but is it a sneak attack 16 to hit okay ten 15 16 17 (shouting) go that will miss that misses as well i'm going to try and hit him one of the last two okay 15 oh thank you then that is only-- it's only ten uncanny dodge please we should run to the front door and act like we saw attackers running off in a different direction (laughs) body chucking's not a thing are we going into the shrak hole no yes and i jump in i jump in after him in the shrak hole oh i could barely make it through so big hits uncanny dodge no i already used my reaction oh crap oh crap oh crap 16 for me oh jeez there's only 40 of them 40 or 50 16 (laughs) yeah it hits whoa so can i use uncanny dodge on the slashing but not the radiant so 13 points down to seven (shrieks) please let us live let us live i want to be with you and i will aim my crossbow over at eden (laughter) is he within melee of one of my 40 or 50 of my new allies 23 (laughs) ah shit seven oh (laughter) (scared voice) play along tell a joke i can't use uncanny dodge-- eight i want to hide behind the gravewalker's legs (laughter) me i was born this way 13 this is the one to follow yes bright lord not with that attitude well technically we are bad guys i serve the bright master can i hold my attack and ask for one of the large uruks or uruk-hais to pick me up and throw me above the wall so i can take a crossbow shot at fleeing eden we all must serve answer the call yeah that's going to be a 19 21 we cannot flee does he know what's coming any chance of sneak attack he's on the other side of the wall yeah 15 17 18 not me we're on the same team betrayers unite yeah crossbow oh does it up my-- if i'm from a hidden position i will use my bonus action to try and hide 27 oh my god damn oh that's pretty good 25 12 points of damage and i will use fury of the small to add five extra damage to it so 17 what happens it's not fair it's not fair i can only do that once a day sorry what yep dead can i try and resist the domination that i'm under the hold no then i will gladly take a-- can i jump down from the wall no crossbow is he within melee of anybody for sneak attack all right crossbow right at him with my bonus can i try and hide that's 26 how do i get advantage on the rolls sneak attack okay great come on damn it okay that's fine 18 aw 12 15 20 damn it but the tip goes into your chin dang it eden just take it take the arrow throw it at the bright lord yes that was fun i want you to know that after that ended i went up and shot eden in his sleep to rise through the ranks my warchief ambitions that shadow strike is real in the game too it's legit
