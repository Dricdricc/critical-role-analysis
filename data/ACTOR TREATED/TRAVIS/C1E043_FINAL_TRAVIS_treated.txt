say it anyway i choose vax and i choose scanlan yep 19 i don't know what you're so worried about okay (laughing) 27 and 26 oh it misses (laughter) yeah that hits too seven (panting) i would like to rage i'd like to stand up please (laughter) i take out craven edge and i'd like to swing twice against him that's a 25 25 hits that's good and a 17 misses 18 21 points of damage and roll for the dc son of a bitch can i move or is getting up my movement i want to move around just stay right next to him but move around behind him yeah now in the middle of the room that's the best i ain't using it (yelling) what like so if we hit him does he wake up you fucking end him and you end him now yeah but he might not hit him anyway he rolls for it we're waiting to see if he's awake or not no and i go into a frenzied rage if it's gonna be an ass-beating we take we might as well just get on with it and i'll use reckless attack and great weapon master against him which means he gets advantage on everything against me but fuck it he's hitting anyway oh 19 so close 28 23 16 damn it those were high okay i'm not listening to any of you (laughter) four nine 17 27 on the second one and the third one missed he made both those checks okay yeah picked you for a reason add that shit up man it's so juicy so savory before i whooped somebody's ass piece of shit i don't know what that stance is-- i chop at him some more with craven edge i don't know can i do one great weapon master and the other two just regular okay i'm gonna do that yeah reckless 16 16 i'm gonna use my other d10 that's not tainted so not this one 27 okay so 12 19 29 damn it he does 29 all that yeah you think shit really little distance or okay can i move opposite of where my two lads are so i stay behind him again yep do it do it do it if you don't do it he will do it that's true yeah jesus you've gotta be kidding me man it's my turn yeah i just keep swinging away yes please at the end of his turn did he go back into his defensive pose okay great okay so reckless attack that's let's make it great weapon master with the inspiration 24 thank you should i do it for the next one then okay so that one didn't right that makes sense right so it was a 29 no i mean it wasn't what okay hit regardless so we'll do the third one will be great weapon master this is disadvantage come on where are the damn crits 20 yep okay this is great weapon master with adva-- with the inspiraton 28 no minus five 23 okay six 11 19 is the first one fuck nine 17 27 (sputters) not once yeah but he's gotta roll shitty sometimes can i move oh i already moved i wanted to move in between him and scanlan just wrap around okay that'd be good yeah where you at pretty sure halved to five okay 17 i'm gonna take craven edge and i'm gonna stab him into the sand and i'm gonna take out the firebrand warhammer instead ten you're right it is (laughter) no way at all reckless attack on all three swings 14 that sucks that's better 27 okay ow
