no song as we leave i am instantly confused about where to start so those runes are alphabetical these are also alphabetical there's a giant wood structure i see tablets of stone with runes  there's a million different potions okay i'm gonna translate the alphabet and that message that's on the right-hand side there's three different slabs that have got little numbers under them  and then one that i'm like okay clearly we have to decipher this thing  so i start looking something to write with and i find a piece of parchment  and a little quill pen and start running back and forth trying to decode the message the first one isn't even here no i'm just looking for the first stupid symbol h that's an h i can't believe you actually just went to bring it on [laughing] i think the bring it on spell was just to make us look like really cool  you know i mean if nothing else then at least we've got that i'm figuring out that message and i'm actually having some luck the magician the magician is the first part of this thing this is going to be the greatest moment of my life there are numbers what kind of an asshole puts numbers with runes o fought maybe is that a fought sought you piece of-- what's a k find me a k yeah a k symbol i've got a u s-- this is a-- i think that's a t and then marisha finds these spells that are you know singing and so we start chanting marisha and is that a ju- i think that's justice the magician sought justice-- this quill is not-- it's magically losing ink come back to life i got it i got it oh w that would make sense the magician sought justice in the tower-- [crosstalk] but but-- yeah the magician sought justice in the tower but-- he's trying to figure out the buts and the thes in between  and i don't care about any of that i just want the last tarot card we got two more words no no no skip to the last word 'cause that's probably what the last tarot card is is this one right here d okay and the h one is an “e” and then-- it's like a pi symbol a that's a t it's death i think the magician sought justice in the tower but found only death death death i have no idea what that means you suck sorrow of what there's water yeah can we like bless it we're just trying to make sense of what goes where and in what order and it's chaos leech juice acrid what acrid what the-- what does acrid mean acrid means um-- dragon's tears is over there siri what's acridness mean roll the dice buy the ticket take the ride which one roll the dice buy the ticket take the ride which one are we drinking it i wasn't 100 percent sure that someone was supposed to drink it holy water right speak for yourself brother i love how exasperated he was in blessing it he's like ugh i bless this holy water  and it's now holy all right can we move this along yeah but he likes it it's his thing travis is tall hey you know there's a little slit in that gold dragon's mouth a perfect sword-sized slot and so i said put the sword in the mouth can you turn it can you turn the sword and then he turned it yep scroll --i find the magical hourglass i haven't seen these symbols before though when the hourglass puzzle finally came about i knew this was a challenge that i had to seek out look over here --that is probably one of the coolest moments that we've got to experience i'll take the second one okay hold on i'm gonna get this sheet and write on it so you're the first-- one two three and the block is what meum in tenebras we say the lines-- shit do we i know we have the spell and all the right pieces for it  i just don't think we're doing it right  i'm completely confused 'cause i've spent so much time trying to solve the additional puzzle nope still nothing we failed wow wow
