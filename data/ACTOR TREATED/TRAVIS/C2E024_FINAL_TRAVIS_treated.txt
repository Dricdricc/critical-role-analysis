seem to have been relieved of our coin during last night's revelry yeah does that happen a lot around here well that might not be necessary i believe it was our fault but just out of curiosity is there anywhere in town that i don't know there might be an infestation of this sort of problem do you know any common areas where folks engaged in this sort of activity might gather at night or in the day areas of trouble that you've dealt with before-- oh god am i sweating (sighs) we're a little light on details unfortunately you know what i'm going to go eat a half a cow and then maybe once that's soaked up some of this i'll return if i remember anything else all right thank you have a good morning i like it cut to the fucking chase trim the fat (cooing) more specific fitz and ashton you didn't need to remind her she's ready to pop as it is all right rissa do you know where this ashton and fitz stay why don't we start by going around where fitz and ashton lived and then maybe we can pay a little visit to rissa's pops when we get there after our run i chuck up a little salsa into the back of my throat and swallow it down morning we're the mighty nein we had the pleasure of meeting your daughter yesterday she showed us a great time last night a repeating crossbow that's not true it actually is quite impressive you said you'd lost some favor with people in power i don't mean to pry but would you mind sharing what happened come on shamone oh yeah that's a 20 are there punishments levied against you yeah we're kind of death-adverse fuck we're broke are you afraid this clockwork warden could be used for malign purposes it's tit for tat in this case we're short on coin and you make mighty fine objects seems to have caught the eye of most of our group we will take it under consideration cleff do you also have simple arms probably heading that way anyway the anvil you raised her good she's been taking good care of us awkward i believe she's incorporated she's incorporated cleff we appreciate your time we are going to venture out our compliments on your work it is truly spectacular there it is so lasagna should we try and find our way over to the-- wait a minute indeed i'm sure their employers are not fond of thieves in their midst ooh it's on yeah fitz did seem like a prick didn't he fitz i understand that you might have felt a little slighted by last night's encounter i didn't say you could talk what i want to know is when you came back into the bar last night did you see fit to rummage your way through some good hard-working people's coin purses how about your friend ashton over there see now we're in a dangerous territory because once that staff comes out she's got to hit something with it and it's not going to be me listen fitz the best thing you can do here is wrack your brain real hard and think have you ever seen anyone around that establishment that might take advantage of some people enjoying some good imbibements oh fitz tick tock tick tock oh no i know it's mine 16 we're making kids cry this is amazing you don't know anyone else that has made a habit of doing this regularly then you might get it ready nott i feel like

can produce some results well if you got to work you got even less time better be motivated excellent yeah might scare them straight it's our pleasure we take our leave yeah when we were in there the shields and swords they looked fairly standard or were there some that were like holy shit yeah rissa how far are we from this assembly yard and just out of curiosity the silver falls the residential area how far is that ol' blemmy's over in the silver falls that residential area do we want to go there or-- (softly) oh shit yep but we have no leads on the girl correct no one saw her knows her name-- you did do you bite your silver pieces before you put them in your coin purse like little tiny dicks silver falls if there was a way to ask about-- if you could ask about large purchases that would be a good idea silver falls keeping an eye out for old craggly sailor-types me yep eight throwing up while we do it yep that motherfucker had leather apron with shitty-ass sleeves let's turn it down no who's going to guard the back fuck yeah if she's getting a beacon oh no no kiri this is where we're stealthy all right knife goes away shh nice two story one story she hops up there i run

fine you're not in any danger nott detective agency always gets their man it's all right no beau we're already winning how old are you you said you haven't had your parents around for a while now what happened to them doing what here in hupperdook the changebringer tithe collectors you all brothers and sisters and your parents' names gail you been taking care of your younger siblings this whole time you been holed up here or you on the move how long before the tithe man comes back gilda and wallace let me ask you if we were to somehow get your parents out of the gearhold prison would you stay here i'm the one asking questions here you don't seem to be taking my meaning if we were to reunite you with your folks would you get out of town right quick give us a moment will you the partridge family keyleth no but seriously listen they've obviously done a fair job of taking care of themselves we could toss them some coin and wish them well or if we're serious about returning cleff with his (tongue click) might as well see if we can get a little extra friend or two out no promises but man if we have an opportunity to reunite these kids with their parents that's a pretty special deed don't you think man i entirely forgot i think it's do i believe him right they said the tithe man could return any day what if we come back and they're gone you'd eat a child i knew i saw you drooling i would really like the opportunity to leave this place better than we found it especially for these kids i understand if it goes sideways it goes sideways and we run but if we can keep them out of an orphanage i would be most grateful to all of you yes i was they're terrible fucking places agreed the effort is all i ask for we're a clever group surely we can survey come up with a plan try something if we fail we fail and we'll move on with our objective i can't leave here without trying how about we bring the kids back in we give them a little coin so they stay out of trouble for the next-- we tell them to stay put unless they're getting food with the girl we found right or we could drop kiri off with the little girl that-- you take care of each other you're a little temporary family for now remember stay quiet could have just gone back and bought it but no we want to go the expert level
