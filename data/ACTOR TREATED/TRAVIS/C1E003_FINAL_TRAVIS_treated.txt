tall scanlan was he bigger than me let's go fuck him up what it was rather restful and those two big trolls there are ogres you know my tactic we should use the volcano as part of our strategy like moses-- well no the pit-- yeah there's a shitload of that oh shitcakes may your list be ever long with your-- list a what fudge why don't we-- listen when my herd used to wander through the trees and we came upon a force that was greater than our own we used the landscape to our ad-van-tage so why don't we provoke an attack and then retreat over the bridge you said they were all gray-eyed right what yeah like in 300 which was a great puppet show i saw yeah what's the bridge made of only makes their numbers count for nothing oh shit what kind of creatures can you make can i test something real quick if i pull out the magic carpet or i take it back from whoever the fuck had it and i stand on it does it hold me up or do i sink so this is a big problem yeah which just slows my fall it doesn't take me across if we cut the bridge you can just fly me okay i'm down for doing this i like the mystical magical-- davy jones i'll stay on this side of the bridge who wants to go be a distraction who wants to be the bait who's real fast i don't-- what if you cast something big and they turn it against us that could suck how about we throw one of those and send-- how about 50/50 it one fake one real one of us one of the cards somebody be gambit and throw that bitch what's wrong with them running away from us they're mind controlled-- ooh i like it all right yep saddle up let's
