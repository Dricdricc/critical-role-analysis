theory we think he might be originating in wildemount no you might want to talk through me i'm his most prized pupil in the sandpit lady vex'ahlia great fighter very brave i was hoping that you would know how to contact him directly perhaps maybe have something that was tuned to his plane of existence potentially self-reliance see if he wants box seats or something free food and drinks do you happen to know from all your years of meditation what plane or where kord might reside ysgard east guard (laughter) (clears throat) ysgard hmm is that on another plane listen he is very busy right now with his meditation garden action now would prevent the spread of his power fair enough you don't happen to have a bean on you do you hard no i look inside everybody else got one i've got a satchel just fucking name the group after me we are out thank you i'll do it too because i was curious don't worry about it (laughter) i thank you for seeing us at this late hour and i wish you luck in the defense of this temple and this city you have been oh fuck that was a noble answer i'm sorry i'm cool we're out make sure as we leave we back away back away that was a total win i got a bag full of beans yep and we know that kord is on he's-a-god you're saying it weird he's-god so should i change back what do you mean you can't we're going back to sleep right it's either that or i put a fancy robe over my whole face we make our way back to the temples is the bustle the same outside of the temple the multiple blue jobs air force got scrambled (aircraft noises) amazing so a question what's on the menu now look how do you even know that why would you only serve beans there's no meat or fish because of your daughter well she's not here can we make an exception i got what we needed i got myself a bean i got several shards i got a bag full of shards hold on the power might bowl you all over what are you doing (gasping) how do you feel these are not the same thing is there a table nearby i dump all the beans out on the table are there any beans that look different from the rest (laughing) 16 does that count these are the beans i mean i should've thought-- kord is a fist and you put one of each four on the knuckles i squish each one of the beans i'm not a praying man bless my gauntlet anything happen are they glowing you know what i bet if i pray hard enough they will disappear look above you laura and hey that's not terrible (laughing) i got plus two 18 (laughter) yeah well the line between me and kord super tight pike pretty good right i know maybe i should get a tattoo for kord like the symbols you have for sarenrae i don't know a fist hey don't put ideas in my head a bean the storm lord symbol is the jam that is a cartoon bean the dick is smaller than the balls it's like a parrot's beak listen we're going to stick with the storm lord sigil well listen i found out where kord is he's in a place called-- laura and are you familiar oh why'd you say sure i do that all the time anybody have any idea where that is okay who can we ask 17 but i'm not trained in it (sighs) okay how did pike roll fuck yeah that we buried under a mountain i don't know there were a bunch of digits you know we could always take kima's greatsword it's made out of solid platinum yeah she does i'm just saying 1600 platinum 1619 i'm familiar with it all of a sudden so because we have these shards right these magical beans if we lose do we effectively kill all the gods whose shards we have yeah that's a lot of responsibility i was not aware of worst scenario possible cool good to know shouldn't you rest first yeah a green emerald gem in one socket you dicks what no it's in percy's workshop that's true i mean do you need me to drop my scholastic knowledge on this shit
