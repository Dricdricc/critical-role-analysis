roll some hit dice to heal up your shoes suck you didn't ask me to make the boots in the feywild don't know who you pissed off grass i mean the sphinx did say that the bow is the heart of a cancerous tree i think if we're expecting to not find the tree we're stupid i am the wrong one to ask why don't we poison the tree abba music i also have poison oh what about honey i got honey for you no i mean i can make some water if you wanna bless it (laughs) by yourself let me tell you a tale of two people that went inside a dragon can we hurt the tree you're just giving the broom away now just saying sweet i love having a character who can't read no pressure is that like an elven word keyleth did you ask if the tree was just one thing what if we like salt the earth that's an expression i have 12 gallons of salt water i've heard them say it before they're like oh you are the salt of the earth what's on the other side of this tree it's huge it's a hundred feet it used to be a titan that had its heart broken or something you're gonna make me check my notes i've got vegemite written down yes do fey creatures live a long time what if he was betrayed by something in the feywild and we found that thing whether it was a comrade or a-- yeah and you can talk to trees who betrayed it can't we just say that we're obsessed with the hundred-foot fucking moving tree in the middle of the feywild yeah we've come to talk to it no bullshit no we wanna know what's up well if he pulls any shit then we kill it it's a mansion we could eat somewhere else bare-bones i like it bum-rush the tree we put the shoes on i'm only wearing that if it helps i put the giant frog-shoes on you don't think we're like perfectly on this tree's radar that going stealth is insulting i'm in the middle good i take them off we fan out yeah wait how big is it you said four and a half feet not this guy not normally i'm going in i'm going in that's lootcratecom/crates well i hope he's watching we just crawled in his tree anus how about we hit the wall well he puckered up yeah oh shit just so you know your notepad is in the upper-left 18 he's pissed i would like to advance-- i would like to rage i would like to advance as far as i can get towards the treant hey that's cool and i'm gonna use the chain of returning with the blood axe and i'm gonna throw it at the tree at sondur that's not great oh 20 total it was a 20 total 24 ahh plus four points of necrotic damage for 28 18 on percy's and mine but liam did i mean vax did something yeah yours was surprisingly good that does hits lightning damage (computer alert sound) halved that's pretty awesome 22 rejection's a bitch oh i was joking when i said it natural 20 it didn't catch fire a natural retardant interesting keyleth how high is sondur liam how much was your first attack can i run immediately underneath sondur are there any vines that are hanging from him there are none right are there any vines that look like they might be thick enough for me to try and climb up if i wanted to get to his height could i grab a few of those vines to try and climb up to where he's at athletics 23 okay with my bonus action can i let out the loudest howl i possibly can (howls) that's my turn hits also hits misses that's a 21 awesome oh that was so close to being a crit that is a 33 no that's wait no that's 22 plus one point of necrotic damage so 23 killed him not so tough really yes i have a question i forgot about retaliation that's a new feat i have oh that's true hit them back as long as i'm within five feet that count on his two hits against me one time okay that's true i haven't used it before you're being so fucking nice love it over here you piece of shit nope i cough weakly it's okay they're all d1s it's that hit back (laughs) yeah well tit-for-tat give him something else that's unbelievable jesus thunder strikes outside the tree i'm too big for this world you're a greater barbarian than i am ukurat it's just on that smog thing i've been so taken out of this fight it's driving me crazy i'm hanging from vines i see wolfman come up i'm not gonna be left out of this can i try and tarzan my way over into the fray all yes just get me there baby okay with advantage a one okay and prone that's probably more insulting because it fails does that still take up all my action all my whole thing to get up i'll cry a little do i keep my rage because i fell and took damage i think it has to be an attack i'm good wow like a molotov cocktail fucking spice girls cup that ball yeah you've been thrown can you will he yeah when it's like when he's playing fucking applejacks back there all right can i stand up and i casually walk over so that i'm standing between vex and sondur right in front of vex like a human shield and i look up and i'm like jesus this is fucking stupid i've broken some hearts in my time but you stupid romeo are taking it way too far guess what nobody cares and i take the javelin of lightning and i throw it at him (all cheer) i do have it here if it hits they have to make a dc 17 dexterity saving throw if it hits it's a 4d6 lightning half if they make it it was 24 4d6 nice six eight seven 12 12 points of lightning damage chasing him around the room i know fuck i throw it and hopefully get it to go right in his mouth as he's trying to have a comeback and i'll just look bewildered that it worked i honestly did not expect that to happen i go get the javelin because it's obviously worth keeping can i run back to vex and offer her a healing potion unless someone can do better are you all right what become a corpse bride it's all right you did you did good i'm gonna hand her the potion anyway as she's standing there so didn't want you to miss out on all the action wait what will you do now he's so awesome can i try and jump through the hole like he did i don't make it all the way in though do i it's up there oh good little colonoscopy can i walk over to vax while they're making a show quietly i say what was he talking about with the bloody dagger what was he saying about the bloody dagger when he was talking to vex yes yeah well let's not downplay the bow are you in fine form should i hit you until you-- cool since i got the killing blow can i chop this tree down now i get to chop a tree at some point they're already down this is true i could get down with that you wanna shoot me with it can we get out of this fucking tree first i walk out of the tree did you loot sondur's body like jurassic park anybody want to climb to the top of the 200-foot tree to see what the rest of the land looks like nice sam hold it marisha we left an empty grave inside it's got your name on it if you don't talk (whispers) nice a statue oh man that was a ten artagan did you know sondur you don't want to see the ex i let go what got your bow you didn't die you don't need the onyx dog why don't i hold onto that you don't need it we'll have to tune in next thursday to see what it is
