now are there any particular groups of people that are responsible for unsavory business in the city any identifying clothing or memorabilia they might have on them no just perhaps to keep an eye out

yeah i was going to say the same oh shit cops no look come on they confided in us the last thing we should do is turn on that just for a simple coin i personally enjoyed the last beast that we slayed

in the sun not too much caleb it's all right not too much that's less than a handful not even worth mentioning at all actually that's not correct i thought it was no well we've lost caleb should we discuss the potential job offers that we've collected i agree i am also not looking to attract any attention well we can certainly teach you yeah it's very shallow here very little risk we're not going to do that she vomits up a popsicle into the pool yeah so here's what we got we got gold from 'my-riad' activity myriad activity whatever that is we got reward for rebel gatherings which we are not going to do we've got tracking down heretical god worship i don't think we're feeling that one right yeah apparently there are only six deities they allow to be worshipped publicly here the allhammer the raven queen the-- we also got apparently winestacker wang stacker yeah he had something at the morrow keep yeah we're not going to do that but there is a roving beast which feel like falls into our wheelhouse if you're not planning on bouncing tout suite might be a fair way to find our way in the town yep we really did apparently jester's mother's going to hook it up right hey nott now the next step is to get your head underwater okay we're going to take a big breath beau and i will hold you and on the count of three we're going to go under travis and we all go underwater
