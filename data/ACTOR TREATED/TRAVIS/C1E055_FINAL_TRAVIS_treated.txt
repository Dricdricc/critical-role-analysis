something-- the bramblewood i'm holding on right with the titanstone knuckles whereabouts is the axe lodged can i see where the chain is attached to (laughs) that went one and then a 13 minus-- zero 13 how high am i a long way well only one way to go and that's up i would like to try and pull myself up the chain towards umbrasyl athletics or strength oh i get an advantage or oh 14 plus five-- 19 yeah okay i remember him saying that years ago do it baby don't see me don't see me i do i have danger sense so just one roll that's not great 11 nice it went away i look down and i see my beautiful body tattoos melting away like instant oatmeal not even like the nice apples and cinnamon kind it's like the maple brown sugar that no one-- nobody likes that you're alone in this and it makes me so angry that i go into a rage right yeah all right so i go in a rage and i would like to try and continue climbing up the remainder of the distance to umbrasyl that was a one that's much better that's a 29 mother of dragons do i have any more movement i'm going to dislodge it because it was already so weak that's a one yep yeah which i have advantage on 18 (laughing) on his back shit that's good do it again i'm enlarged i had one question i drank that potion of speed it hastes me for a minute how many rounds is a minute well there's nothing to do but to climb back up the chain up the chain fucking weiner snap 15 might as well say something cool i can do this all day i'm really not confident (screaming) scanlan (screaming) what the fuck it's the fastest model yet i love harry potter i have advantage on those 26 i take out a case of fancy wine and-- (laughter) there ain't much else to do could i add one bonus thing at the end of mine can i see scanlan and bigby's hand at all or is the world just a clusterfuck four remember we're going to be going the same direction i'm higher i've seen percy make shit i can do it too (blows puffs of air) look what you did what what (screams) it's a new day baby (caw) can i see that flurry of black feathers streaking downwards of this guy we're going full point break terminal velocity straight down towards vax maybe in my dive position i could squeeze your legs with my wings how about that i would i would also think what idiot was just flying behind the back of this dragon on a chain what a fool unless i hear otherwise i'm making a controlled descent towards the ground do i recognize shale shale (caw) thank you god shale yeah it's me i know you can't tell it's a beard yeah lots of lifting lots of running getting strong oh no when i was born she means when i was born puny compared to mountains and stuff it's a lot of fun actually we put a good hurting on it yeah do you-- i mean not like i'm questioning what can you do because i don't think it's very much sweet so you had to have been a part of this party for a reason what's in your bag of tricks what can you do with your stick does magic come out of your stick oh well that's good is it a magical staff of dragon killing i like that but it will all be worth it if we can remove the head of this shitty black dragon so how far would you think that we are from his lair look i'm a little jacked up i think those two are a little jacked up it's fair to assume that he will do the same thing yeah go brush his teeth have a deuce all that stuff can we travel a mile up a mountain quickly can i just say that we agree that the reason we didn't do what zanror wanted and go to the lair is because it's a fucking death trap but he's going to heal up by the time we get there pretty good in its lair when i turned into the eagle what happened to the bloodaxe and chain yeah that's nifty we're fighting a dragon in its lair in the worst place we could possibly fight it that's because he's a liar and a bringer of death and he is smiling at you while he does it in your tiny voice i've rolled all nine of my hit dice yes 16 i'll put soot on your face if you come near me with that wicked wicked staff of yours what how could you have a staff and not give it a name no really pike killed a dragon let's do it (laughter) wait just to be clear if we kill the dragon are you going to say you killed the dragon or would you say i killed the dragon who's going to be the greatest goliath yeah we'll shake on it is there anything you can do to make the dragon visible with his invisibility set fire or your faeries totally meant to okay i'm just climbing i'll follow them 26 nobody saw anything you're a champ call me up to the front we got this (whispers) what about putting her on my back balls of shit a mere 16 and the dagger disappeared into something right i take the tiny pike backpack and i would like to run along the right the farther wall from you opposite direction yes 50 feet using diagonals to try and get as far around that pool as i can yep and i'll use my bonus action to go into a rage hey pike gimme a slap (growls) nope well i can't really hit him from here 23 i would like to run along the side of the pool and up on his left side closest to the entrance of the cave right there would be delicious i would like to go into a frenzied rage a regular strike on the first yeah not reckless not great weapon i keep rolling yeah 24 is the roll and then what double it or add another-- that was a 15 oh the dice roll 12 yeah yeah so that's an 11 for the second d12 plus five for the necrotic-- five it's a ten yeah 20 you nasty boy 27 i do let's do it great weapon master just for kicks 26 minus five is 21 cool good beans 23 20 25 plus the necrotic atta girl shale it was only 12 points of damage i would like to stride over to bigby's hand and can i take out a level-- it's not level two what do you call it not superior but the middle one can i take a moderate healing potion can i take the greater healing potion and chuck it to percy just a toss while standing at bigby's hand and i will hold my attack i want to stay right by bigby's hand i'll hold my attack until bigby's hand twitches please yeah can i make two reckless attacks yes reckless i'll use the inspiration die that's a ten so that's a 29 23 26 24 24 thank you 29 i'm not used to that ain't you pretty have you and wheaton ever touched dragon does not seem to be-- that dumb grin 18 i'm good i have a question because he attacked me do i get my retaliation attack on him it's not reckless the first one was an 18 it's a 27 so that was a 27 for the first one 18 thank you 22 did the fucking necrotic do it (screaming) i rear back with the bloodaxe and i swing for the hinge right where his upper and lower jaw meet and i'd like to cleave up under his skull into his brain night saved monstah no shale yeah the wielder of the magic stick of nose-whappiness i will wear this with honor with the necklace oh snap i thought it was bullshit but it's not dope you want to rage loot plus it would be nice to give shale some gold to take back to the herd shale there was a great remnant the herd will live again and with shale's wisdom zanror's baby mama is still preggo keyleth you're going to butcher this dragon right son of a bitch holy shit it's amazing
