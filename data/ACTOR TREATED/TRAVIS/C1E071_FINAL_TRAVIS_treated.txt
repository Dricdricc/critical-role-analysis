pipe down calm down listen how are we getting down there can we hurry this up please and kima is with us there's also a training room several levels down if you want to go smash some shit we all die together four yeah got it we're wind you're good loud not nearly enough to move tunnels of earth and rock we got the house we got the mansion that's it why would you do that how do we go get kima wait does the stone make any sound or light really then sure she can poof from within the mansion send the two bitties and we're going to hide out i'm still in my mist form where is the circle oh thank you (laughs) yeah that ends well no no on his knees or a budget rental center (laughing) 80 to 100 feet up right can i raise a point taliesin do you have anything to keep you from falling if he attacks you on that ravine that's how tall the ravine is aren't those going to be obvious can you do your detect dragons thing larkin are you ready to help us kill a dragon aye don't you think dragons are just the biggest dick-fucks ever yeah no real simple answer i think yeah he's a real dead-eye we have a hard time keeping track of everyone that we hire and fire yeah it's all right listen all you've got to do is smash dragon with us tomorrow yeah the white one larkin holy shit i even got that (laughter) you're the last person in this room and on the internet i got 11 are we not going to be in the house yeah i'll be in the house if you pour poison on a blade do you get poison damage if you hit them with it did you merge 8 mile with-- (whispers) roll a little better focus your chi holy shit a little elevator music playing yenk's going to go come on chum let's be friends back in the dragon again 15 yeah wow fuck me um what i'm up fuck that we're all going down i take the titanstone knuckles and i smash them together and i use the enlarge and i will burst out of the mansion in a rage no remember it's halved i'll use that dash to keep moving towards the ice wall towards you maybe two or three squares that will be my turn three years never worked we don't know what that does only if you're right on him i'm only two squares away i think 17 oh well he's in the air which is my preference all around can i get up please now we're somewhere can i move directly under him as far as i can go can i haste or pick my nose to go any further i will hold until he drops and two more that's 8d6 she's speaking parseltongue (laughter) come on represent us melee-ers i'm making a mean face so far yeah 5d8 because it is a fiend yeah come on for the very few times kima gets to get shake the dust off just from the attack of opportunity that'll hit and you said additional 30 additional 38 so that's halved also 19 48 points of damage there are three giant monsters can i go to a frenzied rage and unload on yenk okay this will be reckless attack great weapon master because fuck it why not 28 for the first one natural 20 (shouting) and 27 for the third the first one is 15 plus six points of necrotic damage 21 25 nope that's an 11 it's a six one one six seven seven extra points 28 on the third one i've got everything you want big boy in yenk-adjacent i'm doing real good did the key break off when you locked it she made him bend the knee that'll hit hits i'm going to use my stone's endurance on the natural 20 and i'll do retaliation on one of those three hits d12 plus my constitution modifier 14 so i reduce that by 14 great weapon master reckless 26 22 32 when he jumped up and did the hoof kick down i'm going to take it and then grab his hooves and wishbone him (cheering) i look at both of the legs in my hands and i look at kima and go which one's lucky yeah can i make a quick look down do i see any spire of conflux in my rage natural one i'm going to take off running toward vorugal i'll dash to get as far as i can from which potion are you kidding me every time we have one of these big fights-- we do but a straight 20 to one flip-flop only happens one time i think i have advantage on this because of rage i do 21 i run as fast as i can over to pike and vax i have two basic potions i de-cork both of them and shove them in their gullets the two of you inside the mansion now six eight that couldn't have gone any worse in the beginning they hit each other maybe once and then it was all on glad pike was here for the fight (cheering)
