sediment and hide what we did coming up to this i think it's been ten minutes damn pay attention nobody 20 to 15 12 laura and yasha rolled a seven sorry ashley (laughing) that is such a benign correct sure nothing wrong here in the middle of initiative i mean clearly the top is the damage right well i mean they're big we think right they're not going to come through that little door right the crustacean things of which i think there are three it was it's further around than you think six foot what the hell is coming off of it yeah we fucking see it natural 20 for fjord a 13 for yasha i'm going to use my 30 feet of movement with my mariner's armor and i'm going to move north on the map as far as i can great i will with my bonus action-- i'll keep it for now i don't know what else is in there yet i'm going to fire off two eldritch blasts at his bitch ass that's a 12 probably won't hit damn and a 15 ooh thank god for that ten points of eldritch blast damage what is that what the hell is that oh jesus if we hit it do you think it might break the grapple yasha will advance on el aqua screecher gentleman and she will unleash two swipes with the magician's judge with her bonus action she would like to rage because of bless 18 to hit first one hits and the second one 19 the third one is 3d6 15 points on the first one on the second one-- that's not great eight points on the second one of slashing damage sorry ten points add two more on that they do i'm not but she is yeah that is a 19 for the first one second one that's a natural 19 it does oh shit it's already me ah yeah i know yeah i don't know if i want to get that close to it that thing is grappling-crazy can i kick up 15 feet and back 15 away from the target yeah i'll take it i will again throw two eldritch blasts that's a natural 19 and-- the guy on the lower natural 19 is 26 to hit on the first one and the second one is a 19 okay great lots of dice for two different characters nine plus five 14 on the first one and 13 on the second one nice those are good with my bonus action i will do nothing yet so this guy down here at the bottom he was just hanging out slow-playing that shit you son of a bitch i don't like his face the way he said it he's going to turn on you you're going to have two on you natural three and natural five right yeah she is going to deal with the-- what are these called we

that's a 22 that hits 23 all damage is doubled on the first one it's 3d6 so that's (counting) 17 what's 17 times two second one yeah five seven plus three is ten 12 points of slashing damage for the second one both of them or just one are you grappled by both smoke bombs something that helps a ton i love that they wrote it out that specifically is that going to turn him back around on you that's okay i think that's actually better keep him going matt and fjord will take all 30 of his speed and head towards the two lumberfucks that're messing with beau i'd like to get down there if i can could i i'm going to send-- and one of them's stunned right i'm going to take two swings with the summer's dance falchion at the stunned one that just let go of beau they stay at advantage because of my mariner's armor 15 that's going to hit that's 30 yeah i mean that hits that's 37 without the-- ooh god double fours plus 12 16 20 11 on the first seven on the second 18 points total with my bonus action-- oh i should have done it first but i'm fucking stupid look at that i wrote it there in big letters cast hex goddamn it i'm only governing two characters right now fuck me can i cast it with a bonus action yes with my bonus action i'll cast hex and get it up now on the stunned one please it'll have disadvantage on wisdom checks you're wearing cowboys colors it's fine take your time everybody is ready to be out of the water this is the first time she's raging i think it's okay both hit okay 15 damage constitution saving throw does she have advantage on-- no okay oh she's great 24 plus-- 26 yasha's going to try and get to red lobster with two more swipes of the magician's judge reckless for straight attacks okay what doubles oh great okay cool 16 to hit oh nice and the second one is only an 11-- oh wait an 11 plus four 15 damn it but the first one does that's good okay sweet (counting) 19 times two so 38 yeah sweet she will come down in an overarching right with that magician's judge and on the second one she'll shove the sword in and crack that fucking thing like a beautiful fillet (as yasha) so many people leave so much good food in here got to know how to eat lobster she'll take her 15 feet towards the other two can she get on his ass nice natural 20 you'll only know if it's inception or not if it falls over at some point crap fire what in tarnation hasted nott man it just wants to live i'm worried about caleb okay let's do it i'm going to grab beau's arm and go come on first mate and cast thunder step take the falchion and shove it into the bottom of the ocean we're going to come to caleb's aid right here does that sound good and right behind me all right there you go that's 3d10 plus hex a constitution saving throw yes yeah that saves it takes half that's 20 solid so just ten ten points cool it's only within ten feet and i think yasha's 15 feet away from where fjord was awesome with my bonus action can i transfer my hex to that fuckstick oh sorry wait d6 for hex that's six yeah because i cast hex on that bastard thank you you're right never mind no that's okay let's go now let's go yeah it's a spell so there's no disadvantage right yeah it's like what's up over here that's okay we've appreciated it this entire fight you found that fast you're turning into mercer i can't find shit in that book put it up top widogast can she peek in the doorway not that she doesn't think all of her friends can't handle it but-- i was like no i'm not killing ashley's character cool yes that'll drop her rage too back you it was a 20 for two seconds the club punch bitch walk away with some weave in your hand a little slice i don't know if i believe you actually if we went inside then at least anything that's swimming overhead with big teeth might not see us that would be great yasha do you see anything in there (quietly) no (laughter) error 404 deuce do you want to take a look make sure that it's not the ravenous variety i'll help caleb over to the door yeah we have 24 hours of breathing so we're okay yeah let's get inside jester that was very impressive i must say and the use of the lollipop really nice stuff we'll be inside yasha's back up to full careful as you head out there you don't know what's above you i don't want to disturb the fauna is there a more genteel way to make our way through jester you find anything on that guy no pendants or necklaces or keys yeah let's do that yasha will help you pull the body back in who yasha and her i don't mind all right is there any jewelry or pockets or stuff on it keys i'm real good at these that's cocked that's worse 11 no yeah 11 let's pick it up maybe we can offer it as a gift to the (slurping) as we make our way down okay are you grabbing the tendrils ugh caduceus you okay with us chunking this into the-- what i meant we were going to toss the body into the seaweed and let it have a snack oh okay i thought it was the gnarly kind oh okay never mind sorry i misunderstood hello bees (chomping) they're very smart i've seen a place like this once before when we were in the temple previously with avantika if you will help me you could search the floors and the walls for any sort of recessed sphere shape i think it needs to be about yay big well if we find we something that looks like the previous situation then maybe we could send some of us out of here before we put the key in the lock no as far we know i don't think it will i don't think so i think it's to get the three spheres in the three temples she did hers and died i have the second and the third but that's my logic i must concede i don't know how many temples there are i'm only going off of that art that we saw in the temple now unless there's two holes in here there should only be one in theory no how do i do that jester does he answer you when you talk to him he does would you ask him if he knows anything about this i don't know what agate is what does agate look like it's a see-through glass or is the same color well i figured we're in a safe-ish space i don't know we can do it on the ship my question to you-- oh they could see us through the glass sphere that's okay we can do it on the ship with that crazy investigation check of yours did you find any recessions in the floor just one i don't recognize that armor do i does he look like his appendages are all attached any cracks on the skull or face or any sort of-- me yeah hey jester could you make a-- thank you natural 20 maybe it got crushed by the pincers and then crawled down here where they couldn't follow i think i need to do it alone if i'm going to risk getting out quickly i don't want you to have to do the same there's only one recession in here so one sphere i do have my mariner's armor i have my normal speed sure i don't think there's anything else to do (background music) i'm not going to turn evil i'm not going to turn evil i rub my cut earlobe now look i think we're overthinking it right same as before i anticipate some crazy arcane stuff to activate maybe a little rumble and a shake you guys have been more than accommodating you don't need to be down here with me when it happens if something does go wrong that should be my burden my price to pay not yours i don't think it will and only because if uk'otoa really wants me to do all of this for him what good would trapping me down here do i have the third sphere i don't think he's going to hamstring me like that no i don't but i wouldn't gum up the one person that was bringing me the thing that i needed to get out of demigod jail yeah i'd like to i don't know what that looks like i don't even know how that'll go but i don't want to release a sea-snake beast on the world yeah yeah fair enough if you hear the signal take off you remember the signal right (choked screaming) can i go and sit down right in front of jester well what'd he say kind of you had a little projection on it yeah jester you don't have to tell me it's fine i appreciate the sentiment it's okay you can go me too or anyone else just you deal all right get going i don't know what that does i will kneel down in front of the recession and i will look at the eye that's in the pommel of the falchion (different voice) let's see what this does and i'll place it in the recession time to go i'll head towards the tunnel i rolled a seven where is the ship jester i didn't know you could mess with water like that no oh i'm forgetful i mean it worked would i know if i got something new do i know what it is i mean i can try i'll reach my hand out towards the sea and lift up my hand cleaning herself on her balcony yeah i think we're good make for the coast orly we've had enough time at sea really cool shit what the hell is durian yeah (mouth full) what is that (garbled noise) (laughter) ugh on a course to intercept starboard port no we're dropping all the sails we're getting the fuck out of here and i'm going to use control water to push the back of our boat out the fucking archipelago north northeast the way-- i imagine that's the closest one if there's a closer opening yeah yeah make ready the cannons yeah what's the distance from the ship if we had to guess it okay i have no idea what's an appropriate range we couldn't just get to land goddamn it (clears throat) just kidding taliesin do you have any idea what the range on a cannon is 120 or 480 okay we have seven cannons i am reading this card (muttered reading) each of us get two what right which is a singular cannon shot with additional loads of powder seven four on the port three on the starboard but we don't know which side they're on are we both facing the same direction right now so are they on the starboard right now yeah (sighs) run or fight say it now what do you want to do yeah i did but you've already risked a lot for me we'll see how fast they are we'll turn to flee into the water yes probably faster 14 oh she got a three no five 15 what the ship had a 15 mine's not it's up for ten minutes and it's at the back of the boat oh well there you go yep i have no idea i don't have any visual of where we are in relation to anything the coast off to starboard no we're still out of range we're still out of range by 300 400 yards sure yeah let's aim to hug the coast on the starboard side that is a three negative two to survival checks y'all no five yes so three is our hull at full strength okay i got that how close do you need them uh-huh we're hugging the coast we're going to continue in that same line we need 480 anyway with a tidal wave yeah it's a wave no i'm glad we went through all that so i could get that spell once a day make it so turn to port prepare to fire smoke these motherfuckers yeah after we splinter the ship they obviously had some sort of wind in their sails i mean they've got some arcane people they'll be fine if the can survive this barrage yeah there was a 70 percent chance it was going to fucking fail and we were going to turn to port and get into it we're realizing the amount of hours that must have gone into the detail of this because i'm reading into targeting the helm or the sails or the cannons they tried their hand at a new occupation oh i'm so glad (nervously) no it can't be we even did another job nice call taliesin nice call do you want to go close and toss out a rope for a couple how many manacles do we have i don't fucking know how many manacles do we have master gunner we'll be okay i forget do we have any firearms or did the plank king dock crews clear all that out it's not like they've got-- i'm sure they're not swimming-- well we'll see let's get them up fortunately you found us on a day of mercy you have a second chance at life is there anywhere you would like to go i am captain tusktooth 'til the end that's a better name better name we planned to make our way for the menagerie coast do you have any objections with that excuse us a moment yes master gunner you mean nicodranas yeah but we're betting on the fact that they do i think if we go into nicodranas we need to be as stealthy as possible there's a chance they might not take it we should probably drop them off at the island give them some food we'll go into nicodranas stealthily that's my fear i like the way you're thinking i can i don't know if i want to risk it orly make for the shore of the nearest archipelago coast yeah just going in no rowboat how about one stays on deck and he's going to carry the canvas sack with some food rations in order to eat you've got to get the mark it's not optional how about his face what you don't want a unicorn pooping on his face oh my fault jester oh jesus well he's covered in most places so pick your spot give them the food beau will you show him the door i actually don't need to dive down there i can't breathe water again for another-- until we have a long rest orly can we set a course for nicodranas by way of brokenbank oh just going by the normal trade routes just in case we i don't know run across any trouble how are we on supplies food water anyone sick hurt it's the next stop on an established shipping lane if we're set i think maybe a speed route would be great nicodranas nice i'll throw in some control waters once every day caleb that's it i think that's the plan caleb you want to take time to identify your goodies not too shabby they die before we reach the shore what no kidding (laughter) he jumps over i would i would like to ask beau and anyone else that lives in the empire if they could tell me a little bit more about where they live and who is the most concerned about the news that we received about the war moving south he's looking stuff up you're from right we came through the wuyun gates right here maybe we'll just see it's at the discretion of everyone once we're off the boat i'm not the captain anymore i don't know where the urgency lies even with an army bearing down on it you have family there warn your folks get them out of harm's way no beau i want to honor what you've said but you only get one family are you sure that whatever's transpired between you is too much to drop a note you have a brother now no other siblings aren't you at all concerned that he might be an innocent in all this he has your blood running through his veins maybe think about it him at least could give the kid a chance you'll know what to do no i think we're fine for a while my first priority was getting jester back to her momma for a hot minute if we could i think we're pretty sneaky we've learned some tricks wouldn't hurt to check out the fucking building that grows and shrinks as you approach it if we're heading up into the empire we got to go through the wuyun gate anyway yeah in searching the captain's quarters would we have discovered any sort of papier yep all right well-- or we go full sail into port crash into the docks caleb sets off fireball as a diversion we run in and hide among the corpses of the innocents that are scattered about i have a problem (laughter) yeah i'm good no i did have another vision it seemed like uk'otoa was straining against whatever confines it was in but not released i saw a vision of another maybe final temple location i saw a shore with three cities along the coast and then a forest beyond that just before you got to a rocky mountain ridge there was a single glowing light-- it could be i don't really care for now no and the thing i wanted the most was-- in some of these i saw a vision of vandran whether as a statue or in a reflection or something i didn't see anything nothing i've run out of leads there i don't really know where that leaves me on that but we've spent enough time on me i don't have anything else to follow besides there's danger coming maybe we let a little bit of time go by but thank you not yet i feel like we're good for a while i couldn't tell you why we'll see it might be good to ask anyone if they know anything about uk'otoa or if there are offsetting deities or gods he seemed incredibly powerful and i have to admit i was a little unnerved seeing him push against his constraints in that way i don't know maybe there's more to be learned just those single words he says things like learn and adapt could be yeah i summon it yes yeah take it up into the empire by way of nicodranas no no and if i can i'd like to find some way out of it yes i like how i am now and to answer your question i have no idea i've only been in its favor i don't know what the other side would be like yeah no i don't know (chuckles) no i'm out of my depth i have no idea i don't know any more than you do all i know is i'm ready to get off the sea for a bit unless i hear otherwise all's well no reason to assume otherwise he's the most sterile he's ever been and you hear (cannon firing) as we give away our location yeah of course fuck off (laughter) ah my back's popping an instant fucking big-ass tree it's like a ladder caduceus does i do laura and does it come with any protective-- i don't remember much yeah we'll hold it for yasha i bet it's giant yasha drinks it immediately no whoa that's a thing that took me a long time to get to that should we get to work on forging those documents for when we make our way in the mote the shred of fate or whatever i was like when did we start calling it the mote yeah but we don't need any sort of official record tying us-- orly in no less than 30 words describe to me why you should have this ship further inland what i think i'm saying is the ship is yours once we reach nicodranas you can sell it you can take care of it whatever you see fit you've done right by us that sounds quite agreeable orly that'll be all bring him with us make him fight (as orly) no worryin' now yeah fluffy little clouds (stuttering) what (whispering) what the fuck leave it to taliesin to trip you out with shit you didn't know about (laughter) oh man that was awesome i'm sorry that we capsized the boat so fast
