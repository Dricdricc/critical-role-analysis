we play dungeons & dragons oh yeah i love how you just weekend updated your own sponsorship message that's amazing it's going to be so good give the dm some xanax yeah that was when we were talking about the four walls in the temple right (whispering) what is the chair [laughter] did we put the chair in the bag of holding first roll of the night no fucking pressure first roll of the night you got this yeah we'll stay caleb are you worried about another attack one or two are you a goblin do we know who we think that is majority that's actually very clever further away why don't we keep moving upstream what's the direction away from the conflict sure let's head south before we go are you sure your son is safe with this-- what did you tell her last are they staying are they going do other people in town know that old edith cares for your son that they're connected in some way i don't want to tell you what to do but i feel like our previous experience would lean towards getting your son and her out of here especially if the people that have taken your husband are still here if they're searching for answers or asking people questions that could lead to her and him now's the time to move them maybe it's not you maybe one of us go mm-hmm if they do decide to cross i think they're less concerned with people going out more than coming in if it does continue to drift that way bryce will be sure to get them out quick there's a lot to figure this will be one less thing to worry about this is going to bryce woman and child incoming take care of them don't waste it on a stop oh boy bryce is shaking their head trying to get better reception and it's not working because you're checking out around us periscoping snaps all right can we maybe circle back to the maybe if you share with us your apprehensions it'll ease it a bit the head of the whole thing i mean i did that's the center of magical teaching in the empire as i understood it also i don't think a very bad person would care about us this trent does he know these two that we saw how powerful are these two our normal tricks would they fall short so we need to give them a very wide berth at the same time we need to figure out where-- did he experiment i'm sure he's alive but if he was good at breaking things down taking them apart experimenting on things this thing that we have falls directly into that what do you mean what do you prefer we should ask to see if anyone saw a carriage anything leaving town with yeza yeah it might not be the only one pretty smart and also ring the dinner bell jester i think that's the more dangerous part we're super close to the front line or at least to them you do that we might get exactly what we're asking for but then trouble might also come calling i think so it's kind of like when you smile you're going to have to do this twice so do we avoid your two professors or do we try to study them divide them interrogate one of them-- laura and you don't know that what i swallow shit and make it appear in my weapons i'm fucking down to throw you know what i'm saying you don't have to minimize my new shit okay i'm real proud of it i've had it for a fucking hot second yeah maybe we don't try to separate him right well what about the one that studies history you met a bunch of really dangerous historians what do i know man i'm a fucking sailor listen jester-- as much as i love this it's not about me okay so what do we do we need to send your son on his way do we need to try and-- do we want to ask if your husband was spotted leaving by some sort of natural means then we kill the two elves yeah you seduce one i'll seduce the other no problem i have a way with elvish folk we'll deal with one thing at a time have we talked about sending a message i mean if he's in super magical headquarters i'm sure there might be protection against that but-- yeah oh-- yeah your wildmother-- the thing you did for me no nope no he has-- we can do that cover of night helps to the inn i'm going au natural four rooms three you said with events being as they have been we noticed there's been a ruckus recently calm the last few days any reason why we should be apprehensive this evening i understand the aftermath we saw troops leaving on our way in they catch any of those that were guilty of all this appreciate ya thank you ducey a florist stop let it ride that might know locals demi leric you say (whisper) come forth come forth brenatto did you hear what was revealed in that moment just now are there specific areas where the tunnels were collapsed after they went back in and covered them up yeah a lot of jeffs right now are fucking giving you the bird yeah keep digging couldn't hurt sam and can't they respond to your messages or if you're alive just say ow we'll go find a nearby crownsguard and see if they can point us in the direction of where some of those collapsed tunnels were mm-hmm i'll walk up excuse me yeah sorry we're just passing by we heard this was the scene of all the unfortunateness has it been cased this area searched for i don't know anything left over by the invading hordes who's they fancy oh i think i saw them what were they doing fair enough you know if they found anything took anything out of the dirt they tell you that these might open up again or they might be in imminent peril i see there's eight of you guys you were here is that right my god that sounds terrible when you saw the big mouth with teeth what'd you do damn right fast as you could i'll bet did it come out of the ground or did it go back in after how big was this creature wow that's significant were you also here or far away when they made their hasty retreat keeping an eye out could you see anything that was driving them off or were they just taking their sweet time as they left we've come across these cricks before we saw them in zadash there was a big ruckus in the middle of the city trying to learn all we can i don't know when we'll come across them next i feel like share and share alike you know 16 why'd they stop pretty long i appreciate it we won't take up much of your time we thought we'd have a gander around if that's all right fair enough being that fancy folk were here i don't suppose there's any point in doing our particular brand of searching the what what is that i don't talk to the traveler that's a good idea except for what if the whole tunnel's collapsed and we blink into the earth i mean i imagine anything is possible in this world of magic and mystery but i bet it would hurt a lot i don't know about you but when i blink i can only appear about ten feet from where i previously was that's better it's sunken earth right nope oh you're doing your walk thing any reason to use your radar and see if anything was missed anything magical anything arcane they're still here no they bamfed in didn't see them leave yeah but we can kill them too just as a warm up all right do we want to abandon this tunnel i can jump forward 90 feet in a direction i don't know i think i'll get shunted out yeah that one in my mind's eye damn nope that would have been out of form for us no we don't do that yes of course you did are you talking about aligning ourselves with the people that ganked your husband unless you could dig underground with a bunch of pet worms maybe they're baby steps plus it'd be super nice if you could take the most powerful city in the empire and slow it the fuck down before you attacked it that might work we'll get to the tunnel we need to get her son out and then we can decide what thing were you talking about poking yep that's what he's talking about because it's there to do normally all about that dragon sucked i agree carl kevin keep going it's a k sound you said we how many of them are there (laughing) yeah herbal tea some melatonin something right well i'm going to bed you sang what do they look like leave the table (whispering) what they fucking out i mean what else are we going to do maybe maybe not we don't even know if the tunnels are accessible to us why don't we see if they are first it was probably me i'm very wise and agreeable yeah we took that wrong turn at albuquerque right we'll get back and skedaddle out of there if we have to yeah weren't we more concerned about that when we thought he was in rexxentrum why did you say that usually on the anniversary of when they were married not just like you're married happy anniversary mm-hmm better yep let's get your son out let's go son let's get started everything's fine just going to the beach for a bit it's up to you mm-hmm luke best customer service ever (like jester) you need to hang up because i can't technically hang up on this call i want to toss you a pickaxe for that shovel you're using (laughing) don't tap my shoulder again (laughing) their post fucking awol they took an oath and shit all your money (pigeon cooing) (cooing) i'm just a pigeon what do you want do we see
