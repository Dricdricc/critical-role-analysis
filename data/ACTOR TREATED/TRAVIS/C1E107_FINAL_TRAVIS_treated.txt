i was educated she's playing with her giant trash bag of dice yeah pretty much if you die we will lower you from above like an angel on a fly reel with some asshole swinging you from side to side (yelling) i want to get down i can't feel my legs we planned this out way in advance it's so good it's scurry i watch the show with the lights on 'cause it creeps me out once a year y'all once a year i can't die today right it's in my stomach i mean that was awesome it's a little pike cake we didn't say anything what do you mean lentils what is that what is a lentil is it a leaf is it a bean why on god's green earth is it even here i don't understand really that makes sense an hour from now when i get punished in the loo you can make us breathe underwater right can i have something of yours at least until we see each other again (sounds of distress) ooh the bloodaxe there you go mary poppins handbag (gasps) it's the sweetest thing ever i tie it onto my necklace yeah and if vasselheim is attacked you don't go saving the city all by yourself i know what you're like that's what i thought all right bye pike hi pike no lentils right yeah but we need it holy shit jesus what the fuck do we plane shift remember delilah was already down there she was in tunnels underground right we don't know if she's at this forge so we go right do we go to the shore and then out into the ocean on a ship the volcano is underneath the ocean underneath the ocean we've only talked about it for four hours it's okay you never watched behind the scenes on titanic we go to the shore i have a question sorry did pike come with us to send us off pike you know you have-- what's it called you put on me one time that death ward should we put that on one of us before we go just in case it's super dangerous one of the squishier ones does someone want death ward so if you go down-- yeah no boulder-parchment-shears perfect opportunity yeah come on one time one two three go those two thanks pike i thought it might help just in case nope nope i like a little danger in my life do you want one on my birthday come on what are the chances cool good question right now you're sure do we take a boat now or do we find some dolphins and ride out majestically you know you're only talking to yourself we all know hey use your elven eyes see if you can see it otherwise we're walking five miles underwater look scanlan the necklace is really nice on the inside i can vouch for it why not new experiences right whatever it takes to achieve the mission thanks for your time three days not if we want to live we priced it out once before and it was like 30000 shanty's a fancy name for a mansion right did you see her eye it didn't move how does that happen let's meet the crew how many crew are there yeah scaldseat the name of the boat is the sea shanty but the captain is santy can i look down into the hatch where he came from can i see anything two there's rum down there down there there is rum let's get shit-housed who cares what our responsibilities are we haven't even left the dock yet after all we are going on a three-hour tour why do you say that i will throw something jeez hold on i saw you drop anchor do you have an idea of how deep it is here oh shit the ship will be gone when we come back up you got to do a proper paddy entry into the water (splash) do we have good visibility 40 feet 60 feet where should i be yeah how about i'm the down-weighter system for whoever's in the front i'll hold onto their ankles you're breathing water it's not necessary there's no air in your sinuses quick question like in space can we talk underwater if there's no air going through our vocal cords cool stop peeing vax do you see anything around us you've got the death ward go for it should we walk around the volcano is it massive there are tunnels that exist already man-made is not important yeah what the location of the anvil is starving or through rock you can make tunnels right i would prefer to do that than go down the barrel of the shotgun but that's just me (garbled) no (laughter) i'm just saying yeah i forgot he's like a crash test dummy we'll worry about that later what did you see yeah but it might be worth it we don't even know what the core anvil looks like i mean no it might make another exhaust port for the heat and the water you didn't see tunnels right you didn't see tunnels in the sides of the volcano because we're not trying to go down we're trying to find the tunnels right i don't know if we're trying to get to the inside of the volcano shaft there's a chance the core anvil could be made of molten rock right there's nothing that says it's a not dangerous totally cool to be around piece of thing i'm not worried about it well we've got to find whatever it is we don't even know what it looks like yeah when i was getting the upload from morpheus did i see what the core anvil might look like or was it just like i'm just hammering and rambo 2 montage music is playing we need a walk walk the perimeter yeah caves oh minus two 17 kind of (garbled) say my name bitch i do only if i'm raging hey oh 26 i did didn't i grog versus the volcano air pocket yeah put your face in the water and breathe vex will you look for anything that looks like a core anvil and i stick my face in because you made a wall of stone do we want to get rid of the water though because that's what's allowing us to breathe me in the middle yeah of course air pocket do your navy seal shit come out of the water eyes open i don't like the way he said that the walls are cooling we follow vax i don't know but i love it what nope awesome it's just a thought but i do have the big-ass jug that can make a big thing of portable water well you can breathe in that shit right we won't be able to see you're breathing it back out you're recycling it it'll get a little less oxygenated do you want to do that salt water or fresh water or wine laura and i take out the alchemy jug and i say fresh water are we underwater right now okay i stick my head in it can i breathe it works it works i'm holding it above the water don't downplay my special moment i was looking at it and i was like fresh water vinegar oh 21 21 oh i think you barely got that in i'm sorry guys 16 i have a feeling oh you fucking didn't that was a barrage can i quietly go into a rage (laughter) i heard you saying it too

one might wackadoodle on nice watch me knock this out of the park that's better still shitty 11 the pathway still continues to descend around what boners and wangs you're not there i think that's what we're looking for right yeah we're great entering doors great history with doors let's go i've got the carpet what about your bean i don't want to jump the gun but i did punch a volcano today this

but people were like no don't talk to pelor what are you talking about i'll go in what's the floor look like from here to there the same surface any seams or just smooth i move closer towards that hold on 17 it's just the triangle shape right there's nothing else around it and the coals are in a circle (sighs) might have to tony robbins this shit right is there anything else in the room besides the two reliefs on either side that we can see tools so we're supposed to smelt the platinum right melt it down and then we use our magic beans to make the prime trammels and that relief is in the middle of two crossbeams so you couldn't push the crossbeams over and lay it down flat it's not something we have to lay flat what did the reliefs have in their hands weapons swords axes hammers okay yeah the coals are cooking i'm going to walk across those crossbeams do they look like they're structurally integral to the room oh shit oh my god we're going right into it
