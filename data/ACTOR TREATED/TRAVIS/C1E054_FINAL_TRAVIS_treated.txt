magic-users or clerics abjurist and old davin included wait before we do that didn't you do something that gave us an extra amount of hit points before kevdak 14 that's not bad if it's midnight i would take aid just in case he comes in the morning and if he doesn't no harm done you rest up anyway right i wouldn't mind taking aid in case he comes in the morning if eight hours pass i lose it anyway but you rest up again yeah just in case he comes in the morning yeah before first light how high do you want to cast it rock out go for it five times five it'll hold for eight hours right or but i lose it-- you're asleep yeah man it's as good a time as any i'm going in that tunnel too if you drop below zero you come back to one i'm down in the tunnel i'm down over here i'll throw her out of there if something goes wrong how about fuck shit up 20 if i were near you i would slap you get a hold of yourself man i go into a rage and i would like to run up behind him with my bloodaxe and make two reckless attacks against him 26 that's really good 28 so that's 23 with three points of necrotic damage oh that's part of it yeah and then the second one-- 22 with one point of necrotic damage with my bonus action could i drink the potion of fast nuts potion of speed i believe you're right never mind i think you're right that'll hit it's a 20 what's in the book yeah could i go into a frenzied rage excellent i'm on top of a pillar and i'm not within striking distance right from up there (laughs) i would like to use all three of my attacks against his backside reckless natural 20 26 these are just regular they're not great weapon master 23 sweet so the first one was the crit right that's a d12 21 and two additional d12s ten 31 seven so 38 that was awful 13 that was also pretty crap that's 16 oh i did not add the necrotic on all three of them three six eight total of eight (singing) i believe i can fly-- a nine reduced to 16 he's taking a photo yeah we said to lift it off no marriage fucked everything up how high is he fuck him up pike probably not but against dragons it does specific damage is it grabbing him or not is that the third one what's left of the herd come on goliaths and herd please roll better scholars the lot you're going to pay for that later by the way yes i have two questions one of the things i picked up from kevdak were four enchanted javelins what do those do and they're just enchanted just that what is my climbing speed if my natural speed is 50 and i wanted to climb that column what's the climbing speed on my back can i use my bonus action to drink the potion of speed which makes me hasted i do and it doubles my speed right okay so i have 100 feet so can i stand up can i try and climb that column towards umbrasyl's feet that's not awesome 18 so i have four attacks yeah so i'll use three of the enchanted javelins and the javelin of lightning reckless all of them yeah it's 120 feet for the javelin of lightning it's an 11 plus-- just my natural like-- right oh no my proficiency-- okay where's my proficiency-- oh five i got it okay is 28 is 19 and the second one the last one is a 30 that's right so that's 12 14 17 okay 4d6 13 six-- yup yeah i stay up 16 resistance so i halve that copy that no it came in handy for the one we don't even know where you are really 18 21 is 15 halved for me for the bludgeoning or is that already halved a 21 my eight is halved pike still hasted can i stand up and with the titanstone knuckles can i smash them together and cast enlarge on myself (cheering) being that i'm hasted can i move directly behind umbrasyl like underneath him and behind and can i attach the chain of returning to the bloodaxe-- yes and can i throw it at umbrasyl do i have four no i just have one throw if i want to reckless that's even better 29 21 with one point of necrotic damage i don't want to pull it loose i just want to weigh on it does enlarging do anything to my damage sorry i didn't do that can i do that hey four say that again perce i'm still attached to him too i'm going for a ride yup advantage on this 24 three of us are not here next week it's either that or-- we're not here laura travis and sam that 30 minutes fucked us it's the shaft of an arrow made me drop my fucking jelly bean we're doing great no
