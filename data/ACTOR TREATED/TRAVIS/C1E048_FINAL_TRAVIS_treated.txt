what he looks like the place looks pretty rough he's not here in this little encampment i'm not really sure where he is yeah i want to but like listen i'm afraid to put everybody in the group in jeopardy they're going to be there in the city and i was wondering what you might think about going to look for a few other more vestiges trying to find osysa's mate and seeing if we can find anything
