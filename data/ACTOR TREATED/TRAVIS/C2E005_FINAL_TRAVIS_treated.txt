think it was acid reflux i don't know i want to shake your hand but at the same time i want to smash it i had a dream i'm sorry a vivid one just shook me to my core a little i'll be fine really it's not a common thing i don't know yeah that sword is a pickle it's a mystery yeah i feel funny caleb you remember me asking you about your arcane prowess my small experience with the arcane came to me around the same time that sword did not too long ago very recent right before i met up with jester yeah i was did a lot of merchant sailing previously had one trip that didn't go so well suffice it to say after it was done i found that sword yeah yeah i'm not real comfortable talking about it i found it on the shore when i got back to land it was just there i'm not super familiar with a ton of weaponry-- the sword i know i had some training in it but this seemed like a unique sword i felt like it almost called to me i know how that sounds but when i picked it up seemed like everything changed ever since i've been able to do more things been able to reach out with some of the stuff i've seen you do that's why i'm trying to make it up to the academy i'm trying to figure out what it is that i have i don't mean to alarm any of you really i'm trying to be as forthright as i can can i make it appear i focus reach down you can see why i'm a little curious about this item do you have any experience with items like this could we revisit that idea perhaps i'm sorry the night has left me a bit shaken and i feel like i need a moment to get my bearings if that's all right of course not and i don't want to make anyone feel uneasy again trying to be as transparent as i can i don't quite understand and i appreciate your patience in advance and i make it vanish (sighs) no i hadn't considered that terrifying thought but thanks i'll just add that to the fucking list in a jar tell you what i start sweating real hard i'll let you know okay i don't really remember i don't really remember my dreams all that well they leave me quickly if you wouldn't mind horse you're just too bad vasquez yeah 16 nein cookie monster oh shit that's not really a-- yeah let's do that fire i chase after the crownsguard yes we are a gnoll just go get them it's all on the other side of a wall you mean your water 14 we do we have to use the cover of the buildings diversions are absolutely-- yeah i was going to say we're in it this is a fight so anything you want to do now do it can i also knowing that we're probably going to be up close danger close i'm going to cast armor of agathys on myself you see a spectral frost start to harden around my armor in a shimmering light is that one of the were-thingies damn (german accent) that was worse 25 to 20 16 wow guys wow oh shit already oh god what are we calling these things oh throw that shit in the foot my legs are jumping around like crazy right now yeah okay with my 30 feet of movement can i wrap around the far side of the house and just get to cover of the corner now there is an individual over there that sucks right i beg for forgiveness i'm going to try some shit i would like to cast-- crown of madness (cheering) it is wisdom saving throw i believe let me double-check yeah wisdom saving throw so he becomes charmed and a jagged crown of iron appears around his head and madness glows in its eye yes it is oh melee fucking shit i saw the bows damn the words in this book but i can make him move towards something right okay good i'm going to have him climb up on that roof and attack that other fucking gnoll that's up on that son of a bitch that's fair can i use my bonus action to use my mask of many faces to make myself look like a gnoll no they're taller they're too tall two feet taller i can only do a foot taller or shorter i'd like to do it i was hoping to just be-- because i can't see that far-- to be right here to hit the only guy that could see me on the ground there the guy on the roof can see me as well that is it i should have used it on that fucker (raspy voice) hey come on let's go what dice are you rolling there big guy no your d20 which one was it that's all i heard melee so if he has a weapon or anything hit him if not just knock him the fuck off the roof spear oh okay plus anything that's a 20 that's a 19 yeah that's much better nine adding my modifier or its 16 plus crown of madness piece of shit can i go ahead and send using my action to maintain it can i send that stupid ass back up the roof knocked it out no fuck it i'll drop it and i'll come into the street down the way 30 feet but i look like a gnoll but i still look like a gnoll that will be my turn i guess because i dropped it i have it with my action i'm going to cast hexblade's curse on that big son of a bitch yeah it is with my action i will eldritch blast from where i am thank you skadoosh it's a 15 plus six 21 amazing 1d10 (counting) sorry i should've looked at this beforehand 14 (yipping) that's it okay oh that'll hit both hit that's okay i've got the armor it deals damage when you hit me liam and i got ten temporary hit points at second level so he takes eight points of cold damage so he'll take two points of cold damage and i'll take the other two points thank you sam oh let's go this way here we go get up in that get a whole bunch of stank right in your face definitely hit (chanting) level three level three critrolestats is going-- (clicking) nice (singing) pour some sugar on him just going to take a quick timeout but i'm a gnoll ah i'm just confused that hits understood yeah great awesome sweet can i use eldritch blast against the big fucking guy because he didn't get any closer for a melee attack right oh imma fucking move out of his attack range does that give him attack of opportunity yeah i'm doing that anyway i'm going to move back towards the corner where i was going no all the way back back towards my original hiding place that hits i will now out of his melee range eldritch blast ugh god that's not great 13 nice as i'm pulling around the corner can i use my bonus action to drop the stupid runty gnoll look i need cover we're at level three that's got to be an acceptable option right now yeah it's simple numbers them leaving is a good-- hideous indeed my turn can i hop around the corner again i'll go ahead and use my 30 speed to close in on the proned-out great and i'll use eldritch blast against that 11 that's it that's my turn we need the assistance of guards guys it's hard what you really want to do something really marisha and what's your spider sense that'll be all the damage your friend took off running i'll run forward using my 30 feet but i will call out nott get back here let them go what were those creatures have you encountered them before such a grizzly scene they seemed to be carrying away bodies on that cart they had i did indeed my concern is that they'll return we've fended them off for now but they'll come back are you going to run back to the group or bring wc with oh cool okay indeed we could provide some extra muscle perhaps for some lodging while we stay and maybe we could aid your men and their efforts to exterminate this foe nein crute we appreciate that hopefully there won't be another call to action while they're here but you can count on us if there is damn i'm great with a bed jester
