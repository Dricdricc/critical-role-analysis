learned that my true strength comes from my friends which means that these trinkets no matter how strong they are mean nothing you knew me before then and i would hope you would know me after while my best buddy pike taught me to love you taught me to laugh and i don't want to know what life is like without that and the last thing i'd say is you spent so many times inspiring me i'd like to take a
