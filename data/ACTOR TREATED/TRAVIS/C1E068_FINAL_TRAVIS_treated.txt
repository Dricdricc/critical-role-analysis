take off in my bird form admiring the arch-ipelago but i have an intelligence of eight and realize it's ark-ipelago and i head for the treeline i do not shit apparently 16 petri-fried trees or are they scorched i did petri-fried entire state building (squawks) how do you turn my head (squawks three times) actually instead of that can we go 100 yards past the tree line and into more of the forest just to see what's there i'll land us at the treeline just the three of them right oh he's pulling it back just pointing and laughing natural 20 because i have advantage on initiative rolls my dex is two (squawks) i look over at scanlan and i'm like (squawk) so can i hold my movement until scanlan moves so i'll take us both over there is my intention can't hold my movement i'm going to take off and i'm going to go towards them and as high as i can go i'll actually go ahead and take my action and i'll stop flapping my wings my intention is to plummet yeah right above it that'll work because don't you guys like once you break out of your animal form you change back you can fall off into the water if-- which is okay yeah that's a vestige for you this is like your shit so let's go because he's in its what got it so stay out of that works for me oh yes all right since he killed the big one can i fly down to the one that's right next to vax with scanlan on my booty yeah now if
