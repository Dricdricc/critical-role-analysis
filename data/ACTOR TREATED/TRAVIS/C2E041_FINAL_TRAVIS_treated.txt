i have experience being a quartermaster so i'll do that as well of course i'll bring them up indeed oh god what (exclamations) that's a shit-load of jewels oh fuck will do jester deuce up top well i'm sure it's a ship of innocents we don't want to stray from our path correct i'll use the spyglass 20 captain are you in a habit of intercepting said vessels in your time at sea it's important that you know in my previous life i had encounters with pirating vessels as well and most of those experiences i did not enjoy you say no need for a loss of life or stubborn well my fellow boatswain and navigators to be nope boatswain and carpenter yeah okay carpenter and-- what are you oh well i had that completely fucking backwards i take real good notes what say you on such a dangerous expedition as this oh yes of course you're not wrong jester you're up for a scrap on the seas what would we give them very well as long as we abstain as well as we can from violence and as long as your men in the crew understand my disgust at such tactics i think we can make our way towards an intercept well you said we need supplies right i felt like your words were different before listen we're going to not use violence all right i'm not-- do me a favor spread the word amongst the rest of us and make sure the rest of the crew hears as well i don't want innocent blood shed if it can be helped thank you jester nope is the big ogre-- yes that name can i find bouldergut bouldergut i'm sure that is just for show yes it's important you understand i have an agreement with the captain no unnecessary bloodshed you will make sure that the rest of the men know this (uncertain noises) i know making sure you know that is all i'm running to find nott our master gunner-in-training i'll say nott i need you to keep an eye on those guns we're not looking-- nott nott oh my god look again we're not looking to sink this ship okay we're going to try and board get what we need and let them go i don't want unnecessary violence we're doing great beau you're going to join me as we pull alongside the ship you're part of the boarding party go up above nott i pull nott close and i say if you fucking fire on that ship before they fire on us you will never get into the academy do you understand yeah the letter that i have that grants me access if you want that for caleb-- so act real tough and yell real loud don't fire on them unless they fire on us you understand as long as you don't hit the ship i'm sure you'll-- i'm going to leave you to it i'm going back upstairs at your will yeah the cannon goes (creaking) they're curving fast because there was a detonation well done nott i look over at caleb caleb have you any desire to intimidate some folks beau's going with yeah i don't know that's not where i'm going beau team up with bouldergut i want you to go on the opposite ship and find me the captain can i see how many men now that we're close how many are above deck okay sorry i didn't mean to interrupt i'm coming with you just keep an eye out and make sure no one is doing any shifty biz not unless-- rules of engagement apply do not fire or attack unless fired upon yes i'll step forward and reach for gloves that aren't there and not do that my name is fjord i'm a representative of the squalleater here if you will but humor us for a few moments i'm afraid we're very short on supplies we need to replenish our stores and perhaps enrich our pockets if your men behave i'm sure we will all get out of this very little worse for wear indeed deuce food water oh indeed yes the well being of your men obviously was something that we would easily tend to now in exchange for our good will in this interaction i'm sure you won't mind if we peruse below decks and see if there is anything of interest fantastic bouldergut i'll call the ogre up to just board their ship and stay on the gangplank between ours and theirs oh no i'm sorry on their ship on that side of the gangplank our friend here is going to play chaperone and ensure everyone stays nice and happy up here beau would you mind coming with me will do again i must emphasize no tricky business we're in good moods it would be smart to keep it that way i motion to a third so it's not just beau and myself one of the other crew members of the squalleater to come with us downstairs vera ipess yeah let's have ipess come yeah we go together what'd you find oh yes indeed it does oh i believe i will nice first room yeah that's real good well i'm going to find out one way i'll call over bouldergut bouldergut do me a favor and lob this over onto the other ship would you i know captain i hate to be more of an inconvenience than this already is and i want to get the stormcap on its way as quickly as possible would you do me a favor and have all of your men come down here and assemble at the bow of the ship please this is getting too interesting and i can't have you spread out all over the place but of course captain what are we monsters we'll make our way below deck to see what we can see i'll peek my head into one of those rooms where the crew is hiding i'll say you you and you get your ass up i want these crates taken above deck and put on our ship do it quickly do it quietly i'll point out the ones with the food some of the water and some of those frozen fruits as well for scurvy needs i'll grab one of them before they-- i heard that you know if you were on the sea long enough you would know that i'm the type that only asks a question once who else is down here 23 that would be it you can go on well i don't feel like we need reinforcements for this right yasha yeah we'll make our way further into the hold and try to find the source of the voice i will aid you i can yeah can i give it a better look with my darkvision that's right i'm helping her of course unmolested except for-- i'll make my way forward into the hold even though we haven't seen much hits hits misses amazing yasha rolled a 19 i rolled a six does he look armored with her bonus action she will rage and she will make two attacks with the magician's judge that's not good that's an 11 and a 12 you can wifi suck hp out of somebody like that yeah i will stand up after having getting the holy fucking shit knocked out of me from those longsword shots and say friend you better be real sure this is something you want to die for i would suggest you drop your sword you're outnumbered i will take a step back first one was a 24 yasha will walk up and attempt to grapple him into a bear hug 21 our dark-leaning thing goes tick friend ow second we saw a little manifest that said there was some guarded parcel down below i can only imagine that they were talking about you now my friend was correct she can punch the shit out of you also we can see how well you want to swim or we can just make sure that you're on this boat healed up a little bit and sent on your way and you can create whatever story you want but i do need to know what you were protecting do i think he's lying eight nearly there oh i really wish you hadn't done that i can't guarantee her reaction to that will be a positive one yeah you are you've done really well are you being paid to protect this how much i'll give him 70 gold i'll walk up and put it in his pouch as yasha's holding him are you coming down under actually while you're here-- sorry would you mind helping this fellow out and giving him a little love thank you he rocked me i miss raging while we're waiting for them can i pick up his longsword can i look at it you don't know the half of it we're going to let you go now and be on our way i'm going to keep this as a memento i would advise you to stay below if you pop up i can't guarantee the same good will be extended i'm sure you understand careful with that do you want to take this on our ship and let them be on their way i will take that advice and join you in a complete attempt to capitalize on your disgruntled feelings would you mind telling us who paid you to guard this or where it came from this paintbrush fair enough i think we've taken up enough of his time you've been more than flexible with our questioning i actually do feel that way so let's just head up we'll head up above i agree do you want to make sure everyone's feeling all right before we-- jester what are you doing can i reach over and-- come here i pull his shirt aside did you do this thank you for your hospitality i am glad that we could complete this transaction peacefully i wish you calm waters and safe journey we will take it back over to the squalleater what not yet myrtle indeed there was a man in full plate armor who got quite a few shots in we did yes i kept a memento i hold up the longsword that's a one that's a one i stay up to entertain avantika bring that fucking wizard down here with you i forgot to look too i did too (impact) (gasping) travis and ooh that's a big old thing trecorum satis dee probably (high-pitched) not there (laughter) flying away oh fuck yeah what do you mean like the who framed roger rabbit warehouse singing sword and black hole what dicks hanging out the walls (laughter) i didn't think this through (newscaster voice) a rash of wild dicks have appeared in wildemount and through the dwendalian empire no one can explain the huge dongs protruding from walls sculptures and holy places a finite amount of ink or what before port before port (snaps fingers) does it say how much paint it comes with wow okay what if you painted a 500-pound diamond okay got it (singing) well caduceus my ac's 17 why don't you protect the clerics laura and aw 17 (pause) no you guys have it consider it a gift after nearly dying in the past well now eight days yeah i'll find my way back down to the rest of them what'd we get shit weird that they would have an armored guy with a longsword protecting a paintbrush that does nothing i'm not opposed you didn't frankenstein make that triumphant bastard into life it's not the dick brush it's the paintbrush just +1 oh so we found a paintbrush that you can paint things and they will come into being is that what it is wow and the shield can i just ask how everybody-- humor me-- feels after today yeah me neither wait bucket list as in hijack a ship before you die kind of a thing nott i'd ask if you have any reservations but you seemed very enthusiastic about today's-- uh-huh i can't promise there will be a lot of that but at least i know that you're dtf cool caleb yep fire caleb how you doing yeah actually i do have some news to share avantika apparently has come across my old mentor vandren before she knew him apparently he carried the same sword that i have it's called the sword of fathoms has a name she's of the opinion that he always carried on him the sword and another one of those spheres an eye she asked me if i knew where the ship that i was on went down i did recall the area and she believes that if we were to search that shipwreck we might find this third sphere she has the ability to mess with water now and in some of the dreams i've been having i believe there's quite a bit more where that has come from not all the time i admit i've been very excited about all of this but the things i see are world changing scary i don't know i don't know that either well when you say it like that i don't know i meant only the power that might come before that happens i-- i actually don't know i'm just assuming that because she placed her sphere at the bottom of that well in that temple there are two other temples which we have to do the same thing and that might lead to the release of that serpent right the third sphere and i have the second it would be a lot for one person correct can i just take a second and ask caduceus to check the door without saying too much more i think it's best that we all listen to caleb's words and play along we'll be making our way to darktow and then we will reevaluate just feel like-- and i'll try and be subtle as possible that only the people in the room would hear (whispering) there are people that we can't see i just don't feel like this is the best place to converse it's not our ship i think i would know the location based off the trade route at the bottom of the fucking ocean mm-hmm all good ideas trying to use that to our advantage thanks i appreciate it i'm trying to keep her close if she starts to suspect us we'll be in trouble if anyone feels uncomfortable with how things are going please let me know my curiosity is not worth dying for or doing something you feel like you'd regret i value what everyone thinks here well that's just fucking dark now jester where would you learn a phrase like that cool yeah caleb said something similar last night-- or a couple days ago all right well enjoy the paintbrush i mean we're going to find our way to darktow with the seducing i mean caduceus if you want to teach me a thing a two about wooing a woman-- yes to what you said and yes to what you said you just do you girl yeah i think that will be very valuable when the time comes about what time of the day is it time to break out the banana margaritas it's only afternoon sounds good caleb can i speak to you for a moment above deck i'll go up how far away are you (splashing) (laughter) seeing where jester is i'll pull caleb aside may i ask you a frank question i had to admit i found myself a bit surprised my initial impression of you was someone a bit timid and maybe reserved meek even your tone your opinion of what to do with avantika in order to make sure that we're okay it seemed very calculated very risky do you mind me asking if you've-- have you ever sacrificed anything in order to achieve a greater goal because i feel like i am swimming in the deep end and i don't quite know what i'm doing likewise you don't miss much do you you have a very shrewd sensibility as well you seem to be able to weigh pros and cons in an equation a scenario liam and i do i don't mean any of it as a critique but more as a compliment and i'll add with it a request keep that eye of yours on avantika for me i don't entirely know what her intentions are but i feel like there are only a few that i could ask to exercise quick judgment in a moment of need i think you know what i mean but in case this thing gets out of hand can i count on you to right the ship if need be of course thank you and thank you for talking with me yeah just so i'll turn and walk off wait you can do that what do you mean what that's the first we heard that right we heard that before right yeah (whispering) oh shit (background music) fuck i wake up and immediately grab the map yeah okay well urukayxl and we've been heading towards darktow so we've been coming across-- did we pass the wall coming in this direction did we pass-- okay that's where we were there is there is and then dead center is a lot of space you could say that this is the center but-- okay well the shipwreck is here well in the vision the three land masses are in a triangle at the time yeah so it'd be heading west mm-hmm yeah i'll be doing that later you did have days shawshank style is the flag just solid purple ten for fjord and 19 for yasha the revelry 17 guess we're part of the island now they didn't sign up for that shit a month-long journey kill those guys i thought for sure caduceus was going to give jamedi a little-- oh god we're at the end of the world my friend it's going to be time for you to toughen up a bit do you have a pirate face is that a pooping face or-- okay well until you find a better one that'll do what's your pirate name yeah did we say there was a plan i'm not sure did we have a plan i don't even really remember who they are no i think we've brought them to a port of great business if they choose to stay here they certainly can otherwise they'll have to wait until we're leaving again i'm just scared how guarded or patrolled or monitored are the docks in this area are there uniformed patrols or do you just see well armed-- is packing we're going to follow something they would wear that would identify they're not wearing a hat or a sash oh lord we all going to die we'll tell the crew they can have the evening they can have the evening we've just been at sea this whole time but in the morning we expect work to continue on the mistake we never divvied up that box yeah it was intentional guys we're fine you feeling at home there deucy the guy that pushes past what's he look like what's he wearing you can't just let these guys go by nine marisha and i'm fjord tusktooth quartermaster of the squalleater what drives any of us necessity urgency for a better life (laughs) stenographer what if the other one isn't around to lodge a complaint (gibberish) (laughter) or a favorite spot just the plank king and linus in that room outside from avantika 17 it puts the lotion in the basket creatures (whispers) statues you said how much indeed he seems like quite the benevolent leader how long has he been in a seat of rule yeah it's something (yells) oh god we're on pirate island we're surrounded by a reef and artillery and pirates he's wearing somebody's scalp you guys we're in the main of other creatures good shit matt good shit matt
