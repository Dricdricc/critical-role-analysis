shadow of war oh shit the sequel to middle earth shadow of mordor i remember talking to you i was commanding orc 1 but with the sex appeal of grog it's such a dope game the nemesis system has been improved on from last time we can testify and make us rise to the higher echelons of the orc order they'll let you delineate between harvey and irma too in case you want to pick one over the other harvey had a lot of support from jj watt's $30+ million dollars irma the damage is still accruing nah but we make happy stuff ooh critical role back brace do you dm 20 hours a week we've got something

hammer that was hitting me in the face we all have at least the one superior from the brass dragon i didn't roll any hit dice should we roll some hit dice i clearly do not remember this that's right i remember i don't remember what i read but i remember yep there were things we also need to be on the lookout for that sword remember in the story just saying keep your eyes peeled high-perception people and vex is probably with her brother i'll be right behind the twins it's the twins and then me who wants to be behind how's it look pick from your fucking 300 dice almost poked my eye out you almost made me vecna like shawshank redemption and the poop pipe well that's what's most important are the knuckles still doing that vibrating hum thing can i go into a rage and i would like to try and bash the shit out of this-- taliesin and i'm going to do the one-inch punch yeah because i'm an angry monster 21 what (angry panting) (punch impact) can i make it reckless-- oh i didn't say it oh yeah siege oh it's fine 30 okay 1d4 four eight 27 no and my rage damage is 15 well that's with the axe do i hit it now sam taliesin and oh that's even better 33 two plus eight ten plus-- 14 i'm so swole right now hey guys it's a z let me find out so i wiggle up a little more it's a well-constructed hallway of dwarvish make (groans) yeah his heart beats once a century so let him go push them incinerator or lasers that was a great jump for me and my character light the brazier yeah but it's vax is it for real you are lying are we still in the room no problem i'll get it down is there anything going on in the tunnel on the outside of this door where we are temperature check anything like that natural 20 there's no ash on the floor in the hallway that we are in right now right i don't want that door to fucking open all of a sudden are there still charred wooden pieces in the middle of it it's not the source of the flame not for that much heat look for dwarvish i'm aces with that but they're revealed by heat when you're a big fire the walking thing-- sure do you take damage from fire so you should be in here we also have an unseen servant it might be a depression on the wall or something the regular buttons or the magic ones no depression no toggle i've got this you guys oh minus two 17 fifth element anyone oh look breath of grog reveals all look behold two lines i breathed on the wall if you're looking at the door we came in grog blew on the lower right two vertical lines what about above the door it is opposite of the mirror right if one's a door and the other one's a door constitution check to see who passes out first can i clear off the door area that we walked through i only know dwarven writing i don't know runes the runes are part of the dwarven language so i know them help me pike yeah i would like to decipher what these symbols mean i hold her up to the upper left corner of the doorway three all right now to the upper right-hand corner okay i put her on the ground and i say okay look at the lower right-hand corner and now the lower left-hand corner i have the same thing as laura yes should we check around the mirror frame to see if there's anything to dust off the mirror frame can i wipe off the edges around the frame and see if there's anything around the frame of the mirror since i seem to be so good at this three it's clear we found everything there is to find well there's no saying that it will activate if we do it correctly i have a lance it's almost broken you have a slightly splintered lance yeah let's go hurry we don't know how long it will stay open for we beat a door iron stairs stone stairs these are dwarven steps that are relatively shallow 25 you said can i look for a doorknob or a keyhole is there shattered remnants of the door any doorknob or a keyhole that's on the ground or anything two roll roll again i'd like to see the temple if i can well look all right my gloves-- (whispering) my gloves come from the heart of a ruined primordial titan so if maybe they harvested pieces of my gloves and it's in a temple i don't know you smart people could do something with that yes yep they're just buzzing are they humming more nope just humming two steps closer to the temple are they appearing buzzing more ooh 19 we are also looking for the sword of kas what's if it's in the temple why did he choose this 200 miles away once we entered is how far away we are from vasselheim 200 miles with steps of we have time to check the temple no don't do it i'm cool i'll vote for a temple party i need the carpet sam saved our asses natural one on the chain literally on the text chain a big statue just fell all right we move accordingly we could just go straight up 26 natural 20 with gil's dice nice am i hitting them yeah okay reckless great weapon master 31 for the first one okay cool can i use the other strike on another reckless great weapon that'll hit that's like 30 32 we might want to save that turnt undead 28 days later they run okay how about i don't move and somebody with flying ability go to check out that blue glowy window when we were at the opening we were 50 to 60 feet away so should we fly up to that window let's do it 26 is there a story he is invisible isn't he if he destroys vasselheim he does his miracle his display of power and he will be even stronger that is not an option i don't think a long rest is in the cards and he may be too strong at that point how about we get ready to leave i'll get on the carpet who's on the broom with vex no who is on the broom with you do you want to get on the carpet with me and he can fly well kick trinket out of the necklace and i'll get in there all right so how do we fly how do we do that yeah sometimes you just got to leap okay who burns a spell to become an animal you do that probably what if only half the room leaves though they don't give a shit do it i'm on the carpet we're ready to go percy and vex are on the broom yeah i have to be yep i can absolutely do that i have a hooded lantern that has fuel in it it will even burn when it lands it's been sitting in there for four years if they chase the jewel fuck the jewel and we'll leave put the bones down gently not the lantern i take the hooded lantern and i (laughs) i throw the fucking piss out of it oh that's good 19 if the entrance is here i'm throwing it in the opposite direction of where we are are they far away from the other ones that aren't leaving yet bag of holding it doesn't hurt my hand or anything does it cool we've got that yes we fly up 18 debbie downer remember we have the-- yeah [break] do you want me to pull it out no undead right no creatures nobody that's going to (whoop) to the shiny blue light that's slow is it a cut jewel or is it rough we don't have identify or anything like that do we marisha and i think we should try and smash it what else are we going to do to it before we face el vecna s√≠ or we spike it down the hole and it causes a hydrogen bomb and we shatter this titan in half it's blue right that is the color of hydrogen it is known it's palm-sized right no these are stone-gray this is blue crystal it could be a soul or something does pike have anything that detects a soul well then i don't know what else to do i think we keep moving we'll think about smashing it when we take our rest maybe a cause will reveal itself is there any writing or engraving or runes on the edge of the circle that's been engineered also fair to assume that whatever's on the other side of that door-- whoa use your legs really use your legs is there any decorating or writing or scratching around the door frame or wall around the door anything other than a portal to go through how far apart are the doors do we want to have keyleth there in case 900 undead zombies start pouring through and she can wall of stone the door i will try and remove one of the doors i don't know how to delineate between them sure yeah it's a circle that one 25 i didn't get that sense at all shall i are the hinges on this side so it looks like it opens towards me i'll pull open the door should i punch the rubble i make my way around 20 on the dot a rockslide continues onward slick dry dope that's awesome i'm getting creepy as fuck now i've got the immovable rod i'll be the caboose i'll go ahead and take the immovable rod out and have it in my hand they're dry-rotted they'll break easy after you're done with them i'll actually take them okay i got them i've got one i've got two actually i've got two vials of underwater breathing any other boxes to smash and undead immovable rod's out you already did 40 point of damage without doubling how much damage total don't fuck me gil no 21 that's weird for you we're not up at the top are we as i hear the sweet melodical miami vice tunes of warfare being played can i double dash up past my mates and into the fray yeah straight towards them then can i use dash to go the rest of the way now i only have my bonus action left so can i go into a rage that's my turn what does wall of force do can i walk through that shit will it which was that way right (counting) 60 is how far away he is it's a sphere of annihilation i do i have danger sense it fucks you up yeah it hurts real bad 16 take my life but not my beard does the sphere of annihilation get an attack of opportunity if i run away it's real bad they can but at least they'll be here who can get to the other side you have dimension door but that's it right that's the only person that has that kind of a thing the wall of force no and you need to focus or is it a random hey man that was a nice try no what ghosts or wraiths my fucking god and scanlan's in five feet of her it explodes near my head and i'm like stop shooting into this thing that's my fault i'm going to try and run through the wall of force it's only five feet of my movement and we'll see what happens probably some eyelids do i go anywhere not even an inch what if i channel all the rage from my life and i draw on the undead okay cool i'm going to turn around and run the other way no it didn't even give apparently (counting) 50 right there yeah that ends my turn we can't do anything nobody knows disintegrate or anything or yourself really okay thank you and the previous ruling was it worked oh god come on maybe it needed to be something else i am wickedly out of my element i'm running from an 8-ball yeah i am aren't i okay cool i'm going to put my faith in scanlan that some sort of impossible miracle happens (counting) 30 right up against the wall can i look to the left down that hallway can i see down there at all is it blocking the hallway off from vision is that a moveable space it hadn't finished doing it not enough to make a concentration check i'm there i can't get into that hole anymore can i fair enough i will hold my action until someone comes within melee distance he's upset that he miscalculated the dm wants blood tiny little nubs damn it matt why'd you have to back up yeah do it take your time baby take your time taliesin give him a backrub come on let's focus up here there you go support feel the love do your thing listen shadow of war comes out october 10th a lot of us are in it come on vax why don't you go down the hallway and see if anyone else is coming keep watch two-face some other voice starts coming out of him it might be high dude you might have to roll a 30 indiana let it go yeah but it only makes a hole its size it's two feet across plus remember the guy was concentrating super hard so it's the only thing scanlan will probably be able to do do we know how far the sphere can move in a single movement the sphere can only move 15 feet no they have to tell the truth when you do speak with dead i think i know that oh shit
