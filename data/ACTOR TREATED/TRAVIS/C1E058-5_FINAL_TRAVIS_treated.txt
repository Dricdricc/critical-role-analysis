manslaughter is all that they charge-- both of them -- critical role on an international tour baby steps totally i don't think grog knows why would i count those things no i just know once a year people give me sweet things and cake get your hand off me sam what about you next question that's true you can find him at emerald knights scanlan it is (gasps) any plans to come to nashville tennessee i work for the titans and could possibly do something cool for you guys if the cowboys are playing the titans maybe we will i'll take it i did i played some college ball tight end a button a bootleg to the left no i'm catching the ball question will vax and gilmore ever end up together yeah pretty bad you killed it man it was awesome taliesin what kind of things do you have in your car for this sort of scenario there was a question that said how much do you all love hamilton right now we're all obsessed oh good question sam how much time do you spend on your goblet do you guys jump on the shipping bandwagon or is it completely weird for you we just watch we just watch and admire we are not seeing hamilton before lin leaves who is more useful bixby or trinket critical role the musical's still a ways off it's still under development it's following the lin-manuel thing it's a seven-year timeline started my own goliath barbarian you're welcome oh it said if you guys get the airship who would be the captain and what positions would you man i was a fighter not a paladin or a barbarian but a fighter laura and and we lived we lived he does yeah it all comes from a beer mug or one of his appendages grog's got too much love to single it out for one person liam would you hire me as a voice actor no that was a question from the chat laura do you think stealing the broom was enough to change alignments liam did it go better than you expected were you nervous dming for your friends and would you be open to doing it again we are totally looking forward to the live show by the way anybody that can join us will join us we hope to do that and much more so hopefully it'll be a good starting point it's on the bottom of your-- it's on the bottom of your damn tankard not a question tickets were gone in minutes sometimes it breaks yeah what was craven edge's full stats this is a good question for a bunch of nerds favorite musical besides hamilton laura and my first love was phantom yeah it was fifth grade i would say besides hamilton it's once for me would you be able to survive in the world that liam just created as yourselves i was trying to kill sam look at it it was at the bottom of the sheet liam wrote it in roll for deception check i didn't use second wind are there any hashtag questions very hairy baby hairy baby i would kill the green dragon yeah actually we want to turn him to our side i mean i can't really answer that at once it's a complicated question but if you stay tuned every thursday at 700pm you might learn the answer those are different voice actors there was a good question that said does doing so much vo in video games decrease or increase your enjoyment of playing them sam this is a question for you or if you do a lot of porn would you watch it when you're getting off to answer your question we do love playing the video games meet and greet will be for vip tickets at the live thing i saw that one yeah there's going to be a 30 minute q and a afterwards and then we'll have a short meet and greet backstage where people can shake hands get stuff signed i think the vip seats are the first three rows of the theater we had to have some sweet internet signal for tech reasons so we're doing it in a movie theater with stadium seating we're going to have a stage on the floor while we project it on the movie screen it'll be great we'll narrate it what is the scariest moment for you so far in the critical role campaign i would say i didn't want to die by kevdak's hand i thought that was going to happen i would almost be okay with dying at any other moment i just didn't want to die at that point it was great for the story will we dress as our characters at the live show we only wear those outfits on the weekends when we have parties with each other let's take a couple more we've got a couple more minutes you put our life at great risk often i had to chase after you and save you like i do every day it was okay yeah i was proud that was good yeah that was good you mapped out that studio perfectly do you ever feel like mercer is picking on you laura taliesin and sam your old les mis audition got posted on the internet recently is there any other old work that you would like to see come to light i remember that commercial where you were the dweeb right hot cheeto you broke it off man i was shocked let's take two or three more and we'll wrap it up the live game will be streamed and if the first live show goes really well then maybe we will make it to other cities for live shows but it's super early on vip is sold out i will never give my allegiance to the green bay packers do the titanstone knuckles level up any higher than they already are i keep seeing gencon we'll just say stay tuned i keep seeing this one i don't always play a warrior type in video games i get to play various other things we all get to stretch every once in a while yeah was there a joke earlier did somebody joke am i a joke right now what's it like living with a dragon dangerous keep her fed and let her sleep do you have any character regrets you wish you could do over that's a good one yeah that'll be the last one there have been a couple yeah as long as you're still alive there's no looming regrets but there have been after the immediate game moments where you're like oh if i'd just done this instead i was thinking of it and i pussed out we jumped into a big hug afterwards i wish i had smashed that skull last bonus question pirates or ninjas ninjas take it three to two all right we're done liam you are our temporary dm for the night
