barbarian has an appetite for the two great loves in his life combat women and ale (chuckle) (record scratch) wait easily the brains of the group grog is often consulted for his vast knowledge of shapes colors and (chuckle) shiny things also ale in his early years armed with his two-handed great axe grog often enjoyed proving his might amongst the ranks of his family's wandering herd but after coming upon an unsuspecting elderly gnome in the woods he objected to the killing of such an innocent life a creature of impulse grog felt only pity for this-- well this terrified little thing and his disobedience cost him dearly beaten bloody and banished by the herd leader his uncle kevdak grog was abandoned and left to die exiled from his herd it was then that the relative of the very gnome he fought to save saved him it was the kindness of a gnome cleric named pike that healed grog bringing him back from death's edge and they have remained close friends ever since most nights grog can be found challenging entire taverns to wrestling matches ha or accompanying scanlan to the nearest house where you pay for lady favors also ale no he's drunk yes hoo baby we ate already right so let's
