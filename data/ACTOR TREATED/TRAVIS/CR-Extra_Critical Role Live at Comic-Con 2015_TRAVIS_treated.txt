oh you me hi i'm travis i play grog super smart i never played any-- huh also ale i never played any rpgs before this but i had asked around our little voice actor community for years like yuri lowenthal and liam and matt mercer i think the first time i asked you about it was on a mo-cap session i was like i hear you do the master of dungeonings what does that look like and he started to tell me and i couldn't concentrate on anything beside the fact that i wanted to do it then liam had that birthday party and i came 20 minutes late i walked in to laura being extremely posh and bargaining with somebody for something liam was going yes of course oh hello sir i was terrified i think matt had said just prepare your class and your race i said goliath barbarianhe goes okay so what's your name i was like um grog he was grog what do you do i was like i make fine leather boots he goes okay bootmaker grog and we were off to the races but that has led us to this somehow matt pulls out a d20 he's like roll it (laughter) we're on a baseball field (cheering) people going oh keyleth's mom man you're like yeah wait what right that's a real thing that's a real thing my intelligence is still six we love scanlan by the way every time he comes up with a song i ask him afterwards i'm like did you have two songs on retainer that you were going to sing during the show true story we still don't get it right what's the explanation behind yours other than just coming up with it because i hadn't made a name yet because i'm an idiot i loved monkey island the game and i remember that was my introduction to grog i always figured that a barbarian needs a really simple name so grog was the first stupid light that turned on in my brain and that's what i am and you came up with my last name that's right because i got possessed or something at one point it was bad you it's about farting i did that too i jumped out of the window with no feather fall you go jump out of the window and i'm like great idea jump out of the window you cast feather fall and i'm like shit live and learn my most heroic thing was when you crushed my cask of ale and i avenged it by headbutting the giant in the face true love people true love we've seen no cosplay this sucks when pike died she was crying she was crying she was crying you were crying i was asleep no matt you could tell he did not want to say the things he was saying and it was only because we rolled extremely well when it counted that we got that thing that brought you back to life every time we go unconscious and then the death sets in against the beholder thing i was just hoping we got around to pike or keyleth so that greater restoration could come around i wouldn't permanently be dead there's a chance that one of these days we didn't even talk in voices
