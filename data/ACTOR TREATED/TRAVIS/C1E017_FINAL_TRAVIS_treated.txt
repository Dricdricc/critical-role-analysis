deep shit i'll be at the bar the frying on this chicken is exquisite fuck right listen up if you have ale then you have a friend in grog strongjaw a goliath of towering height and size this barbarian has an appetite for the two great loves in his life combat women and ale (chuckle) (record scratch) wait easily the brains of the group grog is often consulted for his vast knowledge of shapes colors and (chuckle) shiny things also ale in his early years armed with his two-handed great axe grog often enjoyed proving his might amongst the ranks of his family's wandering herd but after coming upon an unsuspecting elderly gnome in the woods he objected to the killing of such an innocent life a creature of impulse grog felt only pity for this-- well this terrified little thing and his disobedience cost him dearly beaten bloody and banished by the herd leader his uncle kevdak grog was abandoned and left to die exiled from his herd it was then that the relative of the very gnome he fought to save saved him it was the kindness of a gnome cleric named pike that healed grog bringing him back from death's edge and they have remained close friends ever since most nights grog can be found challenging entire taverns to wrestling matches ha or accompanying scanlan to the nearest house where you pay for lady favors also ale i never puke what food i think i'm good now that sounds like a plan water it's pretty smooth (laughter) i think we have to go back on the airship to go get it the braving grounds we could see if they need any-- since we-- i lost us a lot of (tearing up) money some more okay we can see if they need anyone for hire go and have a (tearing up again) being strong plus we have the poo cell phone keyleth do you have an opinion to hit to kiss yeah i'm a goliath what about it i have a question for you vax the braving grounds that are here would it be to our benefit to collect maybe some coin and practice our (gets choked up) fighting before we go to the maybe-friendly fire jugglers' village not the crucible don't rub my face in it not in the crucible to the braving grounds was that the crucible i was in (choked up) i could've totally could've i saved it for too late i did it too late but then in the balls and we can use weapons if they suck right yes can we go find an armory or somewhere that sells pointy things i tuck that inside of my belt-beard just so it's nice there one little part of it just flapping out oh it is a new day nine 90 it goes the other way my life is shit i can't do anything i'm hanging myself where's the bridge
