hammer this oh that's hanging off flat edge that does feel like a ready set laura and i take one step back i'm pretty sure that would be 150 points of damage i'm picturing the anvil right in front of me and he's off to the side right and the hammer is somewhere between me and him seven oh it went hanging off yeah but i've got to get to the anvil to do that shit okay cool instead of walking towards the anvil can i start walking to the right towards one of those chains that's dangling on is it tilting it down okay can i keep moving in that direction i'll stop well he might swing at the thing if it got closer so unless we're short on ideas we might have to starburst this thing scatter it ioun helped pelor helped you thinkers better think we still can't see what's sending up those what about

feel like you're filling a playground with gravel right now i feel like he's playing putt putt golf with us cool oh right then i held my action for that should i try and smith yeah but what purpose would it serve i could try yeah maybe he'd stop moving if i grabbed the hammer oh but i held my action until i had sight you're on the hammer aren't you should i try pulling up the hammer and see if that does something okay i'll try and pull the chain up to grab the hammer i will rage and that's it can i turn around and look now that i'm right up next to the core anvil is there anything that i'm noticing about it that would move or knock off a switch or a button doesn't look just like a flipping anvil yeah okay cool that's a two i never see shit 190 there are four chains hanging off of the
