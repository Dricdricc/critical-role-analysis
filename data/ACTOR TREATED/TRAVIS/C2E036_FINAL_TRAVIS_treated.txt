(silly voice) dungeons and dragons chick-a-chick ah yeah man they might get me confused with you just because our voices are so-- that's a good activity yeah trying to spread that good word just run up and bumper tap them yeah it's like it jumped off a cliff and killed myself for no reason with nothing achieved i loved it so good the recap really sticks it in and turns it yeah i'm at the helm is there anybody down below seeing about that yeah i was going to say i'm at the helm beau if you'll stay with me we need to-- we need to check the ship for damages because we tried to blow it up a couple of times and then if the rest want to head down and see what's below any chance you want to come up and help me i pull a big piece of splintered wood out of my forehead throw it over to the side in time i'm good thanks i'll bark out make sure the sails are open tighten all the everything off and then check the exterior of the ship if you can just for breaks in the wood fire marks any damage that you can see more dope nice less fancy will actually do us some good in these waters so that's good give it a little flick fuck me oh god help oh jesus christ (laughter) oh my god fuck travis and we'll be listening to him lift that rocking chair outside oh yes matthew do us right ooh yeah great fucking call it's a cluster out in the lucidian ocean jesus maybe i jump overboard another one what when he gives descriptions and we don't fucking writes notes it bites us in the ass kind of appropriate that's a big promotion for him carpenter to first mate time of day-ish oh shit straight out from shore full sail just trying to put distance between us and the coast i know we have time to decide on our route ooh sports car where is marius not to put you too at ease navigating was never really my thing either i'm better than most but i do need to decide on where we're going if we want to use marius we're going to have to wake his ass up and ask him some questions yeah wake him up not-- (stammers) yeah probably not listen we'll let you go back to your slumber right quick where were you headed with this ship i assume to meet up with avantika yeah right but now we've changed your plans yes you're with us and avantika needs the sphere correct no but i do do you know where she is i'll reach behind my back and use minor image again and show the sphere who were you going to give this to right shadycreek run where we were you wouldn't happen to know where jawgrasp called home would you or where he was heading next do you feel comfortable on a ship we are kind of limiting him he's got big poofy sleeves and everything he's not going to swim anywhere you could rid him of that i hear sleeves are hey welcome to the crew of the-- well we'll have to rename this thing and i'll summon the falchion and just swipe through the ropes oh pal that seems unnecessarily adept i can't tell i don't know is he an innocent middleman that doesn't know what he's shipping or is it just-- listen what we're going to ask for is that you be as forthcoming as you possibly can be would you mind walking over to the side of the ship there and tell me how far nicodranas looks right now yeah can't see it can you stuck with us so i'm going to need everything that comes out of your mouth to be the truth my goodness he is very sensitive about this i'm just trying to set the tone for the ship do me a favor go below decks and try and find us some drink will you jeez yeah seriously are they coming up oh no kidding ax-head is about the sphere one i certainly feel like i have gained abilities yeah i don't know though is this where they were headed this is a map to a reef i know the reefs of the lucidian ocean this is very familiar yeah well otherwise you wreck the ship well there's the everplume reef there's the torrid reef but this looks like the inkclaw reef (groans) that was less 11 there are a lot there're quite a few there are a few reefs that protect certain islands one of which is the darktow isle you don't want to go there that would narrow it to two in my mind if it's in the lucidian ocean one is far northwest of the darktow and one is more straight east by several hundred miles what am i after well i'd like to see-- i keep saying avan-teek-a but it's-- i want to know what she wants the sphere for i want to know why vandren had it in the first place what else are they looking for does it have a brother sister sphere i don't know no i do this doesn't look like darktow to me darktow is more in a u shape you really have to go around the whole damn thing to get in without touching the reef it's a pain in the ass no that sounds great to me you wouldn't let her do that would you we have plenty of time it's quite a distance away so it could either be the deep row reef or it could be the inkclaw reef fair enough we'll have plenty of time i could-- well we have to pick one one's to the northwest and one's down to the southeast from where we are now if you want-- we do have the stars on our side so we'll be able to navigate easier we could drop sail and-- oh you're going to be so helpful in this you're the ship's navigator i dub thee the mist navigator the what the mistake sam and do i remember if the deep row or the inkclaw one is closer than the other my knowledge is limited to what i've journeyed through before the inkclaw is closer we could try there-- at least set course for that direction how does that sound yeah we could do it yes if nothing else to look out for other ships i'll tell you what we could do there's a joint stop on the trade routes an island called brokenbank we could make it there i'm familiar with how we would get there and we could try and find some extra hands almost one-and-a-half times the distance i think --ish yeah i've never sailed directly to the inkclaw reef i just know where it is because i've seen maps yeah we could return to somewhere else along the-- nicodranas or port damali i didn't mean for that to go the way it did yeah it's not looking good for us right now i'll call out to beau as she's walking off how's it looking down there spirits high (laughter) okay no-- i thought i'd ask how are you feeling yeah i don't feel very good it's been a day right we were going to talk to algar we ended up killing his bodyguards and setting that thing free and then we were going to go and talk to marius and then we ended up killing the whole fucking crew and captain minus one why didn't we just go talk i feel like we've abandoned the use of-- here's my thing right magic's new to me this sword is new to me i didn't have most of this all of my life all i had was my words to get out of situations to try and heal conflict to try and outsmart somebody now all of a sudden i have this power and i feel like it's a shortcut and that i've been cheating myself i don't feel like i've put forth the same effort to resolve something because i can just will something into happening that doesn't seem right to me how does caleb feel about all this oh really i don't know just doesn't sit right how's caduceus that was actually very profound i get that maybe we try not to do that i check you you check me we check the group otherwise i feel like caduceus is not going to be the last person that thinks about-- yeah we need to decide on a destination whether we turn around and-- were we in the open quay or were we in the wayfarer's we're in the wharf the restless wharf we can turn around and come back to the open quay or where the wharfmaster was and try and get in and out real fast with some crew or we can head to port damali or we can head out to the open sea but we do need to pick a destination caduceus oh bosun-- we don't have any guns there's not guns or powder-- yes caduceus thank you for making all this we need to decide on a destination we're going to need more hands that are able to figure out where we are going next not those docks we could go to a separate landing site port damali we could turn around and try to go to the-- where was the wharfmaster the dwarf ingus ignus it's a different section of the city hiring a crew fuck i don't know not a ton our quickest bet is just to turn back into-- what area was the wharfmaster ignus in it was the restless wharf that's gone real well for us in the past 24 hours but go ahead yeah could you do this in a night sure although the more time that passes the longer word has to spread we're a little deep for an anchor sure let's go in circles 12 miles off coast we'll just go in circles in shifts you can navigate in a pattern yeah yes i don't know either one of those is fine yeah i vote for sailing up outside of the wharfmaster area taking a little skiff in just getting some crew and getting the fuck out of here i'd keep the ship out of there just in case the zello the jello zhelezo have come up and said (exaggerated accent) there was a ship and the fireball detonated on the side of it and ours has a bunch of burn damage i don't-- the splinters are in my forehead i'll go second it does not it's going to be a giant dick and balls if we do okay how you doing oh yeah that's a good way to deal a plan i have a series of expectations but i wouldn't call it a plan i'm in pursuit of something and i know what maybe the next couple of steps are but past that-- heavy i take it you haven't seen much combat you ever fought a giant water genie me neither never even seen one before yeah well yeah my new life pretty much yeah it's open yasha what makes you say that yeah do you naturally have the ability to feel that out of people it's very insightful for your job when they're grieving you seem to pick up on the stuff that's not said otherwise i don't really know what i'd be doing fair enough okay i'll give you advantage i think we'll expand our travel pattern to skate out wider we don't necessarily want to own that here they are very stern about mistakes i agree with that move on i think that's wise we'll make our way up to the docks where the wharfmaster is which is a separate docks from where-- remember it took a while to walk from one to the other and we're only taking the skiff in and only people that don't look like us can take the skiff in to get the crew that we're going to look for what the mistake can i okay let's try to forge a pink slip for the mistake i am an actor in real life you should probably ask matt they don't even have to board us because we're going to stay out in the river we're just taking the skiff in how about we get into the docks first so we can get some crew i should probably stay on the ship do you know how to move the ship if you need to all of a sudden then i'll stay on the ship you guys go on take a big bunch of money go get the crew what is the argument to that you're not i'll write a list listen last time the only guy who could move the ship was below deck i'm not leaving my wingman i'm not making this mistake a second time no i'm staying on the ship yeah you'll stay with me i'll make you the little lackey that moves shit i'll keep marius and i'll keep gallan i don't know a quarter mile off the coast a couple hundred yards i don't know how close do you get to the ship if you want to take the skiff in i know i wished i'd picked an astronaut then i wouldn't be fucked (laughter) which i do because i want to punish them 150 yards based off the last game right what if a zhelezo ship comes around and arrests yasha we can at least get-- we drop sail we take off and i leave you guys in the cove yep 16 this is very complicated i have not really seen what would the point be because the wharfmaster that's all he looks at i'm open to all fucking suggestions i just wanted to park a boat and go get some crew the filigree on the borders there's little nut sack let's take it into dock against all the advice of zhelezo looking for a burned ship that had a fireball blackened charred wood on the outside of it in a sphere shape i like it let's go into the dock i love this plan nope this is an adventuring party let's go into the dock the one that we were not just killing people at we will tell marius and gallan to stay below the entire time and yasha the wharfmaster ignus you want me to do it sure i'll go find that guy with five gold yes we're trying to get in and out of port as fast as we can looking to acquire a few crew members would you do me a favor though i'll produce the five gold and say would you mind telling any inquiring minds that we've been here for awhile and that we're coming from-- the mistake that's correct yes and we are coming over from-- what was the port in between port damali and this one yeah we're out of port zoon and we're just trying to get there and back in the same day if we can 15 is there a posting for people looking for crew positions a sign okay i'll tell them the amount of supplies that i think they need to pick up for a month's worth of travel seven no six crew of six we need a boatswain well we've got the cook we need a quartermaster we need a navigator and a captain if we don't need a cook or a carpenter-- sweet let's call it a crew of five captain navigator quartermaster cook and another boatswain slash barrel keeper me ten yep yep no we're at the docks right now we'll go to the seafloor bounty first we never know we might kill them so-- jason voorhees jester that's all right go get them we don't look like ourselves me apparently we were hoping your services weren't spoken for few weeks at the most maybe only a couple a week 27 gold a week 19 we can accommodate that well then yeah yes just keep him around you're off the boat why do they call it the inky claw because we have this map and we have a navigator that doesn't mean that we can go from one destination on a map that we saw to another we still need to follow the trade routes right yeah if we stay on the trade route we have to go here and then down and then come across or we go here (laughs) do crows swim well i want to make everyone aware of the dangers okay if we take the trade route it will take three and a half times longer to get there than if we just go from point a to point b but point a goes across uncharted waters and on this map there are giant tentacles coming out of the water probably just for flavor could just be artist's interpretation to try and fill in blank space doesn't mean anything nicodranas and the inkclaw is down to your lower right hand corner they're like little sea cucumbers we also have this map which is at the top of the inkclaw reef that will guide us through the reef instead of coming this direction and then down and underneath which is what you would probably be doing all right we'll instruct orly-- put what in the map is that a goblin thing we're going to instruct orly to navigate from north to south to the top of the reef using this we are trying to catch up with a captain that we need to make contact with i think they might yep caduceus are you excited about these haunted stories whereas he still hasn't found what he's looking for never has there been a more worthless perception check to nugget or your mom sure ten mm-hmm yeah they're beautiful last thing you want to is jump in there though that is a bad time yeah jellyfish sting and it's quite painful no no i'm more anxious to get there my curiosity i suppose overrides my fear no i don't think i had gotten that far plus i have the sphere captain avantika doesn't i feel like we take care of ourselves pretty well thank you sad yeah i suppose i get sad are you sad jester i'm sometimes sad about the things that i had before that i won't have anymore i sometimes wish that things were different what makes you sad i am sorry that we left in the way that we did would your mom ever think of leaving nicodranas right what would you want for her to stay there and grow old or-- that's very noble of you yeah well how about on some of these islands i've heard that there is treasure hard to find i'm not making any promises but if we play our cards right and we take care of each other we might return a bit wealthier than we left or give it to your mom and have her go find the gentleman but she's just amazing yeah don't be sad your mom is very proud of you that much was clear don't mention it they decided not to kill us of course he is nice solid i saw right next to the cut your own keys booth next to the dock there was a rent-a-captain he would sit there with a corncob pipe and he's like argh me is a-- my captain name captain captain tusktooth nope you never want to see them natural 20 lower the inboard motor fire at-- really one ounce one ounce one inch punch i'll take the last watch is it at night at all you can talk to them but they can't talk back i'll hand off the wheel to someone and i'll go down to the side of the ship and i'll summon the falchion with not a lot of people on the deck paying attention hopefully can i reach over the side and dip the tip of the sword into the ocean does the eye do anything okay i'll summon it back (quietly) from whence it came mm-hmm ooh seven professor thaddeus (whistle) i'll sound a general alarm there was something that took off from the mast it had wings it was pretty large right i don't know i didn't see it's too dark yasha had 16 have they already slashed the sails 16 i'll aim two eldritch blasts up at one of the two harpies that's flying up above the mast 19 on the first one and the second one is ooh 25 that is-- oh shit where is the 1d10 ten nope no sorry i was calling that out like an idiot 11 points of damage on the first one and seven points of damage on the second one that's it there's only three left right i thought there were only five oh the song broke it didn't die didn't we say we weren't going to try and solve things with fists (cawing) yeah did you do that on purpose shit throw the sword no fuck bugging out oh smart since when do you have any medicine for him well get at it just cup his nose just (breathes) ja sure caleb always pretending he's hurt you know how much that hurts do you want to lead the prayer he could be on the edge of life and maybe the prayer was that-- i thought it was jester's healing i just watched how do we prevent further heart episodes from-- more friendship beau go give caleb a hug like a voldemort hug how's that sail coming jester are we putting limits on your cuisine taliesin start something start moving his feet and his eyes stay in the same place are you listening underneath the boat using your sonar i don't know why i keep volunteering for fucking perception 14 12 excellent (laughter) well let's prepare to navigate through it i just picked it as a backstory i didn't know i'd need to know fucking anything about sailing jesus these are survival checks 16 got to use the dodeca that's a ten survival is minus two for me not very wise there's not a hit point counter on the wheel that's ticky tock yeah one and two we're on the third natural 20 13 i have no idea abandon ship sure i'll drag that out and jump over the side and try and push up against the hole yeah i'm thrilled we can still go underwater though right i throw the mattress in i jump in after it and i try and go under-- i press it against the outside of the ship and hope the current (suctioning) 20 i'll take the sword shove it-- no i'm just kidding yeah i say from outside the boat yeah i'll let it go i'll tug on the line and get myself pulled back up into that boat yeah we got to get the crow's nest out of the boat yes we've done the final turn so we could try and push towards the island but we're going to have to beach it what's your spell do we've approached the island we have another boat what but i think it's daytime right if we can see them they can see us i will try to increase our speed towards the island in the direction away from them and aim to get on the island if we can it just depends on where the ship was if it was directly ahead of us or towards the north or the south we'd obviously go the opposite way we're going to the southern tip we're going to ground this ship we're going straight into the beach and we're going to run our asses into the fucking jungle i don't know we're not there yet i throw nott overboard full sail i grab her and bring her back no i'm just kidding oh yeah mm-hmm yep does it have some trap doors on the side of the-- yeah why not we've got the gray wave one uh-huh i use mask of many faces to make myself look like captain jawgrasp you lower the flag and-- hmm fuck i don't know jesus christ yeah fuck it we're going to beach the ship we're just going to keep driving towards the island yep how far are we that's another question oh no no nevermind no we'll slow down the ship a little okay yeah we'll lower the flags slow the ship mm-hmm cool let's lower the rope ladder over the side and welcome them aboard i can what oh i don't know if he did that so let's not yep
