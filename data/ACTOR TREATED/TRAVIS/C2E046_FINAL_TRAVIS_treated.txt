(slurred) we play dungeons & dragons y'all going to hype me to death family show family show sam i don't think that's real i think that's-- beautiful maybe erase your browser history you're fired that's incredible five players is a lot phew that's good matt why do you make things so evil oh man how did that happen that's insane it was a lot of fun aw shit as you do that's what i was going to ask what time is it we just started and we slept in all the way till noon you can take your backpack off well i suppose we should mosey out and get the lay of the land as it were i don't know why i'm like this i slept real heavy mm-kay (laughter) what else could it be yeah i'll relay all that stuff in my own tongue and say i'm sure there's stuff it grows a little bit each time i come by here so there could be new stuff i haven't seen before worth a look what about paper aren't you always needing papier yeah of course all right fair enough where's jester how are you doing this morning jester yeah you want to go out and explore a little bit are you okay i know the day's escapades were a bit much little close yeah well you did too every time i popped into wherever i was i could see you pop in and then pop out and i kept wanting to go make sure you knew we were getting the fuck out oh yeah well it was the damnedest thing i just touched it like you know didn't know if it was rough or smooth or cold didn't expect to be like (glass shattering) ah none of that shit boop maybe i won't do that so much anymore yeah what are you grinning at goblin are we not all intrigued by things that don't belong or seem out of place yes that's fair i didn't even ask what was in the room before i got ripped out of there wait a minute when i disappeared you didn't immediately come and try and find me you went and got stuff hmm yeah that's true how about i just keep my hands in my pockets going forward into strange new rooms by long-dead wizards potentially i think i got a button around here somewhere thank you yeah need that uplifting-- yeah i appreciate that that is a great idea in fact you should lead the way i have a feeling you'll be able to find the best spot oh the gangplanks it's right over there first mate show them how do you know where the fucking exit is because i might not as we make our way by can i identify a low-ranking member of one of the crewmen of one of those ships as they're perhaps reaching for a bundle or something you there by gods you guys are stocking up something fierce amazing do you mind if i ask where all this traffic is going oh i understand i'm sorry to hear it's moving so aggressively are you concerned or do you feel strength in your numbers i'm sorry to hear that just in case our travels take us in your direction is there any particular route or island that we should avoid just to stay out of your hair that should be far away from where we're heading i wish you a safe journey my friend that's where they attacked yeah yeah we might return to a different empire yeah yeah they're from outside nicodranas i think they have bigger fish to fry plus we got a new boat right no indeed yeah it is one born out of circumstance we have every intention of paying i just haven't received the bill from my first mate yet you definitely don't i'll take care of it i'm the one touching little red things 295 325 yeah when they came and cleaned it out after the fucking razzle-dazzle i cut my gold in half holy shit yeah here is your 225 gold thank you for your careful inspection and repair of the ship oh in the next day or two we're just getting our bearings about us again we'll be out of your hair shortly i would love to tell you yes friend but the best i could do is let you know before sundown no we have stuff we have to do don't rush us out of here ooh nice yeah we'll find you i promise we'll be as expedient as possible walk inland yeah and eyes up as we pass things along the way we've got to make more of a fuss about that that's pretty cool yeah and so does the stuff that you make i just assumed you were conjuring you know sea pigeons and stuff seitan quinn-wah are we relatively free of furtive glances as we make our way through jester can i make you a plate okay cool should we bring caleb some food it's sweet you'll like it don't look at me i'm shit broke how many glasses did you have ren faire ah three o'clock she was on the boat beau but we did make you this plate of food i'll go over and find bentha and be like can we get one more plate of food please i'll hand that plate of food over to nott there you go no it's not for you we're fitting to explore a little that's not-- maybe some weapons or some potions that might help should we find ourselves-- i mean i would like to yeah i saw it in my visions and i haven't had any other dreams since i feel like this might be a good chance to put a dagger in it you know finish it up yeah i have a feeling it's right in the middle of the archipelago that's just south of here maybe a day and a half maybe two days most depending on-- just a little bit and then we can go back to land nott with the promise of land and no more requests to go to sea if you'll do this for me i would be most obliged thank you nott he was saying they've made their way south into the fucking town of nipple bottom-- felderwin yeah yeah we've been right near that area oh it's far more south than they've been previously really that maybe changes things point oh that is pretty far west they were going down the southern coast yeah most likely in an effort not to get flanked well i don't feel quite as energetic knowing that where you both are from is under siege it may only add a day or two at most i would be most appreciative i don't know i just thought i'd feel it out when i got there all current and past events taken into account no no god no-- no i do have two of these spheres and i can't help but notice the extra shamalamadingdong that avantika got by depositing one of them i could keep the third and certainly keep that crazy fucking snake at bay i would like to see this through otherwise i feel like i'll always be wanting to get back here right but he could be fucking anywhere i want to do this because we're here we can worry about that later it's a wide wide world we might have to go through port damali actually nicodranas is a little hot for us but we could we could let your mom know that you're okay well maybe see how you feel when we're on our way back we wouldn't want to go around the southern tip that's where the troops are heading i feel like danger might be that way it might be best to go the way we came so maybe some supplies something to buff us up a bit some bees yep yasha is there anything you need while we're in port anything you've been craving while we've been at sea we didn't have any idea that that was going to happen well let's make it an even seven like a week right because that sphere's pretty fucking sweet not that i have any interest in messing with it any further well yeah just a little there were fucking treasure troves in there not that i'm interested in that i'm all for playing it safe measured practical that's my middle name fjord practical-- fjord practical are there any potion shops around here no bigs no sweat are you going to show us the notches on your upper delt for all the ones that you-- fire it was pretty gnarly i was testing the texture it wasn't even a push i just touched it before we go on the bee tour if there's any time do we see any magic shops weaponry 16 so there's definitely one here three competing for the same turf oh fuck i put a lot of healing potions into my group why don't you buy us a couple potions (laughter) there's no greenery in xhorhas that's sad anybody else have anything else they want to grab you got that plate of food for caleb that you ate half of by all means is it still before sundown might get some money back pooping every flavor beans beans and beans and beans fucking ridiculous (whispering) write it on your body all over your body (whispering) memento (whispering) the frozen depths (whispering) oh farther north (whispering) off the map or on it fuck i thought it was time for some mercer mystery shit show our appreciation to these fuckers navigator set course for the gravid archipelago ar-chi-pelago ar-ka-pelagos ar-chi-pelago this is fucking unexpected the skies were pretty clear huh that is one smart cow of course storm sails it is on the double why aren't they up already [inaudible] orly do you see any way around this storm or just through it unacceptable push through safe practical measured i had advantage on it already 14 oh does it okay 14 no i'll stay up at the helm no get some rest i might need it in a bit when this dies down rage doesn't raise it me ooh 16 oh shit that's only the second time i think steady that's right plus your rage damage 2d6 on the second one oh that's a lot beforehand yeah ten jester get the hell out of there it hit you anyway you might as well do it because you'll get reckless back do you have any bonus actions both strikes for divine fury yeah but the sword has necrotic right or your shroud oh sorry yeah just once do you have a bonus action features and traits check your features and traits it's all pretty awesome yes you drop their speed to zero but if you make it reckless it's a straight roll advantage come on how far away is it from you on that mast one below your ac strength has advantage jester what's going on down there maybe see to the repairs first before you get your fucking tea less steady i may send orly or someone else below decks to go wake up beau yeah we're through the worst of it listen if for some reason yasha comes back up and starts swinging at a bunch of balls of light on the front of the ship just don't get involved i'm going to sleep (mumbling) nothing just going (gibberish) hey nice job really which direction are we pointed which is orly-- nice job plot a course that would put us right in the middle of all three it was the squalleater it's not our fault real poorly (cracking) we're going to head for the middle of all that maybe we're going to keep our eyes on the islands as we proceed but i do recall it being under the depths in my dream i saw from the top down and i hit the water right in the middle of them and kept going deeper and deeper mm-hmm yeah nope nope nope she put hers in the first temple i have two this might be numero dos and then i'll keep the third wait four spheres three temples that's right and as caleb can attest to that image that we saw in the temple was three spheres three chosen people underneath the entity i don't think they would have an influx of spheres to deal with nott you are a fantastic rogue you wouldn't let such an ambush befall us would you those that want to come can i will understand if you want to sit this one out agreed and i couldn't guarantee your safety up here while we're below the murky depths i hear there is an ancient button factory at the bottom of the waters-- you've heard of it as well the story's been lost to the ages since the great calamity you're in fair enough just in case can we keep an eye on the islands as we're moving in for any sign of structures civilization i'll send the perceptive fuckers up to the crow's nest you're aiding cad if we haven't seen anything on land i'd like to get in the middle and then send him below in my mind pictures yeah i did yeah well caduceus you're definitely coming all right yes one thing we should do can i get you guys to scurry up to the crow's nest one more time and give a gander for any ships yeah look really carefully coves inlets anything that might look like it might be hiding totally fine we're safe no it just seems like the obvious entrance yeah (background music) sorry my impulsiveness was starting to catch up again i just want to be honest (sighs) doesn't seem like there's a trap nott right we seem to be by ourselves at least up here yeah but i mean what's a couple of dead bodies on seaweed to people like us no bigs right about what time of the day is it right now let's get this thing done i do up for another scrap all right i'll look at the group and i will cast underwater breathing on everyone for 24 hours what's the distance from the middle of this archipelago to the nearest outer island i'll go to orly and say while we're underneath if you see another ship enter or danger present itself make for land and we'll find you you ready when we get under make sure to take a breath really quick you'll sink faster he won't he won't (heavy footsteps splash) 13 it's clear water does it look like it has four appendages oh no we can't halo drop in this bitch yeah we can pair up marisha and or at least two there's five pretty sure they look like they're on the look yeah who's got a good range who's got some good pop on a good range you does the water do anything to it there is one that is free how close do you need to be caleb i'm more of a fan of them coming to us frankly let's get in range of whatever caleb needs to do and then let's break off into three and four they can pick but they've got to come to us let's get within whatever you need 120 feet 100 feet we'll try to stealth within that range spread out 30 feet between us the two groups clerics with each group all of them at the same time wizard's choice how about just one and you pick i'll also send eldritch blast 26 and a 19 21 points of eldritch blast 25 to 20 two one oh well then you top me yeah plus zero 30 feet whoa is it just hers at advantage or all attacks against it i will join beau just in case someone decides to fuck around i'll fire the first two eldritch blasts at one of them that's swimming though not the one that's in melee of her that sucks that's a one and a two so i think both of those fucking miss that's incredible i'll fire the next two-- because i'm hasted so i have a second attack oh shit yeah i guess i'll just-- -- summon the falchion and take a swing at it it's a two i do nothing nothing (singing) shitty rolls what the fuck fucking bane man how many are up still so here's a question that very first one that we lit up like the godfather with my bonus action can i reach out since i was part of the killing of-- are these creatures humanoids can i reach forward and go (in a demonic voice) rise and i'll accursed specter the creature i'll say that and go (concussion sound) and throw two more eldritch blasts at the one that's remaining that's a 24 the other one is a 14 (singing) this is the age of aquarius that's ten points and eight so 18 great i'll take my speed and rush at it take a strike oh dope 16 1d8 plus-- two points of damage one plus one it's 1d8 plus one i don't see that on here i ain't been doing it i thought it would be added into the weapon naturally yeah it just says 1d8 plus one okay my charisma bonus is four yeah so it would be six on a two okay mm-hmm we have a friend i'll bring the specter forward i feel bad having frumpkin be the one that's always putting himself in harm's way thought i'd give him a friend i'll send the specter towards the mouth of the tower mm-hmm nope i just wanted to send him to the entrance yeah just to the front just to make sure the tower's not like (violent chomping) don't make that face i wouldn't put that past you for one second it's not a permanent thing just give it a try ruh-roh hey kids yeah we'll move closer i'm a bit faster i'll go hang back for a second i'll use 45 feet of my speed to move forward i'm still fucking hasted oh does it sorry now i have one level of exhaustion right are we above it it's at an angle right i'd like to spiral down slowly making my way around the top so i can see stealthily what is that for i do get advantage that's good ugh nine 16 the top of the tower is open and it continues through the middle i swim over to the edge of the tower to try and lean up against the side of it make myself less obvious out in the open water does somebody appear well don't want to go in that way i wave everybody down i will relay that there is a doorway down near the bottom but something poked its pretty head out kind of greenish-yellow couldn't quite see but it kind of looked like an overgrown shrimp crab-type thing kind of crustacean-y yeah might just be the local wildlife right what are the chances we could just send our guest here down or we could go through the tunnel i'd be fine with that i will command the specter to move towards the doorway and engage anything it finds just at the doorway i push him inside commotion balls ass three i don't know they're pretty resilient but okay well let's assume then-- shall we assume flanking positions you know if it's crustacean-y and it's treating this tower as a shell maybe i don't want to fight it in there how about we drop to the floor about 60 feet from the doorway and send in a care package yeah anything ranged see if we get lucky i'll descend to the floor keeping about 60 feet from the outside of the doorway you got a fluffernutter ready to go well i don't even know why you're down here i am you're on the floor right what's that do again got it yeah fuck did that accursed specter do any damage oh good okay good job carl what is that put seahorses instead oh shit i'm excited look at that forked tongue you got ass-tongue the baby's butt coming out of your mouth thank you matt what a great 2018 guys yeah seriously stay tuned for tomorrow night for liam's-- boof
