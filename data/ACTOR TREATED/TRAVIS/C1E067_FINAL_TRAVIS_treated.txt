i'm the smartest man alive and she gets to sleep with barbarians whenever she wants with the cloak yeah otherwise she walked back in her individual footsteps and then laid down the murderer who's shooting bullets oh no well scanlan throw it in the acid (laughter) i agree with what vax is going to say we should move first one of the night yeah what are you going to mix it with some spice and get high yup here you go true and when we do we should set a little ambush in case it sets off any alarms ripley's a piece of shit keyleth don't soften the blow she's a piece of shit nice job (laughter) if she's anything like you she might've paid someone to magically upgrade it for her what do you want to do with it now what's the plan yeah should i keep watch outside i'll stand watch outside (snoring) you have one ball and thus ends vox machina (laughs) hm that was hot that was hot don't they have an airship here ooh ooh aren't you two dweebs always wanting to steal an airship sam and don't they have one here sam and so do i have to say the third thing or are you going to get there what road trip bitches come on we got to like you know-- that makes sense the only problem with that is she only has one now and if she has two she might be a bit harder-- are you genuinely afraid of her oh the player on your right-- i actually agree with that strategy it is a bit like fish in a barrel because she is limited by her speed wait but play it out how do we see where she is in comparison to a giant body of water look up at the stars we're looking at her right not up can we like go like that-- we could but we might just be chasing as long as we're all right with that we'll just be chasing vax does have a point though if we're just chasing we could get the jump on other ones let's get the gun unfucked and we'll simmer on it i got two chunks of whitestone in the bag of holding i got a bunch of gems in the bag of holding gems lots of gems we don't even have to keep the agreement come on just saying we getting the gun un-fucked or what is he still tapping the coin i take a very blatant look around 13 there is a ceiling they look pretty makes sense do you have any

herself and we die shit literally in the last place we would have looked yes is there any way to book passage on the ship that's already moving northward how fast is that smaller ship hmm yes yeah we are going to an ocean wait why who's the captain what did you end up drinking in that damn tavern mmm ledgers looking to leave quite soon yes yes oh this is given from j'mon sa ord consider that in negotiation maybe some servants and some masseuses don't mind me but i have violence on the mind at all times is there any customary weaponry or defense that you can put on this airship during our travels just in case we run into the same shit we did last time nice do they aim in all directions nice stand at the ready our business is of great import can i ring the bell but i don't grab it and ring it i go (clang) one loud time how many of your crew will you have with you just ballpark it and i'm sure this crew is your finest no greenhorns men you've spent years with trust your life with most of them how many do you not trust your life with perhaps she should stay behind on this voyage she's coming with us don't worry about him there's a hubbub down in the quarter people talking it's the gold armor yep good we'll be back why did you ask him if he was single that was so awkward yeah i know but he thought you liked him now we have to-- i thought you said that it's part of your winky i'm like that's not-- boom for free bitch on the house i know it's an amex black card we make our way back yep i'm with him i'm with you i don't know if this is where our friends are oh okay play some music outside while you go number two is there a test on this later grab them and then what just do what i do best when i see them outside cool should i have a code word if you know they're coming out like-- dijon can i go to the corner where i can see the front entrance and the side alley where i was and look and see if i see either of those two faces this will go well total shit six cool i'm looking at the wall burn it to the ground can i look around and see if i see the two faces now 18 put some money on red or black while you're in there just once yeah no even in the middle of the day the minimums don't go down well i've been to harrah's take your finger out of my asshole gary do i see any half orcs outside damn it you're sure really hard you want me to use the gauntlets or no all right i take the titanstone knuckle off my left hand and i slap him 18 i was so confused why a stranger would ask me to slap him (laughter) we're back well it's a very intricate and detailed process involves a lot of-- you know what it'll be all over your heads so just say thank you our damon pilot you did now we can leave whenever we're ready yeah she's hearing this right now and three greater the sorcery is strong with this one apparently (chuckles) you're fucked the faintest nosebleed please sir even though it's dusk should we mount up tonight let's head to the skies (singing) indalla actually if you don't mind we're heading north once we're away from port we plan to inform you of our destination one thing before we do we forgot to mention that next week during game the game thanks to magic puzzle quest matt and marisha taliesin liam and myself will be joining ivan and becca for game the game from 530 to 630 so make sure you tune in it's going to be a very special game the game thank you magic puzzle quest yeah we wouldn't want people to miss out it's limited run and the mug which is my favorite okay now we're good yes and all hands on deck 19 she dies captain who is it that's in charge of your seaworthy navigations the newest member of your crew you mentioned some say arch-ipelago but yeah it's worth noting as well that if we do find this ship we do not mean her well is that a promise i'm sure keyleth would provide you with some cover as well the island of glass is it called that because of a glass production site (laughter) i hurt myself right you said we have quarters on this ship do you mind if i sleep under the stars rocking going to commune with nature in my own way fart in the wind no one wants to join me get all hippie up on the deck of the ship i pay super close attention but after we gave them the destination did they tell us how long it would take what if we pass over the ship in the night do we want to go lower how high off the deck would you say shut the hell up well we want to stay out right now could i take a shot of the sandkheg bottle i would like to slowly start building up an immunity 29 sick awesome well played sandkheg i go to sleep it's not at land it's in the water she's got it how is she under the water i have two vials of underwater breathing could i make a song request could we drop your big rocky ass from 300 feet up right through the bottom of their ship and sink that bitch and if they have a teleportation circle on the boat we want to destroy it they're also in the bay so they can swim to shore i want to send a message to the ship is all and vax rides keyleth down like dr strangelove the whole way last song request we destroy the ship right it (burbling) and they all (burbling) come up to the top they got to go one place which is where the shore so why don't we wait on the shore oh yeah i mean i'd love to be a welcoming party i'm just saying if anyone else wants to come with that's where i know they'll be going is there a telescope on this ship can we see the other side of the island or the water on the other side from this vantage point thought we were getting ready to kill a cruise ship no we don't need it do we want to raise our elevation as we're getting closer the ship or the shore i'm going to the beach i can't yeah oh what kind of thing you worry about other stuff that sounds like our only option yeah how do we communicate with the captain once we're off the ship should we give him an earring i'm a big-ass eagle no it doesn't in a wide arc what if she's looking like nothing but a-- same number and do i get a bonus on the-- 15 i fly over i'm going to make a low buzz over the campfire but keep going along the beach not landing at the boat or the fire we turn inland can scanlan and i make a loop heading towards the tree line and then stop i'd say 100 feet from where the water hits the shore right yeah not all the way as he's scanning i peck him in the shoulder thank you to our sponsor backblaze those commercials are fucking hilarious and next thursday you can see us at game the game the hour beforehand
