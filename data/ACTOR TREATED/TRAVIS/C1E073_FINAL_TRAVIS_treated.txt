prepared holy shit that skin weighs a ton good thing i'm strong as fuck what'd i miss is it super cold where i dropped off the hide like is it below ground a bit chilly did we decide what we do about raish-- yeah okay so we're not (death noises and farts) it's open to interpretation yeah just want to be fancy i lean that way but you know cannot speak for other people i don't know what to do training this is all training it's training at a thousand times gravity ew we don't really need to like check in with anything well i mean i-- yeah what what what but it's really a lot to hold onto your person i mean it's a bag of gold-- yeah how much do you want you don't have it i have it yeah if you want 5000 do you have good credit yeah can i have your last four pay stubs please (laughter) hey that's good enough have 5000 gold and it's probably about 1000 because i can't count to 5000 are you really why not but he can carry ten that's easier hold on let me consult blackstone yep stoneblack says it's all right i take the gold i put it back in and i give him ten platinum which is actually six one three seven eight nine 40 ten yep it's really heavy how about i give you 20 more platinum and i give him four more 50 all right i give you one more preach it's daytime right is there a way i can find a courtyard or an open-air area if i get there are there a lot of guards keeping an eye can i pee in the courtyard i feel like i need to mark my territory this is home for us and i peed all over greyskull keep i left little puddles that y'all didn't know about it's real important in case other goliaths come around and are like (sniff) nope the wolf's here i got to go elsewhere no stealth roll motherfucker can i take a leak on a wall in the courtyard can i find the highest wall with the most ornate decoration on it and go slightly off left the way me member goes and make a little box right there a little waterfall on the whitestone very nice in a wide arcing pattern not like the one shot like a nice upside-down crown thank you home how else do you spell home that's your second luck yeah don't women talk about their vaginas let's go krogering the best of everything do what ah well good question right it all comes down to one word really (clears throat) family right before i was a part of this group i had no family pike took me in i met all of you and i had a purpose so before that i would be down to fuck anything up anytime no problem i still kind of am but i realized that if i fly off the handle too soon it screws over my family that's no good because i care about you most of you (laughter) yeah i promise deal (cracking noise) (laughter) oh shit sorry i'm so sorry oh yeah bruises right no it's cool you make up a really good story but listen if at any time it gets to be too much you just go we've got you you won't you do that's unexpected well-- ow right yeah two is his hate for you we can't move it can we or a weakness i really don't i have no idea oh anything he has nostalgic feelings about glintshore-- this is true we have the herd we can go get the werewolves yeah but it's either death now or death a little later i agree we should leave whitestone we are if we wait outside of westruun right yeah we've got to do a lot of recon before then but i think he's got a good point right we've got to have like a staging point from the other side we'd have to go there that's called thinking outside the circle is there like nothing friendly in the fire plane we're in a room what keeps his soul on this plane destroy the stone yeah i walk over around the table towards asum i try and poke her in the shoulder him she's not here so we have to rally our forces to us and we have to do some really smart recon do we make her a part of that or no can you keep him from attacking whitestone we don't know yet no i like her idea i want to see him here sure you are you are our errand boy we are your vessel to what it is you want so get busy and do it quickly after all you're very powerful but that changes day by day doesn't it one day so allura so it's clear seeker asum is raishan yeah let's be real about it no tricks in this room (fake cough) whiff and she's super slippery she just totally like evaded percy's sneak stabby-stab oh yeah allura can we light your sage real quick make sure everybody's on the up and up yeah no it's in there you shut up you (laughter) i feel totally fine she evaded it really easy i agree i agree our play is the finish line that's it not a moment before sidebar do we have all the vestiges that the sphinx told us about what else is there i know i'm not the smartest one in the group but we don't know what the fuck we're talking about with this little sphere why don't we go find that last vestige and see what it turns up well i can kima might i'm not much for poetry but it seems sort of poetic that thordak came from the fire plane and the last vestige we're looking for is in the fire plane well so was the feywild and we didn't-- that's basically all of our choices at this point a regular creature or a feywild creature do it oh my god do it wait if you like conjure it outside and walk in is it going to go poof and disappear what's going to squeal touch it just go do it just do it yeah yeah yeah go touch it she meant what she said do it fucking do it you don't speak sylvan well hold on wait what was the biggest thing you put in there probably (chanting) fire plane i third that fire plane yeah we're not going to see her that's like saying i farted because my stomach hurt and then i found out it stunk as well cool fort daxio then check it out are you saying you want raishan to go with you one-on-one so you can do the melora thing and then maybe you take her out and you want a shot at it before we try anything else because i'll grant you that yeah rare spell that yeah no we got that so does anybody want to do anything else before we go to daxio wolves are on another plane herd is wandering yeah that's fair let's put one foot in front of the other first shall we yes i approve yeah (chants) dax-i-o dax-i-o what was under that blanket no we know you did we should have him walk down the street and take bets on how long it takes him to get arrested (laughter) it's cool i have an internal timer and if you don't meet it i'm going to kill all your people (laughter)
