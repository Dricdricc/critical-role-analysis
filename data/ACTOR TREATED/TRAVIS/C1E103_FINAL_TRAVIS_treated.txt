what's with your eye what (gasps) oh i don't have to pee (laughter) it ain't close it's eight hours what deal you wanna tell us what deal it was okay fucking a i have a random thought while y'all are trying to go get sarenrae this is where the story of the lord of the quad roads is if you're not familiar with the lord of the quad roads he was a gentleman that just very quickly came into fame and fortune and he's a personal friend of mine and i thought i might try and go find him for a favor you know one of those people if you pop in town they get real pissed if you don't stop by maybe could be not sure yeah i'll meet you up where we were yeah it's real important yeah i could just pop in give him a little fist bump and i'll meet you at sarenrae's hovel fancy a trip yeah yep you know totally behaving ourselves besides we'd know if old shit nuts is moving closer because of-- holy shit (whispering) tell no one all right so i know this guy named the lord of the quad roads back up while you were gone-- were you gone i'm not sure did you know that i have this little magical thing no okay (laughter) so i went to vasselheim actually i was looking for you you little shitstack and i was like hey i've got an idea (explosion) boom in my head i was like i'm going to find a guy to pull out cards for me see what happens well i heard her nagging me in my head yeah (laughter) no because fucking i made him pick it so he goes ooh and all of a sudden he was in fancy clothes and he had a servant that appeared in the alley he was like thanks i guess i have two more of these and he fucking ran off no he pulled the one card and it disappeared in his hand right and then he walked off but the point is he's got two more wishes yeah and i told him grog grog gave you those remember me i'm not opposed to it i thought maybe if we walked in and i had a title like grog the wish giver and we were calling to check in on him that maybe it's time to pay his tithe to the wish giver and maybe he would give us one of the two yeah or pressure him lay it on thick we could say like your fucking face is going to fall off if you don't give me one of your remaining wishes oh i've still got them yes well (haltingly) for peace on exandria right i want to live forever just never die i just want to him to go you will never die i'm happy aren't you really old though you get company what would you wish for i mean enough of the bullshit yeah i think maybe you can get real descriptive with it too so you can make it real complicated maybe think about it while we're on our way yeah how about we go and we pressure him and then if he doesn't bite then we kill him i want to look like me he's going to remember me you're the idea man warm it up son let's get the bad ones out of the way right now shake it off yeah or maybe my manservant can you make me look really amazing but rich and wish giver-y i want to look like a sultan i have a great record with these guys (high-pitched) peter frostbucket i seek lord of the quad roads i don't need it negative one (laughter) two and a one oh yeah sorry aside from the four around us is anyone around this is profiling thank you i mean mine's do one thing you've got options i just want to go talk to the lord of the crossroads manipulate that guy that recognized us he said it looks like it's him kind of blanched complexion orange hair hits people in the face somewhere around here you know the thing about that one though he doesn't like to leave loose ends goddamn it 13 no i stay with my dice this other one very tall and metallic-looking yep we did i was not really aware at the time yeah well now that you mention it i felt a chill oh no his final change is complete no it's much worse i trip and fall please save yourselves run i'm going to kill him i reach up and snap the horn it's a 20 (laughter) well you got us yep yeah sure yeah lock me up first (whack) (laughter) i don't think that far ahead 26 ten got to go i'll get smarter sure i should have killed him back at the shop i'm pretty sure this problem wouldn't have existed i have 13 left (squawks) 16 thank you only one apparently that is what happens when you leave things alive look should we still look for the lord of the quad roads which ship all right temple of sarenrae where is that should i wear the hat since i am apparently a wanted person now can you do that aces damn it thanks vex you know he was indiposed we should go nope i can't really look like me in this city right now i punched a captain of the guard was it that long look how far i've come i
