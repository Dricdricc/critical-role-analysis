dungeons & dragons how do you spell that b-a-k like the blue hair yeah we'll all be in one place good to know are there three regular crownsguard that are going with molly or is the watchmaster going with them as well i'll go out the front exit of the tent just to see if the watchmaster goes with molly bipedal or on all fours you're good you're good you're good that is a bastard die right there that's a tease time to go to jail tried to do the sherlock holmes she sees you having a seizure in the chains (laughter) that's correct i can assure you we're here to cause no trouble we will be as compliant as we possibly can be would you call it infectious excuse me-- oh i thought you were right behind us mollymauk i don't mean to pry into your business but has this ever happened to you before oh i don't know about that right the large toad that was with the girl what's the story there unfortunately no well yeah don't leave it was a busy day for us unfortunately we're partially responsible for this one as well bad luck fair enough to the side i say to jester i say this does not really fall in with keeping a low profile we talked about this yeah it is are they not going to take her to see the lawmaker actually we were just upstairs and it would really help us if we could perhaps expedite the process perhaps there's an arrangement we could come to if she could see the lawmaster now an audience is all we're asking for no favors god bless 16 i understand thank you for your understanding beau remember your little sister i do hate to trouble you again twice in the same evening it's incredibly inconvenient if we may this sweet girl here was also part of our party and she is quite the protective one i'm afraid that she was also providing aid to our fellows in that tent i'm afraid her younger sister was attacked in a similar way i feel it's only prudent to acknowledge that she was trying to protect this young dwarven girl that performed in the circus she means no harm oh yeah baby 24 natural 18 i'm new at this stat don't fuck it up indeed and we can be found at any hour the nestled nook inn is where we are a great idea indeed and thankfully there was no flesh-to-flesh contact indeed it would give us no greater pleasure than to get out of your hair understood indeed we would this is most gracious of you lawmaster norda what no i was trying to say she had a little sister that had a similar incident and that made you try to protect toya i was trying to throw you a bone we're under watch yeah you did all right did you see anything we don't know that have you been to this town before and you've never seen conditions like this affect any other carnival goer before where are the other two the stinky one and the little one yeah can we look around and see if we spot caleb and-- i wonder if they came back they are good what did you come to trostenwald for sure i'm not trying to pry i was just curious where you were going i like funny stories you did some crazy shit with that sword of yours you polish off that one already can we get another round for the-- wise words only because we seem to find ourselves in quite the predicament no i'd love to it's a moving story would it be fair to say that the more someone desires something the more you're interest increases are you good at it do you get caught very often now jester if i may we are already in a little bit of a pickle i take one step back on the sacred money pot of school if you place a copper piece into this pot and say the magic words-- what's the magic word again by the end of the week you made your money back some people more than others well i mean i was really impressed with the little trick i sure would like to see a big trick jester i meant a trick from caleb i would love one how did you learn to do that that's impressive is it something that can be taught to others well i'm just a little curious about how people use their magic no it's relatively new for me though so i'm just trying to learn no i wonder if maybe i should be no again fairly recently yeah yeah we're not super deep well i came up from the town of port damali yeah i met jester a while back and after i ieft town coming up to the northeast i ran across her i'd seen her do some of her magic before that's what i'm trying to learn about that's true molly if you would like to share my room you can d&d beyond's watching going fuck you nott molly that's your tab right yeah except for that one that's true are you praying over your swords is that part of your thing i try to be that's quite the story can i insight check him 15 well thank you for sharing that honest story with me it means a lot ey oh ey yourself (laughter) yeah we said we were going to do that didn't we what did you have in mind that's a detailed plan i like it are we taking anybody with us fair enough do you want to ask any of them yeah that's not going to cut it not quite like what we had in mind she's right here let's see if caleb and his little friend are downstairs first he has tricks after all y'all are downstairs it's like a little dog the little back foot creeps up (growls) if we could we're-- did you just fucking shit we were thinking of maybe finding our way outside of the inn for a bit i don't want to presume anything but do you have the ability to change the way you look yeah you know yeah assume a different form right molly what about you fair enough beau i don't want to leave you behind but i-- he makes a point i think that the sooner we find the cause of this the sooner we can get out of here let's get out of here can i walk back into a privy washroom area can i use my mask of many faces to cast disguise self on myself older white-haired with a beard just very simple peasant's clothes maybe a bit of a farmer or a land worker smudges dirt on the fingernails in twos or singles level two trying to get out of a fucking inn (high-pitched) new york is where i'd rather stay (laughter) should i go first not command ops in the tavern hall you want to come with don't do anything stupid mouth shut eyes forward show me how you walk maybe a little less that's nice i also assume a little limp slight 20 just keep moving to the other side of the street what color is that die let's just keep walking for now that's a good point maybe there is a morgue maybe they recognized him was he in good health i should point out this is the second connection to the ustaloch well before we met up with you two we fought off a wicked sick water snake (shushes) did he work for any of the particular breweries around if we were to go down to the docks and ask after a few people he worked with is there anyone you know that we should speak to familiar of his i understand that thank you for the drink vosna i'll be taking my leave now we got to get molly we head outside well that was revealing you're worried about them having a heart attack or something she makes a valid point actually laura oh if people are scared of carnivals they won't want them in the future that might be harder to do maybe we go down to the lochward how far is it from where we are to the lochward let's head down to the docks keeping an eye out for crownsguard do we see any king's guard crownsguard 11 same no flattery got you nowhere damn it fuck it i drop disguise self i'm sorry to deceive you rinaldo this snake that was in your house is not the only strange occurrence that's been happening we're trying to find out the cause of it have you seen anything else like this in the time that's passed we're asking after a man that helped down at the docks named enon have you heard of him enon we were trying to see if he might have worked with people that might have known what he was doing that day earlier i see you're skinning the beast can i ask why if we went down to the docks where he worked is there anyone that we should ask for to speak to who might have known him better i do if you think of anything or if you hear anyone speak about him you can find us at the nestled nook inn we'd appreciate anything if it happens to reach your ears much obliged shall we we should probably wrap up whatever we're doing i imagine they're going to come by the inn soon and try and speak with us not you two nope no stuffed beds no recordings on the old vhs i'm a little concerned that we've been gone for a while maybe let these two that aren't under house arrest-- no continue i mean if you're up for it tavern-keeper doesn't know anything about this we'll see you back at the inn i can keep them busy at the front door childhood cat destroyed faced with our own mortality must be plugged in and connected to wifi indiana jones style yes jury summon i open it i shut the door go take that game in the other room why don't you thank you sure you found nothing at the docks zip zero how late i can be down for that where were you when you saw these cloaked figures at 200am we could should someone stay up well i was thinking someone should keep a lookout on the roof of the inn in case someone comes for us while everyone else is out i don't know can you conjure those golden orbs up into the air as like a signal maybe we just risk it it's 200am i'm sure everybody will be asleep let's risk it didn't really look like much yeah i ought to be leading the way i reckon 15 good idea nine look up yeah let me get it-- we have a few more hours and the cover of darkness who's real stealthy maybe we don't all need to go maybe just a few and the others will hang back an hour and a half is it like a mound of poop or like a single-- is it a worm it's a snake yeah i thought it was like chocolate frozen yogurt stealthily to the circus yeah going in danger close nine i cast disguise self and i turn myself into a crownsguard (regal voice) indeed stay our blade please obviously he can handle this right in your face haha incredible is that a natural thing for you guys to just attack each other in moments of stress oh i can't tell if that got worse or better if you want to make your ways around i could distract them for a moment have a conversation with them for an hour sure i got it yeah caleb and me-- i walk up to the guard (regal voice) it's a late night not much action this evening see anything unusual yeah have you heard heard how long are they supposed to be here at least you're by the tent they've had us walking the perimeter of the lake the entire time did they find anything inside today tell me something interesting please would you mind if we popped in where is it jesus oh 13 we'll be quick super fast let's go (as grog) that worked way better than i thought like we should-- i mean-- (as fjord) should we look around for stuff or what (laughter) well you know i do a little mimicry here and there we should look come on check the grounds maybe we can find where the bodies are laying well let's search the grounds have they moved the bodies or are the bodies still there can we check the bodies for anything that's better 16 okay roll high i did not ten we can't spend that long in here maybe we just take a bit of it with us do you have a pocket like a jar i-i got no
