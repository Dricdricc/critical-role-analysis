can anyone cast hold person or friends i shouldn't have said anything were-creature can you change or are you locked into one like a big ass rat or you're like little bitty princess bride hold on he was holding back during that whole thing cool awesome put my belly button with my spine that's holding back snarf gets an upgrade the quivering snarf this cookie's good laura says the same thing and i think it was kit buss' art of those novels that we saw first and we're like oh she's an amazing artist those go on your nails no they don't (chainsaw sounds) it's gender neutral is it really for dudes come on are you serious that thing moves like the matrix screen matt and oh there's an emoji thing can we just talk about how that's the best name i've heard all day that's amazing well bonertown's a classic well there's many hours of meditation and reflection that goes into what professor grog is going to do next or you can tattoo impulse on my forehead that would probably be it you're very organized it's kind of great because we have this endless resource of people who are going to let you know when you miss or forget something so it's like what's the point of prepping because an hour after the show i have 500 people going you might have forgotten about that yep never even thought about it to be clear i like that it is there so please keep it coming otherwise i might not remember any of that stuff how many do you get 17 spells you also don't hear them yeah yeah did we i think those were some pretty marathon six-hour sessions we would break off for whispers we were pretty slap-dickish when we were playing and i think we've carried that through pretty nicely that's true it's weird because sam's such a great improv person liam's got crazy theater experience so everybody knows to honor moments when to be quiet when not to the timing is such a great thing among the cast we're all friends so there's no trying to figure each other out that was like that d & diesel thing because he had played years ago but chobot and dan were new to it and when you sit down and you're happy-go-lucky about it and you drop into your dungeon master thing people are like oh shit this is real (laughter) tiny arms (laughter) those criticals didn't hurt either thank you rng jesus yes first five or ten minutes i was like this is going to be a great movie (laughter) shit no laura is already rolling her eyes enough at grog that if i tried to be that stupid at home she'd be like fucking stop she wouldn't let that fly we talk to each other in weird voices almost never our own but if i tried to talk as grog i would get dragon eyes of death i'd get smarter real fast lob it softball that bad boy it's really such a weird thing to be positive all the way across and if you're not we mute you it's so great no sorry i had an art question if you come up with a sketch do you ever stop and start and stop and start or is it what hits the page is eventually what comes up we see so much art and rarely do we ever go no that's not how i saw it we're like yes also yes it's so cool it's like a crystal ball yeah there's a guy we know that plays at emerald knights and i forget what night they have d&d nights-- wednesday nights he showed up a couple of times to play with one group and then he hopped in some rando group and was totally nervous about it but he was like it was the best game i've ever played because nobody knew him or what he was going to do so he was free to make these wild choices and be totally nuts he was like it was exhilarating i'm like d&d night was exhilarating he was like yeah man it was great we're coming (laughter) d20 turds everybody gets a pop and do the glasses pre-stream matt and i have one so one of the first pranks that vax pulled on grog was we were sleeping around a campfire and in the middle of the night vax went over and wrote dork on grog's forehead with a piece of charcoal from the campfire and when i woke up-- we might've been drinking while we were playing when we woke up i look in my goblet in-game and i see the reflection and i said who wrote kord on my face krod (laughter) it was one of the first ones and off went the prank war we were going to use him as a sacrifice it's like in hermione's handbag dork was toast we pull him out this giant carcass fell out i was like oh shit and we butchered him and we put him back in little pieces but then we also learned that the bag of holding is not refrigerated so three months later i pull it out and this gelatinous ooze comes sliding out we're like has it coated everything else in there let's say no we were not expecting that yeah ashley literally pulled her shirt up to her eyes and laura sat under the table they were both crying and the rest of us were in shock what we do what what happened (grog voice) they're like your children you can't really pick one (laughter) i think the one where he bit the tongue out of the mouth and then tore it out that was pretty good the gorier the better i do i get so happy when it's a blood shower that was the charity game right what did you write next to victor crazy i was like spanish very first game right which is great because when he was playing that dragonborn wizard sorcerer paladin he knew everything he saved us from dying in that first hour and a half we were fumbling around like a bunch of blind morons and you could see him biding his time i wish we had video of it so i could go back and see if you gave him a nod like go ahead and save these jackasses he was like i would like to freeze this gear and move this and shift that and everything stopped and we're like we're alive just because of taliesin yeah totally it's all therapeutic it's like the ultimate character customization screen at the beginning of a video game it's unlimited your own death we do need to have one guest that's got the silver spoon and has never suffered tragedy in his life we need a super optimistic person everyone's dead what's in the box we were in the other room we were outside in the studio you did it on purpose i'd like to roll insight it's all good we flew over the underdark we flew over the whole encampment and stuff now we're going to die quicker clarota was a bitch i said it but half the party was all about it i wrote it four times i thought the briarwoods were both vampires and somebody was going to turn vampiric i'm not going to say it was an easy fight but i thought somebody was going to be on death's door legit not just because of the ziggurat's anti-magic zone that was after-- was that because of the fight or was it because of the ziggurat going down to one that was down in the ziggurat what's wrong with that give me that thing laura texted me and said my pulled-up pants look weird like that mary and it's hot in here i was pulling the pants up you don't know what it's like living with a dragon advantage two i loved it in the pre-stream games you'd show up with these two bags and five or six maps and i remember there was one night a six- or seven-hour game where no maps were put upon the table you were rolling them back up and i was like were those for tonight you were like they were going to be and we didn't go any of those places off the cuff strategize i really wanted to look to see what their traits are and stuff but i can't i wanted to cheat i'm saying i wanted to cheat me research he ain't going to read but if it has pictures i don't even think grog thinks the sword's trying to corrupt him he's just a chatty sword that for some reason talks to him that's it he got the battle-sound lightsaber at target and it talks i think he thinks it's just loud enough for him to hear so he's always like-- i have no idea how that sound actually works you didn't think we'd keep it fuck that noise i'd throw percy in if he tried to do that i wasn't equipped for that shit in the monk pit that was unexpected i had trouble putting baby down you get three per round or something that doesn't happen at your house when i almost smacked trinket and he ran through the minefield generally everybody laughs and when you clean it up you're like man that was fun she's like you never do that again oh shit it's just a game she was like-- and went upstairs babe i love you imaginary bear what nothing (bear-like) grog is okay when you were monologuing i actually leaned over to laura or to you and was like he hasn't looked down yet because you were explaining the history of the world and we're always looking for a little bit of-- and come back up and you were up here the whole time i'm like he's a god it was insane it was six minutes we do go back and watch those things though because there's no way some of us catch that the first time around you're a good note-taker but i'm like-- the vegetables of the portents he was our manager right he took us through that tournament right i didn't just cut its head off i smeared its gore all over us and we started screaming like crazy people matt and you know you've done well when mercer's eyebrows go up especially like-- oh what did you say kord i mean krod (moans) i get bags and bags of reese's pieces and i like them i don't drink them we've got to fly with them they take you into the mirrored room and it's like-- (laughter) i saw there was a person that was asking about do we have too many magical items i think it's important to say that you told us that we can only have three attuned to us yeah so we don't walk around and be like oh i'm going to use this oh i found out where it was because vex is a sneaky bastard she didn't hide it i rewatched the episode (laughter) what cuddle puddle how often do you rewatch episodes only if i feel like i missed something important but normally that's a character choice too but i don't catch shit i wouldn't ever do that how smart is trinket that's so low-hanging and you-- it's running down the jowls i remember when we were rolling the character and i rolled it and it was some awful roll and you're like your intelligence is six i was like yay what's that mean yes awesome yeah you two are total trainwrecks how's your family they're doing well the boy's in soccer she doesn't what happens to vox machina when everyone reaches level 20 or something like that have you ever made a character that went to level 20 anybody that's played before what do you mean not quite meaning you stopped playing deities god hunting did you see the size of that dragon back there we're fucked next to that thing you say yes isn't it if you want to talk about genius we've got genius doing storytelling i've asked him i'm like do you come to the show with two or three songs in your pocket ready to go and he says no because he's a cappella-- mensa level from college right let's wave a flag over some furniture the doctor's like you were on the barricade i don't know somebody asked if i could re-pick the people that went into the earthbreaker groon pit would i do it no a i didn't understand what you were actually asking because he was speaking in such a poetic way and i was trying to give you an intense struggle shit i'm missing all of this i don't know what he's talking about and you were like who are your blah-blah-blah muses and i was like my muses pike she's not here shit in case we fight who's good oh vax has daggers and scanlan's my pal and we jumped down and they're like oh we're fighting and i was like fuck the first five minutes i was going through my mind how it would have gone if i had picked other people but i wouldn't have changed it for a second it was so great ain't those the bad ones you would be a bad dragon in real life i was expecting more from you whatever voldemort shut up i'd be a gold dragon i'd call myself kanye i'm a wordsmith you're welcome for my existence i'm an influencer i'll start smiling and then go-- yeah i like him so glad we're not fighting him tonight because i just got infinitely more nervous are you playing as gilmore i'm going to do what laura would do and warm up this d20 shit fuck that's the same number we haven't started this set is amazing by the way i'm so excited by it what are you talking about really you don't know it falls into darkness so it's deep enough what if there's a giant trampoline down there i would like propose a pre-game handshake (under breath) i will throw all of you in okay all right i'm ready to die i rolled it twice and they both suck this is nice stone ten probably not me 15 looks like rain is that a beholder coming out of the pit can you move diagonal squares one plus one plus two plus one it says we can see the board but not you guys off- i would like to go into a frenzied rage i would like to move ten spaces right there oh so should i maybe move first and then rage oh i'm very calm as i run from this spot to here preparing to rage shit i don't think i ever knew that you learn something every day hit a little kid in the area if i have to attack something c'mere boom but i'm so stealthy what the shit this is like seattle i would like to perform a little community outreach and i would like to run frenzied rage i would like to look at keyleth and go hi and attack 26 14 24 21 it was the third one that hit 18 and she needs to make a constitution check well i'm working on it shit relax a little just do it (shrieks) does she have that do you have to roll for it well fuck the foreplay let's get on with it you have that 16 you're having me help you with math that's four one more oh into the pit you die there's a window is there a window matt or is it supposed to be a wall through the window to the wall to the sweat drops down dragons' balls i was coming over to say hi and then it was like (explosions) 15 i would ask a question is there any way i can move just up against the wall so that keyleth and zahra are in a straight line no i have the javelin of lightning but it only works in a straight line i'm going to hit keyleth on the ground yeah isn't she down on the ground i'll hit her once and then move i'm going to pimp slap and run i pick up craven edge over my head seeing her there unconscious i turn my head away turn the point down and go whack i'll do my best do i get an extra attack after i make my move because i killed someone all right i would like to move to zahra please i would like to do like joaquin phoenix and swing away yeah joaquin phoenix in signs see and swing away grabs the bat and he beats the shit out of the alien i would also like to do reckless attack on these no reckless advantage and whoever's fighting me gets advantage 24 is the first one 18 is probably going to be good enough 27 on the second one oh that's right ten 18 for the first one 12 20 on the second one a beautiful thing it's always an option face slits are always in 19 tell me she only has one of those a day right no i'm not getting excited about anything because if christmas is any indication shit can go south i got a remote control car (crashing) (crying) i got a nerf football what whose yeah i do do i get advantage on my recklessness you roll once instead of having to roll twice and take the lower because you have disadvantage but i gave you advantage so they cancel each other 15 was the total of the second roll i'm sorry so that's 24 21 and a constitution save in explicit details i'm restrained okay so my speed is halved shit she needs to make a constitution saving throw come join the party it's like an anime nightmare in here (laughter) orville redenbacher so i have to make a save to move or it just halves my speed no look she's right there in the open world you don't want to do that think about all the poor tentacles that just came to life you might not get this chance again i mean we're both
