what yet more evidence why we should see the return of max better sam james you're still wearing your purse by the way arsequeef will take care of it he is i don't think so might be unwise yeah i want that bracelet i'll reach down and pick it up i'll hold it in front of his face you used this to control that that's a 25 well it depends on how forthcoming you are anything i need to know to operate this thing or i just slap it on and start giving commands indeed the hour is nigh may i ask how you came to be enslaved in this predicament in the first place how about an answer for the bracelet that's right you do i'm sorry to hear that i never like to see a creature put under the boot of somebody else for their gain i'll toss him the bracelet actually if you wouldn't mind we have further need-- not even five minutes perhaps if he can tell us the safe way out of here in exchange for letting us have our way with algar he could be on his way and we can have our time but i don't want to kill algar i do not nope hand up one sec yeah i'm saying don't kill algar i want to know if there's other booby traps i'm not sure yet algar i'll give him a little cheek slap i'll tear off a sheet of ribbon off of my sleeve and i'll wrap it around his forearm like a tight tourniquet 11 silversilt i'm pretty sure-- oh thank you nope no i just forgot he was there actually algar might need a quick-- no yeah i like that plus they're guards it's their duty to fight which they did and we defended ourselves i feel like-- we'll make it pretty quick yep if we want to be really careful there are other places to stay i think we're going to listen to your influence on this one jester it is closest to you no no hard plans well let's wake up this son of a bitch yeah we'll get answers yeah that's it i'll bring the tip of the falchion right under his chin you know before we begin we got this thing about calling out yelling really sensitive eardrums so let's not do that back unconscious i'll lean over to nott and say nott do me a favor and make sure he's not carrying anything fancy in his pockets what was your job down here and why were you giving commands to that creature with this bracelet who do you report to marquis yeah not lepual demesne the creature that was here and the magic used to control him is that something that you brought to the table or was that a device given to you and known in the higher ranks of government one of two cities and the other would be right what else do you do here in nicodranas what do you do to pass the time algar i'm trying to decide whether or not to hand you over to this fearsome beast over here and i point to (laughing) caleb i'll make you into a jacket you have any significant others in the city agreed i think we all know the ruby of the sea far and wide think she'd miss you if you went missing yeah especially if you start to admit that you did it all yourself i'll use mask of many faces to look just like him (as algar) who the fuck are you 19 you know what i'm feeling like beau that i just need to get out of this city and never come back go somewhere far away i hold up also a stump because my hand is missing i need to go in a boat and just go maybe a haircut maybe a new name too what do you think all depends on how we decide to act as we get out of here i'm sure you know a very safe way to the surface yes shall we just walk out with handless bagged man jorge any traps contraptions we should be aware of as we're heading out how far away is the other container for the other i assume creature under the same restraints we saw here he mentioned going to free his compatriot oh i thought there were two under nicodranas i was okay with the rolling blackouts in nicodranas but two cities i feel a little worse about a little worse they'll figure it out there's a mage tower that goes up and down this place will be fine well jorge why don't you show us the way out pre-dick or post-dick just a moment we're going to need those keys now i'm sure it goes without saying that once you leave this place if you yell or act a fool in any way we will tear you asunder before you can say ow yeah that's a bitch what do you guys think i feel like i need to partake on this voyage today don't you think almost asafp right it was a nice day earlier you want to do that shouldn't have been a dick where i don't think it has a shore let's send him to marquet there you go nice you want to put back one of those platinums let me get that part (slap) any boat that ring of keys that he gave us approximately how many keys are on that thing yes and i plan to betray all of the city's secrets to your foes if i ever return it'll be very smart to kill me on sight (laughter) i didn't dismiss it you mean as we go outside outside go back inside the room remember we don't want anybody to like him when he comes back you can go christ it's a letter just fucking write it and send it okay no we're all back together now well i feel like that kind of went about as well as it could have what do we do now see who we could do both sabian was me let's make our way back towards the-- (under his breath) jesus christ yep i've got to take more organized notes maybe we can stop by the fancy tower on the way back sure about what time is it right you said that no bigs i'm tapped i can't do anything yeah it doesn't bother you that it grows taller as you get closer no doors oh shit yeah that's not true this is your home it's where you're from yeah we have time we're going to tell the truth about that i would be glad to-- with tiefling horns and tail coming out of it i'm going to have an owl i think they're worried about the-- (whistles) (laughing) this sounds like a warning is he coming with okay yep good we're inconspicuous with a big fucking horned owl on your arm she had a cat the-- it was the open quay right was where he wanders at midnight yes pass that 26 should we go out and tell them we're bearing gifts and shit yeah tell them we're bearing gifts and we want to see the captain see what happens all right yeah i like that i'll run and-- staying a good distance in-- i'll drop off the docks under the water and start swimming five i didn't even ask how far is the water from the fucking dock five feet or like 15 feet is it a tall dock okay sweet i can't even get out of this water if i wanted to i'm disappointed in us that was the most flounder-fucky sneak up ever we should have walked up and said we've come bearing gifts where is the captain code word do i roll for yasha too i rolled a natural 20 (laughing) yasha rolled a two this is weird i'm the only 20 two plus whatever her initiative bonus is which i don't know i do all right i'm going to use my bonus action to use the single charge on summer's eve-- doesn't use a spell slot-- to misty step from my position in the water up to where marius is summer's what what's the name of the sword summer's dance (laughter) nope it's summer's eve from now on oh my god amazing 30 feet it is every short or long rest with my action i will use thunder step well i'll reach out and grab towards marius and say come with us and cast thunder step he has to be willing to come with oh really that's a natural one fair enough does it cancel out the spell or does it still happen and he just doesn't come with well that didn't work i will-- i did i rolled a natural one it was great he didn't want to come yep par for the fucking course can i make it over to this dock over here 90 feet that's 3d10 thunder damage (counting) eight points of thunder damage woo that's good oh god where's the reset button can we reach in the snes push the game up and down oh yeah you can hear it within 300 feet so right here put me out of my misery because i was behind them yeah we are missing a long rest we could just get the fuck out of here he does misses nice boil their flesh caduceus let's go do it bring it yasha seeing all these arrows fly at beau she would like to rage she will rush up next to beau towards the half-orc captain beautiful she will make-- does she get two attacks two reckless attacks against the half orc oh then we'll make it regular so that he doesn't get advantage back only the person you attack any attacks against you been a while that's a 19 ooh the second one is a 12 she rolls-- what is it 2d6 maybe 15 18 plus six is 24 plus an additional d6 that's two what did i say yes nice you okay oh it's me you know what fuck it i'll use my last spell slot to cast hypnotic pattern i will make it in the shape of the cat's eye sphere above the ship so that everyone can see it it's brand new i'll miss the guy at the back yes 15 is the save yeah they're incapacitated their speed is zero but if they take damage or if someone else uses an action to shake the creature out of their stupor then they (confused noises) yeah i've bascially thundercat ho'd the eye up into the-- yes nope i'll come over here that hits 17 is my armor class hits oh man we might get lucky marius if marius is incapacitated she slips on some slick dock wood and slides right into him fucking power plants are shutting down-- i just wanted to see you roll sacred flame making it through please be shipping black powder travis and who gives a shit they deserve to die i hope there's nobody important in the bow of the ship he would've painted that shit on there i don't see it in there hey man if you've got fireball yasha's going to rush up and aid beau in trying to pull marius towards the docks would it help make full speed when it comes back to beau's turn if she's assisting can they double pull yeah i guess do you want me to roll to grapple 15 plus her natural strength god it's an athletics check what's her athletics yep i'm going to run over here (counting) i'm going to stand out here and i'll unleash two eldritch blasts at this enforcer (quietly) awesome great good stuff (louder) that's a 20 11 oh nice okay 11 points of damage on the first one and ten points of damage on the second so 22 total what that we come bearing gifts hits it hits punish me for this horrible fucking crap oh yeah let them go what the fuck are we going to do run and jump on the goddamn boat all right sure go for it do what you were going to do do it do it go ahead and fuck them up man go for it we're all going to die we need to get onto the boat and get out of here yes yes i'm fine he's going to go hang with the ruby yasha's going to run her ass onto the boat double dash if she needs to right and she will assume the dodge whatever in case they throw fire or something at her i'm going to arnold schwarzernegger from true lies run and jump off the dock and dive into the water heading straight towards the boat in a straight line because my speed is the same on land or in the water and i will double dash to the boat i'll be like we're getting the fuck out of here shove off are we tied up too i set the boat on fire and kill us all (laughter) this was just fucked from the first 17 will hit 15 misses okay we want to pull up the anchor or are we moving yet with her movement she'll stand in front of marius like a human shield from any arrows that might be coming do i get an attack of bitch slapping i go up and i kick marius in the water-- no (laughter) i'll do that do i have an action or did i double dash to get down here oh i'll use my bonus action to cast hexblade's curse on that enforcer with the hope that he will soon be dead i'm going (laughter) yeah i know yeah it misses it hits nope i'm uncon-- no i'll use my relentless en-fucking-[slurred] well i'm up to one hit point just out of pity's sake i'm disappointed i came back up to one hit point in myself yeah is that already halved because of raging you're right that would fall yeah oh she did the dock's on fire for crying out loud yasha's going to turn and bear hug marius awesome she's going to assume the dodge-- is there anything else to do does yasha know boats i mean i suppose she could run over to the gangplank and she could try to pull it and shove it against the dock and push off 26 i'll back up to the top of the ship where i should be useful do i have an action i'll climb up onto where the rudder is i start turning the bow of the ship out towards the sea i'm smashing my head into the fucking bow i fall unconscious when i wake up this will all be over i do that yes i do i do it no that's fine frustration's good enough frustration's fine no that's appropriate for today oh right you don't know how to sail the ship hoist the thing and then the other one ooh the mage a mage or the mage laura and oh yasha's yasha assists beau in getting the ship-- keeping an eye out for caduceus start to steer the ship along the coastline this way 18 no fuck that guy where's caduceus just sail yep just sail as she put her hands up he can see her flexing biceps nobody's going down there to help jester toll the dead it wasn't my intention the name of this episode with an i or a y yeah would it mean anything if we said that we come bearing gifts and that we are looking to see the captain i'll reach behind my hand and use minor illusion and create a little replica of the cat eye sphere and hold it out in front of him from who what are your ambitions with it have we patted him down we're not sure yet tighten them and tie him to the mast will you shove it back in (laughing) maybe there will be lunch meats down there and we can make a sandwich (laughing) oh first pet down he's eating mice or he's chasing the ship and he can't catch up that map is gorgeous he didn't even make an attack
