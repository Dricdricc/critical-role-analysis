001715882 no 001729475 --> 001731240 do we see any other sea life 001734718 --> 001739971 thank god it's not here's an astral dreadnought 001810211 --> 001813922 oh that's right 001824097 --> 001824972 oh right 001833546 --> 001836925 that's a natural one 001845267 --> 001846876 i have darkvision 001919132 --> 001920336 the first one was a five so six 001921412 --> 001922911 (raspberry) 002011024 --> 002012602 the tide's breadth 002014925 --> 002017373 (laughter) 002017373 --> 002019561 i don't think i named it in my backstory the tide's breadth yes 002028665 --> 002034979 let's go for it 002121366 --> 002123008 like a seal 002128396 --> 002129676 per the song i mean-- 002241456 --> 002246718 i mean what are the chances the ocean's huge 002252519 --> 002255396 glass half empty i get it it's all right 002300690 --> 002302562 got eyes right now all right we'll push forward 002308307 --> 002313943 should we stick together or do we want to fan out and go around 002355844 --> 002400646 sure yeah that'd be fine 002402700 --> 002403971 as we get closer can we see from outside the ship the extent of the damage from the initial explosion 002414401 --> 002419451 yeah no i chased sabian down into the hold of the ship and he was messing with a 002448380 --> 002455132 package i saw a fuse burning as i chased him back up above deck there was an explosion and it 002455132 --> 002504043 threw me from the ship it's nice to know that it wasn't a small explosion a real motherfucker of a 002504043 --> 002506146 thing apparently 002506146 --> 002510808 no we were in a storm he wasn't supposed to go below decks either that wasn't normally 002516841 --> 002524444 his thing so it was strange when he went down there i saw him when i confronted him he threw 002524444 --> 002526689 a dagger into my chest 002526689 --> 002528049 yeah well he turned on me real fast he seemed to know that what he was doing wasn't up to 002536237 --> 002543712 snuff when i chased him above he was at the bow of the ship getting ready to exit or jump off 002543712 --> 002549814 obviously he knew what was coming next then the explosion went and the last thing i saw was the 002549814 --> 002553324 ship as i was being thrown off 002554141 --> 002557721 yeah i don't know why though i didn't see anybody 002609588 --> 002611525 i don't know i assume 002616701 --> 002624434 no sabian was someone i grew up with who was also brought by vandren to work on the ship 002633144 --> 002640389 yeah i've known him for many many years and he's always been a piece of shit of one variety or 002640389 --> 002647979 another only in the most recent years did i think that maybe that stuff had faded between us and 002647979 --> 002653623 we'd found a way to work together but apparently not 002654854 --> 002658266 ooh as an idea sword in my hand as we start to push in through that hole of the 002739257 --> 002745852 explosion or peer in can i lead with the sword and see if the light and/or eye is reacting in any 002745852 --> 002748608 sort of way or is it just static 002748608 --> 002750935 not my best nine 002757230 --> 002758247 in the sea certain creatures like to make homes of vessels you want to send in your-- 002820696 --> 002826878 yeah 002922583 --> 002925360 oh 002926519 --> 002933718 why don't you node 002941832 --> 002942662 and drift 003047911 --> 003054984 if you don't mind i know this ship better than anybody jester would you come up with me 003142448 --> 003146158 and we can explore the captain's quarters might be a good place to start 003146158 --> 003147583 no i'm okay 003149462 --> 003150171 i'll drop the cannonball and i will push up off the ground superman-style in the water 003158559 --> 003201468 and swim up above the deck 003201468 --> 003210300 his quarters are that way we should push forward 003259559 --> 003301287 swim over 003302716 --> 003309605 i imagine so could be still 003329651 --> 003331738 i would say no but there seem to be more than a few things that i didn't know about him 003338925 --> 003345149 you're so strong might want to give it a-- 003400886 --> 003403389 really 003427415 --> 003435465 it's all missing is there anything that i-- 003458845 --> 003500258 is there anything that i see that is definitely out of place or changed that i remember 003505853 --> 003508368 third one of the day let's go with this dice natural one 003511751 --> 003514889 apparently you can pee down here and nobody'd notice 003519748 --> 003523729 maybe we should get the others and-- what fucking extra 003541754 --> 003544181 i'm always eating stuff maybe we should get some of the others to come in and do a more-- 003548398 --> 003551439 yeah 003552456 --> 003553939 unless you want to give it a look 003556655 --> 003600894 yeah he was a tidy man he certainly wouldn't have left things like this it looks 003605882 --> 003611250 like either before or after it went down somebody was definitely fucking looking for something 003611250 --> 003616598 do i i don't think i do 003619910 --> 003622704 could be yeah i'll go get caduceus and caleb 003634402 --> 003636255 i'll go get everybody 003637726 --> 003640390 what 003909991 --> 003911935 no 003912466 --> 003914342 what do you mean 003916523 --> 003922833 that's amazing lead the way 003927532 --> 003929723 no let's go now 003930988 --> 003934488 do you know how far away it was 004016112 --> 004017961 all right yes fine take five minutes six minutes and-- 004035592 --> 004036469 is it dented at all or just scratched 004115410 --> 004118276 yeah like an inch between the claw marks or a couple inches 004123275 --> 004124802 while they're doing this you can tell if it moves right 004154953 --> 004155816 okay 004157017 --> 004202820 glad you remembered that i'm kind of forgetful 004210153 --> 004219981 here underwater yeah 004254171 --> 004256147 might be did you find anything underneath any remnants of that explosion 004300333 --> 004302168 package shrapnel anything like that 004302168 --> 004305984 i think it's safe to assume that that was done after the ship sunk a hole this size 004435201 --> 004437312 wouldn't keep a vessel in the water very long 004437312 --> 004448658 glowing eyes 004451059 --> 004453950 pretties 004455115 --> 004456501 locate ariel 004504312 --> 004506585 true very true 004512775 --> 004514865 i'm sorry i can't wait

005041336 okay she will swim towards that merrow and with her bonus action she would like to rage 005050562 --> 005052529 oh yes then let's do that and get within melee 005059515 --> 005103532 as a point of order can she also yell don't let them leave 005121930 --> 005123056 that was more caleb than yasha but-- 005135614 --> 005138403 that's it 005147173 --> 005150653 fuck a duck yeah okay that

fire two eldritch blasts at it 005552458 --> 005553713 (drawn out) eldritch blasts 005558035 --> 005603122 four so that's 12 points of damage the second one is nine points of damage so 21 005618193

005645709 --> 005651447 movement i will move back under the deck where caduceus and caleb and jester are 005651447 --> 005653964 one step in 005655370 --> 005658853 yeah 005659791 --> 005701359 not so

three is ten and the second one-- 010929272 --> 010936935 great shit so if i didn't need that second attack did i waste it on the one that was there 010950123 --> 010953716 i made it reckless so it was just a straight roll i'll use the 20 feet to head down 011006612 --> 011009577 towards the one that caduceus is right in front of 011009577 --> 011013728 is that melee 011015549 --> 011016431 okay
