you've already fallen apart and liam is sam what is liam from that's right yep are you little shop of horrors meets peanut m&ms that's really smart i'm pretty sure there was some rick and morty in there too laura will be stealing this book and it's like super textured all the d20s are something different keyleth's has antlers mine has a big ale of mug on the 20 oh yours is dope with the two arrows and the bear paw it looks all marble-ized what nerd got a book on theirs as the 20 get your d20 and it's soft as with all of our things where did that come from oh shit the tongue lick after each sibilant is the best new one of these next week yeah i'm doing a one-shot or rather grog is running a one-shot grog's game-night comes next week where we will all play bunions and flagons lots of algebra trigonometry yep a game within a game if you dare pretty much but he is the game master so nothing to worry about everyone's totally safe and fine and you're alive by the way oh good thanks i killed a bunch of clickers to get here there were some cannibals but the fireflies are on my six so we should get started it makes me look far wiser than i actually am i can reverse math all day we do have one extra announcement i forgot november 17th some of us will be attending pax unplugged in philadelphia there will be matt and marisha taliesin liam will be making it laura and i will be in australia unfortunately sam can't make it but the four of them will be intrepidly braving the philadelphia pax unplugged you're such a goober they'll be there you can see them friday night there will be two things let's make sure that i have this right 100-230pm eastern standard time is the critical role panel and then the signing will be 530-730 eastern standard time pax unplugged on friday info should be on the website if it changes stay tuned if you're in that area come out throw things at them because we won't be there obfuscate i don't think you used that term correctly that means you vanish but you've got to hold still right yeah and to our rescue came matthew colville did he have claws is the tunnel backup blocked by debris and other-- mm-hmm well jesus taliesin oh that's right we didn't have our phones in the first place so that thing on your wrist is-- being that i have heightened senses what can i see in our new under the earth situation okay just a red d10 six a six and above is a success right yep do we see any slime or hair or anything that's like oh this is a-- or or we can do the thing that we've learned from being vox machina for so long who's super fast like the flash yeah you should run ahead dart ahead of all of the rest of us and check it out there's just enough light coming from the bottom of the tunnel i think that's a good idea good call yeah i'm glad we agree i will kill him first yeah either one of two yeah do that well we know you're fans of rats but-- how far behind you we will follow not so closely behind sam liam and you look like if the clown from spawn was trying to be pacman pac mcfarlane pacman you just eat people now sofa king live there what happened to you in that coffin we're talking about you wait didn't a week go by wait raise your hand if you've killed somebody a person yeah wait no oh you left him for dead okay i'm just checking to make sure like-- might be holding onto this for no good reason no that's the truth preach i know forever let's go see the sewer a little more closely i feel weird about this just committing to being-- i don't know if i want to stay this way i like the sun it's warm-- yeah i mean there are night games but-- i mean you can it's just super dark and swimming in the ocean at night is scary yeah all water yeah we've got to go forward i have amazing senses i hear everything that you're saying then why are you directing it towards her shoulder no i knew that too just a tremor oh wait shh i actually hear something down this way yeah no we're going this way we'll go towards that noise can i snag one of the rats and fucking rip its head off and squeeze it like a thing of toothpaste dex brawl all the dice three successes two failures but none of them are red two ones but they're black ones i was going for the rat yeah toothpaste rat damn it fuck i should have eaten somebody i'm so hungry i've got all these red dice i can get rid of one of these yes what i'm trying to embrace it forever okay yeah let's do that oh me too because i'm actually perceptive for once two successes two successes no failures whoa is there any pavers or anything in this tunnel or does it still look like it was burrowed like rudimenti-larily we're making pretty good distance i think we're close to mullholland taggers well we can't go back the way we came we've got to find a way out at least okay just perception that is a crit two tens in the tunnel with us there's-- there is-- don't look up there's-- (incoherent mumbling) there's something above us and it's reptilian looking yeah celerity we're all giving chase we're trying to catch up ooh that means you get another-- i'm pretty fast could i get there and try and help what the fuck is that thing his name's slock yes of course man the rest are in dc we want to let you go we don't mean you any direct harm but we need to know how to get out of this tunnel we're going to eat him i don't want to be a vampire we're going to eat him we're literally hours into this thing we don't mean any offense okay hold it take it easy you're rolling crap tonight we'd be most grateful like you i think it's the best we can do watch where you point that thing who will we be meeting sure as we're walking from behind can i use my aura perception to see what his true motives are as he's leading us to this chamber fuck yeah a red one i was at three down from the four from my wife rat now i'm back up to four that's one blood one and three successes but not the i'm leading them into a trap i whip my hair back and forth probably not the restaurant see taliesin's so immortal he remembers the civilizations that preceded-- fair enough i'll go in what's your intelligence rating three and mine's four so yeah i'll do that is this tibet's doing oh it's okay okay great laura and i will co-lead this venture into the chamber yeah i think that's actually a good idea yeah in fact just stay behind sam super cool my 1600 will hold up and are you familiar with one gary gygax yes many of us have we were surprised to see him up and walking about a mere hour after we woke and found ourselves in this state did we grab any posters or fan art on our way out is there any way to be of service we don't mean to offend he's really fast i can sense things we're very interested in that clearly well we might change that we're very interested in getting to the surface we will deliver your message as you've described it infancy got it yeah and fashion trends they're such a bitch to keep up with their router obviously runs through malaysia we're ready to go i'll go first this time i'm very perceptive i can hear and smell and see things i'm a fucking vampire i'll fly up there i go and i try to fly aw damn it i thought i was going to lost boys that shit fuck okay wait (mumbling) all successes no failures and one ten one two three four five i didn't want to show off too long i make my way up toward the ladder so the ladder goes straight up and then it turns at the surface or into more under-earth yeah i'm up here there's a tunnel that continues at the top of this stupidly absurdly long ladder it's only single-file i guess you guys can make your way up here and we can crawl wherever this goes will you ask mahlo if we're supposed to crawl through this okay well go ahead and come up i'll get started do i hear anything in the tunnel now that i'm up there with four red dice i'll just listen okay do i see anything like a switch or a button to lower something i rolled a one yeah yeah yeah i will fucking fang you right now does anybody else want to open the fucking door for once is there a name on the outside of the crypt that we walked out of hollywood cemetery do they look like they're paying their respects oh okay great no i am going to do a little natural selection is there anyone that looks like they are weak and clearly ailing and ready to have it all come to an end i'm definitely looking for somebody i've got four red dice question if we try and herd them won't they be doing that human thing called screaming and making a racket i'm pretty sure this is the one thing i can break into of course you killed will friedle what do you think liam's doing or you know you're also super charming you could just-- you've got a trustworthy face maybe ask if somebody will take a picture of us over by this crypt you know like we're visiting i've seen the movies i'm going to drain you to life's edge and then i'll open up my wrist and give you a little-- i grab him and i throw him into the crypt (laughter) i take his chin and i go sorry mike and i smash his head against the back of the crypt i'm fucking tired of your bullshit (snarling) five successes no failures all the way well yeah six no i got a six this is not what we want for our friends i'll take his head and-- you want to make him a vampire okay so what you want us to leave him in here we should walk him back to manzi well how many of these did i get rid of i was four blood fine actually i pick his head up and i feel around on the back side how's the back of the head sorry mike nothing personal you made me feel bad you get to kill random smart girl people and mike gets away it's okay for you just not cool for other people huh yeah pretty much is he a vampire he had to leave he couldn't say hi to us first did you leave him alive we're really supposed to be meeting up with someone we told you we were new sorry we're just trying to flush this out enough delays we should really go we have a promise to keep we were just about to kill mike diva you get one i just realized liam has the habit of killing npcs before they ever utter a word well i guess he protested through the door i would like to use google translate what about my iwatch are we inside or are we outside the club at the door then we go right in hemoglobin sticky or alcohol sticky i'll look for a vip area okay you've never been in a bar before (laughter) i had three successes on looking for the vip area is there a bouncer i'll walk up to him we're supposed to meet someone in here we're probably not but me and my three friends are new to this scene my name is travis how does one go about getting on the list does he seem like a human one success no failures while i am standing at the rope talking to this gentleman can i look and see who i see in the vip area a lot of people a few people fantastic i'll be back once we're on the list thanks for your time and i go find sam i make my way over to laura and sam i'm like sam i need your-- what are you doing my apologies i pull him off the dance floor with laura yeah so there is a vip lounge but we apparently need to be on the list i don't know how to do that you're fast as shit how about i distract or-- maybe or if there's a payphone at the bar we could call and pretend to be-- she's also nigh-invisible i'll do that yeah i'm really breaking my own finger three successes no failures i'll just (cracking sound) it normally stays-- i'm hoping that vampires have amazing regenerative powers what if i pulled it out you don't even really-- is it bleeding is the bone out is he going to be looking for me you got to do what you need to do yeah there's four of us three go go not yet the vampire shock will wear off in a second and then all the humans in this bar will be dead yeah (laughs) what the fuck (shouting) i just said bite it to fix it i'm a ninja turtle now what the hell man this guy-- not this gentleman this guy that just bolted for the bathrooms he just pulled my finger-- do you have a first aid kit i'll get out of your hair i'll just need a first aid kit we were trying to get on the list a voice from above says-- is the wound continuing to bleed or does it-- yeah yeah just one four what does my blood look like but that's actually the name of a show brighter than the rest of these murdering fucks i am going to resist oh no it's the one you took always you it's dead blood yeah so we make our way to the top of the stairs what do we see fat boy slim are there any golden thrones a bar my dark gift no like ashes and mushrooms before you go have you seen taliesin he's the only one we haven't seen any recommendations from the bar fair enough i head towards the bar i saw the sign travis and we go to the bar okay barkeep would you thrill us with four glasses of whatever you would like tonight dealer's choice does somebody scream when it gets pulled (yelling) do they smell irish european has a nose of-- a toast i feel we're finally in a sort of safe place to the new world order right to our fallen-- yeah may they live forever as dust and spore drink up to rats you're sleeping in your own coffin tonight as we sip these drinks and we turn our backs to the bar posting up like one does can i see with my heightened senses anyone giving us a look of malcontent before i look at the smiling faces do i get any whiff of a giant dog in the crowd i'll do that perception and investigation jesus-- i'll use the heightened senses aspect two successes can i focus on the smiling faces and see what we see laura erika ishii's here her hair's so cool none that we recognize though a critical two tens this is a happening spot yeah look at sam we're totally cool he speaks nine languages it was an explosion you remember matthew colville right yeah we woke up in coffins missing taliesin matt and marisha were killed while we were trying to figure out what was actually going on oh yeah i was supposed to give you-- i didn't think it would be you but i'm supposed to say they're very displeased and that we need to make amends we've got to find a way back to our friendship you guys are supposed to offer a boon-- mahlo or it was lockey i didn't even know he was alive and tara too rats man we ate rats raise your hand if you haven't done anything inappropriate and as far as monsters go thank god we know you right seems like you're pretty high up right now like a foster situation or-- sure would love to avoid that yeah i stab my newly healing finger do you know what's wrong with liam's face i don't know how to break it to you man you're a little flakey wow we all have to do that this fight is mine she hated your dancing so my wife and i you know i think we're open to all scenarios at this point i'm extremely strong i'm not terribly ugly i'll kill anybody you want and i can also talk a lot less than that guy (singing) five gold and a party you're the alpha and omega of 20s and ones the two of you sure you did (laughs) uh-huh it was like the worst walmart job application ever i work well with others and i'm quite affable-- if i could my wife is a fantastic person and she understands how valuable the relationship between the vampire world and the human world is and how much it must be protected such a delicate balance we are here to disappear and never cause a bit of trouble and only to learn i knew it (laughs) she was very remorseful i would have taken a life if it hadn't been for her if one of us can only enter this world i would ask that it be her oh yeah i'm sorry i suddenly feel this lingering shame and guilt but as the person who applied it is now dead i don't feel-- i will burn a willpower i now have five successes and no failures oh good no i would never have stepped into that-- that's a fool's errand i know better the tremere family do i get a hint as to who my honorable sponsor might be laura  it's satine oh fantastic i'm thrilled she's a really good sponsor what do you mean we don't know what happened to taliesin could we have found him in the one-shot we're not going to have a talks this week because it's halloween where mary came from nicely done yeah still up and running starts taking some of its characteristics my turn yeah actually grog's turn it's not me brilliant happy halloween
