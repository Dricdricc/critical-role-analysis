first one of you that brings me a cow wins it's like a bunch of mr meeseeks with cows do i get to pick a cow there's just one cow right so can i touch the cow on the head we're not killing anything and i punch the cow in the nose no look i'm just seeing what it is stay bessie what i'm just seeing if it bled did the nose bleed i punch it again i took a really easy punch no i'm not is there any blood never mind you know what i changed my mind i don't need a cow i'm going to go stay in a normal room all right i punched it so hard it exploded yeah you want to train with me all right always a good time to get better i guess rope climbs wizard of the day what are you doing that was awesome but this is where you train i thought we were going to train i thought we were going to fight i feel like there's a problem with this idea but i'm not sure what it is so i do it look i know i usually hit back but apparently your mum thinks you can cannonball into me so give it a go oh fuck yes yeah that hits (laughing) okay 26 that was pretty good i liked it a lot i think this might be a good look for me how do i get it to stay i start climbing all over the walls is one of your servants named broom rotisserie chicken do you usually yell when you clean what was that for no i know but i like to make her feel good about it ow i look at trinket and wink yeah what are you doing you didn't clean very much all right i'm good for the night i wanted that cow eating food should've come to me for that yes totally i rest sleeping in the sand pit like a beach just (snore) (laughs triumphantly) you swallowed that last part what did you say why is that bad we commandeered it i don't care i don't think you wanted to do that either are you going to re-gift it sweet yeah shoot me with an arrow oh jesus how many was that just one right we've been here for five minutes it is pretty sweet flying around like that (burps) yeah where no we haven't gotten those yet but there's other things to explore yep yeah oh no i mean whenever it's you know you want to go to the library you know they roam yeah was it what they wander there yep but look i was thinking it might be a thing when we find them right so picture this me and then a lot of other me's and they're all really big and angry so if we want to do anything else before that happens-- yeah and i'm a super cool awesome fun guy but we didn't really leave in the best terms ass-kicked yeah all left for dead pretty much right so i was a bit younger and we were wandering through the woods and we came upon this little old bearded thing right and he was carrying groceries like food and stuff and everybody was a little hammered from boozing and they were like hey let's kill the little thing and we'll string him up and see what his insides look like and normally i'm like yay i'll wear him as a hat but he looked really sweet and i felt bad so i said we shouldn't do that and they didn't like that answer my uncle in particular he didn't like that so he made me fight my cousin his son that wasn't bad i handled that it was not a problem no there's no grudge they pretty much think i'm dead because after i whooped his son's ass he whooped my ass yeah i'm not hiding from my herd i was was i no i'm excited to go i want to go we should go you know what we need is the wolf yeah we need-- yeah don't they smell shit he could help us find them i mean if you want to i don't know how long it's been since he's seen a she-wolf so you know i mean it's very generous yep what's a number bigger than five yeah it's like six yeah six that's closer yeah it's been a long time i mean they're pretty smart they're like me here's the thing though normally if you try and steal something or if you try and break the rules and you're like keyleth and you get arrested every time arrested ain't so bad they don't really arrest you they like open you up and use you as an appetizer yeah that was my thing though so i'm a little nervous about that yep odessa osysa shit that's what i would call her odessa it was pike's grandfather yeah and plus she's a healer all right fuck look if there's a lot of them and only a handful of us it's not usually customary to have two sides go at each other if we want those knuckles i'm pretty sure it might have to be one on one now i know i can totally take my uncle but i wouldn't mind if we found a few extra-credit items before we did that just in case i have the flu that morning or it burns when i pee just something to take the edge off if that's what you want to do then yeah grog does not kiss and tell all the time yeah i mean i hope we do or we go where we could set an ambush later a what 14 do we keep going or do we-- somebody make a choice down or keep going just you two right you three wow

it shit hammer no wait wait we've got to go get his kid you said there are a lot of people that look like me they're in the city we need that guard we're going to ask him some questions i just want the guard no there's two there's two fucking nipple tassels is he holding anything yep i love it i love it we're going to ask him questions and if he makes a peep-- hold on before we do that can you see the other guard that was out here it's like kansas right it's flat what distance would you put him at how far away would you put him 100 yards do it do it when he comes over i grab him nobody do anything that's loud yeah i promise i run over and i tackle him knock him to the ground put my hand over his mouth punch him in the forehead punch him again punch him a third time and i barely lift my hand punch him again (sing-song) horace (muffled) fucking hell i'm going to move my hand if you make a sound wash rinse repeat yeah nod shut the fuck up you're looking big yeah right funny thing about me so look who else is out in this field with you right now yeah no i want back in for sure that's what i've come here for to come back in but here's the thing it's a bit of a surprise right other people haven't seen me you like a good surprise right horace yeah i thought you might here's my question have you seen my cousin zanror is he in the city right and what about kevdak right listen i was going to pounce on this poor farmer over here but i saw you were obviously keeping your eye on him why are you doing that yeah old broken foot over here really gold this poor farmer have you oh like wishbone yeah that does sound like a good idea here's my thing why are you guys in this city it's not really our thing to be in civilized places no i don't think i will horace jesus really kevdak did well it sounds really good i do i've actually brought a few gifts i unsheathe craven edge isn't it and i ask out loud are you hungry i pull it back i stick the point in between his ribcage and i drive it up through him (shocked noises) oh more pity that acid reflux what nothing it takes in the strength of who it slays did it do that what i don't know i remember him he was always a little shit who horace sure yeah he was going to go tell about us what so listen right either we stay and do some recon or we take out the other guy that's walking back to the city really shouldn't be a problem but if they're all in there 50 strong i don't think we're quite ready for that the sneaky fucks in our group could go take a look if you're feeling randy info only yeah but that's because we did it as a group how far are we from the city here five-minute walk that's not far that guard i know i did just imagine what we'll do to the rest of them i don't mind you taking a look but be careful it feels kind of cheap i don't know yeah but can't we use our eyes just as they are do we have to turn to smoke this time it feels a little cowardly yeah that's fine you can turn into a cloud and float in there and see what you want to see but i'm not turning into mist when my herd is inside that city if i go in i'm going in yeah thank you reginald you want some ale no i do yeah hold on get the cask out pour him a cup pace yourself son there's a lot that's here wow another i'll keep them coming scanlan and i have been alone right so i turn to scanlan and i say you and i are mates right right could i confide something in you (clears throat) right well i'm full of surprises one of which is-- so i had this horrible dream recently and in the dream i was killing all these people with this amazing sword that i have but there were a lot of people and some of the people that got killed i knew and i feel it has something to do with this sword that i have and the secret is i can hear the sword talking to me yeah look so i'm telling you because you and i have such a history right and i feel like you won't judge me but like i'm afraid the rest of the group won't quite understand i don't know if i'm crazy or if this sword is talking to me no i just hear a voice and i was wondering if maybe i take it out-- no only when i'm holding it so like i could take it out now and we could see maybe if you hear it so i take out craven edge craven edge how did you enjoy your snack are you getting that you're not hearing anything no like super sexy (low-pitched growl) voice nothing no it's not worth it look do you want to hold the sword i hold the blade and i hand the hilt towards scanlan (grunts) see now now now craven i'm starting to feel like i'm doubting myself i'm seeing things-- he's talking to me i'm going to take it right back i just want him to experience your glory shit fuck that's bad (gulp) seven (pained) no on second thought don't worry about it it's clearly-- and i take it back-- it's not it's just-- maybe i just need to see someone or talk to somebody clearly i mean you don't-- it's talking you don't hear it right no it's really heavy too and i sheathe it three (laughing) giant modifier on this one 16 with a modifier of zero you know what that's a great idea i feel like you should hold this sword and i hold on to the blade but i still hand the hilt to him 18 19 yeah plus one ask it a question yeah and it'll talk right back it's like that is it saying something no it's not saying anything what (laughing) why are you pointing it at reggie yeah i take it back it talked to you then yeah right it's creepy as shit (confused sputtering) now hold on i just wanted to make sure that i wasn't fucking you know batshit crazy which i'm not and i'm really glad that we're sharing in this now but hey hey don't tell anyone promise me no that's why i brought you in you're all smart right and i always want to ask questions like what's the first thing it remembers what was it doing with lord briarwood-- no you must be a dark wizard no it just says it's hungry you heard it that time holy shit i feel like kevin costner in field of dreams and you're james earl jones i've got a friend in this now (laughing) right so look you know yeah right yeah it could be good there's nothing wrong with being hungry i would never never no yeah there's never even like-- yeah totes yep the eiffel tower yep all right what did-- yeah boring here yep no action a lot of goliaths that's what i'd do right trying to be scary agreed as far as this city goes correct me if i'm wrong but we have two options either we stealth in with the stealthy people not me included and we try and pickpocket kevdak for the knuckles or i challenge kevdak for the knuckles yeah cole was heading back to the city though they won't care about a hostage maybe not that hard though so my fear is this that if it's anyone but me and him everyone gets involved not just us but all 60 of them in that stronghold i don't think we walk out of that very well i'm not opposed to facing him head-on and seeing what fate has in store for me while you free any prisoners that might be around or ransacking his house for any fun bits but i think he's going to have the knuckles on him no i would need to think about it regardless i think now is not the time perhaps we go look for osysa's mate he seems pretty fortified and we don't have pike and this is her hometown well yeah speaking from a selfish position if i fall you can really do whatever the fuck you want i think honor is bupkis at that point so i don't mind what you do after that no no no that's very sweet uh emotion i would like it if pike was here they're not nomadic any more yeah they ain't going anywhere yeah let's just do this let's go after osysa's mate if we don't learn or find anything incredibly valuable we're at the same place we are now and then we can kick the tires it's too big for grog could have but it's where pike and her family raised grog her schedule's so busy but if we can get her next week we do
