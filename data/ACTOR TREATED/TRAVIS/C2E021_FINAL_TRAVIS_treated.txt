holy shit those fucking vocals son that shit the synth gives me 80s life in the best way i will be watching that on repeat until 300am the d20 ring where the 20 is the cr logo too it's so pretty (drum beat) [click tv static] [groovy critical role theme] that's a lot of fucking energy this early in the morning god (clears throat) do you have to go and kill it first yeah what are we going to do until then i mean should we explore the street that we're on i mean we've got a long wait time they took the cart the old movie theater grab if you don't mind us asking why are you heading into the swamp yourself repeats stuff yeah yes yep mm-hmm are you getting paid for this item retrieval yeah what have you been doing after school honey very open yeah we're like best friends so you're searching for a bowl and used in rituals our business might be headed out that way a little later today does she have any weapons on her that are visible not me yes that's okay 17 do you think they're sending people to get it there before you oh good for us is that code for something and you have a reason to believe that they are expeditiously heading towards this bowl as well listen we are kind of heading in that direction yes i understand that completely you and i we're going to be real close i can feel i know they can tell no i'm allergic although i don't think we're going to have time for that if you're going to join us you're going to have to work for your food you understand my name's fjord by the way i understand unfortunately my daughter is very particular about shiny and expensive things so if this bowl has any worth i'm afraid we might need to be compensated for our troubles did you happen to bring any coin with you we normally have a no stranger policy but we'll keep a close eye on you if you get up to any tricksy business-- i hear you talking still yeah yasha and molly they'll remove your head for you you understand should we have her sign something i mean should we have a release form good you're in well we'll see how we are at the end of the day bet that'll fix itself you're overthinking it caleb febron any suggestions whether to move through the muck fine land or through the trees the where we'll leave it it'll be fine daughter no you've been naughty no and gets eaten jester's regret i think you tell kids to run with scissors she'll be fine can we check to make sure nobody's following us as we're heading out plus four 16 good pull deep pull already that was like 40 minutes ago no please lead on we're quite anxious to get there fine i'll take the lead who wants to join me thank you both don't fight what are you talking about i honestly don't have an answer for that you said it right it's ford oh jesus kiri all right let's go all right you're actually going to be scouting right three out of five beau right front-- it's really reassuring when there's a question mark on the end of your statement are you still drunk oh jeez 14 can we see a source where it came from a plant or a-- i think that doesn't look very hospitable yeah cali that is a very good idea i mean hoping the pollen's not flammable but sure try it caleb i'll give it a whirl i'll reach up near my eye and you see this little arc of energy pop out from my eye towards my hand i'll throw it forward and cast witch bolt oh thank you yeah ten plus six 16 okay great this is overkill it's 3d12 that's nine-- 27 points of damage no it was a really encouraging display i was not expecting it to be so durable not anymore with these rolls i actually tend to agree i don't want to leave things undiscovered are you surf pro (disgusted) oh yeah super inviting just all the tendons (cat growling) did you hear anything snoring jester bones aren't normally a very good sign you didn't happen to see a bowl did you very wise do you think we'll be able to find our way back here should we mark a tree or something like that which way's your ass fair enough lead on you did a good job the first time let's take it up again i think our speed is halved in the conditions right doing the slo-mo game which is really not losing much at this point maybe we try to outmaneuver this one now ooh 17 plus one 18 hold i saw movement off to our side 40 to 50 feet into the trees fan out a little bit yeah fan out who wants to move towards it with me yasha molly cali and fjord we'll walk towards it but fan out not together maybe ten 15 feet in between us like a fire line but fanned fire line is it moving fast-- easily in this terrain (whispering) do not see me toucan with a belly shh jester we'll keep moving around the edge of the lake who wants to keep an eye on his area as we're moving jester and molly you keep an eye as we keep moving forward we'll come back to where the casters are no they're going to stay with us in a tight group but they're going to keep their eyes as we move mind your slice of the pie all right you guys you're a fan of pie so heard of something like that around here yeah i don't know if that's going to work for me all right let's get moving try and ignore this we'll give him a chance whether he engages or not no stealth maybe a little faster than our regular too some people i saw it what do you want to do not too far or we could just keep letting him match we could or jester you're pretty friendly you want to see if-- what's the trap made of okay how about this yasha i'm sure you'll agree we can make one move to see if it's interested in non-violence and then we have the advantage here now i don't like being tailed in particular don't you that means literally nothing to me i don't think we should stealth fuck the ambush there's nine of us one of him molly yasha and i will not be stealthing and heading inward and we'll be just behind jester's diplomatic envoy (sarcastically) oh no i was enjoying our closeness are we sure it's the same one 17 yes perfect mushrooms question answered did it move away do you want to chase it i think that's a good call we'll stagger back towards the back line of our group 15 maybe we can get back to talking to the dead people which one's got the better mouth easy kiri easy settle settle underground did any of it precede the attack he's fucking huge i thought he was humanoid-sized why did you go try to be friends with that what are you thinking this is north towards me xenomorph blood is he unconscious is he done is that it jester and cali 14 as well oh my god 33 can i move 15 feet towards the troll i'll see the gore and poison splattering all over beau and little sizzles coming up and shit and i'm like eh eldritch blast (screams blasts) okay oh that's 26 to hit and 25 to hit those were monsters jeez 1d10 plus four that's eight points on the first one and that's 14 points on the second one oh shit right 33 yeah don't anybody else hit it yeah i cast regret (laughing) you didn't really like that character that much did you that's what happened to febron i don't either i mean i got something that holds but it damages too no how you can use your str-- yeah modern literature we don't know what that is what how's febron a soggy kfc drumstick send it packing molly what does it sound like hadouken glug glug she doesn't have a glug glug i'll move five feet closer towards el troll and i'll say get the fuck out of here and i'll eldritch blast twice that's going to miss anyway and the second one they both miss you get your ass out of this forest yeah get the fuck on out nobody wants you here anyway sure i'll do it i'll take two more eldritch blasts at it at disadvantage right that's a natural one my bad 19 18 that'll hit that's 25 1d10 that's nine plus four 13 points of eldritch blast you fucking piece of shit don't you dare tell us what we're starting to think yeah that's right we know where his hovel is so lesson learned beau is just you fucking-- still one more question yeah in fact could we could take a short rest while caleb's doing that since that was a little gnarlier than we anticipated so good finish her how far does that extend it occurred to me from what your friend said that this location might not be entirely above ground any longer yeah two hours past what was it noon maybe it only becomes visible at a certain time since there are things that'll be snagging bitches when we get separated cali do you plan to go back to port damali after this if you're successful absolutely well let's try our luck certainly not welcome is the water around the tree in a circle like it pans out from around the side i'll go with her just to accompany or when if someone grabs you from the shore easiest to remember liam and there's a teal piece of fabric that's tied up on a branch how deep is the water without the water being dispersed near the base of the tree oh jeez nicely done who's first wait let's just hold on i'll go in with darkvision without setting off any lights that might herald them then i'll get hurt i don't see anything inside here looks like there was a broken lamp so careful with fire yeah i'll push in a little bit more looking up do i notice any furniture articles clothing 17 i believe cali not that i can see not any danger in the chamber but it looks like there's more to this room could've been nott bren you're up yep by yourself brackish flesh gross well only one place to go and that's down yeah sure i like what i'm hearing shark fins and shit i'm a happy camper we're going to find out how far double knot it is kind of enclosed i like that idea we're good to fuck them up i think no i don't think that's a good idea i could blind them what i'm not half fish i'm half-orc that is actually not true at all nott not at all half-human i'd assume marisha and once right now 13 18 do what you're going to do i'm going to run around the corner give me that right over here yeah so i can see all three of them at least 'sup fish-fucks (laughter) aren't y'all pretty i look in the space in between them i see this ripple start to form and i reach out with my hand and i'll grasp at the space and tear a rip in reality and i'll cast hunger of hadar ripping this 20-foot dome on the ground i'll put it right here so it's-- actually no i'll stick it right here yeah because it halves it makes it difficult terrain so let's put it right there ish only if they start in it or if they end their turn in it two different types of damage well actually it says the void is filled with a cacophony of soft whispers no light magical or otherwise can illuminate the area of the 20-foot sphere-- it's just within the sphere they're blind they take 2d6-- each of them do i roll that five four nine points of damage each cold (impacts) tentacle beating and they're in difficult terrain so it's halved yeah you just send whatever you've got in the sphere trying to keep them in one spot at the end of their turns they must succeed on a dexterity saving throw-- oh sorry my fault 17 that hits i have to make a constitution saving throw to keep the spell okay strength save nine what do i have to make i forget 23 that hits natural 20 that is a six and a one so seven points of acid damage yeah it's a sphere of darkness with stars with milky tentacles whipping around that's what it says what happens to the harpoon and the cord sticking out of me i appreciate it (pained sounds) i'm going to hug this wall if i can back up a little bit and i'm going to hold eldritch blast if i see them emerge from the darkness i'm scooching two three five points of cold damage yeah they both 21 i don't know i can't add this fast my app's breaking 13 17 i go unconscious i use my relentless endurance to pop back up to one 19 plus all that i'm super strong where the fuck is it 14 it's like a dock on a tuesday morning at disadvantage 16 doesn't hit he's throwing in the dark in the direction where two guys and he's threading them and hitting me fair enough unconscious i go don't worry if i sink i have that armor it's a life preserver guys throw me a bud light thanks jester oh god what's wrong with beau (thuds) ugh mike myers flurry of beaus i'll use half my speed to stand upright and i'll unleash two eldritch blasts at that-- that's a 26 and that's cocked reach for the sky and an 18 six points of damage on the first one and 14 points of damage on the second one i stand up i get to my feet i touch the wound area and i fire it across the way we can deal with tempers somebody help me check these crates do they have any rune-ish markings on them or anything like that we treat guests so well are there any weapons that the merrow dropped the hook or the spears or were they tridents or anything i pick up one of the tridents does it seem like an average-- plus some of us can swim we could pop down real quick and see what's down there anyone else feel like going for a swim laura and yeah pretty decent no sure we have an extra 50 feet we didn't really need the rest yeah but i mean we're fine let's do it yeah i'm going to go down and if i start running short on air i'll come back up no you don't need to do that there's no need jester we'll take a short rest afterwards just a quick little recon i drop the rope and jump in this is college all over again 21 six i'll take a big breath blow it all the way out (inhales deeply) go back under push back what's the depth like as i'm going through so i can see the bottom that's not so bad yeah there's another room there's five more of them if i remember yeah there's a whole other cavern there's ruins and objects and all sorts of stuff we're not done with this by a damn sight there were so many things there were crates and objects could be underneath it we could guard this entrance and rest up for a bit get ourselves together and carry through it's not that far i think everybody could make it i certainly could help somebody if they're not a very good swimmer but-- we could i know there are five but i think we use this funnel point as a fatal funnel right we make them come through one at a time we send some bait bring them back through but only when we're ready what do you think cali sure are you natural beau or big-ass beau cali i'm just curious you don't want to try and smash it on the ground real fast just for shits and giggles yeah i mean while we're all here yasha chuck that shit on the side of the wall will you we're actually traveling all around i was going to ask where do you go now since you've achieved your objective we might find our way down to the menagerie coast at some point and if we do we'll give you a look strong grip remember follow the daggers on the way out they mark your way dram-o-mine
