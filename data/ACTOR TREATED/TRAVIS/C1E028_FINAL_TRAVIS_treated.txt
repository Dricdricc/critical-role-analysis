an extra 3d6 of damage sorry i blacked out for a little bit (all laugh) what do you have to do to attunement caressing it that's more than i usually do just in case you need a sword i missed it it

works on me-- -- a diversion that was perfect timing his ways are mysterious my love couldn't hurt you know we could try to work our way up the opposite side of the chasm yeah it can't move with us could you make it fire we're also on a chasm so if it gets wet and slippery and muddy we might all go down i have mine too so i'll put that on as well attached to a rope and a grappling hook that's in

are lying about me investigate that's funny eight i find dirt wow matt you do notice that some of the blood is dragged through like something was dragged out of the puddle but not for a long distance whatever was there was cleaned off at some point or lifted up and carried out from whatever was originally pulled through those puddles of blood you also do notice that in the pile of furs and refuse and there are bones of things that were left there to rot in the corner you find roughly 120 gold pieces is it evil can i walk out the front door can i walk out the front door and keep post on the porch and i want to look in the direction we want to be walking she's attuning do we see anything outside on the porch stealth i might use your inspiration on this i am in the mountains i don't have advantage on-- so can i add an inspiration on this that's a one (loudly) that's what i said birds (loudly) yeah i spy birds they're flying everywhere (yells) go away i run back inside do it do they fall to the porch i run out there and i grab it i rip its head off with my teeth (all laugh) yeah shut up dust of tracelessness why they were just birds and we're at the southern part of that that's a detailed map man they sell those stock right riveting we could send one in just to see if the town is normal or not we should send one by air and one by land like up in the trees we're gonna climb some trees yeah get on the ground not just above and as they're going out we get in the trees do we the four of us all go up in the trees plus ten to stealth 14 stealth i've been doing the dust of tracelessness we'll see i'll take it what really the golden snitch wins again six smart (snores) (yells) i fall out of the tree because he's dead nice bonnet i like it nope this is a trust exercise you don't like the trust exercise no i'm good thank you that could help can we at least try cutting down the bodies and running and seeing what happens i heard you're supposed to pee on a lemon tree so can i make a nature check to see if that's true 19 that's 17 operation tree rescue i have an idea should we wait until the sun comes up create a distraction so all the undead giants come looking and then we have someone go cut the bodies off the tree and-- -- let keyleth give it a little love i don't know it's an experiment all right they can see through that oh shit this is like phone a friend who knows you have a plan tell us your plan shh let him finish the plan okay where do we start (pained groan) fucking gravity this is like sunup right let's go find an abandoned building and set up this is what happens holy crap step one of this do we take the stealthy one or the invisible one first part is getting an abandoned building abandoned building part one so who goes and finds the abandoned building we need a forward operating base so who wants to be stealthy or invisible and find an empty building does it require attunement we have dried food rations we've got dried food rations he has a plan come on drop your pants and get with the plan it's like 12% of a plan that was an eight beard check amazing is it like that vidal sassoon commercial whip it you can forget it i won't go in look like commoners shit i'm a goliath are we all going together are we not sending one person in to go find an empty building leave the bear or do you want him to be a donkey something we can move milk cows are slow just like her owner i wanted to be a model oh shit are we checking buildings while we're walking through was the first number gonna be a 40 we casually begin-- interesting it's north yeah we continue on don't pay too much attention to it find a place to post up that's a large radius right do it from inside a house i know five what do you want to get closer and look are you sure-- they're probably watching the tree i don't think they're here i don't think they're here no remember they have to like be where the soil they came from is i don't think they're here okay the one's painted all red-- we're all there no it was because of emon let's stick with the plan yeah 150 feet from the tree preferably three bedroom three bath no no no no no not yet let's post up first yeah we're all going in come inside don't bring that-- don't mess with that thing once we do it it's like ringing a dinner bell yeah we'll take it i am too i'm staying up in the tavern you want
