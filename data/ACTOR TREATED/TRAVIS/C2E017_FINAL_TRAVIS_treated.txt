crownsguard in the little waiting area that we're in can i make my way to one that's over by the entrance man i cannot wait to see this year's victory pit competition i hear the beasts are heartier than they were last year which one is your favorite so far the beast they selected this year really man i heard you guys were more informed than that really sheesh what do you got to do to get duty like that where do the handlers of those beasts stay around here fair enough you feel like dropping a coin on a team remember the mighty nein i walk away what are you going to do about the flying creatures indeed yeah natural one yeah nine yeah no nine yeah bring it out put me behind that wall yep oh good or the other one's invisible yep oh shit ladies first can i turn towards the beast and i'll cast eldritch blast at it that is a 23 to hit that is a ten plus four 14 points of damage can i roll back behind cover even a couple more out of view there we go sentinel rock that shit goodnight irene let's go big nope if you go reckless you can so nonchalant with that shit where are you at jester hit point-wise you want a health potion you want a health potion i think you should save-- because you got stabbed with poop-teeth yeah fucking take it did it look like they prepared anything with fire before the creature came out they used cover really well we should try and hide ourselves better nott had a great idea actually though we should keep our distance we don't you people that need to be up close just wait until it gets to you make him chase you for a bit use the cover let's put some damage on it before-- jester and molly oh no no that isn't me either six yeah round two oh fuck me oh god oh 12 ooh 13 yeah okay i'm going to cast armor of agathys on myself and i'm going to use my bonus action to cast hex on the wolf that's nearest to yasha and give it disadvantage on dexterity checks i'm going to use my movement to run towards that wolf mm-hmm in between molly and yasha stay out of the cone get on the backside huge with my bonus action can i transfer my hex onto this wolf and can i start running around to get to its right hindquarter staying in melee but getting on its rear mm-hmm can i keep coming this way a little bit more yeah right there i reach back and as i start to swing my hand up i'll summon the wastehunter falchion and slice up through it that's 26 to hit 13 points of damage one d6 necrotic for another four so 17 total nein fuck it really is come on tell us how you taxidermy it yasha yasha could you give it to one more do you have to spare okay i'll take some okay great they pass out when the manacles go on i'm tapped plus somebody's going to be super danger close right off the bat we've got some super squishy people in here that won't make it past-- all right if that's what you guys want to do i'll go take one of the doors for the record i do not like this plan you should get some distance any ideas the idea is that whatever doors they come out of will get one surprise round and then whoever's by those doors better be able to take some damage-- you don't want to be near me you should be in the middle able to move yeah there are four doors right i don't know if the map is accurate to how many doors there are-- fuck that no no no we've got to get in the middle this is a terrible plan there's too many doors there's those four others besides the one we came in no no we got to come in the center we got to take advantage of the sentinels that's the point of the feat we're spread way too fucking thin go back in the middle like we thought we were going to do (shouting) my door my door two spines in the side oh my god (laughter) my door yep oh my god
