learned from the previous sessions naked and running in full steam yeah no vestiges no nothing i'm so happy right now ah deception first things first right how do we get there we don't take like a ship right says him psh oh i got it we kidnap the president of hell and we assume his visage why have you seen him feel like i'm going to forget this i've got special gloves like a what you're going to make me a special hand muff (laughter) is there any worth to only a few people or one or two going in to get a lay of the land once we get there instead of just moving in our truffle-shuffle normal formation i'll do it i'm very stealthy what is the problem with that we got away with it right did we get caught did we get caught tary no tary is very excited about my plan it's affecting his memory of what happened yeah peruse the last 90 pages for the last hour if you don't use a turn signal if you have a vanity plate you go to hell (laughter) really pike tary what else (laughs) nope so we kidnap the president (laughter) good slick when we went to the city of brass we were owned right that's what let us move around so freely there's nothing that we need to think about like that so that we have-- you actually become that thing yeah i don't believe you yeah he does have a slight point maybe we do them a favor it's not like we're saying-- i got lost but i agree it's literally right there motherfuck-- oh do you have those potions perceived it are you sure you don't want to give me one because i usually end up pouring it into one of you sloppy saps yeah yeah get up (laughs) what yarr oh good question frederick what about d-roll tary do you want me to punch you in the face sam's stuff is right there isn't it can we tear off your sleeve and then you understand infernal we could try you can't just off-the-cuff that you've gotta save that for something yeah do that yeah you get to suck nope laura and that is not true (laughter) oh i dunno i never look that far ahead it keeps disappointment low yep goals hey (with a mouthful of drink) i don't have any plans so i do anything and it normally works out great you don't need to see all the way to the horizon right you just gotta see right in front of your own little feet you'll get there yep not yet percy are you going to be like mr bates on downton abbey afterwards i learned it from you (laughter) you're going to shroom your tits off tree beasts or three beasts is it all water outside still like a little bit of water on the ground no we're not there anymore there's so much water outsi-- (laughter) taste of choice takes a strong constitution it's so pure it never leaves a hangover (laughter) (whispers) insight check ai she's not even waiting for it brilliant you're not going to ask her any questions but she's a fuckin' felon on the run from the hells you're just going to let her go-- no you're a fool you're blind she's a mass murderer and you let her pick your vegetables it's a great cover she's got more people to bury make it the last word in a four-sentence line regularity how did it go did you learn everything i expected it to go pretty fucking well oopeck that's it that's all you got did you believe her what's her last name she's coming with us though right nononono how do we feel about kidnapping the nine-year-old tiefling tary do you remember how dangerous the kraken was and this is like-- (whispers) what's a big number this is like seven times more dangerous only if you want to become you know a full-fledged permanent into-the-histories member of vox machina mm wise choice a wise choice it's only like part of it do you have a will made up don't worry about it we'll get to that later i will shave both of your heads (electric razor noise) i'm above you the divine gate we didn't say it holy shit [break] the box is really sweet we just saw it that's weird send up a flare what (groans) ugh it's tucson is it like a fondue pot of nine people in one this guy needs some calcium right next to that beautiful picture of a-- do we know what layer we're in oh we gotta find the-- open market right yep please don't make me be the one that remembered all the shit about dis i mean i am the grand poobah de doink of all of dis and that so y'all motherfuckers is coming with me ahh mayonnaise (squelching noise) or how much i love it sam said he can cast alter self on himself plus three others okay female heroes' feast whoa cool wow that's true i lean over to vex and i say oi in an effort to blend in should we just kill a random person i just thought of it so does that mean it's called for is that what you do here they might really like it here oh right i'm glad i asked you okay asking you love you detroit natural snitch if you roll one more natural 20 it's just going to dissolve into gold dust and float away yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah get the fuck out of my nightmares and we all fall out is the ground as hot as the walls are jesus it's like a parking lot in texas is there anything about the humans in particular are they wearing anything unusual or do they have any company with them that might denote why they're allowed to roam about empty (whispers) i bet it's one of those little dudes we had i am currently spitting on the ground and watching it evaporate ooh he said a familiar creature we're still outside slick he's literally eating raw meat and blood let's be honest it doesn't really matter what we think about that price does that burn you oh (laughs) of course yeah yeah we got one left let's take it upstairs he said three of them oh yeah how many souls did you just buy like a whole family back to the plan and then the feast can i touch the door with my pointy finger real quick is it burny oh my god yep that thing was still alive i'm not topped off i need four hit points thank you he's rolling we've got to get arrested keyleth will get arrested no problem dispator wait you said it wasn't fully formed right it's still like in its goo phase am i the only one that feels like this is an awful lot of trouble for something that's not a problem yet not in a chocolate egg okay small question we checked in as-- you checked in as tieflings for bursts of an hour each time there's only a few rooms in this place right i would think so-- ol' broken sausage finger may be sharper than we think hey i'm really hungry can we have that fucking feast now they pump oxygen in you can stay up as late as you want come on now we might not come back here (sighs) oh tary he's losing hit points from this are we staying in for the for a bit we've only been traveling for like a few hours right yeah so if we've got to find our way to some sort of prison two options get arrested or ask people where people go who get arrested which seems really fishy and stupid i wish i had some bacon right now you know i still look the way i did when i checked in looking like me going to go and do all the recon what you and i me and the tiger but you said minxie where are you pointing over here i can't see i've got a head of hair in the way where'd you point yeah but it's more angry they're going to want to steal you and put you in a cage yeah and i go down as just backup oh you did a rail of soul huh okay sweet he did he's so causal he was like (inhales then roars) (laughter) oh no what comes out of the bottle okay greg what does the chalice smell like i take a big old sip this i'm sure you know is really good i had too much of this wine anybody looking at us strange i've made up my mind no no it's you and me down here if you want your glasses back we decide here and now damn it apparently people are listening to everything so no names no specifics how many empty soul stones did she have while we were gone i don't think it matters though we gotta kill someone and then get arrested for it i understood that we kill him then when we go to the prison he knows people in the prison who would make sure that we find our way to the right places but that's the shady part business well if we've got your code name what'll we call you taliesin and freddie right i still like d-roll but whatever freddie how do you feel about this plan right but do you have any amendments to it would you change it somehow who's to say where he's going right so my thought right is that i think we have to be arrested breaking into a prison seems real tough at least with this guy's plan if he's lying the worst we get is just straight-up arrested which i would assume means all our toys get confiscated right so not all of us go on the killing yeah and if he's a man of his word then those people that are in get led along to this magic place where you can go and smash chicken little but if he's a lying piece of shit like i'm sure everyone else is we're going to need someone on the outside-- really and do what i think we go perform the hit and then we leave tary i mean barry to get arrested right like super-secret spy no this is a very privileged role yep big-time macho-man stuff yeah he's ready for more responsibility right really (sings) don't say no to this yeah me too archdevil is the pope of this area definitely something big with big red flashing wings though do we all want to kill the thing explain to me about the contract so in the contract if he doesn't hold up his end of the bargain like he explodes or something right it's a magic contract because if we get arrested and they take all our goodies and we're in a cell i'm going to kill all of you with my bare hands prison assault we don't know where the prison is what no hey beekus you just said his real name so hey freddie like how long do you think guy downstairs will give us to decide not supposed to make any deals we could just try and do it on our own the deal might put us in a position where we're totally fucked we don't even know where the prison is you think isn't that the way life is just take off running around the city man boom marathon woman go get it (sings) she's a maniac man-- oh he's down there how do you fly can you do that and concentrate at the same time yeah sure off go on fly off by yourself nobody cares how do you go you get captured or eaten out there we're done for the night anyway (laughs) imps this is your game go for it do it have that backup character ready (laughter) go get it keep going momentum yeah ermahgerd-- (sings) highway to the danger zone i could be many people it could all f-- silence (laughter) it's royal we multiple bags
