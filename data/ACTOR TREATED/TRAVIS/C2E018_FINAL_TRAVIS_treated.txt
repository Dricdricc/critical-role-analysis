what i mean yeah of course that's quite the offer seem to be opening up the whole kit and caboodle for us here we understand your position unfortunately you find us in a precarious time as you can see we don't have all of our fellows here with us and this morning's news caught us unawares we'd need a fair bit of time to consider your offer i'm afraid we can't give you a yes or no right now we have sympathy for your situation will you be here in a few hours if we need to return fair enough your asks are fair we'll return quickly we turn and leave i do too or something just as sinister let's find the others and get our story straight we've already been it's all right ham and beth we now have something that rivals a shopping episode it's called the library i mean i have to give a small golf clap for-- not dolan we are in rexxentrum we ate like three shepherd's pies we fucking killed a guy and hid him in the room we stuck him next to the skellington for what uh-huh wow yeah sure why not do i have to touch it or just look at it i'll do both are you doing it too sure was i supposed to say something oh no it was a crazy trip though yep no well i don't know 10000 gold i mean shit wouldn't mind earning 10000 and then bouncing yeah you're conscripted as long as you stay in town right let's go to pumat's had a bit of a tussle guess what we're back for i know we were in here very recently you haven't got any overnight special deliveries of anything interesting have you you're welcome what was that other item you had does it work with medium armor how much for that shield i think i'm all right we got an offer to work for the city to be legionnaires to protect it while its troops hunters and mercenaries are going to the front lines there are bounties of up to 10000 gold in reward if we stay our other option being fleeing the city there were no postings for-- believe so oh the soltryce yeah i'd like to see it but i guess i'm not in a terrible rush sure she seemed pretty heartfelt i think a polite exit would be thoughtful i'm going to go back to pumat's i'm going to buy that damn shield thank you not me the opposite direction pro 10000 gold everybody rolls a d8 it was a d8 six plus four ten
