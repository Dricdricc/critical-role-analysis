every time welcome back baby where'd you get that great t-shirt you're wearing and they got really good stuff you got your t-shirt from loot crate voltron yes yeah back in the pilot chair we're in trouble six all right i'm ready to go yeah do we have to wait long because i have the pee you know where you're like hide-and-go-seek pee feywild what a dicklord you did not throw out the paper you piece of shit why did you throw it away what a fucking-- what what level are you doing inception this is amazing who's yes whoa me so it's mine what those are like amazing things there's a petrified crocodile what else did you see while we were in this magical place what thank you we just left there yeah wait if you got a bow and there were pixies and you gave her something did i get anything did i pick up any diseases can i insight check scanlan six that's pretty great i like all those things you said did i get any new weapons i won't be able to pull it out of the bag of holding unless i know what's in there i don't have pockets oh fuck i mean oh fuck a little statue of a dog can i reach into the bag of holding for an onyx statue of a dog 11 if you want to reach in here and reach in my bag oh it has an intelligence of eight six get to the bottom part come on if you set camp though good sentry all right we start walking back to whitestone do we smell oh shit amongst a horde of dragonborn did you see any motion any slaves this white dragon does he bring weather or any sort of change it's all ice and snow yeah i'm going outside 17 fucking fucked this is his home i'll be right behind him he said they're curving what direction are they looking shall we scatter spread the word we're scattering fucking ziggurat looks like the spell worked yeah apparently we went to the feywild and everybody remembers it but me and percy i'm just too smart what do you see don't make me any dumber (surprised noises) i got petrified i tried diplomacy never again holy shit no it's okay yeah percy will remember the nude massage i forgot that shaun was gilmore's first name well we've got a few of these vestiges so we're a little powered up but we're not quite sure what their full abilities are it's significant but we think they do more we're just not sure how much can't you tell what direction the dragons were heading so not back they came from the west right to the west to answer your previous question there are four vestiges left ooh yeah yeah your parents in another plane of existence which i don't know if that's a problem yeah we need more offence less defense i don't know if that will work a second time best not to mention our name i don't think we're cool with the clasp after our last meeting yes strange that he had all those wyverns with him though umbrasyl had none he was by himself yeah but didn't they say the white one was more savage more emotional can we ask why would it bring retaliation how would they know it was us what if we don't sign it when we killed the first one there were a bunch of jewels in the wall and we saw a bunch of eyeballs i insight check jarett seven well i was looking for a loot crate have you guys seen any loot crates that's incredible how do i get one of those oh shit hold on i reach into the bag of holding and i grab five expensive-ass bottles of wine well i've a question if i were to call somewhere a city of brass where would you think that would be we were already there once actually well look the plate of the dawnmartyr is in a city of brass but i don't know where that is draconia is in wildemount right and so is the big white fuck right the city of brass worse than the fire plane wait isn't that where the rakshasa's going to be who's got a map where's the ozmit sea which direction is it towards draconia well look hey so i have an idea right someone mentioned that the white dragon is very vain and very savage he's got like all those wyverns around him that's a little bit of a bitch for us we're usually good one dragon on all of us you got a whole gang worse for us so what about if we played to his vanity and maybe sent him knocking on one of his conclave brother's doors maybe start a little beef that maybe's not there i don't know the idea just popped up i'm looking for your help and shit you know how tired i am right now wolverines yeah scanlan keep thinking about it you'll be the hercules mulligan of vox machina are we at all just forgetting the fact that draconia is lying in ruins how far away is draconia from here travel wise doesn't draconia have an army there if there are any survivors anyone we can bring back to whitestone shouldn't we be accumulating those people we're sneaky we're so sneaky yeah pike's not even here no no that was personal yeah no look i'm not trying to pick a fight with a dragon i'm just going to make sure that dragonborn are there and we can help them wow well listen again i'm not trying to kill the white dragon i want him to go pick a fight with the other dragons you guys don't know how to pick a fight you honestly can't brainstorm one way to pick a fight i would talk mad shit to the white dragon on behalf of the green dragon i would rep the green dragon i'm just saying i feel like an opportunity's being wasted here fine someone else do the thinking i bet you could do a lot of incredible things or maybe even statues where umbrasyl's nest was do we know how they communicate gilmore asum do either of you have a theory on how they communicate they were broken already i'm only saying maybe it's empty right draconia i'm only saying if they were just here-- get people out do recon whatever sam and i'm just pointing out an opportunity where there is one a few days we would have a whole fucking day why not wyverns when else are we going to know for sure yeah i know an ancient dwarven one that says no risk thank you disrupting communications is a great tactic you don't think we're going to make it to the jewels and smashy-smash oh man i can find all sorts of problems with a situation if i look hard enough opportunity honestly there's a dragon's perch and he is vacated and it will probably never happen again as far as we know cool while they're killing whitestone because we didn't take advantage of this moment then we'll go to draconia i pounce on it yeah should we put it down who are we talking about (laughter) oh why we know about tiberius we know about kruvanis stormwind not great oh are we asking for grog's opinion now i think we should take the hint and not go yeah but i was picturing meandering out of a nice beautiful tree in a forest i do hate to have my own words used against me i'm down to party i'm just saying it was a little different in my head i'll go first you hold my hand and i'll go first i'll go let's do it i'm ready does the portal only close after a couple seconds all right sweet i am too should you make me some something teensy yes that's awesome 17 oh 27 27 am i right under percy (laughs) yep 13 i got a booby pike's a small monster we're going to crack out the good old dust of tracelessness since there's knee-high snow what is the definition of this word (speaking in japanese) keeping an eye out for trees oh are there any frozen bodies oh i rolled a ten are there any trees that we can see as we're walking hey 19 i did might be a long way though (moans) (laughter) do not answer that question we follow can i ask a question the bodies on the spikes none of them look familiar right a big icy dog bed the highest point nine if we do then we violate what we said we were going to do that's amazing i used my last magic poo to look at my daughter i have a suggestion the white dragon is primal right he likes to hunt creatures we've got to go now we leave we leave them alone that way we're not in danger they're not in danger we promise to come back not only with forces to help remove the white dragon but also with something for it to hunt that way we're not fighting it in its fucking lair we know that there are people that will work with us we know what the terrain looks like we know what his lair looks like which we don't want to be in when we fight him and we know how to get him out of it possibly it's a pretty successful trip how about a little wine they did want trees i like the tree idea tooma forgive me i'm not the best speaker but we have learned from fighting these dragons that if we fight them in their lair we are at a severe disadvantage we are of a mind on that if you can get away from the city-- oh no oh jeez oh man i love it yeah i go and i gather the remains i have a horrible thought if we move him will the dragon know we were here where should we bring him we take him back to where the frozen books lay i'm going to take a chalice out of the bag of holding and i begin to fill it with ale and then remember he preferred water and i take the alchemy jug and i pour fresh water into the chalice and lay it with him pour one out for tibs we will be
