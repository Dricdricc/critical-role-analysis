oh yeah mainline that shit amazing yes yes i mean yeah yeah parlay yeah i think it will be a parlay unfortunately well i don't know who these people are what kind of ship they've come in on i mean this can go one of two ways either very amicably or we all die oh i don't know do we have a spyglass onboard this ship lead anything i said a spyglass and you pulled out a bird oh they're that close yeah so i'm going to look like the half-orc captain was i close enough to hear him talk when he was on the dock shit fuck balls ass okay so i'm going to make myself look like him yeah i know we don't have to relive it can i reply to that message we're about to be boarded by fucking pirates [laughter] [applause and cheering] can i make myself look like the captain jawgrasp but can i put like a bloody bandage around my throat as if i suffered a wound and i'll talk like this okay well i mean not that you're already really super dangerous-looking but maybe you could like menace it up a little bit i'm going to roll a perception check yeah no hold on i know the name [cheering] the windlass yeah and we'll make sure that flag is nice and high that had the gray-- (pigeon cooing) (rasping) actually funny you mention sinking our boat sustained some damage so if i could request of the captain perhaps some grace while we go into shore i'm afraid if we try to make it to her ship we might be on the bottom of the ocean yes my throat it's all fucked up okay 17 yeah heavy casualties yeah the butcher's bill was very steep yep it would seem that way [laughter] jesus do you think you can accommodate seven of us on your two craft do we we have a rowboat [laughter] i'll turn to the rest of the crew and be like just do whatever she-- he-- she says nott make sure that caleb comes with us he's awful grumpy below decks he needs to be on the part of the boat with us yeah go get fucking caleb he's a terrifying fighter just make sure he's on the boats no good at these that poor bastard coming out of the gun port [cheering] i'll go first no that's not right at all sure yep i mean yes oui [laughter cheering] oh yes we actually came under such heavy heat we had to rebrand the ship as the mistake yeah yep we came across some new crew may i introduce-- tracy bowman next to tracy you will see phillip is a talented bosun may i also introduce the tall and powerful-- he's a talented cook that one what was your name again corneli-- yeah the food just blows your mind well you see we now know the location of the artifact you seek it's as good as ours oh god it's real sore all part of the plan well i must commend you on your perceptiveness my balls are quite large [cheering] that is a wonderful story one that i would love to share you have the honor of being in the company of the mighty nein [cheering] it's a long story but i'm afraid we won't be able to tell it or further converse unless we have an atmosphere of equal exchange here and this hostile act is not a step in the right direction captain yes (laughs) gilli-gone hon hon indeed oh yeah [laughter] it's also got a giant fucking ogre on it now get your hat out of the way well i imagine there must be a hefty reward for the item that you seek we went through great troubles just to acquire it perhaps yep [laughter] fjord it's actually captain tusktooth but-- (clears throat) cornelius what say you in this highly delicate matter that is not necessary we would absolutely love to prove our loyalty in your service it's a resounding yes of course by all means vera (mic thuds) yeah yeah i'll make my way over to janet-- yasha and take her by the arm and say you okay with this if i ask her about it let her know that i don't know anything oh you don't think she'd believe me that's a fine idea yeah like i hoard the information very small ship yeah work your magic not making any movements to move the ship it's just staying yeah i third that question so what i have worked out is that we have what she needs we got to try and find out as much as we can about why she wants it and what it does where does she want it for herself or is she taking it somewhere that's about all i got yeah oh shit is marius lepual back on the other ship that poor bastard oh shit our fucking tortle they better not sink i like orly yeah okay fair enough i feel like we can make some ground without fighting if we have to i feel like we can find out what we need and maybe slip away i think that's a great idea no i kind of fucking like it actually how about in the meantime keep an eye on the people around right watch what they're doing the things they're doing on the mast rigging right try and familiarize yourself with working a boat if you can sure yeah our partners yes sapphire more of the what this is mine i earned this and it's not actually in the game it'll be our pleasure yeah mind if we partake of your beautiful spread here is there food in this bitch 14 that's a candle that's a candle stop eating the candle [laughter] no put it back [laughter] outside the door is it essentially us and the captain if you don't mind my asking-- tusktooth yes i know if i could you seem so anxious when was the last time the item was in your possession i'm so excited to reunite you with it i feel like if you tell us your story we'll share in that sense of triumph you're correct i have it on very good authority that an island that is surrounded by the deeprow reef is housing the item you seek 20 [cheering] i do i do fuck i picked the one reef that doesn't have any goddamn islands she doesn't know that and i'm not saying this out loud yeah yeah oh uncharted islands let's not do that [laughter] well you see marquis lepual let us know that you were in dire need of it and that there was heavy coin and glory in its delivery now as you can see i lost my original crew and found these bunch of fuckwits you see i do owe them a little bit of coin for their trouble and i sure would hate to leave them empty-handed plus i want to see what happens when you're reunited with your treasure perhaps [laughter] captain i hope you understand that this is not my first rodeo if i were to tell you everything that i know right now why would you need me alive that's what i heard great pizza place no no no take it easy it sure as fuck doesn't could you say that again slower stay away from the captain's cheese do you know what that means i don't know what the fuck that means no she is the chosen of-- (high-pitched) serpent so say we all yeah just a moment no nott i'm pretty sure you're not playing this out all the way that shit's in my body okay bless you sam and did you all do that together the dreams i have dreams she's not looking at me right i'm a (vocalizing) you have dreams i've had dreams of being deep underwater there's a giant eye that sees me i hear a voice speaking to me but i can't reply does that ring any bells perhaps not perhaps this is destiny i must tell you i am very eager to see what this leads to i haven't been entirely honest [laughter] the item you seek does not lie on vial coa-- what the fuck was it called vide cay it does not reside there i have it protected in an alternate dimension i'll use minor image to show the sphere and make it disappear if we can work together i would like to accompany you to this temple you speak of i would like to see it find its resting place if who's plotted out the course to the temple who cosko oh no no no as we turn to leave the cabin the captain's quarters a quick look of anything that looks like info about where this temple is in case she decides to fucking slit our throats in the middle of the night ugh a ten awesome everybody drink yeah laura as we're moving through can we clock sort of what's being kept on the ship are there cells are there barrels are there packages of things did we previously see what the flag they were flying was and what it looked like i can't remember can we do that now that fucking eye yes it does but i don't want her to know that i can't know that for sure but i know that as soon as she has it there's very little reason to keep us around caduceus would you mind telling me did you feel anything coming from the captain well i don't know you seem to make these strange comments about how people feel and stuff i'd have thought maybe you were like a mind-reader let's pay attention next time shall we cool oh good call i mean-- well if-- no shame i'll tell you what i know and that's that i see visions sometimes it's been a long time since there's a giant eye and i hear a voice speaking to me i don't know where it comes from and i don't know where i am if it's the past or my future but i feel like it happened that night when the ship exploded and before i found myself on the shore with the sword i feel like those things are all connected when i saw the sphere it reminded me of that eye i am too i wouldn't say ongoing it's happened like three or four times sure three or four times three yeah right or i can summon the dragon [cheering] i have been having them but i wouldn't think to comment on them because they're just fucking dreams no not to my knowledge did i no you're right i have under-shared and i'm sorry i just didn't think it was relevant well yeah fucking now yeah yasha i mean do you vomit after you talk to the thunder me neither it happened one time so just the once look i feel like if we can get on land at least and some sort of landing party we'll have a better shot nott you're terrified of the water i mean we're on unfriendly ground i don't mind trying to slip away or forcing our way out of this situation but i sure would like a resolution and at least a better place to stage some sort of action than on an enemy boat ship ship it's a ship mizzenmast mainmast foremast i got it ha ha ha [cheering] no i just want to know where the temple is i don't care if these people die no yeah no that's what i meant i know you want to leave i do as well but we need to play this game a little longer yeah that's back up where'd the squid come from i heard serpent and leviathan is leviathan a giant squid i don't know if you can feel-- yeah i'm not comfortable doing that if you could be succinct i'm a little fucking ticklish okay (singing) are we okay to play this out see how it goes at least get on land and see if we can find this temple this crazy bitch talks about of her yeah i think that's-- vanity you say we're trying to do less of that oh do it amazing uh-huh oh my god we all go down in a blaze of glory you fucking fuck but of course i do oh motherfucker [cheering] oh my god yep captain i admit i too am very encouraged to find someone that seems to have gone through the same sort of visions and trials that i have you said it's been a long time since you've met another chosen are you saying you've met previous i found myself feeling i was the only one that was experiencing this vision the blessing you say i haven't heard speak blessing i've heard words of encouragement and your crew believes as you do i look forward to this very very much i noticed as we were leaving your quarters that beautiful iron piece above your doorway a snake circling back upon itself the eye in the middle but it seemed there were small eyes all around the body of the snake that sounds-- exactly the word i was searching for speaking of beautiful i was so taken by that marking that tattoo you had i was wondering if you might show it to me again i'm uncomfortable with what's happening natural 20 [cheering] like a fucking eye or a tattoo of an eye 16 oh god fuck that's getting weird [cheering] fuck it i feel now you and i are more connected than i could've ever imagined i'll summon the sword [cheering] perhaps it was do you know what will happen if we-- do you know what will happen if we take this sphere to the place of its choosing have you seen what's unleashed or have you only heard i admit i find myself very curious three temples all of the same construct all looking for the same what do you call it same my god the sea [laughter] to consume i confess having spent so much time on the water the command over it seems like too great a gift to receive but i crave it [cheering] oh fuck [cheering] indeed we will all [laughter] it's like an onion you got to peel it you know i turn and i head towards the door and as i get there i look back [applause] no thank you where did that even come from that's okay not much actually she is far more under the influence of whatever this is than i initially thought she took off her glove and there was an eye in the palm of her hand and not another tattoo i think it was like a fucking eye ah yeah i know so she showed me hers and i showed her mine eyes our eyes on the sword i did not fuck i didn't even think of that yep what the fuck do you mean still [cheering] oh shit yeah but you know yep yeah no you're right she actually said there was one before that was also chosen where was that fucking pigeon we didn't get to that part but i feel like because i saw my former captain vandren with the same sphere that he might be the one that she was talking about there's a chance she said that this temple that we're about to visit was one of three jester i don't think she killed vandren he was on the ship when it exploded i don't even-- no i understand sabian my crewmate he went down and sabotaged the ship he set off an explosion that has to be what happened well i think we were being pretty respectful i do not altar the little iron piece above her doorway i saw that on the way out i don't do anything like that i don't know what that would-- she did she said there was one other chosen besides herself and now me i did the tattoo have i seen that anywhere else didn't molly have-- [cheering] what [laughter] sure could be nothing yeah right yeah i know she said we should all get some rest i feel like we've earned some trust i feel like we'll be in good hands i don't know if i entirely trust her but i do feel like she is motivated to see where this leads liam that's one way of putting it ja or other follow-- but doesn't that sound like too much we will and in the meantime i would suggest that we acted like we are as interested and motivated to see this through as her followers otherwise i think we'll stick out no she does unleashing things that are too terrible to talk about but you can use your imagination nope you're not drawing like this you're drawing like this it's the first time i've heard of it i mean it sounds incredible but i can't even begin to fathom what that would be like that responsibility i don't know who i would be if i could wield something like that understand it would be a start what urges well i've asked beau to check me and i'll check her on areas of aggression if i start controlling the oceans and shit maybe we'll talk about it until then i can only tell you i only want to know more about this and find out about what happened to my friend that's as far as i'm thinking try to sleep share with tal no goddamn it no i climb those motherfucking stairs i'll fire two blasts of eldritch blast at it witch bolt right to its chest the stairs are they staying the same is there anything at the foot of the statue after they break apart i'll move forward i'll summon the sword and hold the eye facing the circle void that eats the light can i walk into the center of the circle well i definitely do now yeah is there a ceiling are there walls are there statues in this space watching can i look into the eye of the sword do i see anything what the fuck can i try and take the edge of the blade and press it into the floor jesus (english accent) i don't know what you want from me i've stared at the eye fuck i have no idea ooh 19 i'll let it go where it's leading and point it towards the floor okay sure can i put my face in the water [cheering] can i look behind myself real fast a shit load of ships coming towards me cool are there any pigeons in this dream (laughter) 16 can i reach my hand out and try and control the ships yeah we're going to go ahead and grab whatever the fuck that is and pull it up can i take both hands and do a coup de grace two big (crashing) over the top don't wake up don't wake up (laughing) yes (english accent) what (regular voice) no no i didn't yeah yeah no we were fighting crazy beasts and monsters and all this talk of serpents i feel-- 16 i don't know i'm so used to copying people i get all sorts of stuff mixed up in my head talk about the dream i mean it's just a dream what's there to talk about first thing in the morning you're like (sarcasm) oh i know it was amazing tell me more  i mean wait you guys didn't have any dreams of a similar nature did you that is correct it is a pleasure to meet you as well i would agree i think they're quite territorial we would do best to remain unseen no i haven't i'm-- no what was your comment they were like fish people not like snake people i see where you're going me it is a sigil of our group that is sometimes viewed just to focus one's energy but i don't think i need it i'm very focused on the fucking job at hand and perhaps someone needs help with like stealth you know oh plus zero all right i'll look at it [applause] indeed should be take a bow
