your magical technicolor dreamcoat so brave nice molly well next up as this is now important jester it's your turn she has desserts no vanilla extract or sprinkles we still look like crownsguard caleb and i did anybody see what happened or where that hellish toad went you saw it we can't be here what where i don't want to get these folk in any more trouble how far is it from here to the lake i say we could drag them and throw them into the lake to avoid suspicion on the carnival we've got to get out of here where's caleb he was i look around for caleb that's a devastating toot nott have you seen caleb you got his little cat right there on your shoulder we need to get out of here we need to follow after that toad that's actually not a terrible idea that's a great idea let's do that who wants to help me with the one totally charred body shit never would have known i'll help you i mean it's either that or leave the carnival and take the fall for what is two dead crownsguard where'd you go you shot shit out of your hands i don't think you were not brave that was really impressive it was fire it's a figure of fucking speech yeah okay we go back over there and we fucking grab molly i grab him by his horns is that single horse a mustang what can i ask a simple question it's not a mare i'm just checking i'm just very curious as to the sex of the horse that's all 12 no 14 yeah you'll find out (laughter) you couldn't see us in the low light but they chased after whatever caused this any previous episodes of this kind we'll try and find some evidence that will exonerate you and we'll return we should really get to stepping sure i do shelby just deliver it to the po box that's fine in the direction the toad leapt we might need to play it by ear if it's too dangerous we'll stand down how about that yeah you blanked out there for a second yeah this is the best we can do for them lamplight on the boat we're going to have to ditch this wagon anyway because we've got tracks vanity plate what does it say no they don't have to go in the water right they're burned it's not like they burned in the water it would that's what i just said i wish i had something that could help molly out as we've been riding have we seen any tracks that we think might have belonged to the toad since it was leaping in these huge arcs ugh three why we could get rid of the wagon later once the sun comes up-- no no we can't just leave let's see if we can find the toad if the sun starts to break then we'll make up our mind yes kick them out anybody else want to look for some toad prints we've been doing that already that's actually a great idea come on don't roll sam's fucking dice in the shape that it's in this print are their toes pointing in a specific direction 14 two one and a giant toad girl does one look like gorilla grodd and--- 12 we're not lucky enough to have any small boats along the shores that have been beached yeah we got like four hours until sunrise how do we feel about the knowledge that it's somewhere here in the lake perhaps or the other side circling back tomorrow at least we'll avoid suspicion if we're at the inn i'm sure we can find some charcoal and you two seem to be able to move freely without suspicion and leave it outside town as we're making our way back maybe give the horse a little spank on the ass and send it on its way shall we we head back i thought we were going to head back to the village to a good distance we're taking the cart back to a distance from the city yeah and then letting the horses run so the-- sending the track off please roll bad if there is any justice in the world horses are our new door i'm going to use mask of many faces to make myself look old 18 but i'm also-- we made it no knock on our door only you two your jury summons is (groans) i'll open the door yes i just shut the door and dies no hands in your pockets order and it's about 230 to 300 in the next couple hours they said they would call for us i was going to say did they come to your room as well i mean we tell the truth we did nothing wrong i was thinking that if we get out of there tonight fingers crossed we should probably think about acquiring some sort of vessel to explore the lake tonight or i may be able to arrange free passage on a vessel i have a little knack with you know well for a bit few years sure am yep i have it gets funnier every time though i got to say it's all in the delivery is it too early in the campaign to walk away and i fucking saunter away and we didn't see anybody it fed on how well did you know kylre yeah what did he feast on i think we saw both the fast and the slow feeding methods yeah weaknesses vulnerabilities in the bathroom well our day just got freed up are you sure you want to do this with your cat anything else besides a bird i mean any kind of creature it can be killed is an important thing to know i only mean if it's important to you in a moment of danger i would try to save it but if that's not important fair enough that's very impressive i have ten gold well if you'd like you could stay at the inn or we could acquire that boat and once you're on board we could send it out as a sort of a recon it is daytime right now it would require us leaving now a what we should take advantage of the daytime out the windows as we did before perhaps we should go upstairs-- if that's the case we'll get the boat if not we'll let drone sparrow activate we could try to go out the side of the windows it is daytime can we say we're doing this from one of our rooms yep there's that bullshit again he talks he will talk to you out of the fucking blue you kill us all that is a hell of a talent you have can we ask what you saw was it busy water was there lots of ships out it's not a lull for any reason fair enough out the window shall we is anyone else going to be heading out the front door besides caleb nott and myself i think that's smart that's great yeah he has tentacles now can i use mask of many faces to change into that older gray-haired farmer using d&d beyond (laughter) i can do that do you want to come along on this little escapade fair enough so i'll head out the front can i locate the crownsguard can i run up to him and say (old raspy voice) you please over here i've seen one of those creatures it's tearing into him and it's horrible please come quickly 15 this way quickly please it's a nordic 7 weekend at bernie's walking looking around at nothing i look over my shoulder and keep running and then go oh what do you want who are you why are you following me have i done something again have you seen my son what's your name you're a strong looking-- oh dear do you have any coin i'm sorry no respect for the elderly apparently i walk away (grunting) i make my way towards the docks i think we may be able to avoid any kind of trading of currency let me see if i can find a boat that would accommodate all of us and see if we can find some amicable people as a sailor apparently i'm able to acquire free passage on ships i have to talk the talk and maybe trade something but-- hello there i was hoping that perhaps i could trouble you we're trying to make our way out into the lake some of my companions and i for a small day trip we've never quite been out on the lake not this one is there a chance we could trade some work on your day's journey for some travel i'm sorry we're a bit light on coin is there perhaps anything we could help you with around here in trade indeed many years of my life port damali they never go away yes it would help me look a bit more impressive in the eyes of my younger comrades much obliged i go back it fucking worked thanks we should go a bottle right you don't happen to carry any fine firewhiskey on you do you if i
