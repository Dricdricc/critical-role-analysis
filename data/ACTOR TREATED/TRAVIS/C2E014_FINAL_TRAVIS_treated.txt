not a chance i didn't catch that at all lucien nonagon wow this is all well and good and kind of fucking boring i couldn't help but notice that surly-looking crew up there who might that be humbly we are members of the mighty nein well we sought an audience and to be frank we thought we might find a little bit more of a warm reception than the one that we're currently getting oh of course easily understood we mean to make ourselves of service whether it be for the good of the city or other endeavors we're new here we thought we would try to make as many introductions and have as many meetings happen as we could oh i'm sure we'd be all ears oh of course and forgive my ignorance this would be used to locate us is that what this is for yeah fuck it how did you do that right (laughs) don't like it do you yeah three to go one two three yes i'd say i am are you writing that down shit where's the fucking luck of jester i could as well all right i feel lucky deal fjord no now i do ooh get

goliath nott i think-- yeah this is most intriguing i hope we would be able to interview your previous compatriots we'd like to know what they saw before what we might expect to clear our name here in zadash you're going to kill the gentleman sir i couldn't help but hear that this is about a mile outside of the city is that correct are you operating on any sort of a timeline might we have a little bit of lenience with how quickly we get this dealt with i've just had a thought actually if you could help us at the same time we're trying to get a friend of ours out of the city and (coughs) recent events seem to have clogged up most entries and exits we have a friend horris that needs to find his way to a safe spot indeed discretion is appreciated figured you might outstanding i think we have a deal do we not outstanding fantastic nott pace yourself now you hear is that goliath wielding any sort of visible weapon ogre and the goliath mauls each fuck oh yeah they were armored behind us that group looks like your type feel like making friends i would love to what do you expect to see there t yeah i was going to say the same thing let me get this straight a bunch of fucking floating lights came out of the wall gave your boy a little static shock and you ran yeah well they're calling in the big leaguers now so we'll take it from here your way up and down those stairs you mentioned you get tripped up along the way or was it just easy sailing what about it was ominous yeah scared of school yeah old terrors i appreciate your passion i don't think you're in great favor in this room at the moment you see that really tall woman over there with that big greatsword on her back she doesn't appreciate when people talk to us like that 13 no 15 sorry my shag armor did you three have a name don't be ashamed if you don't don't worry we'll clean it up for you enjoy your drinks going to join the others deception check of course yeah good thing i won huh am i rolling in it oh no i was actually only gambling my funds yeah are you at the moment i'm telling the truth i hadn't even divvied up that amount from dolan and everybody else good to know calculated risks i'll keep that in mind i thought you liked to play things close to the chest sometimes you got to get a little stupid though no that's not it either can you change that alcohol into wine it's alcohol one way or the other i'll fucking drink molly-- excuse me lucien how many others around here might we expect to have that same reaction towards you yeah travis and you're not afraid of inclement weather or anything are you it'd been real fair that storm rolled in and poof you were fucking gone did you handle what you needed to handle i make sure nott's drink is full all the time (laughter) i think kara's the way to go we start asking him questions about something that big maybe he won't like us poking our nose around when shit happened no there was a bit of a beatdown the other night in the tri-spire one of the towers was attacked oh yasha-ing you want to go talk to kara before we get out of here they came in trying to steal this beacon this glowing beacon which we still have but they were mighty upset about it why lucien you afraid the myriad will hear what's his reaction do i believe him shit 11 what's that saying be careful of the toes you step on they might belong to the ass you got to kiss later the attack on the tower i was looking at you still need a whisper corner i'm going to ask you a question you're probably not going to give me the truth to is your relationship with the gentleman one of a debt or one of convenience i hear that i only have one other thing i was taken by dolan's passionate message all right is some of the business that we can expect going to go against the fair people of this city indeed that's a connection worth the trouble you got a nice face i'm glad you found a place here it was good to see you again if i can't tell you didn't-- leave that one alone we head downstairs oh yeah the one that we had for-- yeah yeah like sprinkles and hard candies just (dry puffing) (farting) her skirt's like (farting) (singing) i'm on the couch tonight (laughter) it's wafting over lucien-- greatsword yeah i think it's got some potential do you mind if i hold on to it for a bit nott why don't you ask that big ogre by the door what her name is you have such a way with people yeah you knock down the barriers you get right in icebreaker no that's not true at all always good to make friends with the doorman you got to know this tell him that joke you know
