on the second one i rolled a five plus what my strength 13 if you hit him does he become not paralyzed he's paralyzed can i walk around to the front of kevdak no my hands are fucking shaking this is the most epic map ever by the way can i walk around to the front of kevdak please knowing that he pointed up with a hand at scanlan's beautiful ass hand still on his greataxe paralyzed can i try and rip-- continuing my rage because he hit me last round-- can i pull the axe from his hand 27 because i'm frenzied raging do i have another move like can i hit him with it can i looking at the axe say oh i do hope you have a necromancer in your group because i'm looking at a fucking dead man (laughter) well he did it against me so i get it against him oh that's much better 20 i don't know what the attack bonus is with the axe okay where is it jesus this one plus what ah so five and it hit him right so is it an automatic critical because it hit so it was a two do i have any of my movement left can i move around behind him 50 i'll either flank him or yeah i love you oh my god are you serious yeah yeah yes misses that hits i can't use it on this stuff though only when i attack reduced to seven okay no whatever you're going to do just do it what what was it what 15 17 okay 32 halved is 16 which is eight misses yes that hits oh scanlan i will make out with that fucking shirt i swear to god so in my frenzied reckless attacking great weapon master can i bring my axe up high and swing it for the first attack to his left side where dangly hand is disadvantage for the okay 23 no 18 (counting) 20 for the first one 30 with great weapon master 60 11 which is seven or eight rage bonus is eight oh sorry the total bonus is eight that's why that's a seven that's it right right okay so whatever 11 five so that's 34 and a nine so that's 43 and that's the first one called shot second attack straight across his back that is a 22 yeah 22 okay and that's four so double this-- 12 right so

a 32 yeah double the first right which was ten so 20 so 42 i say for strongjaw and i sink the axe right into his neck and part him perfectly down the middle yep nope don't care that will put me unconscious and 21 points under i have relentless rage you're pointing at the screen okay my herd hear me fallen is your mighty leader kevdak the very goliath swine who would have domesticated you like a common household cat who would have made you bend a knee to a mere dragon i show you this and i reach into the bag of holding and i pull out one of the dragon's teeth that is still in there and i toss it into the middle of the square i would tell you that under the correct rule and a return of power to this herd dragons would bend a knee to the herd of the storm where is zanror oh you mistake me seer of the herd i do not mean to lead this herd but rather to empower you to more powerful game i'm here to inspire your aspirations never would i ask you to bend the knee only would i ask you to live and fight and perhaps die in the most beautiful death you can possibly attain join me and my fellows come to our aid when i call and with that we will chase down dragons gods and more fuck that's only an 11 hold it is not necessary brothers look me in the eye has the taste of food lost its appeal has the zest for life fallen from your hearts living in this domesticated dwelling i promise you this hear me and i promise you adventures and glory that is worthy of this herd cousin your face seems a little different scanlan lower me down on the ground i take a few steps forward yes this my work a debt fulfilled after many many years strange i would ask why is he in shackles what did zanror do that would draw this sort of ire from the herd i am sorry zanror but i will make it a glorious death bring me the gauntlets as well i stand put on the gauntlets zanror quiet yourself i've heard enough and i lift the bloodaxe and i say you are a disgrace to this herd and i will return this herd to power and i pivot and i drive the bloodaxe into greenbeard reckless that's an 11 so that's 15 and then two more that's 27 37 it seems all the poison came from his head so i'll remove that from his body i spin and i say do you see do you see what staying in one place does this is what weakness looks like i would return you to the wild i would return you to power but you will have to do it under this goliath's rule unchain zanror worra i don't zanror she is quite a beauty congratulations no this is honor this is pride this is a life worth living how many do you number more than we need and i grab my earpiece and i go (meekly) thoughts (laughter) all right all this bloodshed is giving me a terrible itch in my ear we shall stay with you and tomorrow we will bathe in the blood of a dragon yeah strength and honor it shall be could you do me a favor could you butcher me a skull of kevdak please i would like to not only remove kevdak's head just the upper part no jaw just the skull and i would like to use the bloodaxe to flay the skin around the bear tattoo off i'll take the plus-one javelins and i'd like to put the flayed skin in your refrigerated bag are there any other goliaths in the square that are lingering can i walk over to one tonight we prepare for an incredible battle go release any meager prisoners you may have kept they will do nothing for our fight i did
