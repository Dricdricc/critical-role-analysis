should go in fact anyone that you see take them with you there's a little encampment not far from here yeah all the shanty area of people-- it's over by foromir basin head for that if you can there's a fight coming here you don't want to be here don't be too obvious about it on the sly if you can but try and make your way out of here before dawn tomorrow on second thought should we ask them to leave on the sly like through the sewers just in case so maybe underground if they can (whispering) reginald don't poke him do you want to knock maybe you should say who's knocking just in case you do knock so strong i go with her hello wilhand oh no-- yes take it easy i know it's all right it's all right wilhand it's all been taken care of you hid i see where pike gets her smarts from this is vex this is vax yeah thank goodness yep that's the only reason they came here little misunderstanding they're not all dead we unseated kevdak he's dead and so was the horrible bastard who was pouring poison in his ear but listen i gave power up to the herd to zanror his son so it's in slightly better hands little problem-- they want to stay and fight the dragon that's going to come back so we need everyone in here to leave sorry yes i grab the back of his britches and i pull him back nope nope wilhand that's how she's known ruthless we're glad you're safe we want to make sure you're out of here before any real damage comes to town we haven't quite talked about-- but what is known is that there's going to be a fight tomorrow and unless you want to throw down and i know you're a mighty warrior not saying you shouldn't but if you don't want to now might be the time to hop-skip out of here no no not in the hole well don't be stingy welcome to ren faire yeah hook it up homie is wilhand drunk right now insight check his soberness yeah we could do that i don't know he said at dawn we-- wait at dawn we fight or at dawn we plan aw really do we give a shit about it no you're right we do why don't we set up the mansion in wilhand's house we'll go and run our errand and we'll come back and he'll have gotten the kitchen all up to spec so can we make the door wilhand's starting to turn green wilhand just give me the bottle take it easy never saw anything holy shit holy shit can we walk and talk i'm a unique little snowflake i take no offense thank you really i don't know if we'll be alive in the morning i don't know if it's occurred to any of you but i don't particularly feel safe i'm glad we got out of there-- i'm glad we have a mansion i'm glad we have a vestige because of it but look i got abandoned once think anything's changed since then no neither do i but i don't really understand much things look if it was the day before yesterday i would have said they're all fools and they're going to do it the stupid way but i think i underestimated 'em a bit so yeah i think they might be a bit clever yeah no here's my vote so i can have it said i would rather get everyone that doesn't want to die in this town out to that encampment if we take this meeting with zanror we will no longer be able to walk away there could be a total chance that they all turn on us right then in the throne room in the yard wherever we are we could leave now yeah because i just saved his life for a second i also beat his ass when he was little and let me tell you a thing about grudges they don't go away no he's a little man and little men have napoleon complexes he's this horrible elf from the west bigger than the blue bigger than the white where i rolled a 21 and it missed yeah remember 21 missed i can't believe i'm saying this-- right but there might be some that can hit him when he's in the air but not all of them yeah if you had time why are we being in such a rush about this they're not all goliaths 20 or a one seems to work well for us a warm fire and i run-- no (laughter) yeah do you want me to hang outside i left a little something in there for him time doesn't pass right does time pass in the locket well i farted right before i hopped out (laughter) i might not live past this (fart noise) (laughter) you've made her very cautious yeah actually can trinket and i walk to the other side of the street can i walk to the other side of the street no yeah and i watch the house from across the street yeah since this is taking a bit it's not a short rest is it

and punch fassbender in the face 28 of the four or the six because it's my fist well hold on we were just getting warmed up i mean this is where the game starts you know it's like p-i-n-g and then you really start playing it's a song that's my designation that's like the fifth time today and it's so good no like a good horror movie fakeouts can i turn to pike and say like look at what i got yeah right i don't even feel it it's like nothing nope no nothing well look the bloodaxe right i've known this weapon for many many years and i wanted you to be here when i did this (whispers) can you hear me no which is cool right yep better can you tell if it's evil no what do you think oh you can't tell anything right so we're already in a better place than we were before they do hey wait keep holding it for a second can i walk over to the wall can i punch the wall i'd like to punch the wall wait-- 50 oh just damage 25 25 i remember being little and kevdak went and punched a boulder and it went like (stone shattering) and split in half yeah we're going to be busting balls big time yeah at me good swing (laughter) vicious vicious oh wait-- well hold on i had to take the gauntlets of ogre power off do you want them back now i think you have to give 'em up for the boots but it's your pick it's a kite-- or you can be a monstah i also have-- wait is scanlan back (sniffs) do i smell poo

they're worth like six thousand gold so i guess-- i'll hold onto them thanks for 50 no so it's night it's nighttime we owe zanror a talk one way or the other yeah we need to heal up big time you guys are the biggest fucking dicks ever great conversations have been had at dawn i'll have you know we're not the only one treaties have been signed and-- stuff we might be able to do that how long is a long rest six to eight so on the short end we could get up at three and walk over yeah we should do that now all right that's percy's vote keyleth what do you say sure vax what do you say vex badass hand-smasher the first i wouldn't care if we left now i don't think we're ready i think it would be foolish i learned a lesson yesterday and i'm anxious to die don't get me wrong but i'd rather win if we planned a little better than lose in theory i'll amend my proposition to this i'm not sure what that word means yes if we go and speak to zanror and we can't change his mind about fighting this dragon which i'm not entirely comfortable asking him to do we at least get the innocents prisoners and hostages out of the city we pretend that we're going to fight the dragon with him and when shit goes down we wait and if i may in case any of your consciences are in conflict the herd is full of murderers and pillagers and rapists and child killers the worst of the lot and only when i was younger did i not know the difference between right and wrong still working on that definition but i can tell you this group ain't the best lot in the world and they mean nothing to me compared to the people in this room once but are we trying to save a herd or are we trying to save a town that's bigger than a town right do you mean like permanent marriage i take the bottle he pulled it back i let him have it i go and grab a shitload of chicken and start shoving it in my mouth he's passed out is vax here shit i wanted to put like shaving cream in his hand and tickle his nose with a feather what's left to finish we go to sleep-- yeah is there anyone on the street 19 plus zero same people i saw outside of the house earlier all right fuck this shit i turn and i walk towards those two people hello what're your two names funny i feel like i've seen you about in the last few hours watching us huh why hm don't you have a new leader now would you like to walk with us we're going for a little morning stroll and we head to the margrave's house i make eye contact with both of them i seek an audience with zanror we go in i grab my earpiece and very lightly say vax keep your eyes about you nope stay together aye wouldn't miss it for the world it is pretty sweet though isn't it we all have our preparations to make before battle don't worry about mine you have no idea that i do it is a wide wake my friend thunderlord we back your play watch where you turn your gaze it may be the last movement your head makes attached to your body oh that's not good ten pike wars have been started over less aye she will 25 strong we have injured are no good to us neither are the prisoners or hostages that were kept by this herd you said you have made preparations what sort of preparations do you have in mind interesting very true have you seen this cave might report back with how-- the size of the cave do you have any interest in a tactical ambush don't have that one thing dragons-- dragons and kevdak shared one common trait arrogance in your previous dealings with this dragon did it ever speak down to you aye perhaps if we tame your lust for blood for a day we can control all the variables that we have by setting this trap if we go to that cave aye we will find war sooner but we know less and the reason you're the thunderlord now is there is a better brain in that skull than there ever was in your father's let's use that to our advantage don't need it 19 planned at dawn see (laughter)
