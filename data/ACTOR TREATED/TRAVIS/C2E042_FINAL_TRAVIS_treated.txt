gone down okay avantika is the infinity gauntlet and she has one stone (laughter) captain how did the current plank king get to the position that he holds now do you know a little mutiny eh did-- hmm interesting no that's all that's what i was going to ask if you were a fan or not any foes of yours in this darktow anyone we should look out for yeah why would you get wrapped up in that yeah let's go grab a drink marisha and yep we go they do that cafeteria thing hey hey you want to sit over here you're no good at those right i want to know what blood type they are i'll grab a drink and i'll head over to where vera's sitting yeah i'll take a drink and i'll plop it down right in front of her and i'll take a knee on the floor so i'm kneeling next to her on the other side of avantika i'll say hey listen no hard feelings right right whatever's best for the ship well i feel the presence of uk'otoa smiling on all of us and i know that our partnership here will be a beneficial one well this has been fun if you need anything as your quartermaster you just let me know sorry i didn't catch your name it was-- oh i'm fjord nice to meet you strong name we just got here (gulping) we're all grabbing our drinks and standing up should i be mean i got one gold on the blue one anyone want one gold on the blue one (groaning) he's on the edge finish him yeah and you kept all your teeth laura and nott unconscious person down what's the rest of avantika's crew doing are they in the scrap as well hourly flare-up wow where the fuck did you guys just go i hope we're going there after this show taliesin and just taken with the saying yeah it's a fairly benign saying don't get too lost in it i was wondering how empty that cup is i was going to ask you had an ale or whatever everybody else is drinking caduceus wayne sam and gunner master nott gunner master was she directing that towards avantika you mean a competitor in terms of sea space or in terms of your faith diver's grave it would appear so yeah 15 yeah that's fortuitous her claws single eye huh anyone else getting a bad feeling about that (low-pitched) break it break it break it down sorris is that somewhere you've been to you seem like a very fortune-seeking type you don't stop either you know most myths are based off of some sort of fact we don't happen to know what the song thinks this dreadful creature is do we is that a thing you can't really sing underwater so how's that work i love that everyone did that at the same time that's all i needed well great we'll find this solution to the diving in the morning and then in a day or two we'll make our way do you need any help securing this solution well being that you'll be out anything you need done for the ship or the crew while you're away as your quartermaster wonderful all right and your crew do i need to keep an eye on anyone wonderful being that this is our first time in darktow i would like to see the rest of the area would anyone care to join me for a stroll back corners alleys no who would be so foolish little would they know they'd be tangling with avantika's crew and that's something they don't want to mess with right you see everything why are you even rolling you've got fucking mad-eye moody's eye where it's on me the whole time and the other one's doing its own thing ridiculous she's on a nickname basis already she's like we're not there yet we're not fucking alice yet oh the hand touch no maybe that is better yeah i'm come join him out front you're up front right i put my hand on caduceus' shoulder how you doing you seemed a little more at ease i'll lean in a little bit you do much drinking in there i'm not really getting the fumes on your breath really is there a reason for that what happens when you drink did you have stuff in your cup right you don't have to fake it you can just-- right anything popping up on that special radar of yours yeah that she is should we grab the others and go explore for a bit yep i mean i think is anybody out here in earshot yeah listen about that let's just keep it right between the amigos all right just because-- no that's us right one amigo two amigo you and i are amigos it'll be our thing like we're bunkees we share-- no we're not going to share amigos we are the amigos sharing amigos is a whole other-- yeah well actually that's kind of what i wanted to talk to you about you're real good at picking up on little things yeah heh no i think that's pretty clear i'm just letting you know i'm trying to keep her close i feel like this whole thing's getting a little out of sorts and the best way to keep a small finger on the pulse of things is to-- yeah haven't been very good at it so far thank you yeah more of that to come where's the rest of these chuckle-fucks head down huh contemplation (singing) i want to take a night walk-- that's not a song we'll poke our heads back in and go-- we'll wave them out (whispering) ask him about the diver's grave i'll get the other 50 if i may orly you seem to be very familiar with the diver's grave and the song do you know anything more specific of it and creatures that might be in that area things to look out for deep-ocean folk any good things about the area that you care to share right all right who are we missing why are you guys wiping your hands on your pants okay who wants to go explore yeah i figured we'll use the night air to our advantage acclimate a little bit oh if there is trouble let's try and resolve it-- well yeah the judge will do it's so intimidating when she says it like that for the sword up away from the docks checking the bottom of my shoes like what did we step in why is it-- outhouse campaign two here we go like okay tiffany and which ship how will they crack this if they hear us how do we reference the-- the apricot nope it's this say that again let's walk-and-talk about tiffany tiffany doesn't know that we're talking about her come on a lot of store fronts and things that are closed up for the night no maybe they were looking for a new environment and they found exactly what they were looking for ooh natural 17 for 19 there was a lot of assimilation here here it is how drunk are you i think that's the highest priority the only thing that we haven't discerned from tiffany is if she knows where the next-- no we know where the apricot might be where the next apricot tree might be or fruit stand i like it well if you used her right name yeah wow well i can tell you that her quarters have a balcony yeah because if we are planning to leave without her that means she'll give chase-- i mean i hate to even suggest it but i'd rather not have someone hot on our tail well as honda i would race to the apricot and seize it so that she can't pick that fruit keep it for ourselves in our fruit basket and make off and decide if we're going to make marmalade later or not we actually don't know where the other tree is yet that's the thing we just know where the fruit is they're in season right now if we do that we might need to ask tiffany if she knows the location of the tree because it hasn't been brought up as of yet it was a long walk but we're all on the same page okay are we up for a little b&e in real life or the game yeah absolutely don't you have another way to make a door yeah i mean there was a door-- was it solid wood or did it have glass sure maybe with a short rest maybe who's the queen in this scenario sam and the two clerics are not going on the mission together doesn't ipsis-- small like that's a natural one this is going to fucking suck (laughter) no also where are we staying tonight are we staying at the bloated cup or we finding-- on tiffany's ship it might not be a bad idea to find a room that's not at the bloated cup and not on the ship just so we're not suspicious how do you feel about rooms at the bloated cad three rooms hopefully some with windows smells like shit in there famous last words look i'll be fine i'll make sure she's occupied now what do you mean in the room what form is frumpkin an octopus is he there am i carrying him in like it's no big yeah i don't think so listen let's just kick this thing off i'll toss frumpkin back to caleb look i leave this in your capable hands if for some reason tiffany's on the move or if something seems up listen for thunder how about that nothing i could say would beat that so sure whatever you feel is best all right here we go i head off towards the bloated cup real confident real strong if bouldergut is in the bloated cup that's where yasha is is somebody aiding you in that no it's real sotto so we don't have to use code words anymore he's our type man he thinks sleeves are bullshit too no i'm not false backs to safes i'll head up the stairs to the second room on the right was it anyone in the hallways no sign of bouldergut 11 she's an ogre okay yeah second door on the right and i'll put my ear against the door shit balls ass oh three (sighs) (heartbeat) (knocking) oh sorry is-- (clears throat) is the captain in fjord who's this second door on the-- is there a door across the hall i'll put my ear on that one three does it look like there's any light on under the door bouldergut captain she's very loyal how long has bouldergut been with you in your service quite some time how have your evenings been any more dreams tell me yes i'd like that yes that's more correct yeah can you give yourself advantage i don't need this in my life jewelry boxes confused is complicated he's going to tell you you've got to roll to see what happens yeah she could be straight up like nope i'll open the door is there any ice no okay yeah it's even harder to spot them now the most inconspicuous person oh my god perception what does that do or running i'm in a great deal of pain (impact) bloated cup no smoke coming out of the cigarette (door slamming) (heavy breathing) i look down the stairs can i see caduceus down there yeah i'll come down and-- a drink hey deucey how we doing oh good report yeah i'll just hold my cup and wait for something to happen oh compound well shall we you know turn in for the night seems like it's been a crazy one we'll all pile into one room before we separate for the night or how about-- what'd you find oh okay well first-- was it hidden where you found it should we detect to see if it has magic anyway like a trace on it yeah just empty your pockets let's just make sure nobody's following this stuff that's not as lo-fi as we were discussing we saw them yeah well isn't allison not cool with avantika and the enemy of my enemy is my friend right so why would we want to get allison in trouble yeah sure yeah laura and maybe we just hold onto them for now they came in containers right are they just gems or are they specific pieces of jewelry if you're going to plant them on anybody vera would be a good candidate well because she's a bitch we got to get her out of here she's you know wants my job yeah we're definitely going to plant it on her cause some commotion at the top caleb what do you got oh it hasn't been time ooh please be an almanac sorry what language was that in oh that's not great for us you're due one rise baby rise what if the necklace as a trace on it o for six in the series and you crank one at the bottom of the ninth oh wow we're not keeping anything on our persons we need to hide it bury it uh-huh you dump that bag out or just go searching for a necklace stick your hand it it comes right out or we could old-school bury it under a tree right mark it same diff frame somebody well listen i am all for putting vera in a bad light right avantika is going to want to know who did this yeah tiff old tiff fanny might as well put it on her right no no but maybe we're thinking too small-ball if you can actually make a translation of that thing that's the frame we've been looking for we take that to the plank king we're going to get all the head start we can get we know where the other peach tree is now so-- it's apples and peaches so you know yeah yeah i think it's too dangerous to try and plant it on her it's adding one step that we don't need i think we take it once you're finished-- yeah i agree i don't think it does right as beau has appropriately stated many times snitches get stitches if we walk that in there the plank king might just be looking for disloyal motherfuckers to hang up by their toes we need to find a way to either message that to send via messenger with the book and a codex that you've created and let him be able to see the evidence for himself we're assuming that she wants to destroy her yeah maybe they need to (yowl) get it on you know a physical copy or up in the dome true what to go with the package yeah that swings back to us a little bit yes yeah i don't know how we get out of here but we're going to try well we need to wait until they apprehend her we do something oh boy you know-- okay just throwing it out there big picture okay because there are two goals on that map one is the peach the other is the peach tree if we go to one and she goes to the other and let's say she gets deferred adjudication and gets out just a little bit after us she might be waiting for us at one or the other i'm just saying let's just do that let's let caleb do his thing and we'll see what the morning does where are we keeping the gems and everything else in the meantime the lead safe do we still have that in the bag no if she gets the book back-- we do have the lead safe the dodecahedron's in it yeah make it so well once she's apprehended yeah okay we'll send some food and water up your way the jewels in the containers go in the lead safe in the bag of holding is it stupid to be literally down the hall decoding this journal all night from where avantika's staying it's just a warning system right it doesn't keep her out so will yasha it's in the safe right lead should block it yes it is yep caduceus and i will open the door to our room now yeah sure let us get our shit together okay grabbing our stuff you could just pop out of the room and meet us on the way no i mean jester pops out of the room with the bag and leave it somewhere then meet us on the way to the ship dimension door the fuck out of the room not now there's no time we're going down no no i'd rather fight over it than lose a check just going like uh all right do what you're going to do do what you've got to do who else was walking with us besides bouldergut i am burning so many calories right now that's the most sure way to get it seen is this a frequent occurrence when you're in darktow this sort of-- oh
