so good you're cultists the prologue is so good it is currently encompassing brian wayne foster's life is that the third time we've had him in our lifetime like halley's comet you always come around i think your language was actually pretty good yeah we still dropped a few chicago is a tiny town though there's not really a lot that's there it's a couple trains or little puddle-jumper flights to get there it was one roll never again we're all fucked what's the lawmaster's name at the song and supper inn we’ve got to figure out where fucking lord sutan is right we don't have any eyes on that location where would we find something that's handwritten would that come from them you think yeah we didn't really check to see if they had signed any of them did they i was thinking do they have post here in this city someone that comes and picks up mail could we jack some of her fucking outgoing mail what time is it what's the exact time no i'm just kidding what the fuck are you talking about what if we divide our forces for now and try to find that handwriting sample one of us goes and looks for the post the other one tries to find those public records yeah she was kind of unpleasant yeah she wasn't really about that fan life possibly but if we go by there we can't be seen or knock on the back door if such a thing exists is that how we want to find lord sutan's address that seems like a good idea so you're saying ulog probably is in trouble and is going to roll over on us in order to get something taken off of him to dolan's then yeah you said there's no back door right side windows anything like that well it should be one of the three of us because that's who they'll know mm-hmm okay yeah i'm going to fucking change it up is there a little alley that i can pop into before i head over to his place of residence yeah i cast disguise self and i turn back into that-- black cloak with gold trim the long black hair-- that's right nice yeah if you look like you-- we don't want to have them see us going over there cool all right oh what's the sign a peacock was that supposed to be a hawk a pigeon (pigeon cooing) fair enough it's a pigeon a feral pigeon if there's trouble laura and all right i walk over to dolan's house yes it is-- i bring word from the mighty nein may i come in please is there anyone in the room that i don't see besides horris and dolan i'll drop the disguise i apologize we realize that after you-- (drawl) i apologize (laughter) great will do another thing that we realized-- in our efforts to frame and forge which are vast you don't happen to have any handwriting from lord sutan do you there was nothing that ousted you from your business any sort of receipt or-- is there anyone else in the area that we should know that he does business with that he might communicate with regularly there's a pen pal and finding out who the pen pal is-- no there's no fucking pigeons ren sutan that's who he wrote to though it's who he wrote to well he sounds like a real son of a bitch this ren sutan any idea where we might be able to find him a physician also a dark physician most likely hmm yeah rampant where i'm from just real fucking dark indeed i will indeed you probably will not be hearing from us again before the task is done sam and no was i supposed to say stuff about the high-richter thank you we won't trouble you any longer song and supper inn mm-hmm lock that door behind me and i leave stupid pigeons sam and yeah but i'm not sharing it yep got it got it no problem read it looked at it i understand what it looks like let's go (laughter) nope sorry not going to help you a whole bunch of stuff but i can't say it around them i just won’t out of principle now see if you ask nicely yeah things will ha-- i walk back up to the door (laughter) one more thing totally forgot to ask you don't happen to have any handwriting from the high-richter do you yeah i know (laughter) have a good day no none yeah blah blah blah ren's address and the address now you got it was that mentioned oh okay yeah that blah we're getting ahead of ourselves let's stay on task let's head to the gilded willows where in the tri-spire where the fucking scottsdale party-- what do these notes say skyskate park and constellation boulevard yeah that thing yeah i was writing real fast just recon we're trying to see what this place looks like if we can see lord sutan then we'll make a decision if we go after his son or not who maybe has some of his handwriting sure handwriting and see if ren's a son of a bitch yeah yeah me too because i can't make it through the gates that's what i was wondering what you were talking about because she's got a cloak now cool caleb where you want to go buddy wait they're both sutan yeah you won't bring back clarota or nothing it'll be great can't be should we meet back at the song & supper inn at what sunset okay fair enough leaky tap hashtag nbc blindspot i just got a shit-load of ball bearings yep you can see if it hurts your hand if you touch it no fucking way (laughs) ah you son of a bitch (vaporized noise) yeah new character that's some fight club shit (coo) remember (coo) (coo) hunter's mark (laughter) turn undead (coo) you've never heard of safety in numbers and all that shit yeah man i just figured you'd be a part of this just some simple reconnaissance see if we can see ren maybe have a conversation with him if he's not a total prick i don't know maybe he's got some of his dad's handwriting great we're going to head towards the apple tree tuneship what did i write here thank you oh god nine twelve 13 guided hand infirmary right he's a physician well before we put a personal touch on it do you people with sneaky abilities want to see what you can see in the windows seniors '99 (laughter) 11 strength okay… oof oh you know it ran up on the roof we were trying to chase her down you want to see if maybe she ran around the corner yeah they're tricksy like that tell you what if i see it i'll call out what's your name simon okay simon i'll call out if i see him why don't you see if you run the other way see if you can find him (laughing) oh my god right unless ren is actually on the inside if they had an office maybe we could rifle through some-- yeah or just ill on the front doorstep and keep them occupied yeah i could you know kick the shit out of nott in the face and then be like (yelling) i could kick the shit out of nott in the face and then like-- although he's a physician so he might try to you know check and i think up to touch it falls apart yeah i mean i could mimic whatever you have and try to stay at arm's length i like it yep yep i like that then you two try to get into the office somehow i'm assuming there is it's a doctor's office right i think that makes sense we'll cause a ruckus see what you can find is it taliesin and well they're not here it was a chihuahua on a chain fierce as shit spiked collar tongue out-- how

like one of them but like them in a uniform okay can i exit the room and come out into the hall get him out of here i walk past them towards the office where the doctor is can i turn and as i start to close the door behind me can i look down the hallway and see if anybody is walking towards me in the hallway is it relatively clear can i grab a handful of papers off the desk and put them under my shirt and start walking out that was very unruly i need to excuse myself for a moment i’ll head out of the infirmary i’m heading out of the infirmary and i’m going to start wrapping around the building towards the side of the building that he was in run can i point off in a different direction than molly’s running since i look like a hospital clerk nurse 15 as we’re walking back can i start looking over the papers looking for some sort of signature that says richter or prucine or anything yeah it was just on top of the desk i don’t really have anything to hold him crown of madness great success went off without a hitch we found ren we-- that’s actually exactly what happened it just didn’t go as well as you thought it might go great minds think alike though jester how’d it go for you two not promising it’s an infirmary they got to see terrible people in there all the time might get us in past that outer wall at least yeah it’d be obvious sign it somebody else’s name “as discussed”
