are we cutting to that title camera so they can see the addresses it was cold (laughs) it was real cold lord taliesin can you put the first one up again because we didn't get the pamela joy title-- yeah it's the only one we missed they were so instrumental and did such a lovely job we have so much you guys so much bigger than i thought it'd be yay pike look at that look at that yeah we all have one i'm going to stay as long as i can cry forever i think that's one of the vestiges yeah yeah do it again do that shit again please i'm really sorry about that no no i didn't i was floating away you should've seen the inside it was wind everywhere yeah and i was like what would my buddy pike do she would take the sword and attach the chain to it and throw it through the door and then you were there yeah but you're my best buddy do you want one of my healing potions are you sure you're all right yeah what do you mean it's magic time of day towards the campsite please i'm handsome as fuck right now come on like a fine wine yeah i got aged well she was young again oh i don't cast that yes (emphatically) yes so i lose all the buffs right natural 20 i don't have anything to feed you (exhales) all right all right all right what i'm so hungry my stomach's rumbling what my stomach yeah i would not turn down some delicious boar do i get a level of exhaustion back or no long rest fuck that should've been at disadvantage 5% both times i can't hide disadvantage still 11 no no no (clears throat) what'd you do to me i like gnomes i don't know what why am i down here i did my classic ten-minutes-later remembering-the-rules shit nine no i didn't no what when my sword is-- where is my sword what do you mean wait wait where is my-- where's craven edge hey hey percy percy well i mean he's obviously messing with other people's property and i walk over to the sword what let what-- but it's my sword i mean percy gave it to me but it's mine yeah we traded fair and square i'm still a bit fuzzy like i mean you know we fought the sphinx it got super-gnarly and then we took a little rest and you-- did you see it shrunk well how did i get out of there oh like just now why do i taste ale and whiskey i mean i didn't know if i'd thrown up in my mouth and like swallowed it look guys i can carry it at least well now that's really judgmental yeah yeah only four of us look it's been a great ally well that's a bit strong don't you think look look okay look if you get bucked off a horse right you don't kill the horse you just train it up a bit let's just work with the sword ah well yeah right bone titanstone well look hey look all right fine look i won't touch it but can we like at least figure out what it was doing lord briarwood had it i asked it a few questions like if it knew vecna and we just got to see it level up a little bit it's always hungry right so it likes to be it likes what i do-- what what i'm hungry too i said i was sorry i really-- oh well i choose the group i mean i voted i was uncomfortable as well well i don't just want to destroy it yeah but i could use it on kevdak well look the last i remember was it said it was hungry if it gets hungry again i'll just give it something to eat no like my thigh or something no i would just stab it kevdak has the titanstone knuckles it's a vestige that we're looking for right it's going to be a hell of a fight and this is a hell of a sword all right hold on pike look if we're going back to kevdak you know i'm not scared of death right i would die by a dragon i would die by a beholder and i wouldn't care as long as it was a beautiful death but i don't want to die from kevdak not him all right fine do what you want with it i don't need it this is an empty cup i throw the cup away and just take the cask can i make like one little suggestion that doesn't involve it coming back to me i had a thought that since lord briarwood had it before that every time it killed it might've been sending that life back to vecna but i don't have any proof of that you know i just remember being in that room with all the bodies with the little sphere of-- the little dough button in the middle of the room or really cool i'm at one hitpoint i could just take a healing potion (sings) i feel amazing not if i'm wielding it yeah go for it we've got a backup if there's something wrong what how could i have been so foolish this whole time that fucking blade has been using me yo guys update that sword is totally evil yeah i'm not cravin' bacon anymore and there was a dagger that came with it laura marisha and (laughs) i'm fucking with you i'm super exhausted-- no i'm like northrop grumman meets raytheon in this bag of holding we're good oh no i just gave them to you though what about if i trade you what if i trade you-- i have boots of levitation or i have black iron plate that while wearing this heavy plate armor the bearer gains resistance to any fire damage i bet if you levitate you'd just be floating above the ground yeah yeah that's fine i'll take care of that yes we'll discover electricity with you you're a great conductor oh that's true which one you want i'll take my gauntlets of ogre power back strength back up to 19 way to go badass no problem man long in the mouth of the cave take ol' wrinkly-nuts over there (laughs) i'm in the training room in my sandpit sleeping bed the full one oh fuck you (laughter) no no no i can make really good origami now can i try and take out the flaming warhammer the firebrand warhammer can i get it to light can you hear me (laughter) the silent type i like it (laughter) this is a lot to leave off that's a lot to not have that's a big fucking difference you don't know oh well if only i'd used my identify spell i didn't even know people could do that oh right remember there was a lake when we were looking for the heart of a nymph yeah there's a portal there right and isn't one of the vestiges in the fey yeah yeah only if it's close otherwise i'm good to go back to westruun only if the lake was close i don't know where it is i'm still there right no we took a long rest 28 yeah she's back let's run i pick up pike i put her on my shoulder and we run 24 21 we get to play that shit again right yeah poke the dm (glass shatters offscreen) pike are you all right what time is it no no i like what percy said i think there's worth in being clever i would actually like to maybe run some ideas by you we don't walk into town but we have the town walk out to us well look so there are people in there that are innocents right we told the farmer we'd get his people back and i really want to see if wilhand's all right so listen how do you feel about sending someone in that would draw out their worst oh it's about all we do well it wasn't really an official fight it was more of like a one-sided ass-whooping yeah we're going to get to that later i was thinking maybe we could set a fire and send someone running in and say there's a roving band of orcs that are challenging the goliaths and then when they come out and leave we can move into the town and get all the innocents out and then if we want we could set a trap or an ambush or we could play some mind games but i want to try and get the town clear first no no no no just a few well look if it's not kevdak we get a practice round on those that do come out well so you know how last time when we went over there and horace was just outside the city walls i'm pretty sure if we wait for a bit somebody will come out we take him we mess him up real good maybe take his tongue out chop off his arms and then send him back in i mean i'm open to augmenting that plan a little bit no like i said before if i go in there-- i'll hold him while somebody else can rough him up but-- well pretty smart they're all like me yeah scholars the lot well my math is a little shoddy but i think that would be me maybe but-- (sighs) so here it is my whole life has been wanting to punish or get back at kevdak i don't want to do it cheaply i don't want to do it quickly i want to do it with my own hands now i'll do it with my family do it with my buddy pike but i want it done right no i can guarantee you no one will interfere i like that oh wait a minute right so they think i'm dead maybe i let them think i conquered death maybe we let them think that i'm not the same grog i was before maybe we let them think i've gained abilities yeah yeah but i mean like-- yeah but they don't have to see where those abilities come from all they've got to see is me there are roofs right i mean it's like two- and three-story buildings all in that city yeah you guys get all up on the roofs while i'm making a scene in the middle and we pull off the greatest stage show there's ever been if i do a pelvic thrust will you do your-- holy shit i will grant you cock lightning three i don't want it i have the gauntlets of ogre strength i have the flaming-- yup and the belt what's the other oh and my-- actually the flaming warhammer's not attuned it gives me plus two to my ac get in place i mean i could try and do it while you're getting the hostages out or we could just take down the snake's head i do know how to get his pride in check why who said something no no i made a choice this is my family my old family left me to die yeah i mean and either way i like that because either way if only the pawns of the group follow him out that's fewer goliaths we have to worry about best-case scenario kevdak zanror and the best of the baddies chase him out we can get the hostages out and then set the trap for when they come back will it i thought they only fly over every few days if there are no wyverns are you open to the idea of gerbil-ball scanlan doing a thing yeah and if we get close hopefully we can ask somebody that's nice if they've seen any dragons and how long it's been since that's brilliant yep i like it i'm game what's that i mean look we're going to find out one way or the other i don't know but look yeah no look he's wearing weapons given by a god i don't care if it's a totally fair fight i just don't want to dispatch him cheaply sam taliesin and oh thank you we have that really nice high grass right not like cornstalk high i'd like to stay there i'd like to stay in those areas that's good 19 oh 29 he rolled anyway 13 did we pass the area that we were at before where the farmer frederick did we see him reggie reginald sorry horace horace do they i think they thought it was him we should've sent him off to the camp i agree laura and i don't think they did either five questions vax make it count yeah do i understand that description i was wondering kevdak's son does come one more question can we ask if he's seen the dragon or how long it's been we thank you for your time if we may how long has it been since the dragon was last here two days it's coming back okay i would too and i'm the smartest of them all no we're going to put him back up so am i the only one that while we wait is itching for a fight i'm sorry look it's just who i am too soon okay yeah zanror it's spelled-- it's spelled like this and then like it sounds nah not any longer nobody look nobody look don't you look don't you look don't you look we got to wait for her to finish because the night is young oh fuck no windows okay from the three that were walking around what did the other two do we can use that well i haven't had my morning shit yet but as soon as i do-- i don't think i need it this time (laughter) what you really got to go all right yeah then we do it and we do it the way we said right now here's the thing sorry well hold on what were you going to say so if we try and build that trench outside right we risk being seen and then pop goes the weasel if you go in-- well what can you go in looking like me or can you go in looking like me on fire can you conjure just me or could you be me as a walking flame oh i know this is like a one-time thing for me so i figured i'd just do it rockstar i just want to see what it looks like we'll stand down from that idea it was just a thought no problem if we want to do the trench we have to wait for nightfall i'm all right with that can i hear your best undead grog it's amazing it's like a verbal mirror so if we do the trench though we have to-- percy-- percy what was your idea if we do the ditch for the people that're coming out of the city we waste it if it's not zanror and kevdak if we go in-- i don't know last thing i remember i was looking up at my father and the rest of my herd he made no move to save me way back in the beginning it's a repressed memory all right he comes up never no if i walk in i want to walk in on my own as the distraction right yeah go ahead right this is your trick you pick anything that moves but he can't move if he's wearing the boots can i ask this let's say we pick this gate where she's digging out this ditch what is the terrain like on the outside of the wall next to that gate zero cover past 30 feet from the wall from the edge of town what kind of cover is there is there any not even the tall grass this is an important thing we need to remember as we're doing all this let's just assume that we're us and this'll all go tits-up real quick we're going to be a fucking long way away from you before we can come to help we should at least find a forward operating base a place where we can watch this unfold from cover and figure out how far away we are from the first act of our show how far away are we from the entrance now wait a minute are there sewers in westruun i don't know yeah i hadn't thought of that look at those eyes don't say a thing don't say shit come on what are you doing yes i like it perfect perfect perfect jesus that was a hell of a 50th fuck's sake it's going perfect it's going perfectly we are still on the rails it is working
