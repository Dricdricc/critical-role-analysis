and get a close look why don't we send one like mars rover over here and have him go check it out isn't there something in the water we haven't been down to the water's surface but maybe there's a different vantage point he might die didn't say it was foolproof never to be forgotten tiberius tiberius do it go fly all the way down to the water's surface like michael j fox in back to the future 2 and check out if there's any other tunnels that we haven't seen or ways to go we didn't go down to the water's surface though did we oh we did we went all the way down can you freeze it we have two underwater breathing potions but remember we're slow as balls in water can we stand on it anything if we wanna fight it or are we gonna be fighting it in the water yeah but we'll be slow i'm not

sovereign uriel tal'dorei iii as part of his gift to the group for essentially saving his family and the city itself had a keep constructed for them and took about six months or so and the keep was
