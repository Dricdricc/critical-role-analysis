even worse 16 with a minus two he fucked us marisha sam and yeah feel like i should take this and try and find him he's got to fucking die he was so cool and strong and only his physique rivals my own but i feel like he's got to die couldn't what hold on a what so he's a paladin of-- right is that a good or a bad of good dragons or bad okay i feel like he had a good insight but the hand does bad things right but he said preserve it lead them to my junk people have come looking for it for less it doesn't even look like a hand just like one really big middle finger (laughter) yeah all right i have it i'm not going to preserve it and bahamut is the platinum-- no bahamut is the good dragon of the platinum variety would you say they are at odds taliesin and like godzilla and king kong she was badass liam and i'll just hold on to the hand right now nothing we just had a big fight i have to go after the hand i must kill vecna i have to do these things nuh-huh no that's true that was part of a trade no there was a trade of items i got a cloak of smashing out of it and you got other stuff no we didn't you caught it you threw it-- oh my god (laughter) (gasps) you're so strong what'd i miss before we go down before we leave what about sylas they have coffins right just goes up and says hi to people yeah right maybe we let him go that's a good point we're going to live a life of paranoia

have proof there was a process we had trammels yes ask for money can i ask are you afraid was that necessary makes sense a celestial hand reaches out of the clouds pike while we're here i feel like if bahamut is the natural enemy of tiamat i don't know if i want to be bound to this sword for much longer i feel like my time of hunting vecna is done i feel like we have arkhan's hand maybe if we handed it over to the platinum-- these people then somebody else could take up that hunt right yeah okay i think i want to turn over this sword but would you stay with me he's very persuasive actually scanlan will you come with me also all right can i make my way back towards somebody official-looking highbearer orb sounds good anyone ever stronger than anyone that's ever wielded you yeah (sighs) you make a really good point we're really strong together and unstoppable i mean hold on pike maybe we could do a lot of good we could really rid the world of a lot of bad stuff (exhales) okay (strained) highbearer orb a moment please i would like to make a deposit i have on my person the sword-- okay 14 (sighs) i'm so sorry to waste your time i wanted to thank you for hosting us bidet and

saving throw that's a five okay i stop (deep breath) it is the sword of kas i'm feeling so achy what happened whew yeah we kept the sword right oh okay yes that blade careful with it very powerful he is bent on the destruction of one thing and one thing only vecna wait i have something else then i show the hand of arkhan oh the person that owned this hand-- okay stay with me chopped this off and took vecna's hand and stuck it on and then this got left over so this is not his hand anymore and the one that he does have is vecna's so if you use your noodle you can use this to trace him yeah right it was pretty smart arkin arkeen arkhan arkhan the fool the cruel the-- don't underestimate him he's really buff and devious cool yeah he was pretty cool he was pretty cool well see don't hurt him he actually helped us defeat vecna he pulled a tricksy-doodle and took the hand sure yep beep beep all right pike shall we away scanlan shall we away away we-- oui oui ashley and i feel good i feel like pursuing vecna was something that we all did together and i feel like whatever we do now is new and i felt like i was going to have to do that on my own and i don't want to do that that's good to know you handing out apologies i will consider accepting your apology if you tell me whatever happened to it okay allura (laughter) pike go upside down (wookiee growl) (mediocre wookiee growl)

here or whitestone all right pike you want one (laughter) well jeez i thought we were all having tequila shots and going crazy and taking pictures and writing our name on the bathroom walls but it seems like everybody's lost their nerve i put it back in the bag of holding (laughter and groaning) the night's still young (laughing) she doesn't handle that booze very well has everybody gone off i make my way sneakily outside oh really oh you know i was just gonna um shit in them i wander outside where i'm by myself do i see anyone like it matters oh 17 i pull a card yeah it's nighttime i rolled a bunch of hit dice from our short rest i might have i'm pretty sure-- i'll tell you my soul is drawn from my body my body is incapacitated it is placed within an object that the dm chooses a wish spell will tell you the location of the object but will not reverse the action my body's still there i'm there catatonic with an open deck of cards in my hand like this somebody's going to find

scoundrel do you have any money that's worth literally nothing how about you give her this and i take out the rare black sapphire and put it in your hand i'm fucking watching you you understand don't you slip up i know i usually put dead people in the bag of holding but there's always a first treat her right (high-pitched) yes ranger's hat only you can prevent forest fires i'm so fascinated by vasselheim i have so many interests that i feel it only proper to go back and turn myself in to the authorities for punching one of the guards in the face and take whatever punishment they have for me yeah up top that's where we were oh i'm free to go that's unexpected could you point me in the direction of a library yes you you will come with me gentlemen whose word are you going to take the savior of vasselheim or his new tutor well unless you have something better to do you could contribute to one of the greatest people to ever pass through this city and help me learn to read a little bit more would that be a problem i only have 8000 gold to give you natural 20 (cheering) yes 8000 gold i could carry it if you want fair enough i'd like to learn to read a bit more i'd like to split some time in the temple of kord oh he did survive i'd also like to bring pike out every once in a while and we give challengers a shot in the crucible but mostly i'm trying to improve my mind and
