that had wronged me some that were very dear to me i had to force my way through them up this staircase and when i reached the top-- have you ever heard the word reward it was astounding incredible hard to believe it was almost as if the oceans obeyed my commands how long has it been for you yeah you know beginner's luck right of course with my life anybody looking at us as i turn around

two to three inches not me yeah give it to beau it looks like he's asleep or praying you said what a good monk you don't have to whisper we'll probably get one shot taliesin and who's got one awesome shot we do sam and what's your awesome shot i want to say yes i just don't know if now's the time to be demoing a new thing you know what fluffernutter sounds great what are you holding couple quick thoughts when we tried to blow up the tree didn't work so well two load-bearing beams in a closed room with no windows so it's going to hurt us too okay the name is great i'm just thinking maybe in practical use not the best idea here i am the only one doing that hold for just a second captain i have been an admirer of your ability to disappear we could use that talent now if you thought you could get up close and strike without being detected none of us-- do you think you have the skill to pull off such a feat is that pretty heavy duty do you want to be danger close like that let's do it bolts are just popping off the end of it and onto the floor just expending shells onto the floor what is schmidt no no keg this is fantasy and magic fuck the blackpowder keg i have a strong feeling the keg of blackpowder won't do that much damage nope don't even know if it has ears and kill us all molly-- caduceus fuck balls i'm sorry it happens all the time if we're keeping our distance-- how many people are seriously considering fluffernutter show of hands can we put that to bed now (british accent) governor (laughter) caleb what is the nastiest thing you have can she make your duplicate invisible okay actually i like that the best okay we're going to send your duplicate to inflict wounds float it up the water don't disturb anything uh-huh fluffernutter nott if any of us are in the room no fluffernutter okay nope i feel like i'm talking to baby groot in guardians 2 if we're in the room-- fluffernutter no no fluffernutter whatever you're doing let's do it jester and nott

eight also sorry yeah i will use my 30 feet of speed to run in the direction of nott i will cast hunger of hadar 20-foot sphere 20-foot diameter with the closest lip of it on the side of the well that's closest to us here back yeah i hope so if it won't i'll move it thought there was a big circle yeah that's good yeah cover the well cover him get everybody in hopefully yes yeah it's black you open a gateway to the dark 20-foot radius sphere of blackness and bitter cold you could hold it in case something comes out of the sphere or the well yasha's going to use her bonus action to rage double dash into this corner past beau i'll hold it thank you for the reminder you're right yep then double dash mm-hmm 2d6 my god what the fuck is that 2d6 ten points of cold damage speed is halved mm-hmm cool merde does it end its turn in the sphere as well 2d6 nine points of acid damage if that makes any difference doesn't seem so great now remember ten 15 11 lots of points of damage was it three attacks from the hydra on avantika or four okay 2d6 cold damage 11 points of cold damage at yasha that is her armor class okay 13 yeah yep good shit good stuff i'm going to (tongue clicking) move a little closer to the column and i'll send two arcs of eldritch blast towards the-- yeah just closer to nott yes 17 okay so second one natural 20 okay okay okay the first one is 12 second one is nine 18 22 points of damage like an idiot i'll cast with my bonus action hexblade's curse on the hydra which would have really made that critical way more awesome but i'm flustered yep yes yasha got fucked up and does not care about captain avantika and will move 40 feet towards nott and fjord that direction great and will hold a melee attack in case something comes within her range 2d6 cold nine points of cold damage needed that yeah more of that yeah yeah yeah that's a wasted action you've got the keg right thank god there's another checks and balances to that crazy 22 points of damage to it oh fuck from the two strikes to it her rapier or-- i'll use the 30 feet of fjord's movement to go around the pillar preserve this line of sight with the hydra i'll unleash two eldritch blasts at it that's an 18 to hit one that's terrible that's 13 points of eldritch blast energy oh i'm sorry wait just checking plus three so 16 points with the additional three that will be-- fuck i should have said it first that's it that's my turn yeah that was the plus three to damage i forgot to do something else i'll do it next time what'd you cast now she would like to ragé i don't have to do reckless divine thing on the first one that's only a 14 on the first one fuck 16 it's the first one that hits right (counting) 16 points yes does sentinel engage there does sentinel come after the attack or before the attack she's going to do it reckless oh i got you shit i don't remember what it was when i picked it up be level it's a 15 17 points of-- where is avantika and jamedi in the initiative order at the very bottom they were they should probably go before beau then right because this is the beginning of a new round it's staying out of that bubble with my bonus action i'll cast hex at the hydra dropping the-- the bubble yes now i will fire two eldritch blasts at the hydra with hex on top that's only a 12 that's a natural 20 you said the first one hits it was a 12 nine 18 18 plus four 22 thank you plus 1d6 for hex four so 26 no 30 total of 30 thank you it does what is radiant flame the same i can if you don't have anything you want to do get that fucking bow and that bow is no joke those arrows are fucking-- yes she will walk up and-- do i even need to go reckless to get advantage amazing okay that's good that's 25 to hit (counting) 18 points on the first one the first hit on every hit gets the third d6 the second hit is a 22 okay two eight 16 yeah let's get out of this shared survival you want to reply to that do you i'll do the sentry on it 19 against the hydra-- that was 12 points of damage beau's down it was 12 against the hydra-- i don't have any fire in the bag of holding either no attack of opportunity because of sentry right kill her kill her okay yes i'll move just so i have a line of sight with the hydra and i'll rip off two eldritch blasts in its direction that is 18 on the first one to hit the second one is 14 does not hit okay 1d10 plus four nine plus four is 13 plus-- 16 plus 1d6 for hex that's six points 22 points of eldritch blast damage i do are you punching it it's yasha she's going to walk up and swing away is there any advantage from flanking anything 25 to hit on the first one 15 on the second does that hit 20 and there's nothing else yeah 20 points on the first one nine points on the second-- i'm sorry ten ten points on the second one jester caduceus caleb are all cowering in the hallway with all the hydra heads coming in as it rears back to strike they see the magician's judge pierce through the belly of the hydra and cleave through the middle of it she just goes no problem fucking jamedi fuck matt jesus how many heads did we go through i think we went through-- i'm sure critrolestats knows i think it was around like 14 or 16 or something i can't remember that was really good what's the ballpark damage-ish like blank d6 that's right he said we can still use it if it's not damaged fluffernutter
