anybody have the chicken instead of the salad i was making sure it wasn't me hey look i know we've got a night to ourselves i was wondering if maybe we could all like play a game i heard about no no i don't think so it's a little above their head yeah it's only for us big thinkers okay yeah so i was in this tavern the other day right and i heard about this game i think it's called bunions and flagons right and you are all going to play as little itty-bitty versions of yourselves all you got to do is use your imagination right i'm going to tell you a story and then you contribute tell me what you want to do and i draw out little maps and we'll go on an adventure no it's like the size of your thumb like tiny we're going to move them around yeah yeah you know you're tiny but you've got a big uh heart what do you think oh yeah you know i've been thinking about it for a long time i actually made art for each of you guys so like i made percy right and then i made vex right with the ears and the arrows and then there's vax'ildan with his little ears bleeding then the scanlan oh shit no i am playing with you i'll be there not a bowl but a ball not a bowl you eat out of but a ball no no ball i'm going to put everything on this big table in front of us it'll be right in front of you and you get to sit in your chair yeah it's pretty nice yeah always a good idea when playing this game to drink heavily yes all right so power gamer in your brain theaters all right i want you to imagine that vox machina has been successful on its latest mission we are triumphant as always it's the wee hours of the morning and we have found our way to a tavern small maybe off the beaten path right it's shambly outside we go in and it's deserted right there's only like one other couple in the whole fucking place we got the run of the lot we go in it's time to drink we're raising glasses we're cheering we're drinking everybody's boozing right yeah who wants to make a toast you're just playing you though cheers yeah to keyleth underpowered her whole life really nothing at her disposal may her memory live forever as we are drinking and we're on like-- what's a big number our second cup everybody's really starting to feel it a little bit especially our little gnome pike pike gets up on the table right she's like-- pike flower my friend pike gets up and she's like you guys i love being your friend i'm really like all of your friend you are good and she turns to you vex yeah and she's like you know we're so close and you know i-- (gulping) and you start to see right that maybe she's had one too many which is really saying something for that little tank she goes ah nope i got it-- urp and in that moment you start to see all the color come up to her face i need you to roll a dexterity check i don't know i heard a guy at the bar say it yeah totally right so 29 that's great at the last moment you see what is bound to be a shoot of vomit in your face and you just boop duck out of the way she catches it with her lips and this little stream of bile comes like shooting out and goes over your shoulder you raise the glass right in front of her face as she sees it she sees more alcohol in the glass and she goes mm and turns away and paints the bar except that other couple that was in the bar with you they're right in the path of her destruction yeah and she alphabits and lucky charms all over the place all over the table on this couple you see as this gentleman this greenish-skinned with large lower teeth and a hood and a cloak stands up and starts to turn toward you he's like what the fuck yeah is she with you well i'm sure you guys are going to take care of this right i mean it's in my drink it's on my food it's on my-- and you see with him is also this very lovely lady she's got slightly bluish skin and she is also like staring in revulsion at all of this mess that she's wearing right it's on her maybe there's a little bit hanging off of her lip she starts to go wha-- (gulping) what-- she holds it in but this really infuriates this half-orc looking gentleman he stands up right and he's like that's it you and i-- you you and i we're coming to blows i want answers for this nope i've stood up i'm making a point that doesn't make any difference and i'm too embarrassed to back down now what's a theater nope imagination weapons yeah you tell me what you want to do with what oh yeah okay so you yeah take one of those big globular like d20 dices the mansion provides roll to hit the servants bring over a sheet that has modifiers for you to use yeah these are things you add he's pretty wise 15 that's all you need you boink right in his eyes and he's like argh in the eyes right the girl stands up at the table and she's like no no please not his eyes right and she sees you standing there ready to go and she's like no please please actually do you want to see if she has any weapons oh you are perceptive right roll a perception check you don't see anything unfortunately that's just unfortunate right so you see her genealogy going back like four generations yeah it's like you know a blue denim yeah so you see at her side this spear that's laying up against the table yeah yeah i don't know how you missed it the first time it's a fucking spear right there she stands up and she's like no no please no more eye-poking i don't know can you just do that or do you roll okay go invisible okay roll a stealth check ten total okay great so you go invisible right and you walk over behind the blue-skinned lady and right as you get to the spear you grab for it but there's something that catches your eye and you fumble the spear and it falls to the ground good i love it as she hears the spear fall she turns and she swings her hand wildly catching you dead in the face boom knocks you back you fly back onto your back five feet you take two points of damage scanlan the reason that you fumbled for the spear is that you saw this small little bundle next to her chair in fact it looks like-- it looks like a small baby all swaddled up in cloth no small no yeah i'm going to put this out like what's that game where you move the-- yeah that one we'll be like that on a big map well you're not that far from her so she goes it is a baby it is please we just want to leave i'm sorry if we caused you any trouble would you want to go over to it yeah walk on over and make a perception check it's a baby good question yeah you can try pretty much if you get an idea and you want to try it you ask me we'll roll a dice then i'll let you know how it goes the moldy cheese the point of this is there's a small baby right and you've got a couple covered in puke and she's asking if maybe they can leave instead of-- avoid further scrum you see his demeanor like he totally goes like another eye-poking avoided whoosh right he says all right people make mistakes try to enjoy the rest of your night he goes over and gets his blue-skinned wife up and she grabs her little bundle and they start to make their way out of the tavern you do sure roll a d20 perception do a perception check whoa so you see that she's actually going like that was so embarrassing i want to go home and take my clothes off and you and i go and we'll have a great night yeah lots of boning in their future batteries what are batteries you see the spear is a long wooden pole wrapped with some cloth where you might hold it with your hands at the tip is a very rusted metal sharp point at the tip you got yourself a spear so now now you truly have the tavern to yourself it's just us five yeah you see grog sitting there and he's aghast at how rude pike was to puke all over this couple and that you would go and poke them in the eyes grog's very dignified no that's not true grog goes over to pike and goes okay pikey-poo maybe it's time to let's put you to sleep upstairs barkeep and you look behind the tavern and there is a-- fuck in your mind he's fucking over there he might be over there in a second stay with me so grog picks up pike and goes over to the barkeep and he's like do you have any rooms that i can put this little gnome in and he's like yes i have i do have rooms (wheezing) how much money do you have and grog's like i have ten gold and he's like sure that'll fucking do it so grog goes and takes pike upstairs puts her in a room comes back down and like whoa she is hammered i don't know if you know but i'm super rich because i never really buy anything i always seem to find the money that's what i do find the money so now it turns out that your cups are all slightly emptier than before your plates are rather empty it doesn't really seem like we want the night to end does somebody want to maybe check with the barkeep and see if he has any more points oh right oh like did we do something right no actually like at the end of this story you either win or lose like overall potentially don't you like the theater oh yeah no it's one big long game preferably three to four hours long oh we're just kicking this shit off get comfy set the tone the mood totally hold on can you ask them to bring in some like meats like a meat and cheese plate come on kaylie won't fucking know please i'm so tired of this green shit nope you got to stay in the game that's only in the game with that stuff so you're in the tavern you need more to drink who wants to go talk to the barkeep what do you do eh oh yes yeah oh to drink or to eat my name it's bob bobaline is my full name but people call me bob it's a family name if you want more to drink unfortunately i was not planning on you being here it's quite late i do however have more food in the pantry below the bar or there are some extra casks of ale out with the pigs no unfortunately me son is the one who normally goes and gets it he's not here timothy well it's not a huge deal i just need one of you to either go down and get the food and one of you to go get the ale yeah you go down to the cellar and grog-- i will go get the ale unless somebody wants to go out in the pig sty i'll go or do you two want to go get the ale okay cool so you vax and sam you make your way out back scanlan as vax and scanlan start to head toward the back door vex and percy would you like to try and find the latch under the bar that leads-- you find it fuck it's right there good job right so you lift the latch in the floor and you go down it's a very small room that has different salted meats and cheeses and some bread and stuff like that you take armfuls i mean do you want to see maybe what else is down there roll perception checks nice you also see three of these bottles with hided belted locks on it and it says sandkheg on there it looks really really expensive there's three bottles of that yep sure what do you roll to pick a lock what about liam what does liam know roll for it oh that's not very good unfortunately this is a better expensive bottle of sandkheg after trying to break the lock or pick it you get the lockpick stuck in there yeah and it's all fucked up but you're really resilient and you smash the top of the bottle it seems stupid to have a lock on a glass bottle but it works you did it already it's too bad no you just smashed the top off you have the rest of the bottle you got some salted meats some cheese you also see some dead rats in the corner some empty shelves and one old leathery book yeah it's all dusty shelves there's a leathery book on one of the shelves do you want to open it up yeah they do it says ledger great yeah roll a constitution check 13 right you take a sip and boy does it burn you're like (gagging) you feel like you could breathe fire it starts to spread down into your chest no not literal fire like (gasps) fire sandkheg oh jesus roll a constitution check yeah so the warmth starts to spread right you also feel this immediate desire to upchuck the liquid because it's so strong in your rush to cover your mouth you drop the bottle and it shatters all over the floor you open the book and it's got numbers in it with letters i guess unfortunately no it's beyond your mental prowess so back upstairs y'all want to stay in the pantry or come back up yeah you stayed down there for a while fair enough vax and scanlan y'all head out back use your imaginationyou get to the back door and you push it open you see before you right a pen full of muck mud and these three large hogs rolling around in the muck off to the side you see a large cask of ale no it's not what you do no actually you're not there percy and vex have made their way back to the table you two are-- no the table in the tavern you two are at the back hall room there it's normally my job but yeah right it's simple enough so bigby's hand just appears around the cask and it wraps its purple fingers around the cask picks it up and holds it in mid-air flavor that's some good color you guys should really step up your fucking game leave it to the bard but yeah nice job you get 300 xp for that performance don't worry about it you remember being in school and they gave out gold stars when you did good things no they're not points they're xp xylophone players so you get the cask and you draw it back over did you bring the cask back to the table yes you did a really great job you guys are good good please i'll give 70 percent off because shit no one's here so nobody will know so please take enjoy it's just you so you take the cask and the food back over you two look a little disheveled like you may have fallen down some stairs going into the pantry that's fucking gross yeah so you pour ale all around you get your cups full again you've got a little more food into your belly and you make one more toast for the night to your successes as warriors victorious who wants to make a toast no that's good taliesin and yeah laura taliesin and everybody drink to that yeah it's supposed to be us it's a concept as the alcohol starts to go down the throats into the belly down into your belly the world starts to get a little hazy you got a 150 xp for saying it also you feel a lot of warmth in your face and you feel almost as if the world's been tilted on you like someone's pushing you around and you don't have much control you reach out to steady yourself and to warn your other friends when all of a sudden the lights go out and you feel gravity take over and you just fall and fall and fall the end no that's not the end (shouting) you come to (normal voice) sorry chris you come to and you're lying on the floor it's cold nope nope it's cold it feels like stone underneath you it's moist and damp there's dirt everywhere and it feels uneven you open your eyes and the light of the tavern is not the same as it was before in fact you're on a wood floor and you remember but now there's stones beneath you you got all your stuff you look and you seem to be in some sort of dimly-lit cavern you all look around and you see your mates around you all there but the environment has changed there is light you look around and there seem to be along these stone walls around you random torches so there is some torchlight down here you can would you like to they're a bit high unfortunately they're about eight to ten feet off the floor it's just out of your reach you can if you want to all right so you hop onto your broom kick up off the ground and grab the torch you pull it out and off in the distance somewhere you hear a scraping sound very faint but you hear it roll a perception check is it yeah yeah go for it yeah no fucking flagons around currently vex is the only one who's gotten to her feet and grabbed a torch are you all standing up looking around yeah yeah everybody please roll a stealth check 18 good okay now listen this is where the fun starts no there you go look at that you're all there i stole it from a small child so as you look around your environment you notice the floor is stone the walls are stone and you seem to be in some sort of circular cavern there's also a domed ceiling above you there is just pure wall for most of this circular room except for an area that seems to lead into another chamber beyond you may roll an attack it's so good in fact that you take one step into the wall and you turn and face it like the creepy person from blair witch and you stay there 32 great so you turn so that you can see into the other cavern and you shoot your oracle arrow and your sight goes (zooming) and you see it fly approximately (counting) 25 feet and it just hits another wall made of stone in the cavern very similar to the one you're in yeah almost identical to this one very smart make a perception check you open your eyes and because you're staring at the wall like a nerd you notice the mortar is very fine would anybody like to make a perception check besides vax vex please roll a perception check oh very nice percival 34 that is a high perception you should be a rogue so you see that the room extends out to an edge and you move to the middle and you see that these two rooms seem to be identical there are torches lighting your way and above you on this rounded ceiling there are two hatches iron hatches and above them you see maybe a chute and you wonder as you see water dripping from the hatches in the ceiling if that might have been how you got in this room you may so you fly up and you get to the hatch and it's solid iron with rusted-- there's water dripping out of it and you see there is a chute indeed no light coming from it bars but it looks as if it goes straight up and up and up it is it's closed very securely you may yes there you go you may roll a perception check you move forward and as you approach vex you do see there is an additional hallway that extends forward not in the shape of a cock and balls per se but there is another hallway in front of you and it extends forward into darkness but you do see a very faint torch at the end of it all tip of the hallway yeah so you are going up ooh this is you yeah you pull on it and man that shit is-- roll a strength check i'll give you a shot no no it doesn't even move it doesn't even do the pothole thing as soon as you step on it it goes boop boop i'm going to fall but no it's solid not that you can tell if you want to check and see if there's a latch to it roll an investigation check 23 you reach through one of the slots in the plate that's holding-- you put your hand through and as your fingers curl around you do feel a very large latch but it is thick and very secure and it extends into the mass around it the wall itself you get the impression that it would take quite a mechanism to unleash this thing you both head down the hallway what's the marching order here you said to the right of the hallway and you're going to be on the left to the left vax okay and vex would you like to proceed down the hallway okay so you move forward well as scanlan is just ahead of you in your pursuit down the hallway scanlan feels his foot fall on a piece of the floor and it sinks you hear a grinding noise that you've heard before in our adventures and it's not good and instinctually you look to your right immediately on the wall and you notice there are all these holes in the wall and sure enough just as you're looking a fucking dart sinks right into your cheek just poof right into your-- (yelling) and just as your hands go up to your face another one hits you in the thigh as you turn around one sinks into your butt cheek yeah you pull him back you take-- you take 13 points of fucking dart damage you look at the wound in his cheek and the wound in his arm chest area they don't seem so bad but the one in his butt is starting to swell a little bit kind of bruised and red make a medicine check as you suck on scanlan's ass i will make a ruling because you are sucking on scanlan's ass you may roll with advantage fantastic you manage to get the right amount of pressure right on the butt cheek right and you suck all the poison out and you spit it out because you know if you swallow it also bad for you and you manage to take your head away just in time as a scanlan little boop farts out oh man yeah nothing like mom's kisses that's nice good job so you've taken 13 points of damage you've pointed it out i assume to the rest of the group yeah in this game if you notice something call it out to each other because what one person sees the other somehow might not see and just because you know it at the table doesn't mean that you know it in your mind pictures that's how this goes i promise i was in a tavern and this long-haired guy was playing a game at the table and i thought it was fucking great and i watched for a while like hours i was hooked i might go back next week and watch i'm not sure actually that's a great question so you notice that right here-- it is i don't give a shit there is this area yeah i don't fucking care or you have to build a map with that integrated into it you notice that that area of the floor you step on it bad shit happens well you haven't gone past it yet would you like to try and cross that area nice be very careful with the shaft okay if you would like to try and cross over that area you all need to make an acrobatic check as you try and leap over that's good 17 36 everyone but vax manages to leap over successfully over well done vax catches his foot he's like (yells) and he falls flat on his face and the darts go pew pew pew vex if you want to turn you can try and drag your brother who has luckily had all the darts go above his lying goofy body on the floor and try to pull him off the plate unfortunately no strength check that's enough because vax doesn't have very many muscles so you pull him off the plate and he's there all of you are right there ready to go again all right yeah hold on look grog makes it over and then trinket comes up roll a acrobatics check for trinket you know what save it for later ooh yeah so unfortunately-- sure so he falls and i start to hear the grinding again and i pull him by his ear and whoop everybody's on the safe side of the trap what would you like to do next roll a perception check 22 yes indeed there are no further traps towards the tip but your keen half-elf ears pick up a (wind blowing) sound turn back and you spin on your heel and outside of grog's amazing deltoids which look swollen from shoulder day you see behind you a spectral form starting to make its way towards you i need you all to roll initiative i already bought that one yeah it was two dollars or something 16 percy wow 16 percy really vex you're up first you see the spectral form starting to move towards you what would you like to do you shoot an arrow at it okay roll to hit hold on wait there's music and shit fuck yeah i'm sorry what was it hit yeah that definitely hits yeah too late for that 23 nice yeah roll an acrobatic check first oh then no-- for the acrobatic check trinket falls right on the plate and he's like boom and then because it shot all those darts and vax fell and they were like oh none of the darts hit they're all aimed down and trinket takes like six darts he looks like the guy in the godfather he's like (distressed bear sounds darts) covered in darts trinket takes-- 24 points of damage but he manages with his bear strength to pull himself just out of the line of fire but he is right there no vax you're up well give me an acrobatics check because you jump over the plate area you want to run into melee with the ghost you learn from your previous errors and man up and you totally make it across just fine you stab it roll to attack a 19 which hits boy that's a lot of damage with that divine smite boy it really does you see him go like ouch and his form shivers and stuff and he's like (pained sounds) you see the area where you stab evaporates and then comes back into form but he's still standing there he gleams at you with these fucking dead ghost eyes yep yeah he is a dwarf ghost that's fair that sounds like a good idea yeah that's how it works he turns to you after being like it hurts so bad you really hurt him really bad and he is going to use horrifying visage on you yeah i need you to make a wisdom saving throw oh that succeeds you see him almost glare into your soul you feel your little butthole pucker and you're like oh no it's so scary but you shake it off because you've seen so much worse in your time yeah and you throw up the double-birds and he's like (hissing) and you shake it off that's good percy it's your turn back away from the ghost or towards him 24 hits yeah do it that is just enough you hit him and his form-- you hear this shriek and he just-- turns into a puff of smoke disappears into nowhere and the ghost is gone calm retakes the hallway make a perception check to explore the hallway 20 yeah that's great you move forward and you see no doorways no exits but you do see a line near the end of the hallway that seems to be a bit of an inequality in the rocks almost like if you push on it something might happen yeah yeah you push on it give me a strength check right strangely you lean into it about to give it a big shove but your feet slip out from under you on the slick rock and you fall flat on your face and you bite a bit of your tongue and lip great yeah make a strength check 16 you lean in and you push having percy just like little bloody mouth right next to you and sure enough the wall starts to move but you can see light coming from the other side it's just too heavy for you to move you know what i got it grog goes up towards the end of the hallway he's like maybe i'll just fucking handle this you guys don't worry and he rolls a million and the door flies open almost comes off whatever invisible hinges it had like rock falls out of the door yeah pretty much i know doors can't faze me the rest of you it's a problem not always true you see before you a lit cavern something off in the distance but you're still in the doorway what do you do do you have another oracle arrow yeah roll to attack shoot you nock and you pull and you release and your vision goes into the arrow and it shoots forward you see stone floors beneath you and all of a sudden it shoots past what looks like a flowing fountain of water and it just arcs past and you see as it clears past the fountain a small furry shape on the ground and it hits into a ground and it scatters and the arrow shatters on the floor okay so would you all like to follow her you all want to go vax hangs back you all fell over there you go so you see this fountain right here scanlan right here and vax over here there's a fountain right in front of you and as you go in you see there appears to be like just this rouge flushed-skin type water coming out of it some sort of fluid and it's just a beautiful fountain right in the middle of the room circular from what you can see what do you do it was past the fountain somewhere you're not sure traps do a perception check is that what you're doing for traps okay do roll an investigation check 12 there do not appear to be any traps you see before you what looks like a dog a tiny little dog where is the dog where's the dog gone right about here at the edge of your vision sure yeah we'll use this to be a dog here's the dog right here no it's one of liam's it was in the box you see a dog his tail just sweeping behind him if you'd like to go for it as you do that the dog whips around and looks at you jumps to its feet and starts to growl starts to growl and he's like intruder intruder you see as these bone shards start to protrude from his back and shoulders his spine starts to lengthen and he's no longer a fucking dice dog it is this massive thing you do roll to attack you're at disadvantage because you're so close 26 you hit the vicious hell hound what's your damage 28 points of damage with one shot amazing great is that the end of your turn okay trinket runs up around the other side natural 20 if you can't tell from her exuberance a natural 20 is like the best thing you can roll okay great and what's the damage he critted okay there's fucking mysterious music have the people change it to some sort of-- whoa 23 trinket putting out some damage yeah that's pretty good yeah seriously okay so as trinket attacks and takes a vicious chunk out of the side of this hell hound right-- you hear a growl even further into the cavern laura and no these are caverns what are you smoking and you see from behind the fountain coming another hell hound to see what the cry of its fallen brethren are you're going to throw your spear actually now the other ones as well i need you to roll initiative again 21 vax you back near the tip are up do you normally have your boots then you do the hallway strange words coming out of your mouth you come into the cavern move your little character wherever you'd like to go yeah you stab roll to attack that hits with that first dagger you sink it into the side of the hell hound and you hear a (pained squeal) and he recoils from the pain and all of a sudden his flesh and fur just turns into flame and he catches fire and burns into nothing he just absolutely disintegrates no it doesn't well don't you have more attacks normally i see you do a lot of shit how about one more attack sounds good that hits a nine nine damage the bear did this is not a competition you hit it and it totally gets its attention it sinks right into its shoulder blade and it's (pained growling) and focuses on you that's true yeah scanlan you're up you got it okay 20 it fails you dominate the monster and next in the initiative order is actually the hell hound and he takes off running straight towards trinket yeah it's real unfortunate he's going to unleash a bite att-- no he's going to do firebreath in a 15-foot cone must make a dc 12 dexterity saving throw roll a dexterity saving throw vex vax and trinket you both succeed four so trinket takes 29 points of fire damage liam and you guys both take 19 points of fire damage halved because you made the save wait call it 14 points we'll call it 14 points you can read right well you should i know it's terrible i mean seriously percival you're up okay what's your speed how far can you move 30 one two three-- so unfortunately trinket stands between you and the hell hound out this way more okay so maybe over here you want to throw it okay roll an attack at disadvantage because i've never seen you throw a fucking spear before (laughter) plus two yeah good you throw the spear and it-- it just disappears you're not quite sure where but you hear a sploosh you hear the splash as it seems to disappear into the fountain behind the hell hound good nice vex you're up you have a bonus action if you want it yeah i just assume you'll know that better than me nice roll an attack that'll hit no sounds good he's outside oh he's asleep oh sorry he blends into the furniture that's super insensitive 31 damage oh to hit it hits are you lacking die how is that possible 13 17 and with that you hit the hell hound and the arrow sinks in and he too starts to catch fire from the wound and he's like (howling) and he just evaporates yeah not that's it's a competition but you've killed something trinket's killed something and you've killed something there were only 450 to give out for the entire game so it's all been used there is 200 more to give you'll get 50 xp thank you percival i can only juggle so many you know parrots at one time so the hell hounds have been destroyed and the cavern is again quiet what would you like to do okay so you go up to the fountain-- you can go to this one yep roll a constitution saving throw yeah it's just water so you notice as you're washing your hands off right it's a very nice color grog wanders off-- no they don't just nice and yeah it's a good question would you like to roll an intelligence check which fountain are you inspecting okay you come over to scanlan's fountain and you're inspecting that one as well intelligence 24 yeah this is very soft water it is very nice it's got like a salt treatment to it it's very nice yeah it's good for your skin there's vitamins in there there's potassium and mercury and stuff nice so as you're inspecting the fountains you notice that grog having watched you guys be very careful checking for traps and everything is doing the same he's trying to do his part yeah and lo and behold he finds an edge in the wall just like you found before and he pushes it open and inside there is 20 platinum yeah guys i found 20 platinum in this secret passage platinum's mine but you never know what else is around maybe look for yourself all right roll a perception check investigation check 25 yeah in fact on the exact opposite side of the cavern you find a similar door and do you want to push it open yeah so you push and there seems to be something coiled up on the ground in the corner it's not a creature or anything do you want it or not could be yeah roll a perception check it's a big pile of poop you found a poo each what you want to search the bottom of each fountain sure which one would you like to start on scanlan's or-- yeah sure there you go yeah roll an investigation check there do not appear to be any traps yeah bottom of the fountain you find-- it's like a mossy bottom and there's some pebbles but it seems like that might've come from the stones overhead but there doesn't appear to be any objects in the bottom of the fountain who does you'll go over there so scanlan's little legs just like (footsteps) all the way over here there goes trinket so you see before you-- roll to attack 19 what's your ac ooh roll for damage 14 points of damage the bear sinks its teeth into your shoulder and gives you a little jiggle that saliva starts to burn yeah bear saliva might there is also this incredible door in front of you make a perception check five you see before you a door magnificent brilliantly ornate it's made of several different kinds of wood and iron you know everything about this how do you open it yes there is there is a latch the door opens it just opens the door swings open you notice as it opens there's a carving in the wood of a large tower as it swings open it reveals in front of it a small structure about 30 to 50 feet out in front of you and darkness beyond no yeah shockingly as scanlan and trinket are looking through the doorway they see a structure about 30 to 50 feet away from the doorway further into another space is just darkness beyond you go through the doorway would everyone like to go through the doorway you're going to stay behind who goes first scanlan you get to the doorway and the second you start to cross the threshold you feel the force start to pull you towards the door almost as if someone has removed the stopper from a bathtub you feel yourself being pulled through i need everyone to make dexterity saving throws all of you yep 18 okay vax 30 everyone except for vax and percy are immediately pulled through the threshold that's a seven grog also pulled through the doorway vax and percy manage to cling to the side of the threshold you still feel this force pulling you like there's been an atmospheric pull through the doorway you hear on the other side your comrades getting up seemingly fine for you two on this side of the door the pull is still incredibly strong you can try and fight it or you can go through yes as you're mulling this over you get 12 points of force damage taliesin and yeah it's almost as if you saw it for yourself with those descriptions really quite impressive yeah it's the triple brass tracket there's lumber and stone iron gold inlay on the door yep and a picture of a tower you know right when you slap someone after you've had too much to drink and their face is doing the pull that's what his face looks like constantly you let go and you go through the door vax you're the only one still on this side of the door yeah and you go right through the doorway as well you both fall with a clatter to the floor and you notice that in front of you is a structure you're prone percy's prone really you see before you-- nice you're on your feet you see before you a brilliant structure in the shape of a circle it's quite massive made of stone there seems to be some sort of architecture about it no no just pretend like you don't those are doors you see on each side of the structure there are doors around you you find yourself in a void black space all around in fact you turn around to see the doorway with which you came has disappeared you're standing on stone but in each direction it just seems darkness after about 20 to 30 feet there is no determinable light source it's just you're able to see here right there is in fact doors on each one of the faces one of them appears to be open maybe it appears that the door on this side is open all right yes so you go over and find this open door and as you look there is a symbol above the doorway it seems to be the symbol of a star and the door is open would you like to investigate roll an investigation check 24 yes you may stand up you are facing the wrong way again you see before you a wooden and iron door with a handle and it has been seemingly forced open inside there is a room and from what you can see from your vantage point it seems a very comfortable room you see a rug on the floor a potted plant on the side and what seems to be a chest at the end of the room does not appear to be trapped you step in from your investigation check you saw there was a potted plant on the side of the room a nice rug on the floor an open chest near the back of the room and it looks like to be just a simple table with chairs on the other wall under the rug you pick up the rug there's floor stone floor a little dusty it does appear-- yeah okay you go and look in the chest it is an empty chest roll a dexterity check in your effort to turn you slip and you catch yourself and you face the same way as everyone else well done sure directly in front of you you walk up percy you go up to the square it does appear to be a money symbol would you like to try and open the door you go to the door doesn't seem to open percy goes and reaches out tries the handle door doesn't seem to open you do notice there's not just the handle there seem to be five inlaid gems above the handle they're fucking gems five gems above the handle they're all very shiny in fact as you all communicate with each other these doors seem to be identical a handle with five gems above each handle and one of the gems seems to be glowing nothing happens nothing seems to happen when you push on the gems it's inlaid in the wall it's just attached as you're all examining your doors you hear a sound almost like a grunt vex behind you you hear a sound almost like a wicked grunt no you hear footsteps walk up behind you as a fist grabs the back of your neck and slams your face into the door grog seemingly has changed into some sort of other creature that's a natural 20 i actually did which is shocking you take 19 points of bludgeoning damage do you turn around and face your attacker there's a fucking doppelgänger behind you this amorphous shapeless creature has come up behind you and is trying to attack i don't know he's just back there he makes another attack before you have a chance to communicate with your bear that's a natural one he misses he swings forward with his other hand and takes a chip out of the door he bites him roll to attack oh god i don't know 19 damage he takes a bite out and you see like a purplish blood start to pour from this wound and he takes a big bite out of him you are very close okay make a strength check 16 unfortunately the rope goes over and he just shakes it off just slips the rope yeah well he's a tricky one this guy is there a commotion did she call out i mean you seem to be pretty preoccupied with these doors in front of you he will take another swing at you probably it's a little delayed right now you keep tripping over everything he misses on the first one shit 13 roll to attack yeah just a straight roll with your strength modifier that misses you go to kick and he just like jean claude van damme jump splits and then comes right back down okay that'll hit 12 points of damage okay he's still up doppeljenga you all hear doppeljenga what would you like to do fair enough vax comes charging around the corner percy comes skipping around the corner beautiful the doppelganger will take one more swipe at you yeah he's just furious 23 that'll hit you take 14 points of bludgeoning damage yep vax you get there quick that'll hit i will say because you and percy were up at the same time you get one attack one attack it hits a seven yeah got it all right percy you may do whatever you want he is bleeding a bunch just a slap a regular glove or with-- how about you roll an attack and add your strength modifier oh is there that hits yes he doesn't need to make a constitution saving throw because you slap him and his lower jaw just flies off of his face it just sprays purple gore all over vex and vax just this snowcone of gore no the way you came up and smacked him he went that way and trinket was like yeah nicely done you have removed this doppelganger so grog has been removed from your party it seems to be yep good nope you are now wrestling with the loss of clearly your favorite and strongest party member and we will take a break at this moment (yelling) we will return in a moment i wanted to thank also kristen mack made this wood burned dm's screen which is super super impressive this is

actually when vex strode up to this door that had the money symbol on it and she placed her hand on the handle one of those inlaid gems of the five lit up so now there are two lit up gems in the door as she's holding it it's yeah actually in your door all the jewels they are not lit up but if you explore other doors the more you drink the better you play no we're too far in it now we've formed an elite group here did you let go of the door did you would you like to grab the handle again fair enough you grab the handles and you see as three gems light up while two do not three of the five gems lit up all five gems light up you hear a lock release and the door with the weight of your hand on it starts to swing open you just walk in roll an investigation check apple juice yeah man yeah well i'm kind of doing grog 14 you look around the room you see no traps doesn't seem to be trapped in any way would you like to check the chest for traps roll an investigation check 18 does not appear to be trapped you can the chest opens no you open it and inside you see a small vial with a little liquid it looks like a greater healing potion during your investigation check of the room you see the rug the potted plant the chest the desk and the chair you also see above you in the ceiling it seems to be a hatch above you an iron hatch in the ceiling solid plate metal okay roll an investigation eight you look under the rug there is nothing under the rug you don't see any immediate traps you go over to check the desk nothing seems to be wrong with the desk however as you are checking your desk for traps you feel the slashing whip of twigs and thorns across your back as this twig blight has come across the room and attacks you from behind fair enough hold on he attacks first a 21 it does hit that is surprising you're going to take a whopping-- a whopping five points of piercing damage it's very hard to sustain this personality you turn and you start slashing can you give me an abc your might is clearly on display in this visceral and violent outburst oh indeed in the most glorious edward scissorhands movements you ever gestured there before you stands a very dead but green standing statuary of keyleth very much no longer a threat to you leaning against the wall yes you go to the chest it opens and inside you find a small vial greater healing potion which corner which corner when you aim at it your shoulders begin to burn ever so slightly no nope you can't tell cool you go in you walk in and you're facing backwards you fall down and it seems to be a very normal room okay you go forward and as you get to the trunk the mimic opens its mouth a pseudopod attacks you you become attached-- it has you and it does-- 16 points of damage it grabs you and it wraps up with its pseudopod and because you're so small you're now grappled and it covers your mouth so you cannot scream indeed you are grappled for the moment scanlan anyone else well don't be so excited about it it's a unique room you don't know what adventures lie inside so roll an investigation check see what happens your arm falls off it just falls off behind you no you come in the room you come in the room does not appear to be trapped you do sense movement somewhere in the room it's in front of you you're not sure right as you do the rug of smothering-- liam and --with its false appearance grapples you from behind and will attempt to smother you i just went to the monster manual it is a 21 to hit and you take-- that does hit you take 11 points of bludgeoning damage and you are restrained blinded and at risk of suffocating you cannot gesture make a sound or anything in your tiny little room percy what would you like to do you are in solid stone rooms you are at risk of suffocating yeah we didn't-- we have to do that you've got to tickle your earlobe when you talk yeah i mean you never know when it might come for you out here there is a hatch above you in the ceiling a plate metal hatch you back up roll to-- no fuck that it's a hatch you fire how many shots would you like to fire brilliant you fire off three quick shots-- no need to roll-- they all ricochet off of this-- oh all right that makes a difference you fire your first shot and while it ricochets off it starts bouncing around the stone room dangerously close to yourself you are so calm and cool and with that debonair percy charm you merely make a slight adjustment with your gun and you fire the door-- it hits and you see it start to crack and start to loosen from the wall a small piece of the hatch is now showing some visible line of sight between it and the ceiling you can hear him while you're talking the mimic in scanlan's room will again try to smother you with a bite attack while it's grappling you hold on i've got to add five seconds where's the music with advantage that is 24 points of damage where are you at vax your rug of smothering also begins to crush you again actually before this happens roll a strength check you don't need to roll your modifier that's enough you break free and the rug starts to shimmy down across your legs it's not smothering you anymore but it's still keeping you in place your arms are free and you can breathe while it is around your legs it will bite you for 21 points of damage not bite you crush you sorry it's still grappling you so you're in the same place still but you can breathe and you can move but it's still around your legs so you could breathe and not suffocate you technically no not important for you but your singing career would have been limited 21 points of damage and you are now free sure you take out the broom you fly up to the hatch-- sure trinket comes in plate metal a square piece of plate metal it is a plate metal hatch a sheet of metal with rivets and it's solid you cannot no no you could try and i could make you roll a bunch of times it wouldn't work roll a dice you pull on it and you hear (metal creaking) scanlan roll a strength saving throw 13 that's actually exactly what you needed you manage to get your arms free and you break free of the mimic but it is still coming at you now you see teeth coming out of this chest a giant pseudopod tongue go for it of what that is a 13 with that one lightning you see the mimic shake tense up quake and burst apart into purple goo it splatters little green noodles all over the floor where it was and you see in its muck a little vial where it was it's a greater healing potion yeah you chug it go for it that's it not help while he's healing vax what would you like to do nice you pop outside the door unleash armageddon do what you do now's the time mate you get 150 xp i am susceptible to puns right it's a rug and with that the rug quakes and falls flat deflated a regular rug now slightly unraveled at the corners indeed you hear all of a sudden as you check out the chest-- indeed there is a greater healing potion as vax terminates the rug you hear a click in all of the latches above your heads are you yeah there you are just flying right next to it you fire and the latch flips open at the top no response you may push on yours it lifts it comes right back down but lifts excellent you walk up the side of the wall doing the little shimmy that percy does so well in his bedroom when he's getting dressed in whitestone he pops through the hatch do you go up as well trinket goes in the necklace you go up through the hatch what about you two fellows right yeah into this tiny little dung beetle you fly you hit the hatch there was a click it didn't fucking open (popping) you take five points of stupid damage yeah you fall a whole ten 11 feet you take two points of gnome damage vax what are you doing wings yeah the fucking wings come out even though you're on the ground and you walk very badass back through the room brilliant you pop up through the hatch we'll shortly see scanlan what are you doing you come to and you're like fuck why did i turn into a dung beetle the latch was still closed a monkey what kind of monkey a small gibbon okay we'll find out you get up there and as you start to push roll a strength check with disadvantage this very large metal latch flies open you pop up through the latch as scanlan makes his gibbon way through the latch all of you find yourself in a new space and all of the latches slam closed you find yourself in a new space aren't i it resembles the shape of the previous map you find yourselves with a flat floor you have a visual line of sight with all of the members of your team you can see each other there's some sort of body laying above the area of the room with the door that was already open you are on what seems to be the roof of the room previous and there's a giant tower right in the middle of all of this at the top of this tower not to size there's a large platform dome area up here with light radiating out of it no nope it was a wedding gift who cares (laughter) you can try you start to walk over and as you reach this border you are struck by an invisible field and you take eight points of force damage as you hit the wall there is a shimmer of energy that quickly dissipates in between your section and someone else's it shimmers and disappears laura and as you move towards the column you see on this tower it is made of stone but there seem to be built-in footholds and handholds it appears the same energy covers that tower and you take eight points of force damage as percy touches and activates the shield for a second time the lights around you dim and you feel heat around each of you individually you are struck with horror as form begins to take shape in front of each of you behind percy all of a sudden the form of a mind flayer begins to take shape behind vax a red-skinned armor-clad winged demon appears a cambion right in front of our rogue in front of vex a pony and in front of scanlan materializes to his horror a fucking t-rex (laughter) a t-rex versus a gibbon you all stare in horror at perfectly picked enemies for you i need you all to roll initiative 23 that's the percy i know vex vax okay the cambion turns and faces vax at the top of the initiative and he will unleash his fire ray at you 26 to hit this is hard you take 12 points of fire damage sure so six nice and he will make a ranged spear attack against you it's only 19 the deer shoots-- the deer the deer bounds past-- the spear misses you as you are presented with this new foe and with a bonus action he will take flight but i'm not breaking out those fucking stands so let's just say he takes flight next in the initiative order this pony takes a few steps towards you and (snorting) and turns into a mystical unicorn (laughter) and it will cast entangle on you you have to make a dc 18 it is a dex you feel all of a sudden these vines come out of the stonework and it holds you where you are and it will charge straight at you using its magical horn 22 it does 12 points of piercing damage and i need to you roll a strength saving throw or be knocked prone by its mystical power i have no idea you're not knocked prone you sidestep it but you only take the damage percy you are up brilliant that will hit a natural one he is restrained you're so nasty melee attacks yeah no you have advantage i think if i overheard the guy at the tavern right yeah he has a very low ac all three hit please do all right next up vex just your feet you cannot move let me check because i'm sure i'm getting this totally right no i carve notes into the thingy yeah you just can't move he is top heavy let's go with option number two none of these guys want to stay up you're so drunk unicorn will use one of his legendary-- yep and he resists the grasping vine i know unicorns right fuck me are you a unicorn then how do you know are you arguing with the bm sure what language are you speaking in that's not a language i know these things it's what i do i drink and i know things well the unicorn speaks celestial elvish sylvan and telepathy but because you just spoke in common-- good thing it understands you-- it has telepathy and he's like i am a unicorn there can only be one (laughter) the t-rex will take its turn it is going to run towards you with a multi-attack on your carrion form it's going to make a bite attack first that is an 18 yeah oh god okay that is 36 points of damage does that knock you out of your carrion form it's a bite so you are in the jaws of a t-rex scanlan and we are going to make a tail attack against you oh it's only 18 to hit that is 28 points of damage as it smacks you with its tail next up vax okay that's an eight indeed it stands there not thinking much of you and a burst of fiery light surrounds his form all of a sudden you are very sure about where to hit and how 23 hits 48 massive points of damage shit damn cool sam scan lan you're up no it smacked you with its tail away it bit you and then it was like (spits out) and hit you with its ass extension i mean have you done that before great i should have that but i didn't plan that far ahead so we're going to turn you into this-- this giant werebear looking fucking thing there you go okay that's your turn okay the cambion is up and he's going to multi-attack against you 16 will miss 24 oh 18 nice he has one last-- 25 great you only get hit once though which is nice he hits you with this fiery spear that is 16 points of fire and piercing damage so four points of damage there you go brilliant he's going to use his movement to-- just right in your face look how big my wings are in comparison to yours it is now the unicorn's turn the unicorn rushes forward-- he is going to make two hooved attacks against you and a horn stabby in your face that's true 16 25 and the horn that hits because it's 27 that is 19 points of piercing and bludgeoning damage respectively and he will stay where he is he will try to stand up again for the brave-- (gasps) he's a show pony percy you're up oh yes sorry you did stabby the fuck out of him they all hit very hard yep he looks like he is quite surprised as to why he's there in the first fucking place and that you are-- he will react to that extra salvo (snarls) with all his stupid things he is going to use mind blast right at you i need you to roll an intelligence saving throw wasn't it you that he tried to suck the brain out of before yeah that doesn't happen at all cool good deal he is going to make a simple melee attack against you oh yeah he's restrained he's just like baffled by how dominant you are in this whole thing yeah he really wishes he wasn't here right now he's not sure who he pissed off vex you're up oh make a strength saving throw you break free of the vines and they wither and die in the ground great i roll don't i what is it that's a seven he's pulled back on his heinies speaks more languages than you do (hums) i mean on his turn he might how high looks like it's 120 feet to the top of the tower that's good at 40 feet you are hovering up at the top of the tower and you hear somewhere above you a buzz of energy i don't know how many this is well they're over here so fuck it how's this shit work what was wrong with the first way i was doing this here you're flying 40 feet in the air sam make that work oh here there's a base over here i'm sure there's a certain number of things you've got to count but-- that's really high you hear a buzz of energy above you but you seem to be fine scanlan no vax no t-rex t-rex charges forward towards the triceratops nurturing its ancient rivalry with such a foe it will make a multi-attack it will bitch slap you with its tail 25 for 23 points of bludgeoning damage and it will make a bite attack against you 21 4d12 plus seven i suck at subtraction math adding i'm okay that is 37 points-- of piercing damage good oh you're a triceratops you're all sorts of muscled up nice vax it is your turn he's just going to be like (grunts) as you go to cast faerie fire you see it disperse along the barrier wall between your section and his unaffected 23 hits he's looking very rough scanlan your turn a two the triceratops runs forward no effect (laughs) that's what the triceratops has got okay the cambion getting its ass handed to it by vax will look him in the face and it will cast command at-- let's say fourth level you need to roll a constitution saving throw 15 not good he commands you to grovel in front of him and all of a sudden you feel this overwhelming urge you drop to your knees and you lay prone right in front of him not able to get up i'm a fan of puns you get ten xps he will have advantage on his flaming spear attack against you it was advantage 39 points of piercing and fire damage which is halved well i don't know let's call it 20 down to 20 let's call it 19 points good deal there you are next up is the unicorn having heard your humanitarian pleas for peace-- casts levitate kidding he doesn't have levitate why did i move him he's there the unicorn who's stuck which i totally forgot about will use ooh yes teleport he casts teleport once a day he magically teleports himself within five feet of where he was poof (laughter) no any willing creatures within five feet but that's what i saw first so that's the rule it can go up to a mile away but it's five feet (laughter) that is a 23 that is 22 points of damage that ends its turn percy you are up nope you take it like a champ that hits if those two hit just roll damage for those two he's looking pretty gross with the sword right as you take your silvered sword and repeatedly jam it into his general thorax and face repeatedly-- tentacles falling off like freshly cut sushi he just falls backwards guts spewing like stephen king's the thing he is toast as you walk to the wall you notice that there seems to be no force field on your side of the tower oh you tapped this one i got you you seem to see no effect vex you better attack this fucking unicorn i need you to make an acrobatics check you plummet falling toward its head and at the last moment having been affected by your wonderful message it looks up and you find yourself impaled gored on its horn it even jumps up and spins you will take jeez 18 points of piercing damage you just manage to roll off the horn laying on your back across its mane not riding it but just there for the moment you're on your back in a very uncomfortable arched position the t-rex turns tail whip that is 26 points of bludgeoning damage and the bite attack against you-- oh shit fuck oh 17 okay that is 39 points of piercing damage oh yeah vax you are prone and up an asshole for an asshole that hits jesus you're very good at adding all those dice for someone who's never played this game before i'll take it oh god any other attacks after that yep hits and with that the dagger pierces through the armor and you hear (snarls) as a spurt of black blood comes out of its mouth its wings fall to the side and it's like how did you and falls over dead scanlan you're up oh yeah where is scanlan six yes in fact you see ripples of energy just going out and you start to smell fried alligator he falls 50 feet 25 damn it he's barely-- (groans) oh really so each round he'll take more of that energy damage fair enough the unicorn feeling this upside-down half-elf on his back shakes you off sure roll an athletics check with disadvantage well there you go you fall-- yeah there you go (laughter) the unicorn comes over and begins to smell the fallen half-elf you showed me great respect vex'ahlia your kindness will live throughout the ages all the unicorns will be told of your mercy and it kneels down and touches its horn to the ground and all of the enemies disappear you also see a similar shimmer disappear from the barriers and you can see the stones on the tower even more clearly than ever before like stones yes percy you get over and you see what seems to be some sort of humanoid figure roll a perception check you see tattered clothes but you also see slashes and big gashes and flesh peeling back there's also bits of hair multicolored and big gashes in the floor there's tons of gore but it does appear as if whatever this was was mauled by something almost very close to your own very similar yeah because they do that you come over and you're like those are fucking clothes old brigade navy and you know all sorts of stuff that you kind of recognize but not really yeah you bamf trinket out of the necklace and he's like whoa unicorn piss and he goes right back in the necklace because i don't know where he went-- there he is he's out yeah roll the whatever that is he's got that yeah go for it advantage style what did you roll it on purpose no you've got to roll it on purpose how do you do that trinket takes the meat and just starts gobbling it down trinket comes over and he begins sniffing the body and he does recognize some of the scent it's almost that of an animal like perhaps another bear or a wolf even some sort of animal scent on the body right then trinket (groans) and this little hairball covered in mucus comes out (bear dry heaving) (laughter) that's what our dachshund does trinket takes 27 points of poison damage hold on so trinket (groans) face first ass up in the air and goes back into your necklace trinket heals 15 points do you leave him out well i had the worst stomachache i don't know i ate that meatball from scanlan and then i fucking died i don't want to make any assumptions but-- (laughter) how does that shit work you've got the card right scanlan make a deception check he really doesn't know he doesn't know what trinket's talking about just roll a wisdom saving throw you do believe him he doesn't know he seems quite flummoxed over trinket's sudden-- you're interrupted by an explosion from the top of the tower a sound of noise (deep humming) a flash of light your attention is directed to the top of the tower what do you do it seems to have dissipated fly up spider walk climb athletics checks for percy and scanlan yeah athletics four plus three plus four that's good great as percy is walking up the tower he trips and falls into the tower and smashes his face and stands back up with his boots you take eight points of smash-your-face damage scanlan you fall after about 15 feet you take eight points of bludgeoning damage you start climbing back up to the tower you all reach the top it has a very similar-- just ignore that whatever and there in the middle is your friend grog he's like guys i knew you would come and find me i mean one second we were all in the tavern and then all of a sudden it went hazy you won't believe what i've had to go through there was a big hallway with a ghost and then there were all these monsters roll an insight check you can tell that grog is telling the truth i had to walk through all these things and i came to this door and i saw a star and i recognized the star on the door as the symbol of the dallas cowboys and i went in and i found a healing potion and i had to go up there was this thing up there and i had to kill it and when i did there was like a zoo i was in there were all these other creatures and these partitions and i'm here i'm so glad-- did you teleport here or plane shifty you didn't fight your way here did you you didn't go through the rooms i don't want to fight you you hear a voice echo from above you as you see a cloaked levitating figure take form a female voice shouts out i need a hero i need a hero until the end of the night he's got to be strong he's got to be fast he's got to be fresh from the fight and you see trish the dish floating above the platform trish the god of whitestone looking down and saying i need one of you to be my champion it's pretty close you should hear her in church awful you see now as grog shakes his head goes into a rage and i need you all to roll initiative natural 20 you watch as grog goes into a rage and you see a hesitation he doesn't want to attack his friends he looks down at his arm and you see there similar scrapes cuts gashes as you saw on the corpse below he looks up grins and lets out a ferocious howl as he transforms into werewolf grog destiny fulfilled the time has come he charges forward he races towards percy and will make a reckless great weapon master attack 26 that is 27 points of damage minus five 20 24 points of damage that will end grog's turn actually he'll stay there because he's within melee range next up percy is that dex i'll look also thunderwave constitution saving throw nope jesus i know i hate the ones that have math i'm already ten feet away good that's so casual okay vex you're up trinket's going to run up 22 hits 12 you notice as you do all this damage of the physical variety it's not doing as much damage as you thought it might he's restrained a raging werewolf and remember grog has all damage halved sure advantage kick up on the broom and fly up nice job scanlan how many hit points do you have bigby's hand comes out crunch 24 as you hit grog with bigby's hand you see the pain ripple through his body and the wolf form fades painfully you see his wounds are all quite evident he is already quite hurt from his struggles up the tower he takes a knee and says i'm hideous i thought i really wanted to be like this but i'm not sure it's all it's cracked up to be percy you have a silvered sword end it wait you're not really going to do it are you fuck i was kidding jesus oh my god we did but i wanted to see if you'd go through with it hold on let me get my courage up roll to attack 26 will hit it doesn't matter the silvered sword sinks into grog's chest he goes thank you you dark motherfucker and grog falls over you hear (laughs) as trish the dish above in her robes says i see a champion has fallen you four hmm interesting another time then and she evaporates from the air you find yourselves instantly transported back to the tavern with grog's bloodied body on the table pouring everywhere and the poor old innkeeper going oh my god you're going to have to pay for that he dies timothy what has the story taught you how much you care and need grog the mystic werewolf powers within him will regrow even in an unconscious state any hair that you shave and the sun rises on yet another day is there a dc save against persistent gonorrhea you roll a d20 and i'll roll a d20 ready one two three eight persistent the rest of her cursed life and that will bring an end to our game it really was good right it's not as good as the long-haired guy in the tavern down the way if you want to see a real chapter you should see him no i didn't it was something like bursar or cathew i missed it yeah he's a champ but think about what you want to do differently next time that was-- from a strategic-- i'm a genius at tactics percy i like what you did scanlan nicely done a do-ron-ron i'm a little bit tired because that was a three and a half hour game right in that sweet spot who has the most xp i have a bonus 500 xp to give but you have to guess my favorite color percy guessed it it's six it was so good i had to give it to you i'm going to bed good night and that's it (cheering) you find in the distance the t-rex and the unicorn find each other and start a new magical hybrid race well that was awful that math is impossible as well as keeping track of that shit i don't know how he keeps track of all that stuff it's a mess yeah it's a big struggle it is a stroogle i suffer from the same problem sam had i think i had a bit too many enemies okay good well for those that stayed with us thank you that would be my first and probably only foray into being a
