can call me fjord that's not necessary sure captain fjord works this is caleb yasha walks over and bends over at the hips and puts her eyes right in front of twiggy i like her she walks away sure yeah i can tell that's my emotion fair enough how old is she aren't you worried that her parents are wondering where she is or her family we're in the middle of the ocean jester i'm actually from port damali well howdy there what a coincidence this is so crazy are you trying to get anywhere in particular i understand that wow okay wow were you by yourself twiggy there's no one else we have to worry about pissing in the corner of the boat do we who's trixie who are you talking to a rodent what the fuck is that goddamn chinchilla what is it i don't trust squirrels they're tree rats you just keep it to yourself jester can i put you in charge of keeping an eye on twiggy twiggy we're going to the bisaft-- what is it bisaft isle i don't know if you're familiar with that area we need some repairs and then hopefully you can find your way from there caduceus could you make sure that she gets some real food interest intensifies that is heavily disarming it's like the worst controller you've ever picked up at your friend's house you're like oh chocolate and cheetos and all sorts of shit 15 eight four well i think we'll take her to the island and then obviously give her a chance to continue her adventure well now jester look i loved kiri as much as the next person so much just mm yeah so great but i also don't want to be responsible for anyone that can't take care of themselves she made a what are we forgetting to describe things that are of import on this ship she did what i wanted to see a caleb laugh so bad oh my god like some horrible crash okay so she's not entirely invalid what that's right jester you would not want guilt over bringing in sweet twiggy here to what could be certain doom that's what we do we seek out certain doom yeah tell the truth now well you said you got that nice little sphere there anything else we should know about maybe fun ball of tricks yes i will not forget again anything else we should know about that people might wish they had instead of you caduceus had it last oh great jester i'm going to leave you in charge of twiggy all right we've got to make for this island you keep an eye on her i don't want to see any chocolate thumbprints in my quarters you understand twiggy okay all right you're in charge yeah of course feel free to lend a hand no you're not the only one i don't trust that shit that saccharine yeah you need some salt to balance that shit out what's a pomeranian maybe we throw her overboard when you were down there with her did she try any shady shit right okay yes apparently yes yes i will are you up for it lot of responsibility you've got to like co-sign for the boat and shit shake on it all right first mate ah fucking cobalt grip it's all right i'm kind of immune now i just take it i feel so special (burbling) that's my call (burbling) forward deck we need to change it to the balleater as quickly as possible nott i need you to hang over the side of the ship with a paintbrush-- -- inches above the water and change the name of the ship to the balleater can you do it on who i thought it was on me i was like (yelps) you're a temporary pirate now it's a great honor don't mess it up what were you saying yeah i was going to say we probably took stock of any colors we have that we can run up that aren't associated with the squalleater we still have some fire damage on the boat though we're going to play that our flag was burned get the fuck out of here what that's so old is it only 800 i thought it was 8000 oh no your hands i'll be showing beau the ropes first-manning the ship oh my god shit i totally fucking forgot about that the first time we got on the boat i don't think we were here no that's a kill shot oh that's right oh shit upgrade instant death kiss of death it's just black yeah i'll come running down yeah what is it you don't have to announce it when you show up don't yell your superiority we'll get you a shirt or something rope i got 100 feet of rope put your hand in there i'm reach down and put the tip of my finger in the hole just feels cool (yells) like a person-sized hole oh my goodness you must have proved yourself greatly we vote on the name every couple of months but it's going to be a while well she needs a hat every pirate needs a hat same size i'm sure it'll be fine i think so too but you've got to do it quick because it's going to stop real quick do it do it yeah it's been about twice a minute each time jester and beau boulder-parchment-shears figure out who's going to put their head in and help us see it i'll grab onto her britches as she's doing it down to her feet do i look the same start speaking in latin there's a watermark up here i can see it it's amazing oh i don't believe matt i don't believe it we've got to figure out what all this stuff is first i mean just so it's not a pole and a pair of shitty boots with that symbol on the back have any of us heard that name before archibald or-- beau when you hit that buffer did it feel hard and solid or was it soft and earthen did you find a portal into somebody's wardrobe well at least it's the same place each time so if it does close off we at least know how to find you you're going in yeah you're really good at finding stuff when she was yelling on the other side of the portal was there any sound that came between the two between the portal nothing or if you're ready to come back tug twice on the rope really you're so brave you're full of shit aren't you as a note the previous function of the sphere we can access or is it one function at a time as it changes how'd you escape it sounds real familiar i have a plus ten green light's never good and they never come back how many times did you mess with it like six what's it do what's it do (explosion) all four symbols are the same on all four banners not in the middle matthew (singing) i want to be by the corpses let it build as caleb flies backward i'll summon the falchion and take a defensive stance did the burst that came from the blue make it all the way across the room to the green it just detonated on the other tapestry in the haversack right i'll do it yeah who are the locals oh yeah forgot you can do that which one the one closest to you yeah ditto that shit yes thank you taliesin no i'm trying to put it on does it fit i'm fucking fit okay that is an excellent way to try and figure out what the fuck's going on in here an observation deck you know it's just a thought but if we have to open two of these that are facing each other at the same time so they destroy each other we'll probably have to drop that down we'll get there i like it what about sound that is really resourceful where did her gum come from yeah yeah yeah yeah me too do it you don't need that hand you got another one ooh shit red doors are bad proceed why can i search the pockets of the red coat seven no pockets well we haven't pulled the black curtain back yet yeah we're fine well we're not going anywhere in here who wants to come with jester nott y'all okay they just turn on you that fast okay yeah i'll follow twiggy thanks jester that was well used my man as we turn around and look at the door that we came back through are there any markings above the door or around it 20 no 19 twiggy 50 feet behind everyone else i'll go after jester (vomiting) (laughter) 21 i'm not looking at your notes i'm just looking through the wall caleb passes out you say the stained glass window was on which wall gotcha thank you i'll climb up the ladder and get just under the stained glass window can i see through the glass or at the glass or is it above me you and your damn loft positions taliesin what's that ah ah okay then 15 yeah a small ruby circle does it blink shine shimmer move confused by its location i'm gonna touch it yep because i do stupid shit why does he got to describe it and make it sound so interesting what about me matt i'm going to do it 19 you're not going to whale on this cabinet bro may be taliesin's i love it when the dm describes something as too realistic would the cabinet have a french accent when it talked i have been here for so long (whispering) probably not important (as fjord) what's your name (as grog) what's your name what a fucking bunch of idiots we are it's so good and then there were three just the two next to that one oh shit natural one (high-pitched) i'm okay i'm a fucking sailor i'm okay i miss grog i apologize (laughter) if you would simply point towards the exit i would be most obliged can i be entirely honest with you i have recently been putting my hands where they don't belong this time it sent me to you probably to look and not touch well you know i do have a very salty variety myself i'll summon the falchion in my hand now listen i don't want to disturb you any further i'm just going to see myself out stage left over here you have a nice day and enjoy your vast fortune i'll start to walk towards that left tunnel where'd you get that impression natural one yeah small tears that's funny i've actually heard that name before halas we saw some of his belongings before you devour me like a tiny little shrimp would you mind a small request in letting me know who that person was i am charismatic (squealing) 23 natural 19 cool when there are six others seven others (panicked mumbling) an arrangement you and he how does he send you these i assume incredible gifts i don't want to bring up a touchy subject but i feel like your friend might be dead manor are we in a house jeez you know i hate to leave you without a friend i mean if this guy's up and left you high and dry maybe i could offer my services 14 i was trying to draw that shit out-- you have no idea how happy i am to see you dragon damn it ooh i started to take a step to the left while facing the dragon did he 16 why do warlocks only have two fucking spell slots right now i'm going to focus on the dragon because my friends are here and i'm going to cast blink it is not and with my bonus action i will set hexblade's curse on that blue dragon all right no blink was my action oh i do i roll yep that is 11 just hope it listens to what you say it lights up this place for you big time fifty-fucking-five (screaming) oh matthew i'm sorry i touched the window boom ah 17 misses get me the fuck out of here we're level seven why did we do this yeah that was a good gamble we're all bouncing the monk's like really ten feet closer to the end of the hallway i will use all 30 feet of my movement to head toward the end to see what the fuck's down here did i learn anything i don't know what to do i'll turn around and i'll fire two eldritch blasts at the dragon i hope that'll fucking hit that is a 24 great second one is 23 oh great that's 16 points of eldritch blast and 12 points of eldritch no you don't you do four shit (screams) what's that i did yeah the plus three to each time they were manly screams you got it so good nott and caleb i'm down here now going (screaming) it burned up around it and didn't do anything god what do i do cast armor of agathys on myself and smash my head into the crystal it's cold damage i'm going to cast armor of agathys on myself at 4th level (laughter) (laughing) i smash my head into the crystal can i use my movement now to run up towards the tunnel where caduceus is in the direction that the light moved if i roll less than an 11 on blink does the spell end or is it every turn okay great well apparently i am fucking terrified i shit my pants and i can't blink hope it's home yeah assume 55 points'll miss it's just a dragon and a fire elemental yeah take your time that is my armor class okay that's reduced by-- oh how much-- that makes it simple is it looking rough real rough pieces of his ribs showing through but look how cute she is you're going to what i take 1d10 fire damage right okay i will use my movement to-- where the fuck am i to run towards the pedestal actually i'm sorry let's come this way to jester (repeatedly) uh-huh let me take back half that movement and i'll go here i'm going to-- i can't bail on jester i'm going to fire two eldritch blasts at the dragon trying to get its attention 25 and a 22 seven points of eldritch blast ten so 17 total 21 do i have to roll blink if i don't-- but i think doesn't it take an action or i can just choose it says you can dismiss this spell as an action bye (groaning) come on when you come back remember it's ten feet from where-- it's looking hurt oh yeah there's nobody in there it's bad (laughter) oh fuck walks out of the wall oh you fucking crazy goth genius yes you do i pop back into existence ten feet i want to stay out of his melee yeah and i'll use my extra language to go yeah it's bad grab the sphere i'll use my full movement to run towards the sphere if it will put me in his melee-- will it i will use my bonus action misty step with the sword to (poof) over to the globe i will reach out and touch someone okay it's the worst playroom ever and you can choose mercy kill we are best friends my heart rate is literally like i've been running two miles get the fuck out you've done enough you did enough don't do it oh my god you had one after the 18 please tell me the dragon can't touch the sphere the intro's been up one week the animation takes a long time who's hurting real bad no nobody-- what are the rules of drinking hard liquor on twitch nott you took that with 19 hit points yeah roll that shit caduceus where are we marius do me a favor just tell us how much repairs cost and let's all settle in for the night we're going to-- still on fire we're going to need it yeah 130 gone how many matt and well let's just call that lesson learned yeah maybe we should all reconnoiter in the morning the good news is is that if twiggy actually killed the dragon-- which you obviously did-- we can go back yeah it sounded bad when it came out as an honorary member of the mighty nein just do us a favor and make sure you tell your story far and wide yeah make good life choices she's leaving us it's the best life choice yep right i'd say something about that that doesn't kill you makes you stronger but i feel pretty fucking weak right now that was a dragon that little crazy ball o' fun is a troublemaker just like twiggy maybe we just leave that particular function alone for a while and collect some gold to recoup our repair costs oh shit yeah if a big blue finger comes through the hole we'll know twiggy lied i'm going to go get rid of this concussion now all right first mate you got the con (groans) yeah that's awesome
