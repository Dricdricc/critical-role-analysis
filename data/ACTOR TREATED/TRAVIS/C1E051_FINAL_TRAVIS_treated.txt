know how well this is working-- just a pro-tip vax what would you say is the number one thing to keep in mind when fighting someone like me my cousin your cousin i mean the one i recognize because i the only one i've met giant eagles okay i'm gonna go find a perch on the other side of the gate and i'm gonna find a nice little sniper's nest i'm assuming you have some clan members who might be druids do you know you're speaking really smart right now and it's confusing me (laughing) make sure you're hiding keyleth i want to stealth i kind of want to hunker down against the wall and stealth (heavy breathing growling) (laughing) stonejaw (laughing) two of them of that group start stepping backwards while the two guards that were stationed at the gate they just go cut him down and they go into a run through the rest of the ten fifteen-foot area around the center part of the gate out into the main area out front as they begin stepping (mimics footsteps) watching in the distance you notice one foot crumbles through and all of a sudden the second foot and the earth begins to just tumble out from underneath two of them three of them four of them five of them all begin just the first line the first two groups weren't even paying attention and focused on you as they charged through they all begin to tumble inside-- yes the uh of the last four two of them manage to stop in time to kind of catch themselves of all the ones that fell though the ones in front who originally got caught have no saving throw they just plummet screaming down-- two managed not to fall that means toast for any of us yes we did something right low moans of pain barely echoing up from underneath as the other ones like they grab the arms of the ones that are hanging over-- are they clustered they're clustered in yeah ah i want to take two-- i'm taking two where's my english trick shot push shots okay go for it wow all right that will make them not too happy and your turn all right throwing one dagger okay and it's advantage in hiding and it is 27 to hit that hits even with the cover and it's a sneak attack and a surprise so it's a crit right 'cause i'm hidden underneath shit 'cause she hid us (singing) let the eagle soar it swoops down and the talon strikes you the talon's pushing you forward that is gonna be a 20 your ac yeah that hits all right you suffer nine points of piercing damage as its claws dig into you and attempt to throw you from the top of the wall suda he's gonna not quite as-- oh god it's been so long since i used the (laughing) uh that's 17 so the last attack was 18 plus 2 points of the fire damage for 20 for 20 nice misses misses that is a 24 oh tiny dancer you are fucked (laughing) the pit it might be i think it's like 30 feet i can't remember or maybe it's 20 i can't remember it's a little less than that we'll see drag him i'd like to do that don't say it (laughing) misses i look over and say sit down son before you hurt yourself (laughing) it's a 1 (laughing) misses (laughing) it's contested with your athletics oh and i have to roll an athletics check yeah (laughing) okay as you're holding him there he goes you'll find out won't you i take his neck and i smash my head into his nose it just breaks and crumbles his face is partially caved in and you can see blood just running rapidly out of his nostrils where his bones were you won't be there to watch my discovery are they in the city yeah they're waiting for you good i'll let you fly now and i kick him into the pit (laughing) come on baby oh fuck stay on that trail if i see you again and you ain't got a dead gnome in your hands i'm gonna cut that head from its shoulders all right you have my word we're gonna do-- see ya later (laughing) strange one all right and two of them head back as one of them just kind of keeps their distance behind you guys following you as you travel you dart into the next alley kaylee's like  come on come on and as you guys duck into the shadows everyone's pace quickens to the center of this alleyway where there is it seems like a large stack of partially emptied crates that contain like broken pieces of furniture it's essentially a small dump in the area nothing food or you know refuse-wise but there's definitely like this is a a graveyard for broken furniture but in the center there is a small cylindrical stone protrusion and a grate on top and kaylee runs up quick quick help me get this open at which point-- doctor dr dranzel comes forward and goes let me take care of this which is funny cause dr dranzel looks just like himself but just all covered in (laughing) facepaint you can't see his hat it's he's kind of enjoying this persona for a moment he goes (spits grunts) and strains as he pulls upward straight natural 20 (cheers) does he strain throws it aside-- everyone can beat doors but us (laughing) and don't you forget it so inside yes go go go and they all start climbing in dranzel and kaylee are helping get the peasants down inside first at which point the one that was following you guys turns the corner in the alleyway and starts approaching from behind this is the guy with the long black and grey beard you where are you going that gnome again one of us saw him go down this sewer we're following i'm gonna have to come back and report this i don't trust it hold on one second and i'm gonna cast hold person on him anything we just gotta go in dammit i'm gonna start making my way on the rooftops towards the center of the town i'm like i'm heading in i'm keeping to the roof if i'm going to take any shots i'll try and take them quietly i fly up and i-- i go along the roofline with him i fly up on the broom and then i land on the rooftop and stealth okay it's at this point in time you see the two giant eagles the ones that took keyleth off earlier as you come up on your broom it kind of sees you (screech) dang girl it's like softball right i'm just waiting you guys watch as she just goes (falling sound thud) (laughing) like there's a little-- gonna ring that bell are you i'm gonna take a gonna take a wing shot keyleth runs towards the girl who fell if you miss we move soaked in what she made her choice (laughing) well i'm gonna start rooftopping towards the center if i see anything interesting going on in the city i wanna stop and investigate ditto sneaking from rooftop to rooftop if i can can i do a bit of-- i'm gonna do that for sure can i use acrobatics you this more of a this isn't acrobatics this is more of a jump because there are large large city street gaps that are like 25 to 30 feet good job scanlan mission accomplished yes thank you thank you are there buildings it's so good to see you we should get inside for a moment we should is there a wine cellar or door or something that we can beat in or a window there are windows you don't see a wine cellar in the immediate vicinity of this alleyway can i look in the window first yeah you go ahead and glance in make a perception check i see nothing it's a 2 yeah they were dragging everyone out of every available door and dragging them to the city the center of the city why yeah yeah it's like a thousand (laughing) what time is it perfect last question i have do we know where wilhand's residence used to be we thought about seeing if maybe we could get to wilhand's house if we go to the center of town - yeah i'm not really thinking that far ahead that's not that house no the margrave's house is the one that's in the town square and that's where kevdak apparently has taken as his homestead right and that's not the description so we have to start this now are we prepared there are pluses and minuses to both thoughts they have a bunch of innocent people who they may just start killing here's my question if we wait will they ever theoretically let them go or is it easier to just slit their throats no they won't do it for no reason they don't even know where we are take a short rest if you want to all right let's take a short rest and we'll finish fleshing out this plan mile and a half yeah about a 20 25 minute walk north from where you are right now it's a little ways a little ways west of noja's old store and yeah it's about 25 minutes would you like to go first and see if he's there i'm good either way we're okay well so if we cut off the head of the snake there's no issue (sighs) let's do it let's go towards-- and he is a very powerful cleric if we do find him so it would be nice to have some extra help he may already be there and if he's i feel like we should go town because that's a lot more people than one person is his house near where we're going or no you don't need to i do have a question nah never mind are you attuned out maybe the ac goes to 21 hello we believe in you okay i'm going to cast aid i can't lose we're good okay everyone's good just walking through all right jesus you grab her pull her back draw the blade across the throat with a slight muffling sound she begins to bleed out still fighting and tensing against your body seeing that i'll switch my spell to the halfling (laughing) not necessary on the elf anymore that's the myth carver it's one d8 plus three you lot are so funny you know i think i saw something running behind that pile of horse shit over there if you want to check it out too (laughter) silence no response recognize any of those heads well it would be such a shame it seems all of you would be missing out on the greatest show of your life you see in this bag i carry the very thing that will topple the mighty kevdak you know what i remember i remember a herd that nations used to part for i remember a herd that towns used to quake and run from i remember a herd that was so proud and dangerous they would never hole up in a shit-stick city like this but what do i see when i come here kevdak prancing up in a place like this and what bending the knee to a dragon how far you have fallen now if you have any honor in you at all you'll take me to kevdak and you will see what i have for him and then maybe just maybe you can call yourselves warriors again instead of piss pot squatters there's a moment of pause as all the goliaths who are approaching have stopped in their tracks you can see their neck muscles tensing as they're kind of ringing their fingers across the handles of their various weapons at this point greenbeard takes a moment and (laughs evilly) you sound like your cousin zanror the two of you enjoy a night drinkin' in the hole but sure you want to go ahead and talk to the big man let's see you say that to his face before he crushes it call him out thunder lord you've a visitor 17 17 (dramatic music) as you guys begin this fray no trinket yes trinket what are you doing trinket is staying in 18 oh 17 is the wisdom saving throw for that one do you remember if that one is a-- and it did hey man at least i can say i didn't die without it working once okay they do hit where the fuck is it oh there it is 10 15 23 23 oh 23 plus five so 28 with the fire damage on the first one and the second one 17 17 okay as you slam whack whack with the flaming war hammer twice into the oversize kevdak's chest each hit hits but kevdak is just barely pushed back by each and the damage even the fire damage seems to be taken down by his raging capabilities the impacts aren't doing as much damage as you hoped they would hits second one 28 to hit again with the minus five reduced reduced by half so that brings it to 27 plus an additional ten points of necrotic damage that you do not reduce which i get advantage on yep i'll do that yeah that'll hit (laughter) okay not great weapon master but it's 30 so it's going to do an additional superiority die of damage on top of this nine eight plus two necrotic so 10 total and i need you to go ahead and make a strength saving throw that's my ac i was not expecting that he was so much more powerful than what yeah i was not expecting that i think it's going well i think we've got him right where i want him
