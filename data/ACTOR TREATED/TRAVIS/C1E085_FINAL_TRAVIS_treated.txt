don't say anything i'm just really stoked that i actually got him (everyone laughs) could i marisha couldn't hurt the rest of us either i was thinking initially i'd like to remove one of his five hits that he takes on me but four who gives a shit okay attack with disadvantage that's not that great oh regular attack yeah 22 i've still got him grappled at least that's it yeah let's just assume that i picked him up i'm just holding him grappled or am i squatting hugging santa's little helper he closes his eyes i still have him grappled i still want to try to get him to the ground i want to try and get him prone can i try a leg wrap so i'm gonna wrap my right leg around his and dive forward trying to push him off-balance on to his back okay 24 great great when he's prone do i get advantage on attacks great great weapon master dwarven thrower and i say i want to know the answer to the lesson (everyone laughs) okay 35 plus the enlarge damage uh 28 minus five 23 9 24 34 38 (laughs) no i would

make all three attacks reckless great weapon master (laughing) i don't know any better i don't know oh is there a small fart at least yep it's not even like something to be proud of just a little squeaker (scottish accent) a little turtle head poking out (normal voice) so i'm stunned-- cool i look back and do this yeah i have no healing anythings i do if i short rest but that's it all right-- how far can i throw this fucking thing long range of 60 feet the long range of 60 feet means that it would be a disadvantage throw that's not great yeah yeah let's be honest could i get to him in 50 feet yeah i'd like to try god i just wanna keep staring back at him but i don't-- there's no point to it i can't do anything it's not like i can psych him out or-- yeah going for broke again reckless
