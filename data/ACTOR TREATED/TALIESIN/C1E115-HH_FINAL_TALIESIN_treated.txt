honey badger don't need any lip vegas are you sure you can maneuver this thing you seen something like this before this thing looks complicated liam and bigger than a honeypot i put my honey in the

flammable here's a question how do you spell sun kissed and i can't read i don't feel good about that careful kids they've got sticks it's a far side cartoon just go with it did the cow just drop his

singing voice who would've thunk it the slayer's take's got to have fingers in dozens of bakeries all over town their honey pots are sweet yeah there was a honey pun that's good yeah what are the notes man do i still got a scent on it yeah it's this way bring the cart around i was going to roll but first i was going to think about the last time we were in a tricky situation like this no i remember we were doing a roll through whitestone there was high alert we were trying to book our way through the main square towards that big tree the tree can give you a little coverage but not nearly enough that cart came by and we kept walking right behind the horses on the cart no one suspected a thing they were sitting there minding their own business making noise like bears look out bears they didn't see a damn thing coming ba-da-bing can i get a point of criminal flashback you go bear to criminal honey criminal to bear don't know why i'm still-- boy sweet syrup i got me an idea

someday we're all going to look back on this and laugh right there are they eating the hat honey don't eat the hat honey (sniffs) i don't know i have no real perception of distance that is actually capable of being communicated to a bunch of other bears it's close no it's like two glens tops it's close a glen maybe half a hill and a dale i am genuinely so pleased that all of this is happening yeah and if you've got time tomorrow night we got the confirm that we're going to be singing and drinking on gather your party tomorrow night so we're going to be having a pub sing you get to hear me sing our cloaks our hats a fez of explosive honey whoa one just one i know you've got four just one you apparently don't like them (sniffs) i'm trying to pinpoint the location of the honey i think we've come to the right place yeah don't tell me how to do my business can i hack the mainframe (laughter) i do it no my whole face is in the pipe oh there's a firewall they've got a firewall i don't think they got me no we're going to keep it very safe i think we've got to go around the side i think that's our best bet it's deep inside they've got it definitely under heavy security i don't know maybe we finally heard one success more than half tie-breaker honey absolutely burns hey we're all hungry we all want some honey some of us want some bamboo-- that's weird but that's okay you're the smallest just take a look never happened before that's very old for a honey badger ah the marisha no fucks given voice what the fuck do you need motherfucker he's doing something we almost made it dollars we're on either side i'm going to push against the side of the wall i'm going to try and very slyly snatch his earring in the commotion i may hack the ear try to hack the earring i'm going to try and grab it and put it on my ear with hacker advantage going for it no i fail i had totally forgotten that there was any relation no this is like captain planet you're heart yeah we're getting everything is it digital slayer's cake everything biscuit we've got to get in i want to take a look at that security room use him to prop the door closed all mead is honey mead i want to take a look at this weird security system that they have here with all these mirrors are they viewing other rooms isn't it though isn't it kind of fucking important really i think i can hack these mirrors i want them to run a loop i want to throw them on a loop i'm going to mime keyboarding but in doing so it's going to somehow affect a magical spell yeah double two motherfucking honey barrels we hit the mother lode i'm starting to believe we're clear what wow this is insane no i get it this will definitely not come in useful at all this is useless and dumb and i can't wait to do it ready for an eggo waffle i've upgraded to eggo never better that i can't tell you but i bought us some time the last thing he saw before going unconscious were panda testicles at full speed as he screams-- that's the most useful panda testicles have been in a long time i'm just going to point that out no one looks up do i smell honey in the kitchen the grog strongjaw of the northampton strongjaws i don't know why i went there he looks big quick question which plan comes first is it plan a or plan c that makes sense i don't know what that means does that mean that a young jason charles miller looks like a honey badger in a cowboy hat is it a door or a gate can we see past i can't see any honey i've got an idea you've got a tiny bottle of honey you've got a tiny bottle of honey right wasn't someone given a teeny-tiny bit of honey it'll do i'm going to look around are there cups or something around i put a little bit of the honey into the empty pint i'm going to try and toss the cup past grog into the pantry quietly no i want to throw the cup into the pantry will that wake him up i'm going to stare at the cup i just threw i don't get advantage i just have to roll for it right one i'm going to start figuring out if i can open this pantry door i'm quietly working the pantry door to try and get downstairs i didn't think much past this considering that bears can have very stealthy picnics-- i've got a plan to get us in this door we've got to move what number am i thinking of she can't hear us it's fine works for me we've already taken care of the security camera there will be nothing on twitter other than bear puns that's some hot pee man i don't know it looks a little weird i can try and hack it i'm going to try and hack one one can i find an off switch and click it hacked it cookie let's see the spoils of our work it's really about honey oh my god what is wrong with you yeah i'm into it what the hell are they singing i have never been so proud of you why do i always get a warped one you're a disappointment to everybody everything we've worked for it's all honey from here on out just honey everything let's grab the honey and run i'm grabbing honey we'd better move i'm going to create a distraction let's get this honey out into the cart right now i'm going to do the same as well i've got this guys are you pee shy i have something i can do but it's not going to be pretty i take the fez of honey and i throw it at the bearracuda no no i don't know what not throwing a hat full of honey looks like we've got to roll kids i teleport towards the cart we're taking off with the honey i grab a little jar of honey toss it down if anyone asks we have no idea where it came from i wonder if it was sam elliot at the bar telling that story well trinket had quite a time holy fucking shit and get two bears in a trenchcoat
