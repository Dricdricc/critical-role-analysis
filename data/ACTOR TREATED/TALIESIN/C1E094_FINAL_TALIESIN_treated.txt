i'm marisha ray and this has been-- spontaneous combustion oh wednesday club we're finally-- because i forgot that i was leaving town for some reason that i don't remember at all i don't remember why i had to leave town for some reason (laughs) yeah we did our funny book show last week so this week we're going to do our comics 101 it's going to be a lot of fun we're going to talk about the basics of how to read comics if you're brand new to it or if you have questions it'll be fun we're going to talk about the amount of time that moves between panels thought bubbles talk bubbles all the fun stuff it'll be great yes understanding comics is going to be talked about it's a really really great book guy lombardo guy lombardo but don pardo would've been amazing i do i was about to say i watched the episode so several funny ones oh and we're still talking about the con we're doing momocon hover hand man where is john connor i think all things considered that went rather well taryon are you all right are you all right it is very reasonable not to be all right after that i think i'm going to need a moment to sit down and have a drink-- i pull out a bottle of something did you fail a petting a-- this trip has changed us well we've got a robot to reconstruct i'm going-- i will help with that i've got a very very large-- i pass the last of the green tear whisky for dotty doty for doty this is not celebration this is acknowledgement your oldest friend not anymore your oldest friend not your only friend when you're ready we'll fix one up no that's not crazy even if you were it's-- how else will you chronicle doty's adventures if not with a new chronicler and we'll fill in everything that's been missed we definitely have resources time and help drag the last of all the bottles out this time eloquent very eloquent we should yes we may be taking a bit of a break a year yes well tinkering to be fair i don't actually know what tinkering pays because i've never been paid to do it a lot of money well i mean yes you don't actually have to listen to a man who needed an eye mask explained to him but-- well that's a conundrum yes of course hell has done something to you well at the very least we're talking about advanced flirting at the very least i suppose if there's liquor we could find out that's so exciting it's the best bars where you always forget the name isn't it your majesty quite gracious it's good to see you as well he's new but he's proving himself quite well yes neat neat would be the word i would-- she does all right well there's a pub over there do i see a soldier of any kind on this-- i'm just tapping one when you're done please let the palace know that we have returned we've returned for good for a while so no immediate threat anymore we may have eaten some souls well-- well i may have signed a contract with a devil well we were in hell it's just-- you sign a contract with a devil i'm never going to do anything with it honestly it was mostly just to take care of our little problem and in return i have the option of-- -- selling my soul for power that i don't really need because i have everything i need right here she knows why went to hell yes extra extra she's being commandeered that's so true we do we know lots of people basically grog so far all right that was an interesting word yeah that just brought the whole thing well not literal wolves yeah you're my mate oh well i felt pretty good on that one it's dungeons & dragons man roll for montage halfway there already oh no oh no oh no she's an imaginary woman on graph paper roll for it get a kiss from and then if she rejects both of them we all win oh dear yes i want in on this as well now oh i'm not getting on this i just want in on the rating i technically can't bet because i do actually know everyone enough to-- i have a little more inside knowledge than one should god i hope so (laughter) that's not a clear-- oh yes no right now it's right now it's even keel i feel better there's not at all no-- no i feel the wrong lesson was learned here reel us all back a bit (high-pitched) well-- oh no nope travis three (laughter) maybe the only thing he knows if you want to discover what girls actually like ask girls we've got three-- wells of knowledge nope already lost it nope don't talk to the hair at some pubs that could have gone well yeah matt what does she do during the day when the pub's not open (laughter) bringing it all back i'm feeling very positive about the whole deal i feel that this is a reasonable draw we've had enough of that we met a bear a werebear there you're improving learning names we're not judging i was a bit awkward with girls before i started out oh yes i had a lot of sisters well we end up sheltered don't we i learn very quickly she's an excellent teacher never mind but no adventuring and going out into the world you learn a lot you meet people you get out it's good for you look at all these people we are sheltered children on this side this is also why you always make friends with women they have friends there's just networks of them it's brilliant thank you oh my god no wait no did your father find out about-- oh my god more liquor no we're sitting down for parental issues yes oh no i think i know please go on (sighs) good name that's so adorable i'm so sorry do you know why because those adventurers are busy actually having a good time never trust a man who sells property we just killed a dragon that made a lot of money i kind of want to rough him up no not you you're fine you can do whatever you like or slightly wealthy there's worse things than poverty i don't fully agree with that either although i spent quite a bit of time before i met this group of people dirt poor beggar poor it wasn't the best time of my life but-- i don't remember my point it was actually pretty awful it's true i did say it was pointless and because it comes with an enormous amount of responsibility and complications and while it's nice to have because i'm using it to do some good in the world now and because without it she becomes slightly more questionably evil than she currently is bless it's not the secret to happiness it doesn't actually help if you're not already happy it can augment existing happiness it just doesn't create it from scratch or baking bread i'm not sure i'm going to drink more it actually has a very good reputation to be fair there's not actual spaghetti oh that's funny twice too (laughter) laura and maybe take some pressure off and practice talking normally to people who are going to be very gentle with you about the whole process i missed you so much that was hot damn i feel like i just learned something or you'll just have a great time 21 i think he needs this i think it'll be all right do you have your orb i'm just saying i'm just going to double-check it'll be fine just going to double-check real quick they haven't started anything yet i'm just going to take a peek what if i owe you a favor i'm appealing beyond the voice of the tempest to the heart of the storm i'm asking the heart of the storm pleading to the heart of the storm far beyond the voice of the tempest there's nothing to be heard here i didn't want to disturb them if they know that we're watching it would disturb them you don't have to watch i just want to watch it's just me it's because we're peers i'm a bit drunk i don't know i've never tried yes does it require attunement i'm going to try and use it can i use a resolve for this no that doesn't work does it that's seven i don't understand how this works never mind one more time just bring the difficulty up i don't care there we go 24 and i'm thinking about scanlan do you want to say this out loud this is the second time in a week i've gotten to do this to people do they look reasonable i take down as many details in my head as i can thanks guys ha oh that's a bit much that's a bit much nothing that interesting ugh that doesn't feel good believe me i'd tell you if it was appalling it was not appalling it was fine he's fine he's having a good-- that doesn't feel good how do you do that ugh all right and that would be-- okay yeah four it did i don't think i'm ever doing that again but yes that doesn't feeling good i didn't see that i'm going to be a gentleman and not throw up from the speed at which one goes in that direction that's fair he's doing very well very well i'm very proud we should probably go to the castle i do we've sent word they'll be awake i imagine is gilmore still in town head back out where we have both so that's either way it could work we have lovely beds i was not there very long i'm a little soberer than i'd like to let on not sober but-- i don't quite want to say surprise for tomorrow but i may have something exciting to show you tomorrow i'm going to need you to be extra intimidating tonight because tomorrow i'm going to be very intimidating right back at you i figured you would i'm going to have to say hello to my sister no are we alone i didn't look in on tary no (sighs) i saw scanlan he's fine i haven't done anything yet enjoying himself god knows he has things that belong to me he has the stone-- did we he has the earring i kind of want them back i think that if he did come back i would be very worried about who he was i'm feeling betrayed and i can't help but think of all of our adventures of the last few weeks he would have been oddly useful for so many of them he would have been such a-- hm i'm not i've been that villain and the best of them point out all of your flaws while they're busy exploiting their own i am i will admit very angry i don't want to interfere with his happiness i don't want to interfere with his life certainly not his daughter but i will admit i am very angry perhaps the only thing that's keeping me from doing anything about that anger is your opinion of it i don't mean to put this on you this is not on you but-- i'm thinking of collecting what's mine yes as do i i'll think on it i'll think on it thank you i'll be right there i'm going to confer with my sister about formalizing a few things tomorrow there's just layers to that trouble isn't there just layers of paperwork for a while this time terrible but all over i'm back to help it's my turn i will happily take some layers of both that paperwork and that cake off your hands and i grab a slice i do ask tomorrow that we handle this little interesting tidbit i hand her the documents i put together earlier with the titling that needs to be dealt with i expect somebody will come up with something delightful for that one quite a while a long while it seemed appropriate even before things became what they are yes yes i-- he does if i recall we're going to make this right we're going to-- the machine will run again all of this will work again i will help i could use more cake how goes the training of the company of shot well we're going to fix that as well the guards the captain of the guards has been taking care of everything jarett is he still around i would like to confer with him very quickly before i go to sleep but other than that we are back and i look forward to making this move forward tomorrow morning i will thank you i'm going to run by jarett's on the way back to my quarters all right real quick i'm just going to write a little post i'm just going to write a little letter which i will tell you about in-- well should i tell you what it is now because the person who sent it-- no well yes you all need-- (laughter) jarett so sorry jarett i know very quietly on the sly hire someone to keep very very distant tabs on scanlan shorthalt i want to know if anything unusual happens not to interfere just watch five gold pieces where was my-- i'm trying to find my number i was going to shoot about 400 gold at it just to get it done seems reasonable yeah until he needs more and it's over oh no more of a-- what would be the word i would think to use odds and ends it's less of a guard and more of a champion you'll be stronger than the last one i will say that would have been right before the unpleasantness he was under the anders house which is why the anders house is now forfeit that would be-- just you just for you right hopefully not we'll go down learn a little bit more and begin when you're ready i follow she needs to be appropriately consecrated obviously shush now a sign of your victory whatever that victory may be i've read a bit i know a bit about what's to come yeah you'll do fine maybe you're supposed to build the treehouse in the top of the tree i'm just going to follow in before we send you off into this i just wanted to let you know that when i sort of sprung this title on you i chose the grey hunt specifically the third house is easy it's just land and title it doesn't mean anything as a child the grey hunt was fascinating because it was a title that one earned and i felt that you should have something like this that no one could do otherwise other than claim that you earned it this is not something that can be given and you're going to be fine i have complete faith i love you too good luck backing off i'm in my study working on things excellent excellent i'm so sorry and excited yes i have a map in my study and i just pull it out and just hand it i must have a map grog when i'm drunk do i know anything matt this is not your specialty you haven't dealt with the grey hunt personally and this is not ringing a bell it's different every time laura okay hey do you remember when we were coming here and we were camping out in the woods outside and there was a woman i think that walked by with a pack of was it wolves i don't know yeah oh shit the tiny trees have come out that's funny because dungeons and dragons is my favored terrain (laughter) tavern as favored terrain is genius okay okay oh god tickle tickle tickle i've known the necklace hasn't gone would i know anything with six eyes big rhino thing with six eyes what am i rolling just a general intelligence check 23 you killed a gray render there's a surprising number of things with six eyes and that's-- (laughter) that means it was natural it didn't have a good or bad aspect to it maybe maybe not that means that you were sent and that you did what you thought was right this thing could have been a terrible danger yes that is a thing i'm very proud of you way to bring it all back is there a-- do they do something with this trophy or is that-- i think like satine ran a game like a half a decade ago that we played in together he is terrible
