it's so weird this is a crazy thing above us fidelio exactly two weeks ago at the willingham house later in the hospital waiting room meanwhile inside the delivery room and scene fjord never came back after watch last night fjord marisha and the traveler's bullshit that really would've worked i'm going to check the tents i'm going to check the tents to see if their stuff is still there yasha's stuff is still here so there's nothing behind that's unbelievably bad i'm going to check the road for fresh tracks see if anything looks like it was disturbed oh for fuck's sake same roll two they're literally scarecrows in the background we are children lost at a ross dress for less we're never going to see our parents again it's all over (cawing) hey thank god first thank you second they may have just taken the ones that were furthest away from the light they just picked them off maybe you walk away from camp that's what happens i mean it's not the biggest or strongest it's the-- i'm going to freak out is there any trash or anything on the road i'm just going to look for any-- that's better 14 moving i'm going to draw both swords and head towards it i may have already moved i didn't think of that yeah i'm just going to be obvious that was fast and here have a thing what the fuck is going on we don't know probably i haven't really thought this through where did you come from what are you doing in the bloody bushes by our campsite i'm putting down one of the swords we're having a very weird day just one there's still one glowing sword we more or less got robbed last night and you're the first living human being that we've seen-- or not human being last night not yet but keep it drawn we're having a very bad morning i apologize if we came off a little terse all right fine oh no i have an idea we've all had a bit of a morning let's sit down have a drink we can get you liquor we can talk about anything you've seen traveling on the road in the last day or two i'm molly is your name pleasure then oh okay that would've been very inconvenient parenting there's weird parents that do things never mind they're very weird parents let's sit is that true well we're not necessarily nice people so that'll work out fine we're not we don't leave people behind and that's the deal molly pleasure nott we are at the camp right now i'm going to nervously pack while this is going on she does have a fair point though we are a little squishy you're in good company right now we lost the charm i just toss 20 gold and i'm like throw me a cigarette please i'm not one to interrogate someone's past information's information we could use some help you could also hire us 20 gold yes that's how i know you can afford us (laughter) and we split whatever we find you pay at the end of the deal i try not to learn their names i don't want to get attached yes don't panic about it it's going to be fine i'm all in for this we have spare horses now we're half packed already that's how it's done there you go we would have to ditch some how much can we carry are we going to try and pack horse this is that how we're-- or we take the horse and cart at reasonable speed or stow it so we're going to drop a loaf let's leave a marker if he's going to die we have to leave a marker so we can come back and find where he's been interred poop joke we squeezed about as much as we can out of that one it's been a while i was going to say-- keg's been on this road before i have a giant dragon tapestry you now have a cape it's huge i think the full tapestry you're well disguised as a stoner's bedroom at the moment a dragon on a sheet yeah the orb we haven't-- dodecahedron i'm more than happy to kill something at this point i've got some anger and aggression to work out welcome to the team (vomit sound) oh for gods' sakes oh for gods' sakes i'm going to start going through the woods what time is it do we want to head a couple hours or have this unbelievably safe place what looks like a very safe place although-- never mind we're going to-- terrible things are just going to happen i'm accepting it this is going to be a cursed trip do we want to stay in the haunted house well here's the question do we just go until we have to stop and then we camp wherever we're going to camp or do we find something like this which is possibly a little safer and then just wake up very early and run and go further trust the local throw a falcon through the window chimney or you could go through the chimney or the collapsed roof we have-- i like her i'm going to hop in there as well we always know to look i also want to see if there's-- does it look like people have been in here recently nothing of value a two that's not fair is there a crest on the fireplace or anything like that any markings of who might have lived here at one point can i remove the piece i'm going to take it well this obviously brought luck to whoever was here (quietly) i have a symbol of pelor i'll take a torch caleb you want to do a little scan while we're here see if anything tingles your fancy wait yes bless you ah 14 14 i'll pull a single sword and guard caleb all right i'm going to try and push caleb awake and go for a tree yeah let's go let's go and we're going to head for a tree oh yeah we're getting some distance from whatever oh man the ass sailor her horse is still there 16 it's the anti-snitch i'm going to try something fancy i'm going to tap my new fancy sword and i'm going to like a pepper's ghost effect fade out and disappear and move right into what would be-- get some advantage on the one that beau's been hitting i'll use my movement to get right where i need to be so i have advantage now i'll take two attacks all right first one a natural one and an 18 yeah so one hits ooh that's ten damage plus three yeah 13 ten plus three next attack that's a 19 that's nine plus two so that's 11 yeah we have a little clink and turn and face the other one actually do i have any movement left i'm going to pull back and i'm going to get ten feet in front of caleb right between caleb and the insect no the other side of that right there to make a wall there hey you might be able to-- oh you burned your move though this is not anything i can try and give them disadvantage on dexterity saving throw yay that's a 22 i can live with that loo no that's the end of loo 11 this is your perfect opportunity for new crossbow who dis (laughter) woo it will come in handy with these-- yeah epic combo it's a fresh one circle the tree a couple times holding onto it i'm going to run and get into flanking position with this one over here thumpety thumpety yep and now we're going to take a slice at this one and that's that'll do it (counting) 25 to hit so (counting) ten plus four 14 and again 19 and a one why i love advantage and that's 14 points of damage it's got to be dead by now right how is that-- the one that really it had (explosions screeching) i needed this and i'm going to hide behind the tree trunk from the other one last of my movement yeah it's street fighter-style beau and ken (laughter) oh this is cool give it time give it time nice patronus by the way too many beaus that palette swap's terrible (laughter) we have oats they'll come back if you squeeze and twist you can make it stand up again and you can make the arms move use the ground this is a dead horse or can it be revived i'm going to make a medicine check for my horse my medicine check is nine neigh water closet is possibly new pocket jerky at this point keg can ride with me this is not a problem if you want you're already taking a good hard look at your decisions this is good i'll ride with you then you get your own horse i have their armor yeah that'll do it that's fair (laughter) truly nothing escapes your astute observation going to go back to that cabin and take a short rest for a minute it would have been in the sack do you want me to go look at the locker look at the fancy are you feeling lucky punk whoa i feel like if you give it to me i'm going to end up dropping it and it's not really going to be that useful i'm very happy i say we just camp at the house at this point i need rest and we have not going to get much further i say we wake up early it's going to be dusk in less than an hour well wherever we happen to find ourselves it was just tea we just gave you tea to smoke it wasn't really (laughter) i've still got my tent so sure all right i'll also do first watch individual natural 20 oh plus three 23 there's another there's another campfire 200 feet give or take do you want to send a bird maybe she's sleeping i'd say go ahead i figure if they were meaning us any harm they wouldn't set a fire we get a long rest yeah just us a child that does have a vibration doesn't it i'm not at my best right now if they're human even if they're friendly i'm not the first face you'd want to see you have a friendly owl fine i start quietly waking marisha sam and i somehow woke everyone at the exact same time it's one of my many powers left hand right hand tail i got it all working at once we've got a bit of a situation outside it's going to require some delicacy caleb's dead it's all over there's a boy there's an old woman i'm going to stay 30 feet behind and try and stealth we have not had a short rest yet have we okay just checking that die never does that for me i'm staying 30 feet back and attempting a stealth check that's cocked that's better that's (counting) 12 one two three four five-- five i'm just walking out at this point we've lost a few recently just woke up and they were gone we'll see well we're making our way to see if something can be done i genuinely don't know how to say no to tea you can't heal a dead horse downtrodden i'm feeling all right but-- some people make tea i'm going to head in chamomile i have cards we could have played cards i will definitely take some they've got turn-down service here always do you know which way this friend of yours was heading to find them it was north on the path i suppose we'll see what we can do if it's possible we'll see what we can do all things being equal i look at the kid is he freaked out by the way i look is he-- i'm going to go down and try something i'm going to try this i haven't tried this yet i'm going to hold up the moon card and i'm going to try and do a sleight of hand trick and flip it to one of my little moon trinkets moon baubles it would be the most hilarious natural one-- eight it's not beautiful yet-- i give him the bauble i give him a little scratch the horses you did very well you were nearly charming we're the three amigos is really-- everybody's doing so much better suddenly it's as if the vacuum means other people have to start pulling some slack it's nice well suddenly you're being kind of charismatic nott's making moralistic judgments that are in the direction of reasonable some days it's not hard to do a good turn cheers i'd forgotten about that been a little distracted if only there were a tiefling here who possibly spoke and read the same language keep it to yourself off-roading let's do it do we want to go at a steady pace for this last hour or do we want to push for a fast pace natural 19 21 and you're hangry does it look like if we push a little bit further there's any change in terrain even in far distance want to do one more hour and call it let's send the owl if we can find a stone for cover maybe we'll set up a proper camp (yelling) we're trying to sleep for gods' sakes let's take the next one nine want to gamble no i'm not this is a game we used to play take my cards set the deck down put a question on the deck whoever draws the highest card has to answer it tarot cards but they have numbers i know i'll throw one out there for you what's the best lie you've ever told i'll give you mine if you give me yours whoever gets the highest has to tell or whoever gets the lowest has to tell let's roll d20's see whose number is lower you can be a little vague with it you don't have to be i rolled very high seventeen shit i did shite best lie i've ever told i pretended to be royalty for three weeks for a scam i was-- just a little while after i had gotten my consciousness sort of sorted out and we got into a town and figured out that we could actually get some nice digs and they were seeing if i could maybe bullshit my way through it and it was kind of my test so i pretended to be a reincarnated royalty from across the sea yeah (laughing) that was a lot of fun i like knowing that because it's not there that it doesn't matter and it helps knowing i don't think it matters for anybody i don't care where anybody's from it's nice i certainly don't care where i'm from i pour-- i pass the drink that's usually how this rolls politician no no i'm very impressed actually that's-- you are a good friend to have and a terrible enemy to make to not quite being the worst people cheers night that's very fair they really had it coming cat stats (musical riff) cat stats squats that's a deep callback wow ja i'll take a round minus five natural 20 23 minus five is-- once they get a little closer let's slow down and walk to the side of the road and take a look at this what kind of traders do they look like what are they trading in no let's slow our pace i think we should wait until they start to set up camp they've got to stop at some point they're going to have to camp and a druid do you know anything about the cages they keep their prisoners in are they magically enchanted or are they just cages i sort of figured i figured everyone else figured at this point really i do too but you know people say things how bad are the terms that you're on with these people that's fair we're starting to get a plan there's no cages they're magically-- with his very dulcet tones i have a plan it's a bit of a crazy plan they're carrying the means of their own undoing if we can free whoever is in those cages we get a lot of allies anybody in there i'm sure is going to have feelings towards these people i like waiting until they camp and coming in at night if we can just get into that cage and untie them without them noticing wait until the sun sets right before they go to sleep i could be into that ambush free people all one big thing i'm sure they're not used to being attacked by people who actually know what they have let's full-speed blow past them just nod and keep moving all right this is a good plan yeah it'll be the two of you you still have your mote you can use it now all right 18 we'll stop when we see somewhere that seems advantageous if we see something-- yeah but we've got night vision anything that we were going to do would be near the road anyway first do we have any dynamite we have acid do we have enough dispel magic that we could reveal the cart so we could see it yeah like can you make magic go away magic have you never seen anybody do this before just make magic go away they're cloaking the cages you could maybe free the people inside the cages with your magic hand thing that you do and if their horses die those carts aren't going anywhere and then they're stuck if they're out they're helping us but if we kill the horses the cart can't leave that's fair too but they could try and run they don't drug their prisoners they don't drug them one last question how secure are these carts or do they just trust that nobody's going to get out of the hog tie it's cage cage cage it's not wooden bottom wooden top it's with bars there's no weak point as long as we can pick some locks untie some ropes honestly once the combat starts especially if you've got fireballs we can just make sure those horses are toast i could teleport into one of the cages and start untying people with you at the top of one hill if we get you some cover and you at the other hill if we give you some cover giving you both some distance the three of us getting into the middle of it coming at them at all sides always take out the magic users first and if we can get a few friends in whoever is in those cages for all we know that's where they've got our people is there a way to embed a spell into the ground me too if they try and climb the hills towards either of you you can have some ball bearings to help slip them back down i'm going to take the gun i'm taking the gun i'm taking the gun dex okay oh yeah i'm screwed it's fine i'm seven does it even have anything in it we know there's part of me that's wondering if we hid you in the downed tree if you could sneak in and start working on the cages before they even know there's a problem between two hills if we can pick the locks and untie everybody we don't need to slow the horses we have a tree if we want we have a-- we could put her under the tree if you find somebody bleeding under a tree that's not ridiculous tree fell you happened to get hit good luck we could put you on top of the tree if you feel like you want to have some words with these people i'm all right with that you guys work on people--i still think opening the cages is going to be a good call we'll see what happens i'm all right for this plan he did move four or five maps into this building today under cover of tarp i walked in the green room at one point and it was literally the no mom private time it's that weird room with the weird hair salon stuff anybody who wants me to shave their head i'll do it sam and okay (indecisive sound) it's less of a tree than i was hoping for here's your paintbrush sculpt i'm so proud you know what that is you can also dig a hole right underneath it too so you can hide-- we want to push the tree over don't we want to give it a good shove we also have a-- no we left the axe never mind yeah yeah you can do that angle-- --you can do that angle so that you can just hit it and know which side it will fall to-- um just for-- no that would be too much i was about to say i could make a bullshit trip wire that when the tree went down it would tighten a rope it would pop it it would be rope on the ground i don't know if it would hide in that it might be too obvious let's just for fun i'm going to have some of our hemp rope already tied around this rock with just a big mess of it ready to go so if we need it we've already got one anchor point i'll take bush one caleb's going to be all the way back there it gets slowed when it reaches a log i was going to say either that or you hid up a rock once the first caravan passes the log does it just slow not stop i think we want to be a little further yeah they'll always be in a line if the front one is slowed down then they're all going to be slowed through there and now they're ready for a fight if you slow the first cart then the other two behind it are not going to be able to go any faster either (metal clanging) and then we can push the tree on the first cart that'll be fun the first one since it's damaged or the first one would be more engaged with us if you're invisible you could maybe help get everybody out you wouldn't be able to commit it to memory and then rewrite it later but it's near-perfect how long does invisibility last sure but if you use the scroll once we hear the bells then we've got an hour your trap goes off your little alarm goes off invisibility then you wouldn't drop invisibility that's not concentration oh then fine i like this plan it's ridiculous no there we are we're not ranged people and you can do stuff once slow's cast you can also do other things once it's rolling if things look like they're trouble we'll just go with it go for the druid first all right that'll do we've got a plan we do set up the tent aren't we all i'm very cold but yeah that'll work i imagine it's a whippet that looks like the matrix of leadership from transformers (singing) you got the touch are we really doing this now wrong timeline with advantage because we had time 20 pretty good yes i didn't even really understand how good i had it i was so used to being okay no matter what even if i rolled a one i'm so glad you're first that's great 18 what does slow mean by the way oh my god that's amazing that means you can attack and then disengage for free that's amazing can you get a little bit more around the-- or is that all your movement 21 is that a bonus action though you have to do an action or a bonus action you can't do both no dubstep today no wub wub i look at keg and you got that one right i'm going to start my movement i've got 30 feet of movement i can get almost to the edge of this mountain right that's 30 feet then i can teleport how far can i get to flanking mm-hmm is that way more than-- i have a 30 foot teleport right is it possible to do it halfway through my movement so i still have two steps that i can take no never mind eff it i'm good i'm not going to fight it i'm going to take two attacks i have advantage all right both are up yeah that's 19 yeah that hits the first one is awful seven points of damage second one is 16 17 yeah that's 16 plus seven that's better 12 points of damage that was pretty solid he's going to have a hard time doing that disadvantage of my blood maledict let's see i'm not looking at the right thing where is it blood maledict yeah it's 60 feet amplified yeah i take a lot of damage for that five points of damage for fuck's sake 15 god fucking damn it all right did he get disadvantage on the other attack as well okay 16 okay so they both hit the one on the hill and prone matt yeah you're still within the minimum distance so with disadvantage regardless that is with disadvantage a 13 what's your armor class yeah nope matt spends 15 feet of movement backing away there as the boss said you do get an attack of opportunity if you'd like to take it do i still have a second blood maledict by the way this round i can spend another round doing it i know we changed the rules slightly at fifth level do i get two uses or just two options all right when we get there you did throw two javelins at an irritating creature so that's good it's going to take two turns though right matt she wasn't affected by slow you get an attack of opportunity well actually no can you freeze her she's still between the two of us she couldn't have circled 19 19 jesus christ 20 points do you have any more attacks left or you could hit them while they're down and help them bleed out oh dear motherfucker 25 there's no way to get through-- there's no way i can make it to lorenzo from here is there not anymore i'm going to get my ass kicked if i get there i'm going to try and engage the barbarian before raging happens god damn it fuck it if you're in with lorenzo i'm going for lorenzo ten i'm going to take three attacks i do not have advantage obviously first attack is that cocked or is that okay damn it it was a 20 now it's a 22 that's (counting) 18 points of damage not happy swipe number two that's a ten then the other one is a three that does not hit either i think i have a second blood maledict usage now i know i was looking because i know you changed things and it says blood maledict you can invoke a blood curse a number of times per short rest based on your levels 2nd one 5th two 9th three i'm taking-- hoping this die rolls worse come on for fuck's sake my blood maledict literally kills me actually no fuck was i going to do it advanced i was going to do it advanced my own blood maledict knocks me unconscious i was at four hit points what was i going to do thank you (spitting) with blood eyes never shut i might need to leave the table for a while yeah i can't watch this
