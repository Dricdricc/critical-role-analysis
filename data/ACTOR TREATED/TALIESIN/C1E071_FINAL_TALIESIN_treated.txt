no i'm getting into that where i don't know which camera is-- i know (laughs) our plan's going to go so well i would break everything on the way back here happy pineapple day i'm back what are you going to do i am sleeping in the corner i would assume roll for it matt dad make her roll for it it's in my possession all right that'll do that's disadvantage oh and minus two that's 14 okay (caws) have i had a full night's sleep at this point goddamn it how about making a quiet cavern not too far away from the summoning circle where we can hide that's fair vex and i at a distance let's go scout out the location can you go back and forth that's a question i don't want to be food i want to be something that eats can we go in and out of mist form that's a thing we can do we're going to do this as well if we scout and it's clear and then we come back and then go back it might not be clear again if we scout and it's clear then we do it it's done i'm trying to move in a very windy way yeah i am the fart hugging the walls looking normal i volunteer as tribute let laura lead too late no take-backs just stealth for us 16 oh yes we have cover from either side of the top that's right i'm going to fly over to the top of the far right of the ravine above them all the way up here and i'm going to take a look around and see if anybody anything's around anything living that looks suspicious you'd think i'd be able to do this 18 nine yeah i'm going to survey would i think it's safer above the ravine or within actually that works out perfectly for me then i'll jump down to behind that rock and i will de-mist behind that rock i think a cave entrance right here to somewhere where you can hide after you do the summoning and dive in and get about 25 to 30 feet away i'm not responsible for what you ate for breakfast yes that's actually-- well kima that's all right somebody can mist back and bring her i think she's already so delighted with you that might be a terrible idea that's a very good idea actually we do we want to have places to hide we want to have a place to hide and place to shoot from that has cover digging a hole and moving the mansion here it also means that if something goes horribly wrong you can run downstairs and hide how strong are the ravine walls and can we dig into them as well not just the ground but the walls themselves small tunnels just big enough for one person yeah for tomorrow and where's the green dragon it was a good thought all right i like the idea of someone going back to get kima i think one tunnel on this side one tunnel on the other side and one tunnel on the top of the ravine on either side if you can do that not a ton of noise how loud will this be do you think that'll work no just goes poof little bit of a poof you can't poof within the mansion i'm going to spend some time in this form just studying to see if there's anything odd about this circle at all studying the stones wait i think we should i think two crow's nests for the shooters i draw out really quickly in the snow-- i'm making ice plates not stone can you manipulate ice can you manipulate ice but you can't create ice i think that we could-- stone shape if we pull some of the ice i can try and make sheets of ice-- we can alter the topography just a bit by taking out some of the ice and then opening it up to make hiding places that'll do we don't need a ton of space because we're never going to move more than six give us cover it would be hard to fall if he attacks us the best thing actually if he attacks us up there would be to jump you have a broom i have a rope make some pod bubbles i'm going to start pouring water on this stuff and it's going to be ice again so quickly i've already started working on camouflage-- i would take it to the far edge even further i'd say about 50 feet up i'm creating a breakable ice shield for when it's time but i'm just giving the nice cover i know ooh check out the big brain i'm just going to spend all my time also trying to keep hiding it keep reinforcing it once the mansion's available i'm going to take water and slowly add layers which is not the direction where raishan is oh shit we're setting up camp the attack begins tomorrow morning there's going to be a beast there will be a fight we'll see how it goes we're going to try and tire him out once he's tired out-- it's not like a vampire there's also going to be a field of-- we did that's why it's going to be a great plan let's make the mansion right now please make the mansion not if we're in the mansion which would be you and i before the fight it's a plan it's a plan anything more complicated would immediately fall apart when anything shifts which will inevitably happen no mansion we will see you in the morning thank you truly excellent that's why you're here that's why he's not in here we wake up early before the sun rises those of us who have to hide hide once we see them bringing him to the summoning circle we call the beast and we wait we are going to be in the most danger because we're going to be right in the thick of it we're both going to be hiding in an ice-covered cubby-hole it's not possible to get to those cubby-holes without a difficult climb is it i think it's hilarious that we can think we can we know that the one place she isn't is in here wow oh my god we're going to die worth it man 17 my theory on that subject is that she's clever enough that eyes on her would not be helpful in the first place it's best to assume that even if we could see her that she would be tricking us over what she's doing hide in the mansion and worst-case scenario scream that she betrayed us and that she promised that she would help kill the white dragon and see if they'll fight it out yes and definitely inspire some conflict laura and i'm at negative one not to damage though vex is going to put me in that pocket we have dust of tracelessness we're going to fly over there as well and then also we're attaching a rope just in case to the wall so i have something to climb down with if i need to it's not going to be hanging out it's all in six are there actually enough albino ravenites that we would stick out or is that a common color oh then i would recommend not i would recommend white clothing all right snowy when you see the dragon pop up into the sky and head this direction start summoning yes please that's 16 i would not object to invisibility then no oh we made the gumbo no he's got a movement and an action no (yelling) he has not realized this is possibly a poor idea yes i'm going to signal them to come out he's expending power as well that's the other thing it's a cookbook it's a cookbook have you said anything in the earpiece yet i'm holding oh 13 13 because i'm at a negative one i was holding ready can i try and beat his initiative and get a shot off first jenga i'm going to press a torso push with this by the way yeah i'm going to press a torso push better 33 i don't even know why i bother he's automatically pushed ten feet away from me oh that hits that's magic so 23 plus six that's fine the lightning damage the cloak doesn't absorb that okay then i'm going to do my damage on him which is new to me that's terrible that's 11 points of damage plus two points of psychic damage 50 feet do i join the initiative order 21 it sees me all right jenga except that he also has a dragon to contend with so as long as we keep it a bigger threat than us i think he'll keep his concentration where it is oh boy okay i'm going to take a wing shot at that dragon to try and drop him come on natural 20 does the 1d6 also double is it all dice or just the standard damage oh you say that now let's see how this goes first the damage which is not bad 16 points of normal damage and 11 points of psychic damage and he's prone 16 and 11 that's 27 no not against the wing shot oh strength saving throw you're right against a dc of 19 again that'll hit 31 to hit same thing 15 points of damage plus one psychic so 16 19 so it's dropping now what should i make it have difficulty with not saving but checks you never know one more shot first i'm going to hex the dragon i'm going to give him disadvantage against strength checks and i'm going to shoot him with a sharpshooter shot for my last shot come on yeah 29 this is good (excited yell) 18 oh my god okay 28 plus five psychic so that's 33 points of damage plus another d6 plus another five necro now i'm going to take cover in my little cove plus five necro motherfucker he's checking the sheet oh no it means there's a very angry dragon now that's looking at me all right we've got a game he's just noticing everybody can he do that already even recovering from the prone stay down is it gargantuan gargantuan trust travis on this one death from above marisha and want a bonus i'm going to take aim and hold my full attack until he tries to get up that's a sick tattoo y'all oh no he's even starting to move i'm laying into him spending a grit point and i'm knocking him in the foot back prone before he can even stand up this is my third or fourth because i did crit so i got one back 22 that's a d10 and a d6 and another d6 12 points of damage plus one necrotic and two psychic so 15 points of damage and he has a save against 19 no i was about to say it's a save not a check unaffected again blowing it it's worth it gun jams you know what happens ow that's the end of my turn i'm going to dive down and hide and hold is it constitution saving plus two he moved really far in one turn even halved we're still going to need you then apparently no what are you going to do ancient white dragon someone's going to get knocked unconscious good you've burned it had to burn it i am going to heal as my bonus action that's not bad that's 19 points i'm a little better now i'm at 108 i'm fine now i'm going to take out bad news fuck animus for now take out bad news and take two shots at this bastard with sharpshooter for fuck's sake yeah gun jammed no i have one more gun but i don't have time that burns an action okay i'm using my action surge might as well no i'm taking out my last pistol and i'm shooting i'm just going to shoot see if i can take two more shots technically not it's two shots no i'm not trying to repair oh i'm taking two more shots then sharpshooter shot with retort no it's different 16 ah that one hits on the other hand i think 22 that's not much but i'll take it nine points of normal damage plus two necrotic so that's 11 points of damage no 21 points of damage i'm so sorry i'm going to burn my action surge and take three more shots fuck it see if i can lose the third gun it's that night apparently no i will not that's 18 fuck the sharpshooter shot i'm just going for it no sharpshooter thank god that's 20 excellent good to know oh my god that's bullshit ten points three necrotic so it's ten points of damage my final shot no it didn't this one doesn't do that that's nice but i miss that's 16 that misses thankfully it doesn't burn that gun no that gun is better built i'm rolling really poorly yenk ain't got nothing but us to hit right now let's not dwell on that remember to go into the stomach if it goes we've got a relic in its stomach no nixing it this is my safe place it would have been 19 this is where being at the end of everything is great actually does that hit both of them okay i'm going to take my three shots oh yeah so the first thing i'm going to do is i'm going to use my bonus action to reload i'm going to take my three shots at the white dragon with what i have left i can do nothing that's 30 one necrotic 12 points with one necrotic shot number one next shot same thing standard shot that ran but 22 oh sorry it's not 22 i'm so tired 17 that misses 24 for the next shot that's 12 points with two points of necrotic and i'm going to grab my rope and i'm going to wave at the green dragon and start dropping down i have a rope yeah i can do that even at negative one i can do that no i can't that was a one fine he might have burned it i've been hit by a goat in the face before no really i got nailed by a goat no we were filming this ridiculous television series called hell town when i was a kid it was awful not in the show either yeah we're going to let one leave one's going to walk constitution saving that would be a negative one no not a negative one add negative one that would be 15 there's no middle ground is there there's no middle ground at all how fast is he still within visual range hit him with everything we've got there will be a conversation i run to the body of the big demonic thing and start going through it not funny vex we have a dragon to disassemble i got a 16 no 16 to investigate i pull out my sword and cut it out i walk to you we're walking to the dragon anyway i hand it to you your majesty karma's a bitch we're finishing up the harvesting and i go to talk to raishan really quickly i'm sending you to work on the dragon okay thank you you've earned a conversation we'll see you at home you should get there quickly so there's no suspicion we don't say it that was not a fight we were about to have i'm going to run over and try and pull anything from yenk it really was it actually was how was this terrible good work girl
