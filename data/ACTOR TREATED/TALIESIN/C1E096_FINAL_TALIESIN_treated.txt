could have been tundra could have been tundra mine's kind of wonky can i get a new one got a little-- yeah we're talking about the eisners this week the eisners got announced all in-- a couple friends of the show jodie got announced i think max got announced for one i haven't gone through the whole list but we're going to start talking about the eisners and it's probably-- we're going to break it up but i think we're probably going to have three talks about the eisners there's a lot to talk about it'll be great what are the eisners who was eisner and-- what are these books what does it mean we don't know we'll find out i don't know but we do wednesday noon to 2pm pacific standard time which ones are the gryffindors i know one of these two teams is the gryffindors oh wait wait that's the line de scrimmage right that's where they-- the line of scrimmage yeah the line there's velcro i think it divides into four actually yup that's a thing okay the alpha team is laughing right now the bay of jifs yes i think between the three of us it should be fine if the rest of you want to go and-- -- talk to wilhand and see what information you can glean yes all right well i mean yes but that is honestly like saying 'a man with brown hair of average height' when it comes to these sorts of creatures it could be anything it's kind of the effect they go for no glowing eyes no so there's that a bit of smoke lots of smoke and bird-like honestly who knows we don't know enough yet it's too general it could also potentially be bullshit we'll know more when they decide to open up or if your travels for information bear fruit i imagine that depends on him (high-pitched) oh yes so while this is both happening at the same time there'll be some sort of narrative distance i don't know i just had this weird aneurysm just hit my brain i'm not entirely sure what it was have you met my friend lord fourth wall oh there's more a few more at least so yes anything that hasn't been cut yet yes please ah a fairy circle make a wish ah anyway we were hoping to gather the clan and take you on a tour of the estate when you're prepared let me check i'll be right back oh well i've gone into my sister's bedroom and have begun to raid the spring clothing to find the most ostentatious hat i can find and start shoving as many things into it as i possibly can yes 15 sure and it'll be very ill-fitting now get a feather in there get the whole thing really so it's very hard to lose him are we missing something i don't know is it finished i think we probably have a white plumey feather oh wait-- i'm gonna look to see if i can find some bells all right i'm actually going to send you on that one since you have the broom we'll need two i'll find a feather all right i'm going to just take a quill basically and stick it in there i don't even care i know it's wonderful i needed this yeah the horn helmet was pretty spectacular but i feel like we may have topped it what does jb eat yes yes we actually have a carpet we were thinking of using for this and one of those things it needs is beer yes here we are magnificent isn't it so that we can definitely find you no matter what you would think that but honestly i don't believe that we've ever had an official tour guide before you you would be starting this technically falls under this and that doesn't it it's customary to show respect by jingling the bells i think it's just so much more exciting when you say it why not grand poobah of all of this and that breaking point the breaking point is right beneath your chin who knew been searching for years we pull out the carpet and invite ogden and jb i understand i'll ride the carpet so that you can stay free for yes right i know i know i'll be fine yes oh god i'm okay with it let's roll with this i'm totally fucking down i'm in it's just me like like a gondola driver the gardens were originally constructed by melanie de rolo who is actually one of more interesting de rolos of the time she was of the third generation to be born into this castle-- don't know why i bother melanie is-- -- melanie was actually fascinating she was eventually removed from her position for accusations of witchcraft and raising of the undead there's actually quite a bit of interesting ghost stories if that's your sort of-- oh yes the strange materials that are mined in this part of the world have given rise to all sorts of stories due to its pale appearance the fact that under certain types of moonlight it can glow with a strange phosphorescent supernatural glow there are even tales of people-- -- seeing several of the more notorious de rolos as spirits wandering about the halls melanie just being one of them but she was very excited by the notion of a garden and actually originally many of these paths were-- thank you (laughter) i could keep going well actually why don't we take them to target practice i'm sure that the riflemen are probably at least doing a round of target practice that might be fun to see i'm not allowed to call them that anymore it's a shooting alley it's fun it's got some moving bits but i'm sure you can understand exactly what it entails this is quite possibly the only one in existence so this is quite exciting makes you look bigger as well stale blondie i'm not allowed to say that word out loud i think they may be drunk enough let's go see the-- your boy what's his name yeah at ease at ease we are giving a very rare tour of the grounds and we thought that these being trickfoots as in the family of trickfoots-- -- we would show them one of the things that makes this castle so special and one of the things that makes this castle so special is you and your company at ease this man in command of you all is one of the few people who could actually do a little damage to us in our time he has great respect very much so i could not think of anyone better for this particular occupation i am nothing but prideful i'm showing off some trick shots to the trickfoots while we're-- that's a very different show i'm so glad i can't hear any of this one does not sadly they're very rare outside of this castle and traditionally when they're found outside of this castle they're collected and the owner is often killed i will let you know yes i think that's a great idea i will say yes to this not one of my guns but thankfully we have a couple of the ones that are a little wonky kind of yes it'll be fun i'm showing them through the basics of loading the powder i do this very quickly so i know it's very difficult to see very fast yes i load it for them one at a time because this could go poorly you're welcome to try i give him an ample amount of powder this is going to be funny very solid there's a bit of kick to these you feel it in the shoulder maybe it's all right i think that's a great idea extremely there should not which is why if we find them outside this castle it's taken care of one way or another i'm going to do a quick load shot just to air it out a bit no (laughter) yeah this is 25 i will never ever outlive the shame i feel for inventing these i put it back down walk away you know what i'm going to say yes one at a time you'll have to be very careful it's very dangerous not just for what you're shooting at-- they're both empty i'm going to go a little luciferian here i'm going to load one at a time i'm going to mis-load i'm going to let the powder roll so it creates a flashpan it's going to be a big ugly loud mess it's not going to fire a shot it's just going to be a big ugly mess i'm making a blank i'm making a blank with a powder pop it's going to be a little singe-y you hit something well done you know just because i'm curious i'm going to give her a normal shot good form that as well i figured the sun tree was angry it may have taken revenge no i think that we've had enough for the evening no i have to fill out so much paperwork for that one we'll do it next time if you would like to try and fill out the paperwork all right then i certainly am not up to it so i completely understand if you're not just checking none of the gnomes had even the slightest tinge of reaction when he said that or no 23 even a twitch perhaps it's time to have a difficult conversation how would you know that it's leaving a mark if you had not disturbed the string it's very important are you saying that it's too difficult for you to wear that it's not working all right let me know when you are finished with it and when it is time to retire it i will make sure that it goes back to its resting place i think my sister likes you bit odd seems a bit odd at what point will (strained) the lack of circulation begin to make you talk like this i don't feel like they're telling the whole truth talk to his tics does he have tics we'd have to start right now we should start at the very least my worry is if i understand this curse correctly the only person i think that could possibly be at risk from it would be jb think about it what avarice have any of us ever experienced from pike i what i'm saying is perhaps-- please do actually google avarice hate and greed it's a covet-ness it's someone is-- the point i'm trying to make is and i'm having a notion-- the point i'm trying to make in all of this is that perhaps they're trying to save one of their own and perhaps they need to move the curse to another trickfoot we should start consecrating the ground at the very least i tend to veer towards the worst-case scenario somebody has to that is a question i would check both of them we should perhaps do this while we're setting up the ritual since it'll just be up there and it'll be natural to talk about this subject exactly it's going to take several days and i'm sure we're going to need their help prod your fingers deep into the recesses the nooks and crannies of their-- you don't have to do this in case you have to look weird do you have to look weird while you do this are you listening sarenrae it's me pike (laughter) i say tomorrow on the mountain yeah we've got to start right now so we have to start this immediately no one bothered to listen to any of my exciting stories about my home all right that's a 19 the dawn table but we can carpet or teleport i'll see if i can recall if there's a tree nearby we can certainly get closer it's only a few days maybe during the ritual set-up because i don't know would it work while you're walking not a rhombus anything but that i feel like chewing on your own toenails is the worst villain origin possible i'm highly dubious of this entire endeavor gilmore's out of town let's do it i'm going to get some tents and some food put together so we're at least comfortable it's not really horse-accessible the big guy will be fine he can cloud-stride as well one of us in theory should actually perhaps take the carpet so we can put doty on the carpet we wouldn't even need the tree-stride to be honest we could just do it i mean we could do from the base of the mountain to the top in two hours three hours but we could make the entire journey quite quickly we'll bring tents we're going to bring some nice tents in the morning that's doable i believe i'm pretty sure we have access to that nothing a little lavender and sulfur can't cure in my experience i'm going to go get a pound for good measure what's a diamond something similar to it exorcism for science why not (laughter) we'll get the lavender and sulfur together i'm sure i can dig up a pound of sulfur i figured let's just get double what we need just to be safe we need half a pound you keep your armor in a box filled with lavender does it smell fresh and clean all right your armor now smells like a grandmother's bathroom he does it's true he calls them sachets i'm going to let the castle know i'm taking a brief brief run up the hill and grabbing supplies for this so letting everyone know grabbing a few tents that's okay 19 i think you'll be quite pleased it's a gas i would say let's get all of the gnomes up there first so they can begin setting everything up i'll stay as well take doty so he can set up the tents yeah that should work lock the door okay that's a lot i think i'm gonna want some high ground up on that hill common celestial elven 22 just 'cause this thing's weird first thing i'm gonna do is i'm going to hit it with a sharpshooter with-- where's my runs with a deadeye so i'm getting advantage on it and hitting with sharpshooter and let's see what happens with animus that's yeah 30 to hit that's-- my brain is made of swiss cheese here we go 1d10 plus 1d6 so that's-- yeah that's nice so that's oh yeah that's really good 26 points of damage plus six points of psychic damage and just because i'm irritated by this thing i'm gonna drop some cabal's ruin into it let's just drop-- where's my pen here's my pen let's drop five points of cabal's ruin into that that's 5d6 if i recall so that's ugh three four five ten points of lightning damage this is animus the lightning and the psychic didn't do anything i'm going to-- i don't know what to do i just shot at it i'm going to attempt to hex it with a bonus action does it catch maybe it's an illusion i'm going to-- since i don't have much left i burnt a little bit i'm just i'm going to reload hunker down and watch what happens i'm also going to watch the gnomes all of them are any of them doing weird shit that's where i'm gonna use the rest of my turn to just look at the gnomes and see what they're doing that's my turn i'm watching all this and highly confused i'm going to turn on my boots and i'm going to run down towards the creature and i'm going to attack it with my silver-laced sword and see what happens and i'm taking a swing no it's okay 'cause this is pretty good 17 eight points of damage i'm going to take another stab it's a 24 i'm also going to out of curiosity run d6 worth of cabal's ruin through it just to see what happens so that's-- wow that really-- that's 14 points of piercing damage and two points of electrical damage the shock definitely did a thing okay just for fun i'm taking a third hit i'm gonna take a third shot at him and burn yup no a third slice and i'm gonna add just for fun let's do one two three let's do four more points of cabal and see what happens so that's 15 points of piercing damage seven eight nine and 13 points of electrical yeah and i'll take three more hits really quick i'm going to burn an action surge just do three more real quick just going for it i'll roll them all at once so that's-- yeah that all hits it's a 11 a 13 and a 17 they all-- they all hit that's 11 points 13 points and ten points this is very therapeutic get her this'll end well 18 don't no no no travis willingham you're going to get in big trouble that's a good call okay forget this that'll do i'm going to keep watching don't overcommit don't overcommit no i'm gonna walk below the cliff and just stand on the cliff and start knocking on the ball on the other side and waving so he can get a nice view of the drop down i was technically right below it i'm gonna make a grab i was kind of prepared for this dex saving throw you know i'm going to re-roll that i'm going to use a resolve yeah it's the exact same roll dex saving roll-- it's 11 she can take some damage should we tell them if he survived or do you want to surprise them i say loudly enough for everybody to hear i'm pulling back up oh yeah he's fine yeah and as a bonus there is a diamond at the bottom of the cliff if you're feeling nimble i'm going to walk up to ogden give a little-- when you make it down the hill you will find your cart outside the city limits in perfect working order searched for anything else you might have tried to stash away from my city i'd also like to remind you that the riflemen have seen your faces up close and the next time you come anywhere near our castle you will be shot on sight i release a low charge of diplomacy right into him just so we're clear excellent how much damage did we do to your little fucking marionette you were just doing the john stewart bullshit like ah ah are we healing it what the hell wow that i could totally see playing out i completely believe that you would do that you son-of-a-bitch
