didn't work last week why was it going to work this week good evening everybody and welcome to the second part of our vampire-palooza here on critical role (laughter) yes while matt and marisha are off on vacation somewhere warm and bright we will be slinking through the darkness of los angeles currently gosh everybody looks so pretty actually it's really hot in here so i'm going to-- i heard vampires burn get the diesel yeah everybody looks spectacular that's a great cake by the way we'll see how long that lasts i'm so impressed so far it looks like a peanut m&m that's really pretending it didn't have a bad day it's really intense i feel like yeah between the two of us with the $15 costume contest i'm always a fan of a cheap trip to hot topic so we have a sponsor tonight we are being brought to you by tor books does pac-man have anything to-- on that note of stealing books i don't know that was my best segue it's the segue i have we go with the segues we have merchandise i didn't say it was a good segue i said it was the segue we have this new setup is very strange the back of them is pretty cool too this is the sarenrae logo oh my god i can't believe it finally happened we have been working on this for quite a while i'll allow it this whole game is going to feel so horribly wrong with that accent i'm not going to fight it the critical role podcast is up on itunes google and geekandsundrycom we're up to apparently episode 55 i know that's a lot we've done over a hundred now it doesn't feel like that does it it doesn't make any sense i know slouching toward the end goddamn it it's also available on amazon alexa which i haven't quite figured out what that means yet but i'm fascinated by the notion of this we've talked about this we did a whole gag open critical role if you have one you can simply ask alexa to open critical role alexa open critical role i don't have one a lot of people are really angry at me now i hope so second issue of the comic book has come out it's amazing and it's fabulous and you two are adorable it's great let's see what else have we got here you and marisha did a thing that got released today i haven't seen the prequel yet but i saw some footage and it looked pretty intense yeah there's a little trailer on youtube that went up today if you want to get a glimpse if you want to get an idea of what the thing looks like the preview episode of the first season is available on twitch you can find that and see if you like the idea of people using a giant wooden tower to play a game it's pretty cool next week i'm not running another vampire game because this is stressful and i need to take a vacation let's be honest it's because this is stressful and i need to take a vacation boy am i really looking forward to being on the other side of this piece of wood man i would escape to another continent myself i choose you pikachu you should not wear makeup more often i think it really brings out your-- you have a natural glow to yourself right now so to keep things moving because apparently i should do that even though i'm really enjoying this there's no talks machina this tuesday because it's halloween instead of talks machina you're going to enjoy eric campbell's cthulhu one-shot on the 700-1000 time our wednesday club this week is going to be japanese influence on american comics with erika ishii which should be fun tomorrow we are doing our first little halloween fun with gather your treats on gather your party you're going to see my real halloween costume which is not on theme with this episode oh it's fancy as fuck it's bad you look fancy as fuck so i apologize things are going to be a little weird tonight i've got some tech things that i'm still figuring out but in the meantime i think that's the end of announcements i've got like half of one i'll finish it up encouraging all sorts of bad behavior we'll see if you live through the night that'll be cool i think it's time for us to take a moment and prepare ourselves so i can get a bit of my aggravation and pent-up frustration out on you as we start to pick up tonight's episode of thursday by midnight part two and again thank you to white wolf and to onyx for everything they've done and i'll talk a little bit about that during the game thank you guys so much and let's roll the game [dramatic music] you did find it and this perhaps is how somebody got access to this building i don't know right now you've got about ten feet of clearance on the little cap that's keeping the fire at bay a couple of you are still a little hungry you're fine at the moment he may have been a vamp or maybe he was just a really good guy you don't know he did have claws briefly there was some slight claw you would have noticed that to go back up you can't tell but you're welcome to find out if you recall you got buried without your iphones last time you're going to have to read a book like somebody from the olden days now just because i feel like being a bit of a jerk if you're going to use your heightened senses just burn a hunger actually give me a hunger roll i'm going to do something different just roll a d10 tell me what you get yeah just a red d10 all right you're fine six and above is a success and then you'll always have to roll your red dice you can lose them and gain them this tunnel that you're in from what you can see somebody burrowed somehow some creature made this and it's just big enough for like about two people and it goes down into a larger tunnel directly below you it's like a little offset do you hear sounds coming from the ipad let me find out you can hear the faint distant sound of a little bit of water a little moisture and it's a big tunnel so down there it could be anything there's definitely some sound down there you can see okay you can't see as well as he can so above you you're down in a little bit of a tunnel and it's at a bit of an angle and the basically giant circular manhole that is that table has stamped down and seems to be pressured down at the moment no you're feeling some heat but you're not getting any firelight he can kind of see something and there's a little light coming from the bottom of the tunnel there's just enough to make out some-- just at the very bottom there's enough you're going to go so fast like pacman all right you have to do a roll don't you or do you just have to-- oh no you don't you're fine roll a d10 tell me what you get yeah you get one point of hunger you're fine you're going to do it but here have a-- you get a little hungrier but yeah so you sneak down and the tunnel is larger than you'd expect it's 12 feet in diameter it's a carved out tunnel but not a technically carved tunnel there's like some animals that burrowed this big hole but did it very well something made this with some skill but it's not modern there's something weirdly ancient and a little unsettling about the whole tunnel it's not a sewer you were expecting a sewer it's not there it looks very stable and it looks like it's been there a long time it smells slightly sour like the algae that is growing on the walls this white crystalline algae that gives off a very gentle glow just a hint you're going to lick the algae a little lick the algae i'm going to say it tastes like algae no i mean it tastes awful it tastes of putrescense and death and awful this shit is disgusting the tunnel goes down-- the tunnel keeps going you can't see the end of it oh man this is so serious it's genuinely distracting you're probably not going to really run into anything for about a quarter of a mile in going down and eventually after about a quarter mile you can see a place where the modern sewer system has cut through this tunnel like someone hit this and decided to keep going and so there's a sewer system that's obviously city sewer although very old coming out at an angle hits this tunnel ignores it and continues in an odd way and this tunnel also keeps going around the corner so you can-- there's some options i'm so into this plan liam's tired oh wait sorry carry on i think sam's the only one who's actually-- you dress like that you also eat their ghosts so they're like the soulless really sorry there's a little bit of water in the sewer that's disgusting and probably will give you pink eye you'll eventually get to find out if vampires get pink eye i don't know and that's a question for-- no it didn't hurt you also didn't feel it because you're so fast no since you do have heightened senses you can hear some tiny bit of rattling around down one of the sewer tunnels you can hear some tiny bit of rattling around further down you head down it's about 200 feet before you get to a sewer lock off where there's an old power box and a small grate system that the water flows through but things do not there are definitely some rats rolling around and there's a weird brick square chimney that goes off up into god knows where and on the side of the wall is a small lock box/power box with some very old signage on it that's a little hard to read give me a dex brawl hi-chew three successes two failures not two ones though they're black ones three successes two black ones it's hard to read the handwriting it's a little tricky oh no you were going for the rat you did not grab the rat the rat got away yeah give me a perception awareness no dex and athletics and one blood failure it's really hard to read somebody scratched this in it takes you a minute it does say sanctuary skanktuary with a little arrow facing the way you came and either a cross or a t or something below it and the box has definitely been broken into there used to be a lock on the box but the lock is broken what did you roll oh yeah you got it give me a blood die back yes you can dex brawl very nice it takes you a minute but you get one you get a nice big one for travis so you can-- you can get rid of one of these it makes a bit of a mess there's some attempts you could make but the sewer path is definitely treacherous at this point further down that old tunnel all right this tunnel goes on for a long time what would i call this if anyone wants to make another perception awareness you don't give a shit and that's fine that's pacman life one one okay was it a blood one okay you've been paying some attention trying to figure out your direction and where you're going and how long you've been walking you are starting to go under mulholland you're heading towards the hills you're getting awful close to it it's been a couple miles you've been walking underneath this underground tunnel this really old tunnel since you had a decent perception it's burrowed but there's some very specific scratch marks since you've gotten a little further on there starts to be some rudimentary like almost a hobo code is what i would call it there's little symbols that have been left that obviously mean something but you don't know what they mean somebody's been in here you can i'll give that intelligence academics i was not expecting someone to go for the hobo code there are worse things in the world than one failure on a blood die two failures on a blood die is a problem you end up at the back of the group because you're staring at this stuff and it's not ringing a bell at all this is weird yeah you're drifting a little bit i mean you're a little cloudy you're not all there just the glow of the algae travis roll just perception there is something right above there is a creature in the tunnel with you directly above you it's very thin it's the same color as the walls it's almost camouflaged perfectly and it's vaguely reptilian you look up it goes scurrying at high speed when you look up back from the direction you came it darts back there you're going for it what level of celerity are you some sort of lizard something lizardy so you're using celerity two right celerity two i'm looking at the wrong thing here we go i'm trying to be good about this so you can actually climb vertical surfaces with celerity two make a hunger roll roll a d10 just 1d10 okay burn a hunger so you're about to get-- do you have five i thought you weren't hungry at all okay well fine i marked them all up and made them all pretty for this well you did and you just got an extra one so you're now at one hunger and you're peckish you do catch him you are fast and you climb up the wall and you come in contact with a humanoid lizard who turns looks at you with big gold eyes and (hissing screech) you can do that here we are roll strength brawl three successes yep you grab onto a leg and you've got a flailing angry lizard person currently grappled (hissing) let go let go you turn so quick god just for fun give me one more strength brawl laura liam and two successes one fail is the fail on the red how do you keep doing that oh is it a fail or a one it's a one okay no that means i can maybe-- you were very lucky yep he's not doing well with you how long has it been it's been two-- yeah you're there by then he didn't get very far celerity is mean (hissing monster noises) let go my name is lock this is my tunnel no vampires lock (hissing) vampires two weeks in my tunnel two weeks we've always been here i am genuinely amazed that you actually know that there are lizard people beneath the-- goddamn it that is some deep la myth man okay what's wrong with you people i twice have been beneath cities since its inception for thousands of years we have lived-- you are supposed to know this we had an arrangement with you you people are way too pitiful to be vampires i can do that i don't really-- that doesn't work if we're actually watching you you know that right it's like you got fuzzy for a second are you going to try presence awe i'm going to double check my-- so give me a roll of 1d10 well first give me a hunger roll since i'm learning how to-- you got a one all right you're getting an extra hunger but now do your charisma plus persuasion where's my lizard my god oh what nope yeah you're not alone yeah lock's looking at you you look familiar i don't know why hmm gets about that much sun and-- hmm i wouldn't recommend it i can bring you to someone you can talk to i blame you two you've put it in my head he's got a flattened face and very big gold eyes and sharp shark teeth in the mouth it's a very big chop but he's thin and smaller don't know if he has pinkies well yeah he could put something out put a claw you can do you want to do charisma or manipulation you don't know i'm going to give you charisma persuasion stamina hashtag stanima they made us character sheets with stanima on them i know this is weird but i swear we've met you look very familiar no might have been smart girls to be fair to you you'd never know if there were lizard people working that seems fair yes come i'll take you to the chamber well that depends we'll see you're going to follow him further down sure roll a blood die just one die you rolled a one didn't you you get another hunger what are you at now is that a proper die did i give you one with an x it doesn't matter you know if you rolled a one now you can roll your check for that that was to see if you get hungrier from using it one blood failure it's going to take you a little while to figure it out but he seems frustrated you get a frustrated vibe from his aura there's nothing duplicitous yet if anything you're getting a little activity up here like he's wracking his brain trying to figure out what is going on he seems just as confounded by this perhaps you go down a little further through this cave until you come into a huge clearing that is-- that was amazing at home if you want to simulate the studio right pump that heat up to about 100 degrees it's great there's a big interior cavern that you seem to be under you're probably pretty deep now we're probably deeper than the subway tunnels probably just barely on the other side or a little further past mulholland maybe a little deeper and you come into these two giant stone lions that have started to decay and crumble and there's a big beautiful stone sign that is decaying falling apart and covered with this strange luminescent moss and it says luna park you were thinking of the restaurant how do you know the restaurant i'm so impressed by you as you come in you pass through these arches and there's this strange what can only be described as a supervillain's lair this is an abandoned theme park underground there's a lake in front of you with a beautiful boardwalk that has crumbled into disrepair there's a strange pyramid volcano in the distance there's a strange little amphitheatre to the left that looks like an ancient roman colosseum odd gardens with strange luminous plants growing if you peek in the back you can see the beginning of cages perhaps for animals slightly less than about half a stadium i'll tell you what not that we don't have but if you want to see it you can get a notion of it it's big from the bottom laura the main entrance wow lock he is guiding you past the lake to a strange-- no mm-hmm i'll tell you about this at the break and then i'll tell you where that map came from it's fascinating this is my other hobby that i'm bringing into this game 5000 years ago 5000 years is how long lizard people have been in los angeles man no i got shit as he brings you past the lake and he brings you past the amphitheatre and the strange gardens with these strange luminous lilies and these orchids that are growing that never seen sunlight you come to this weird old victorian house that's obviously a facade into a basic black box like in an amusement park and above it it says the house of trouble the house of trouble and he is turning up-- not of treble it's not the house of treble the house of trouble not treble well then you're going to be very disappointed when you go in and he gestures for you to enter inside will be those who know what to do with the four of you i'll follow my brother thank you alex jaffe for making a judgment call there you know maybe if you had gone to burning man he would have a better opinion of you no it's alex both of my brothers are now dipping their head in panic that's a smart place to be you're not taking that three very well are you really not taking that three well good to remember so sorry as i check my notes thank you as you enter what appears to have once been perhaps some strange boat ride some weird tunnel of love ride where you have boats that go through some strange cave has been drained and you step into the cavern and you walk into the back and as you curl around into the main amphitheater of the ride it is blindingly plated with gold there is ancient beautiful almost a little bit of mayan a little bit of north american hopi indian design decked through this room it is gleaming with a gold glow from all of the plates that have been intricately set into this room from the throne that has been set up in the center to the benches that have been placed around like a bit of an observation court like a surgical observation you're sitting in a pit in a theater thank you it's all too old to tell it's like walking into a temple it's hard to tell what came first and what didn't about 50 it's like a surgical theater you're going to be at the bottom and then there are rows of people at the top and there's not a ton of people if you can call them people there there's about 20 lizard men gathered around taking a look you probably can't tell gender yet and i wouldn't even necessarily know how one would tell gender off the top of my head i knew you would there is obviously a leader lock is coming in from the back and is joined by two or three others who are not pressuring you inside but definitely making sure you're not about to run as you enter and stand in the center of the theater lock turns to the lizard creature in the largest most ornate gold chair and turns and says my lord kotori we found them in the tunnels but i don't think they are necessarily the ones that have been causing our problems and kotori takes a moment looking over all four of you well explain yourselves then what are you doing in our tunnels when we have a very fair agreement with the vampires above that you mind your own business roll your blood and then roll your charisma you get one more hunger where are you at what am i going to do with that hold on all right you're fine one critical success two tens oh my god on blood dice that changes things okay that's good to know so it worked definitely seems like he's looking at you with nodding respect another gaunter lizard comes up to kotori on the side be careful of this one i think he's trying to manipulate you and kotori sits and looks at you there are rules and protocols in place for these things and ignorance of the law is not absolution from the law however you did not know and the fact that you did not know goes to show there's something very wrong you should not exist and not know this somebody has made a mistake i can make you lizards (laughing) no i can't do that but you're funny you're not as smart as the other ones are you so disturbing it's really hard to work through well obviously the four of you are not our problem but the fact that you're down here is our problem there have been vampires in our tunnels for three weeks there are rules there are protocols and obviously they have been ignored do you have any notion of what has been going on do you perhaps have any kernel of thought as to the nature of this why have people been in our tunnels interesting as he's about to speak from the back one of the other lizards goes i've heard of gary gygax this other lizard comes up and starts whispering in kotori's ear seems very excited about something we have internet down here we're not savages apparently members of our council are aware of your show you are everywhere you are literally everywhere things would have gone so much better if you had kotori is giving you an eye but the other guy is not making eye contact he's breaking and making eye contact it's hard to tell man what's the difference can you tell the difference between an old iguana and a young iguana they look pretty healthy sadly we do not sadly no the few animals we do have here have purposes in the menagerie but perhaps we can come to an arrangement something has gone wrong we are going to have to re-establish some rules and you're obviously someone else's problem we will give you passage to the surface we will show you where you can come in contact with some individuals who can clear things up we will send you to the people whose problem you are as opposed to ours and in return you will deliver a message you will tell them that we are displeased and that we have to have words and that they must find a way of becoming friends with us again we will need-- a boon they will owe us for their transgression and you will deliver our message oh they may kill you vampires are not known for their kindness you won't have to be up there for very long lock mahlo take them to the pyramid show them to los globos yes of course no we've been here for thousands of years i am merely 250 300 at this point you'll know what that feels like if you're lucky we have actually really good broadband down here it's insane of course yeah i've listened to the whole thing good luck and lock see if you can't wrangle them up something to eat on the way up there lock nods and starts leading you all along with mahlo who's definitely not quite grinning i'm not entirely sure what you would call this weird curl at the side as they lead you to the pyramid at the very back it's like an iguana smile mahlo lock kotori are the three we've met so far mahlo and lock are taking you to the pyramid you'll find out i'm so amused by all of this as you walk back across the lake past the not-quite-abandoned zoo but slightly abandoned there are definitely some creatures in there that look vaguely familiar there's something a little off about all of them it's as if somebody had grabbed a mountain lion and bred them for a few centuries and saw what happened without sunlight so they've all started to lose their eyes and they've all got the little bit of milky appendage eye everything's gotten a little weird down here and there's a lot again that white luminescent algae everywhere that spiky crystalline white luminescent algae is everywhere so as you climb the steps of the pyramid and i'm going to also point out this is obviously a man-made pyramid and maybe only about 80 years old and like disneyland-bullshit pyramid definitely a little iffy and has seen better days you don't want to get mercer-ed or marisha-ed marisha-ed is worse in my opinion if you're going to go go quick that requires a power ranger helmet too you make your way up the slightly cartoonish pyramid at the very top there's another one of those weird little square cube exits that you saw in the sewer all the way to the top and then there's a drop ladder that goes right into a little brick cavern it's only big enough for one person at a time and you have to crawl up on those awful fire escape ladders from the 40s and there's more of that awful white crystalline algae cool actually-- i'm so fucking with you you cool you ain't that cool are you actually going to try and-- give me a dexterity athletics how many successes you don't fly but you manage after you make a good leap and by the time you realize that gravity is reasserting itself upon your person you are smart enough to extend your hands and legs out and-- you made a good hop it was impressive it was very impressive how are we going to do this give me a willpower check just straight willpower three successes you do not give a little squirt of poop then well done you can't be bats eventually after quite a few feet that ladder goes up and up and up it's about 450 500 feet before anything stops and then it's a 90 degree turn and that brick cavern goes straight out it is a very claustrophobic crawl just l's really hard more underground in that same cube that's not big enough to stand up in it's about maybe three feet by three feet it's a little claustrophobic do you want to listen or do you want to really listen no i love that you're indiana jones-ing this no although i mean you're way up there now you've left these plebs behind lock will also look around and do the-- yes of course yes we can do that i don't care mahlo is losing their shit a little bit it hurts man i give you a critter and that's how you-- mahlo will remember this cool give me a dex athletics just for fun that's okay this is not hard nothing bad happens but you miss on your first attempt you can get one more that's all you needed actually i should have done the-- never mind i can use that next time i keep forgetting i have this mechanic they gave me that's super cool and i'm not taking advantage of it sorry white wolf i'll start doing that because it's a cool mechanic i think they're in chat yeah you make it you're crawling up you guys are going yeah they'll give you a little boost up you can get at whatever speed you like that you want to get up there because you are fast as all hell you've got a long tunnel to crawl to it is not comfortable it is a little claustrophobic it's a little cramped i want everyone to really quickly roll a d10 for me you rolled a one though let's have a little fun with you where's my little chart where's my chart of pain i have too many papers ah here we go there's my chart of pain let's give you-- you've got the hangries you're a little irritated you're having trouble thinking clearly and you are not subtle about anything you're going to have a really hard time being clever it's just that yeah it doesn't feel good you get what i'm getting at travis do you understand are you sure you're clear cool so yeah this is a bit of a trek you come out as you finally breach through and you seem to be in a crypt in the hollywood cemetery mm-hmm there is a gate it is unlocked this is practically an easy access to the surface there are two caskets stacked on the side other than this little broken hole in the floor that you came through oh yeah you can see through it it's just a gate it is still night just barely well it's not locked or anything it's just a gate i'm not going to make you fight doors it is getting a little cramped in here because it's only big enough for like four coffins and it's already two coffins full there is a name-- no there's actually no writing on the inside it's all on the outside it's filthy but other than that-- all right you step out into the late night it feels like time did not move at an appropriate speed like the night is still darker than it should be you don't know how long you were down there but it feels like you were down there a little longer than this it's entirely possible but you're not sure mm-hmm it just says macbeth there are definitely some humans around just walking around it is not movie night for those of you who don't know we have movie nights at our cemetery because that's fun it's not a goth party they look like hipsters in hollywood hanging out at the hipster cemetery if you walk around a little bit-- are you going to look around and find a potential victim i'm going to say right now from your experience it is possible not to kill people when you drink from them by the way i know good for you what's your hunger level okay so you definitely have something resembling morality functioning right now okay and i'll add you still have two lizard people who have now put up little hoods so they're a little more incognito but it's hollywood so who really would notice two people with lizard faces legitimately we wouldn't care we don't care this is how they've been here for five thousand years no one cares yeah there's a well there's always the porta-potties you're into it all right as you curl around there's usually that little set that are out by the street and there's not too many people in the cemetery tonight wandering around being silly just a minute you can give a try see how this goes strength brawl only one fail you pull and you're not succeeding you're like thunk thunk and all you hear from the inside is dude really come on you're going to wait you wait for a minute and there's definitely sounds coming from in there it's a blue porta-potty this is what you're getting are you going to take a moment to look around and see if anybody's looking all right so you hear things finishing up there take a look around give me a perception where are we perception awareness three successes one failure but one failure okay the door unlocks starts to swing open and you're in you didn't even look you're going for it all right you're in so let me remember how to do this i'm so amused there are absolutely more subtle ways but that's not how this is happening you could attempt to yeah but at this point where am i it's strength brawl plus two two successes and one failure is that with the plus two from the vampire fangs yeah strength plus brawl plus two oh try again this is a new system i'm being gentle on people okay and the one failure's a one all right it's a bit of a struggle but you get in there how heavy are you draining this person you can top off if you like but if-- yeah you can attempt to top off or you can feed until you're not ravenous you're going to top off you're going to drink until you don't want to drink any more all right you are at zero hunger you feel perfectly normal and you have a body in here all of them they're all gone you're staring and he looks really familiar will friedle was out-- will didn't even have the moment of seeing your face he never even saw what happened actually i assure you that an entire body can fit in there don't ask me how i know it's not thankfully there's no concert it's not that bad you have pressed will beneath the fluids yeah the lizards are trying to usher you guys out of the cemetery you're going to hunt while you're in the cemetery are you in your pac-man suit no you're not never mind there are definitely people around they're all over the place are you going to go wander they all look pretty juicy i suppose no there's groups of people at the moment hanging out together who wants to look for people they recognize yeah i don't know i don't feel like tourists go to hollywood cemetery but i'm into it do a perception awareness so yeah nobody you recognize off the top of your head but there's a small obviously low-key film shoot happening in the corner somebody's shooting some bullshit youtube shit and i swear to god it looks like it's mike diva and manzi's definitely there a couple people that you definitely recognize hey oh laura hey i know i know i didn't call you for the shoot i mean i've been really busy are you doing a shoot you've got like a whole-- that's cool i've done that that's cool i mean yeah i mean we're a little busy are we-- do we got-- do you want to try and-- give me a charisma persuasion i'm so sorry mike no yes he does yeah you guys can reset this yeah i've got a second all right show me what you guys are working on that's cool yeah he's into it honestly he's already pulling out his vape pen i haven't had time to have any fun lately that's cool you're on the critical role thing too i hear that's cool hey what's up man yes yeah do i get to be a vampire no no no we can work okay i can make you a deal we can do a deal with this this is not my first rodeo it's hollywood i've been around you got one round but i want to be a vampire you got to work that out you do some work for me i'm going to do some work for you you know i don't actually know where you guys are sitting-- whoa you going for it all right give me a strength brawl plus two make a perception roll perception awareness ooh how much do you want to drain him you're going to destroy my favorite youtube channel like that with no-- you're going to try and stop him all right really quickly i need to double check this what's your wits plus brawl i know that's weird six together what's your wits plus brawl ooh both roll a d10 one d10 each you got a six he got a four he goes before you so he's going to at least get half of him drained before-- you jump on his back after he's got-- half your blood pool is empty and you can decide what you do about the-- this is so dark you can honestly how hungry were you i'll say you got three out of your system he's got a little bump on the head but he had just taken a serious vape oh you totally bit me oh give some warning man oh god i'm going to go back to my shoot yeah you guys need to figure your shit out jesus argh ow god dude not cool not cool kotori and mahlo are looking at you guys a little like-- totes we'll take you to where you need to go and we're going to take a break while we take a gentle stroll to los globos that got so weird i'm so pleased i hope now that mike has survived i hope you all take a moment to go check out his youtube channel it's quite pleasing mike diva thank you guys we'll be back in a few minutes there's also going to be a giveaway in the chat but i think that's all going to be in the little video there's going to be a video about the password otherwise we have dice coasters and thank you tor books we will continue with this madness when we come back from a little bit of a snack cake [break] it was actually a really good cake i feel a little guilty for eating it the winner by the way of our contest in the chat room was sharpe_liquid sharpe liquid congratulations that's a great little call sign that's pretty cool i hope you guys are enjoying this ridiculousness i had to take some layers off because it's really hot so serious this is super super serious are we doing this (pac-man noises) so where were we that's right let me get my volume back up can't kill mike diva mika diva's got to do his thing man there's no stopping mike diva no there is definitely some stopping will friedle you can leave will friedle at the bottom of the blue tank slowly dissolving they are going to find his body that is going to be a problem for another game it's somebody else's vampire game is going to run into will friedle's body so we had left the cemetery and its roving hipsters and film crews and will friedle we're slowly making our way through the city up to-- this is why every person that we know who i know i can't do an impression of i just introduce them to liam and i know it's never going to be a problem should have just given you mary elizabeth that would have just been easy peasy because i can't do that we make our way slowly up to sunset boulevard where you are brought to the door of los globos a skeezy-looking club it's maybe two three stories it's hard to tell it's built into a hill it's hard to get an idea of the place you can't tell how big it is really it's just got a big red fiery sign that says los globos on the front and there's a doorman in there you don't know you can't tell i could tell you don't have a phone man you could have taken diva's phone but you didn't think about that did you man they took all your good shit before they put you in anything in order to stay lock and mahlo take a second and show you inside lock comes forward the ones you're looking for are inside good luck vampires i don't know good luck and they peace out they are out and leaving you to your own devices here you're currently outside although the bouncer inside has witnessed enough of this and seems deeply unimpressed by two lizard people having this conversation that he's just sitting with his clicker waiting for you guys to walk in you don't need ids you're fine you do yeah click click yeah the lizard people brought you in nah no you walk through a pretty scummy hallway it's definitely sticky in here and it's dark and there's some thumping music alcohol sticky because that's just the best club there is for reasons of a) that i don't want you screaming over each other and b) finding music that i could have used on short notice is just ridiculous there is thumping dropping industrial music in this club there are people dancing it's definitely a goth industrial club there's some hairstyles there's multicolored hair there's a lot of people wearing black clothing there is a lot of lights and laser effects there's a dj doing his job who's a little old and craggily and there is nothing you recognize off the top of your head but it looks like a decent goth club there are men women and definitely-- you want to look for a vip area you got to watch my guide to goth dancing you're doing fine but that's okay you're doing the pac-man that's cool give me a perception awareness roll for the vip lounge if you're thinking about how you're going to get a drink i'm fascinated it's fine yeah so you know guy in his mid-30s short haircut black t-shirt obviously he's probably here five nights a week and for five different clubs yeah yeah can i get you something beer on tap we do a couple absinthe drinks but they're overpriced what do you want yep card and id i have seen weirder interactions with bartenders this is nowhere near the weirdest interaction i don't want you to fail are you going to use presence awe all right give me a 1d10 blood check and then-- ooh where did it go three where's my blood pool yep you get one hunger yes you notice actually in a gothic red sign there's a little velvet rope and a sign that reads food is only served in the vip lounge there is a big bouncer very big pale older-looking gentleman you have a name on the list okay well i would recommend getting on the list i don't know man make an intelligence investigation check i'm going to get weird on this one give me intelligence occult you have no idea he's big it's up the stairs it's a little hard to see you can't quite tell who's up there there's a rope and then it goes upstairs and there it turns a corner it's practically a different club good luck you've got to roll it now he gives you a look over are you sure that this is the bar you want to be drinking at are you sure that you wouldn't rather have something from the cocktail list oh my god dude this dance battle is killing me it's hard to miss oh man that's a lot of info you should probably be upstairs man yeah you've got a name just drop a name at the front they'll let you right in yeah you're fine you'll be fine but no trouble down here we keep this clean sure and he makes a club old fashioned what's muddled he muddles the fruit like he just reminds it that it's ordinary and then hands it off it tastes like gasoline it's awful it burns it doesn't feel good it's petrol you've never been to a goth club have you you can certainly try oh man oh lauryn oh dear it's a girl with a large blue mohawk and a bunch of metal barbs tied into the large blue mohawk she is doing this heavy interpretive dance she takes a look at you spins around and an elbow goes right into your chest what's your-- no you're hungry but you're fine suddenly a completely different elbow ends up in your chest from somebody else there is another there's a guy with long black hair and he's wearing a little tie and a nice vest and suddenly another elbow is right in your chest and that's what happens when you try and hit on people on the dance floor at a goth club the girl turns to you and goes he's really not you seem to recall he had an iphone can you do that this is a trick or are you really doing it you just want me to say stanima and i'm going to do it for you stanima oh man i'm going to add survival i know that's weird but i'm adding survival to this stanima and survival stanima i'm saying it you're even doing the hands right yeah you do not even break eye contact with him do you dude what's wrong with you man he's definitely staring at a broken finger you're going to wait a while you can try to go let me double-check because-- you got to roll a 1d10 and tell me what you get you are now one more hunger die up but i think you could just do it i'm just double-checking because-- oh now you have to roll wits and stealth thank you i was looking for that he rolled really poorly and he was pretty distracted yeah you would have my undivided attention i'm just saying that if you broke a finger in front of me i would not be looking at anything else that's actually a good point i think you definitely have to take a point of damage so just mark off that you just took a point of damage yeah under the health bar just put a line through one of those humanity we're ignoring because it's because i'm deciding that it's far more interesting to play with when you have a longer more complicated game it's sadly at the moment we've dropped humanity no she's nigh invisible he's still staring at a finger all right roll a d10 you got a hunger die oh yeah i'm throwing them out anyway as it makes me feel excited let's do dexterity and dodge to see if you can get past this guy it's okay he's distracted one blood fail i think you stand there staring for a little while at where laura was wondering if she was going to go and you stand there and stare for so long that you don't realize that he is actually-- the bouncer is like i'm going to go get you some gauze or something man no i'll be right back oh that's nasty man yeah that's a little nasty he's going to walk to the bar and once he goes to the bar you make a dash up fun fact there is no such thing as vampire shock roll a strength plus two since there's no real-- laura and those are two blood criticals okay so this is called a messy critical so you bite his finger clean off you don't know how this works give me a strength plus two roll for your wrist yeah you're just gnawing at yourself it's not going well yeah plus two more dice you have now managed to damage yourself take a point of damage for gnawing through your wrist the bouncer is now coming back over and he's coming what-- you are literally holding his finger right now i'm just pointing that out wow roll a charisma persuasion that's so solid man that's some comic con shit right there fuck two successes one blood fail this guy ain't that bright they're the ones that really count this is more than i'm really up for this is a lot he's just going to shove i can't-- you have traumatized this poor bouncer this was not a good night for him do you want to think about making your finger not be a problem anymore are you going to try to meditate upon that roll a hunger die yeah let me see hold on i'm trying to find all my stuff-- here we are your finger does not grow back but it stops bleeding and crystallizes it is a deep dark crystalline red it's got a little bit of shimmer to it not twilight sparkle motherfuckers twilight sparkle secret messages it's the best but it almost seems to glow with a life of its own there's something about it that's a little brighter there's something about it that's a little more-- it's part of your aura perception your blood almost seems to have a life of its own there's something about it that's supernatural really really awful fanart but beyond that-- the best the best fanart this is not the worst thing i've seen in a vampire game let me check (scoffs) are you going to try and heal your wrist too as well you can try it's weird man it tastes weird it's making you feel weird it's like dodger dog weird that's probably for the best that's pretty much what you have to go on right now roll a d10 you gain a hunger but your wrist seems to-- you've got them that's fine rob me of all my joy i will remember this you're healed for that this is where the real club is it's a completely different dj it's a completely different crowd except of course that being a goth industrial club it could've been the same dj and the exact same crowd and no one would ever notice it's still a bunch of people dressed in black no it's just a different track of the same vibe yes actually there's a lot of black leather there's a lot of black vinyl people have obviously dressed up and done nice makeup you can't tell if necessarily everybody is wearing the nice makeup but it's definitely-- these are some pretty people who have gone out of their way to be extra pretty tonight this is a large dance floor with a main stage for the dj you're such a gift ugh nothing no there are some little corner tables all around the outskirts there's obviously a couple dance boxes but there are corner tables all around the outskirts but they all seem roped off and there are definitely people sitting there who seem like they have these tables on reserve no golden thrones just wumpa wumpa music a couple go-go boxes a-- there is a bar there is a very nice bar three sides two bartenders are you really just doing the chattanooga choo choo i really hope you are all right are you going to try and chat up a guy or a girl where is he where is he tonight the girl who has her back towards you who was ignoring you turns around and satine looks you in the face and says what the fuck are you talking about hey sam did you-- is that what's been going on so you're all-- all right that's cool yeah yeah why there are no-- we come in and shoot at night man have you not been paying attention this whole time you are really oblivious it's like-- hey yeah no you're-- wow you got the whole thing going on wow this has been a rough week then okay no you look like you're doing okay what happened this is a once-a-week thing it's very exclusive i'm amazed even with this that you guys got-- this is a very serious thing like this is-- this place yeah what do you need you want a drink you need anything i mean twitchcon was this week i've been really busy i've got a whole-- like dead holy shit okay hold on-- nah this is weird normally there's a lot of talk about-- okay i'm going to talk to a few people you guys-- hmm oh god you know i've been asking him to come out to this club for ages and he just never comes out i mean not that i'm aware of he's his own thing that's just a whole thing but you know as far as i know he's never been here oh that's a complicated story we'll get into that's complicated but it's good that you're here we're going to work this out why don't you guys just don't ruffle any feathers go have a drink have a cocktail the whole menu's special it'll be good no you're fine you got a twitch show you're great (laughs) thankfully this is a club that caters to people whose tastes haven't changed in decades so you're going to be-- you're going to fit in but no no ace of base i'll be right back i got just the thing hold on he goes and there is literally a tap that gets pulled and a red foamy lager pulls four weird foamy beers that are definitely-- st valentine's day specials is what i'll say they smell if i had to place it-- it's the best it's tomato juice and vodka and just a little something special a little bit of worcestershire it's got a little bit of that wow i'd never even thought about that and now it's going to be the only thing i think about for the rest of the night what's a california king coffin look like very comfortable they're not comfy a look of malcontent there's a mix of faces in the crowd there's definitely some indifference there's some people who are eyeing you very suspiciously and a few smiling faces who seem delighted that would require a blood roll yeah i love the toss you also lose a blood die because of-- if you have one you have to be at one at all times two successes yeah something smells a little doggish there's a little wolf but it's not what you had last time it's something else yeah there's definitely a bouncing bobbing erika ishii who's jumping around the crowd having a good time and she just seems happy that's-- as she sees you (squealing) what i mean yeah oh my god oh ages yeah doesn't it sunscreen it's a trick no it's why she has such great hair it's the undead hair of the undead it's the haircut that did it all the energy seems to be-- oh yeah from her i mean that makes sense doesn't it that's a different vibe than you've got sadly you've got a different vibe going on yeah yeah hey what well i mean they're here i don't know what's going on is just a party it's great yeah it's so great (shouting) i'll be right back she bounces out there's a few minutes of sitting watching this crowd there's definitely slowly starting to become more concerned faces checking you out yeah well give me a perception awareness just for fun just see if you maybe know any of these people critical success yeah there's a few people that you're starting to recognize but not people you know personally but there's definitely-- there's a few people who have a tv deal in here there's a couple serious tv deals in here there's definitely a couple familiar faces rounding around nobody that you're close to but there's a-- few ironic faces juliet landau wanders through for a second and just nods and walks by they're nodding and obviously talking about something and after a while somebody comes up and talks to erika for a second in the corner and she comes bounding over they want to talk to you guys no i'm sure it's fine you just got to be cool you guys are cool you guys are cool yeah it's fine and you're taken to a far corner table the furthest deepest corner so that you have the best-- it's the furthest away from the speakers it's really nice you can actually talk like humans and there very gently spinning a very nice cocktail is a mildly irritated-looking yuri lowenthal it makes so much sense doesn't it why they never age the two of them just don't age do they he's just peppering with fake color in the hair that's all it is hey i mean this is weird guys so what happened like honestly we don't know no one-- well there was a fire it's all-- oh of course well we'll get to taliesin so colville did this was this his doing wait gygax did this laura travis and so this is all gygax or was this colville and gygax working together why does that guy got to be so weird man sure oh no oh yeah this wasn't part of the plan for a while i've been working towards this so yeah this has been a goal for a while oh yeah of course oh no we're raising him just perfectly we're trying to do it right raising him normally letting him find himself it's going to be a while before we-- oh it takes about a week and there's a whole ritual that's involved and usually a becoming usually somebody-- well you're supposed to have somebody-- yeah this is a problem there is-- normally there's a process for this and this is a problem you're supposed to have a sponsor let's put it this way like tor books tor books you're supposed to have a sponsor and really this is tricky because there's a process to just make sure you don't go around killing people and making a scene in these things and there's really-- and you guys haven't done anything inappropriate yet have you yeah wow yeah i mean i'm not that high up though i'm really here because they thought that you should have a familiar face and there's a bunch of us here who're in it for you guys but there's a lot of conversation about what to do with the four of you we don't even know what family you belong to this is all so complicated you see this is the problem (sighs) this is where things get so complicated well (sighs) we've been giving this a lot of thought and-- i wish i could i'm not-- i just don't really have that kind of-- no i'm not going to do that but that has come up as an option well you're going to need some kind of sponsor or we're going to have to deal with you i don't know i guess i'll see if there's anybody around who's up to dealing with this and we're going to have to get-- i'm going to have to get just a little bit of blood from all four of you because we have to figure out who you are and where you belong so-- laura and he pulls out a little pinprick and a couple cups a couple little wine glasses it doesn't really do what you were hoping it was going to do but you get some stuff out of there it is as if the circulation is not really moving the way it's supposed to you can juice it yeah it makes me so happy it's all i'm really going for yeah you're a little crusty all over too but you get in there your skin got a little crusty nothing's wrong with liam's face it's totally normal yeah that's a tricky one we're going to have to deal with that really yeah that will do it so everybody gets a die you got a hunger die you got a hunger die you got a hunger die you got a hunger die so they go take those in back yuri gets up on stage stops the dj ladies and gentlemen we have a bit of a conundrum gary went and did something dumb this week and i think we all saw it coming he's been acting weird with the end of critical role he was getting a little depressed he's been feeling bad for a while and he may have taken matters into his own hands and it feels like it's caused a bit of a disruption we figured out some of it and thankfully now we've contained most of the problem but we have these four right here we're getting some results very soon but is there anybody in the audience-- is there anybody here tonight who would like to sponsor one of these four well i'll tell you what really quickly give me your wits brawl wits plus brawl no you don't have to roll it just tell me what's your number your wits plus brawl is six total all right all right and give me roll perception and awareness yeah really quickly okay that will do you suddenly feel a weird pressure as a piece of wood comes bursting out of the front of your chest (gasping) he's not dead but you do take four points of health damage four serious points of health damage while you're doing that-- you're going to turn around and see who did it you turn around and it is sadly satine who had a stake there you can-- yeah roll a-- let's see that was a surprise run so-- give me a-- what you're going to try and attack her give me another wits brawl wits plus brawl yeah roll that really quickly yeah you attempt to and it does not go well she takes a swing with a knife roll a dex dodge oh boy one critical success yeah you manage to stumble out of the way and now you're rolling with a piece of wood in your chest you're now rolling into the front stage no takers on that one satine seems to say looking at the three of you do you have something better to say the audience appears to be looking at you i can't tell you suddenly out of the crowd-- --wil wheaton slowly walks up to you and gives you a big hug he's going to stab you in the back roll dex dodge roll dex dodge oh boy wil rolls really well when i'm rolling for him i'm going to let this be a succeed at a cost you give him a shove but there's like a knife scrapes your back as you shove away you take one point of damage on the health yeah (laughs) you use presence awe on wil on satine on who erika is also slowly walking towards you you're going to try and-- roll your dice man that was good she seems receptive to it she's starting to get that smile and then you feel shoved from behind someone just shoves you from behind oh yeah that did it and now a stake hits you right in the back erika's still staring at you i do but my boss would get really mad at me and behind you is felicia day staring down going no oh no i know roll strength brawl no one stabbed travis it works you are pinned to her and she takes the pain and it's-- how much are we doing here stakes are mean you haven't-- and i'm going to let her since you're now top to bottom and you're holding on okay she is going to just take her knife and start cutting your head right off you are literally pinned to her like a thumbtack you do i was about to say you can try to dodge out of the way that was a really good-- you just knocked her and she went straight up for it so you should try that would be a-- that's your initiative roll so it would be a dex dodge oh yeah no yeah you're looking pretty rough that was five more points of health you're starting to powder on the floor roll a blood die and then roll a i'm really sorry liam but this is just not the kind of content we're really looking to make right now but really thank you for everything thank you for all of this and i'm so sorry sorry it's going to hurt a little i'm trying to make it not hurt sorry and she takes a stab pushes a little deeper yeah you're staked and down and you're not probably getting back up yeah yeah but she tastes of death make a charisma persuasion roll yeah you can help him charisma persuasion you just add your successes together you could burn a willpower you can reroll any you like as many as you like out of the back room runs mary elizabeth who goes i'll take that one it's okay i've got this one you she takes you and goes over satine walks over to you and goes oh no you're fine you don't smell of death well then we will say welcome to the tremere family and welcome to the toreador family we'll train you we will talk and we will see what else-- oh yes we will sleep for the day and then in the morning we will figure out precisely what it is that you can do and who may have been responsible for creating you in the first place satine satine's taking you well done for not-- and with that they lead you to the basement of the club where there are clean fresh coffins for everybody to sleep in they're powder wow i was really hoping to tpk everyone but you guys made it through the evening all you had to do was to kill diva and that would have been the fucking end of it thank you everybody for letting me-- you don't know what happened to taliesin i know what happened to taliesin yeah travis and yeah no yeah taliesin was in the back room mm-hmm because he was in a cage it's a long story we'll get there one day taliesin was not doing well he may have done some bad things yeah i've got to say this is a wonderful system that i'm a very big fan of and thank you all for joining me in this ridiculousness i was really hoping to give you guys the tpk you all wanted but fucking laura just had to be a good guy and let diva live it's okay it's great she saved your ass man and then you saved hers to be fair she was going to go too so if you guys want the v5 alpha there's a little playthrough online that you can find i'm sure someone in the chat can lead you to it also onyx has got reams of stories of the old books for this game including live action role-playing there used to be these great city by night books la by night new york by night and all these wonderful references i always love that you can pull interesting-- these are great characters for pulling weird historical bits of different cities out because some of these people actually lived to see it which is always fun so yeah look up the lizard people in la and those were fun those were real things and los globos is a weird little club in la still up and running it's where das bunker happens and sorry diva for-- thank god we did not kill diva and manzey we love you both very much and thank you for everybody who's watched this evening thank you for everybody who offered to be a sacrifice for this episode i did see you but i was not prepared to kill critters yet and thank you for not killing the one critter i gave you although i would have been really interested to see if you guys had eaten lizard people that was an option their blood would have been weird yeah i had some interesting rules i brewed up for eating lizard people and how it would affect you this has been fun this has been exhausting i can't believe matt mercer does this every week i'm ready to pull my mohawk off i may have already pulled my mohawk off oh god and next week it's going to be you thank you everybody i hope you have a wonderful halloween weekend if you have time tomorrow thank you to our sponsor tor books and if you have time to check out some of our
