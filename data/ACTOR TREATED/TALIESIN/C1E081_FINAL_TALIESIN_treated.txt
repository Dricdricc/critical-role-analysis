yeah it's like our very own this american life episode -i'm so excited - loot - i was with you - yeah it was definitely worth it yeah it was worth it i just imagine like light slapping in the face just eight times pow hit point hit point once the lair is safe i want to get in and start examining it - i am moving towards it oh good this is-- this is a face i would like to see to break the awkward briefly dear wait yeah now that-- now that we've sent the word maybe now-- (indistinct talking) the conversation's underground are there-- are there any soldiers running around by the way right now any of our people i'm gonna fire a couple of times into the air just to get some attention and just spread the word thordak has fallen spread the word now we can go down i don't speak that wow that's the end of his turn fair no yes angry t-rex this is the best thing ever and i'm not calling this a failure i'm not calling this a failure - we bought time - what two dragons it's a critical role sticker - vinyl sticker she downright ran i'll miss you (laughter) i think it's probably-- well-- wow that would be-- - try and clear my guns in the hopes that they're actually gonna work so proficiency whoa there you go are we calling this a short rest is that what's happening right now are we having like some sort of spontaneous short rest oh my god yeah you know we just fought two dragons they can handle this it's a shake weight it's a shake weight (laughing) it can't stop moving i would hope so ironically there are two gold coins inside (laughing) oh boy did you find anything useful i'm gonna start wandering into this mess this is exciting i'm so excited idiocy no they would have just put them into the rock so excited i don't think i would have the guts to do it i think--'cause i would know i would not have the guts smoke 'em if you got 'em only travis travis is the only one no don't look at the screen don't look at the screen that's not gonna make anyone feel better (cross talk) it's a centerfold please don't decimate the antiquities is it a strength or dex weapon ah but really it's a meal (cross talk) twenty three no no no no no oh he looks-- they can make a lot of things they can make a lot of bad things if i recall it doesn't take much i was going to say let's put it somewhere where no one will ever find it but that will be fine for now wow ah i'm with you - healing up fixing my guns and then sort of trying to navigate some of this crazy in here and then eventually looking around the cavern to see if there's anything i've got 102 i legitimately think this is the one she tried to replace the one we stole it's her other carpet - well she should only ever needs one we just keep taking it that's a very useful find - and with that yeah i'd love to take a look around the room see if anything captures my eye i'm gonna run on up there and get a vantage point 'cause i still have some spider walk-- i can't pretend -i can't pretend that that's-- - why am i even bothering six now we'll we'll take a tithing for ourselves to help rebuild and then everything we're gonna have to post guards and someone is gonna have to take charge of all this put it to a use rebuilding the city make sure that the antiquities get back to the proper owners and that the money is used to just rebuild everything i think they're probably not gonna get their money back but they're at least gonna get their-- no this is we are taking our tithing you know taking it we have work that needs to be done we're going to be rebuilding we need gems and platinum let's not take anything that isn't gems and platinum and let's not take a ton of it a few of those would be good we did burn a bunch of them for this i think i would actually honestly say at least 1000 platinum in general just for general use for the group - and then ten of each gem that we can find that seems reasonable we're also gonna need to put somebody in charge of all this oh we know you have things to do and you did come here so i'm just gonna put 500 gold pieces 500 gold pieces we're going to have to seal this cave for now the city is secured the city is about to become a riot once they finish getting -everything out of here - that's the deal they made this is not our loot we just looted i think we're going to keep an enemy out of them is really more likely i don't know if they'll take everything actually that's true i'm so proud of you right now oh my god i'm so sorry -but i'm so proud - how are you the cruelest human i've ever--oh my that's amazing we can give them the deck i would honestly say and i cannot believe that i'm agreeing to this but i think just if we run into them we let them know that the dragon's dead and that's where it is they're not gonna bankrupt the city it's not in their best interests they're gonna take a look at it and they're gonna get what they can carry we turned over the city to a bunch of thieves they've basically been running the place for the past few months there's not really any military can they that would be better far more stories of treasures being looted by foreigners we have a hand let's crawl upstairs let's keep some people on this kima and we'll crawl upstairs that's crock that's-- yeah i know i'm gonna grab the bag of colding and take samples of the dragon eggs that we cracked the fluid the bodies like i'll put the whole thing in there we need that she's exhausted still i would assume and she's probably been running yes we can say whitestone now yes - back in whitestone as well - it was like a month ago - can i make a lore roll for booky mcbookerson natural twenty (cheering) that's a 29 you're just gonna hand me your notebook and i can just read - knew there was one in there somewhere i was about to say no we're going to the library use these places or they disappear well we need to in theory find the last resting place of opash can't be harder than killing a red dragon we can do that back at whitestone i love the notion of cornfield raven queen worship ohh i'm damned for that (laughing) the harvest is good this year we have two very clean paths maybe she's been studying a lot of things but one of them would probably be how to resurrect a red dragon what's on your face what's a child (laughing) like a warner brothers cartoon - another threat we need to deal with at some point we have to go back anyway - we do we have many things if anything else the next order of business is to make a list i'm not actually going to build a list we're just gonna make-- i think it'll be a base of operations that's what i would do if i thought that i was going to be safe somewhere i would stay there and simply hunt out much as we did with whitestone safe until it's not she's been beaten pretty badly - we could go home - are you gonna be rebuilding your shop here or are we gonna see you in whitestone as well we did we came in -stopped by the ruins - we have a tree at the keep - no compensation - it's night somewhere yes let's head to the castle ♪ - let's give him a tour we let him say that - but it's a victory -we've had a good day - you fit right in here - have a bit a of drink we're going to rest and then-- did vex just do that - no everything's--we can stand down at this point it's time for everything to rest briefly - we do need to wake allura what are you trying to imply - i know i know you owe me--i owe one i am going to walk right up to her give her a big hug i am going to be owed for much more than that i'm well aware it's good to be home we're spying we're spying what - we have met the enemy oh my god - he is the one that knocks (laughing) (crosstalk) wow - i can't--what - you know you're getting weirder (laughing) i would agree although again i'm in a bath at the moment cut to it i think i was really working on something (laughing) i'd hope so ♪ me as well i-- i like this family i'd like to keep it ♪ i was so hoping you were gonna do that they're big bathtubs - i love you that was wonderful she was just tickling on the back of my knee the entire time literally-- we are actually bathing in them ironically in the water flow i will leave that to peoples' imaginations while that was happening let me remind you of that one of my brit friends-- actually were you at that breakfast at comic con where we went to the pub and he said do you have any breakfast beer what do you have on the breakfast beer menu i think it's on the list but we have a list we can slow down a bit island of opash -nothing is north-- - on the side of the road we have a demon no - he does not get to come back next week i have a bit of i have a bit of work to do around the house so to speak there's a few matters that have to be tended to here that we should at least get up and started but - nothing's urgent it's the top of the list but it's not something that's going to be solved tomorrow it's not something that's necessarily going to bite us tomorrow i think it's going to bite us honestly-- if we left it alone i think we would be reaping the damage of it in six months the island that opash was banished to that is they will probably be in  we'll check just think if we had some device that would make it searchable it's in tolkien's spirit guide i wonder if a red dragon had been living there he would've certainly encouraged it though one day we're going to meet a lava door three times you say it three times or transfers her consciousness into the dragon's body reanimates an undead red dragon create some unholy monster - i think she's attempting-- it also might mean that we would be discovered but we'll get an idea of where to go - you went where mold feared to tread yes yes ladies and gentlemen burning man ladies and gentlemen welcome to burning man i remember this after (yelling) no that was the most brian blessed fuck i've ever it was amazing (laughter continues) hard isn't it if we had--if we had a dragon with us i'd say yes she would know that we were there-- and if we go there if--if we were to go right now i would almost recommend that scanlan and keyleth stay behind because they would be nothing but targets which is why we shouldn't go because if we go it is the four of us and if we wait a day it's six--it's at least six seven eight of us-- however many was can bring but every magic user right now is-- - that's a bit it's-- go tomorrow there might be a lair i think we--honestly i think that we-- i think if we go right now we win and at least one of us dies and if we go tomorrow we're probably going to win and probably most of us are going to survive i think she might be scrounging but i think if she's scrounging that's a lot to look through i think that she thinks she's safe i say that we take eight hours' sleep and we go there immediately it will have only been ten hours at best by the time we get there she'll sense it she may not--it's possible she may not even rest she might just be so angry that she's-- let's not let that happen she--we may interrupt her mid-slumber or she might which if she does have it she's already taken them it's the morning we sleep through the day we go tonight i think that's the way to go - we sleep we go tonight she may spend all of today going through those books and then sleep tonight you can go - then sleep but if we go right now you're going to die who's very good at becoming a target one day you may be a bro i think we've all learned something tonight
