charge ish excellent (laughter) i'm going to follow the twins from this perspective i can see your panic folder it's so exciting that's where the magic happens this is exciting for us (laughter) so close so very close whatever's available would be just fine sam and for you it is just percival and i am another visiting royal from man's world we are here on a very similar range of business to be honest ah yes percival fredrickstein von mussel klossowski de rolo iii of the royal house of whitestone representative of man's world here on very important business dealing with dragons we are looking for some objects a few things that may help us in our fight against these dragons that have attacked us we've already made headway against them and we've already made headway on our quest to destroy them any help that your wonderful city could provide would be most agreeable in the interest of dealing with thordak we are going to need access to libraries any of your people who may know something about this bog and accommodations befitting those of us who are titled this is technically what you do though isn't it but you will respect titled entry those of us who are court can converse with court for the moment why not i will say i know the feywild by reputation and by reputation you are known for your manners and any kingdom should be measured by manners as the currency that is the easiest to come across what are you doing no this is good not yet so many soldiers everywhere you've never really been in war have you may i see that really quickly don't throw it pretend right they're all elves i can't look at them this grants an audience for all of us then you're going to have to amend that one name though just to be fair it's lady vex'ahlia lady vex'ahlia baroness of the third house of whitestone and grand mistress of the grey hunt (cheering) good day it's the gift of smugness it never goes away no i actually it occurs to me that we did kill two of the three barons of whitestone the last time that we were there (laughter) it's the one that scanlan burned and there's just a crypt and that's being used for other things but-- but you do have a title at the very least and once a year you have to do something ridiculous you're welcome use it in good health it's adorable that they think they could stop us if we tried there's some art nouveau happening

dark and disturbing thought i'm very impressed thank you now i feel guilty it is a very fair point although i would say i think it would be best to talk to allura about your father rather than talk to him again i think he's possibly had enough of us for a while i think the meeting is actually tomorrow i have made such a terrible mistake (laughter) yes of course we'll take the meeting today let that be a lesson to the two of you about making fun of a foreigner's accent i'm watching you schedulable it's all right it's a futon now it's like college i like it here god i hope so to be fair that
