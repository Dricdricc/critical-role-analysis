oh wow they both stop and just kinda go uh (laughing) are you seeing what i'm seeing the human's like yeah and there's just a moment of pause there and kaylee's looking at you like okay really quick here's your motivation you're a dead goliath you were killed in combat by one of your own and you probably sound really scary and fucked up ready go okay i tell her i am stonejaw strongjaw she puts her hands together and clasps almost like the grass reeds that you blow into but as she speaks into her hand it sends out these rippling kind of almost like a heat distortion that kind of just scatters out from her hand and outside of this central illusion you hear a voice comes booming forward i-- all right um since we're birds i want to take it just an occasional high-level circle around just to see what's up okay both of you guys roll perception checks uh 18 i'll get low okay you don't see anybody coming towards that direction that resembles the individual that you met that one time before okay fine i'm gonna go looking however what you do notice is and you quickly duck out of the way there are two giant eagles that come coasting over the city in the same direction (gasps) two managed not to fall two manage to avoid the entire crumbling portion of it and there are three of them that are currently holding onto the edges and trying to pull themselves back up can i find i want to find a good enough vantage point where i'm behind them and i can give them a push like from a distance yeah have some taste and the next one um that's 17 27 30 to hit plus the push he gets pushed falls off the edge catches his arm on the side and begins pulling himself up now there's four of them that are currently now about to start climbing up outside of this this collapsed portion of earth but the earth is still crumbling beneath them as they're trying-- i cast i cast hail of thorns and shoot in the cluster of them okay go ahead and make the the hail of thorns it is-- that's obscene with that the blade sinks into the top of the skull of the one the goliath's trying to pull himself out as it hits his arms just go limp and he falls backward and disappears beneath the earth and just in case i'm using my bonus action to hide (laughing) none goth'er than thou sail sail (laughing) all right you guys watch as the other two guys stand up getting out (grunts) and look about you are now still standing out in the middle of a thoroughfare you're hiding off behind the one of the chunks of rubble and rock that permeate the outside of the wall in places you guys are still hidden i'm observing okay so as you're watching and you're heading off that direction grog he comes forward in your face what do you do i would like to rage (laughing) also i'd like to keep an eye out for the eagles as well that is a really good chasm way off in the middle of fuck-all percy's like (babbling) action surge oh action surge (groans) so this would be 11 points of slashing damage reduced to six or five actually for you that is 14 points slashing damage reduced to 7 okay keep one alive and keeping an eye on the hawks you can let him stand before the chasm just god we're mean efficient 21 he's wriggling it's my turn well i look to him and i say i will let you fly from here if you answer this question is kevdak or zanror in the city make a persuasion check no this would be intimidation intimidation not persuasion this is how goliaths prom dance uh 8 you wile e coyote'd that guy oh man shit i don't know that i haul ass back heading back do i see them do i see the group we've cleared the area more or less yeah okay good i can't drop it in and out please please god make another deception check with disadvantage hello oh i've been watching those things right and as you're having this discussion they notice up her float up and kind of see you guys moving in towards the city one of them just turns around heads back to the center of town 19 yeah can i get in on that as well into the pit into the pit uh no this is more inside the city right now damn but she was 250 feet up that turned out to be about 100 feet up that still sounds pretty bad really bad is that other one still looking yep yep and so she's falling you hit her one of the wings and she begins plummeting downward not able to gather air at the moment underneath the wings are you taking your second shot uh sure i'll just take and for this one i'm gonna be an asshole and just take a sharpshooter shot i had to reload in the middle so like-- yeah i'm like skeet shooting here i'm staying on the roof moving around the chasm you create you head inside the western gate of westruun at this point figure out which end is up first i need a really good check my investigation's not very good it's your dad oh (laughing) 20 20 you take a quick glance over checking where any ceremonial markings of the ashari are none this individual appears to be more of a primal-based druidic talent there are tattoos pretty basic various animal totems that are inscribed on the body you're familiar with this form of druidic magic it's a less-refined version of what the ashari people learn and teach an acrobatics check thank you it's batman 18 you glance up and you see the dangling kicking feet of percy underneath a broom that just (wooshing noise) across the top of that all right i didn't know there was room on there they're traveling yes yeah they're traveling back inward to the city all right well that's good i can't i probably can't catch up i'm just gonna keep hoofing it what was your plan my plan was to send all the goliaths all of them out through the main gate did they all come through the main gate no no definitely not a distraction from what let's here's the thing pike do you know this house doesn't that sound like the house that-- that's wilhand's house wilhand's house is on the-- in the temple district stands out because it's a small little like red brick area the one that he's talking about is more of a classic kind of dark wood with red brick outside like the way he described it was it's very colonial-style but like with a brick base built around it is that not the leader of the guy that runs the westruun-- that was master quall's house master quall master quall was just the master he's his own little-- we shouldn't wait we shouldn't wait then we just do it those of us with distance we make we find positions around the square not in half an hour i'm good that's what i would say is my plan if you feel like walking we can point guard you from a distance and make sure if anyone tries to attack yes that would be perfect if you're willing to no that's that can't you don't still have the house that you can summon do you of course i do can we put that door somewhere and start sending people if we liberate them to it of course we can however it would have to be somewhere close to where the hostages are they would definitely see their hostages jumping into a magical hole-- we could put your magical hole inside of a building and send people into the building so that it's got like double cover and if anyone finds your magical hole they can jump in it or do they have to have permission by the way so many jokes so many jokes (laughing) resisting you're being very good very firm on this one what happens if you lure a goliath and orc into the magical hole do they get stuck in there i imagine they'll have a lovely chicken dinner yeah 'cause after 24 hours they get kicked out that's good to know you don't have to you can send a couple of us to go check in i grab the stone go check come back-- she can go check and she'll be back within 60 seconds she has to get there she's the worst at stealth that's very fair but we can send someone and have them right back i mean it's not what if she what if we go there and we find him and then what you can pop back but he's alone you can't pop two people back with the stone i'll go i can pop us back we can send him back and then i can get back on my own you don't know where you're going pike can you tell me how to get there yes i've walked city streets that i've never been in before we can start getting into our positions and then when you're done you can join one of us what's gonna be the benefit of finding him before the fight as opposed to after that's fair well unless they're holding him unless they're holding him but they wouldn't be holding him because they don't expect us they don't know it's us that's coming well then he's either safe in his house or he's in the middle of the town square either of which-- she has a fair point i push her towards him give him a hug for good luck 34 21 all right grog is not going stealthy or are you just walking through (hums exciting music) natural 20 oh 21 24 39 12 plus 10 yeah two of them two of them yes there was a countdown 18 24 for the first hit no 22 for the first hit eventually eventually 24 then 12 hostages heading towards you just run just run and hide just run and hide i'm not with them maybe he has a magic vault it might be fun that's true he might have a magic vault i don't know if that's a real thing i just don't remember that either so scanlan you want to do anything about this of course i do i'm going to run up to her and just hold her by the hand do they see us at this point they are right around the corner you see shadows beginning to approach across the road scanlan the mansion open the mansion in a store he can do whatever he wants don't tell him what to do are they going to see us if they round the corner yes i hold her by both hands and i dimension door us to the rooftop ix-nay on the argue-jay you really did it you son of a bitch you weren't kidding (laughter) i'm finding perch on a rooftop so that i can deal with this shit this is a great idea is it possible to move the camera to get the house i was flanking ashley or pike i'll take the 3 o'clock if the house is 12 i'll take the 3 o'clock 6 o'clock 9 o'clock 12 o'clock okay i need you to go ahead and roll stealth check as well as you move up there make sure you're not seen where are the rest of you 1984 with it yeah but this may not be the moment though it's early oh my god oh my god that ends your turn now kevdak who's kind of laughing to himself (laughs evilly) i hate when he does that why what could that possibly mean does he get advantage on that no i'm just trying to-- i'm trying to keep us aware of everything as possible pike an i are going to just inch forward on the rooftop to get just a little closer yeah can i do the same in my elemental form like can i just mist kind of down around kind of right behind this asshole what's up i'm a spooky mist this is one quarter of the square all right grog it's your turn you said i can attack from having a pole shoved through my shoulder oh my god so you take all right 17 points of slashing damage oh no no advantage we'll take a photograph that's what iphones are for tune in next week goliath balls are blue goliath balls are so blue that's true you haven't done a thing has he done any damage to him at all
