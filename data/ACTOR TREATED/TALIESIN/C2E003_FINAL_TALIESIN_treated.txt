classic classic no burger left just onion rings eight that's a number it was such a good idea i don't want to be a fucking zombie they did run by oh fancy everything i'm going to burst out of the tent can i make it to the one that beau is fighting i'm going to make it to the one that beau is fighting and i'm going to take two straight attacks with my scimitar that's a 15 and a natural 20 without even figuring out yeah natural 20 is just double the die right first one is (counting) 15 no double i have to roll two dice right okay that's fine that's nine points of damage then two dice or double the dice that's 13 points of damage i turn and smile at beau it's a pizza pie with a pizza slice i turn 180 and get ready for the other one i make eye contact with it and fuck it just for fun i'm going to burn my blood maledict there's going to be a blood vessel that pops on my neck and i'm going to make him cry i take three damage i'm amplifying no it still hits that's fine ow there's no way we're going to be able to take this shit seriously undead strength i'm going to take two more shots i'm going to see if i can decapitate-- oh man i've got to get out of that habit two more swings see if i can decapitate it that's an eight but a 16 does not that's nine points of damage this is not looking good this is looking very bad oh my god i swear i thought i could kill it that hits oh yeah i'm out i think i'm immune to fire anyways or some such thing yeah fire resistance out but not dead i've just started working on a new character tonight thank god (gasps) (groans) one of them has my sword embedded in their chest i'm at one hit point they're okay really are you going to name it sally i had that coming i'm going to pull my sword back out and start trying to get the horses going that really hurt i feel terrible i can do that i can do that no i'm fine i'm going to actually fall back into the cart everything that you've been holding back for years now is going to come pouring out of you okay trying to take as much of a short rest as i can back there i'm going to try and sleep this off like a bad hangover like dogs we never looked up that would be a very big toad the wagon tracks directly to the point at which they are found who are you that's really clever why would you even think that huh maybe i don't know i'll think about it ow that hurts ow that was a lot well this will break my short rest how many people in the boat how many people are we looking for didn't he leave with a-- two people i'm actively tracking this creature aren't i on a certain level i hadn't really thought about it it's something i can in theory do no this would also break my short rest wouldn't it i'm going to use hunter's bane really quickly and look at the track for a second yeah i'm going to do both of those now i'm at 12 hit points yay 12 hit points i'm going to see if i can help with the tracking because i'm going to start actively tracking this particular creature survival check which i have advantage on 18 guy went into the water do you think he's trying to swim all the way to the other side or you think he's just going around the lake i don't know i'm not sure maybe could be i legitimately do not know how it works sorry do i know what he was by the way and i get advantage on that religion check 15 this whole time i've been sitting with this are you saying this out loud listening to this i reach in i've got some incense isn't this impressive enough that i happen to have some incense there'd also be a fire inside the inn to be fair charcoal is-- it's not like it's hard to get that's true you can go shopping more let's go maintain the illusion of innocence for the evening xhorhas it's a creature from xhorhas i'm pretty sure i don't know we'll see god i'm remembering something i'm going to walk over to the horses and-- they're trained horses i'm going to go whisper in their ear and give them a little pat nine i didn't get advantage on that because i knew the animals did i i'm into this this is romper room natural 20 look at all that stuff i can't even see myself with this roll technically my stealth would be 23 when you hit 'long rest' it should auto-reset slightly hotter okay way hotter any toad creatures oh the first piece of paper of the game have you read it now what's it say kylre's been around for a while though and this is new right i feel like-- was there nothing i mean not that well of everybody the least that's a-- i have heard that word before oh dear oh why can't i remember it was so long ago what did he eat he ate what we had i feel like i would've taken note of it i don't necessarily know i would've commented on it but i would've noted it and it was not noted oh no it's not possible he's trying to head back to xhorhas is it i said out loud kylre was not a talker stabbing can i also do this i'm thinking about everything i hear nine clusters of semen all around you always funny always wait what you could read that other book at the very least i go into my bag and i've got some old weird-- i've got a weird little-- it's in a very strange ornate bag that's covered in strange gems and weird filigree sandalwood it's nag champa all over enough about the pastries already yes of course i'm in for a penny i'm going to throw a gold in there as well i just saw jester open her purse dear-- the ten minutes is clean-up (laughter) go ahead he's a little feathery frumpkin you look like a princess well if we can send the sparrow out we can carry him with us if he finds anything let's let the sparrow see if it can find anything then we know which direction we have to head into so there's not too much meandering about until there's a direction to go play-doh we've got play-doh well we're not going to get our deposit back that makes it worse it's pretty fancy i'll keep with you i'd forgotten about that we were in the middle of things it's usually gustav if somebody's got an act they show it off gustav figures out how it's going to work into the narrative puts it all together you bring a bit and then the bit is shaped and formed by the director of the show if you can do a thing with fire or you can do some juggling and then they figure out how that's going to work into everything where it sits and what costuming and the whole thing is all an act mostly mostly an act oh you're thinking of toya and kylre they were an act before-- they were an act for as long as i can remember right yeah i've never not known them as an act i'm feeling like maybe that might be a thing well i mean everyone's got some weird we're weird people people come in and you're a bit strange you got something you can do no no well that's a complicated conversation but no she is a little girl to be fair toya's not a fully-grown adult woman she's a dwarf that is so offensive i think you're right but i don't know how he's managed to go this long why now and why in front of all those people i think he is a fiend i think he is feeding off her the rest of it i'm not sure have you met us we're all a bit weird and you don't ask a ton of questions there is it's the difference between being in a carnival and not being in a carnival because i'm weird i mean it's putting together he was never that talkative i don't know i don't like it well i am not the right kind of talker for this why does every roll have to be-- oh thank god 18 this is why we don't have you as dm we can also follow the bird i miss the earrings yeah no i'm over cloak two-gold bold well (laughter) that is our siren's call no aerator (laughter) you've ruined it i'm going to keep my eyes peeled as well (growls and sighs) eight i was weirdly expecting more i don't even know how you did that don't do the math before you do let's take a look around i'm going to take a look around to see if i can find any footprints can i use my (mumbles) again or no i'm specifically looking for signs of kylre wow that's awful wait that's cocked that's awful i can't even-- that's eight that's right we've got some humans oh wow we can start heading in it was awful i let all of you go first everywhere or for a witch's hut let's put the humans in the middle so that they can't be surprised again hey there's my good roll 19 there's that magic we never had she ate what was put in front of her we ate what was put in front of us we're not picky people i'm trying to keep an eye out for anything even if we weren't here on business i really want to see this i'll do it i'll go for it i don't get advantage on this no okay god six i did not sneak that in did i yeah i'm all right with that 18 i'm going to pull out both my swords and i'm going to drag them-- laura and i'm not doing my accent right now so i'm going to pull out both the swords and i'm going to drag them on the back of my neck and before the blood even begins to pour it goes straight into ice along the blades action bonus action action and bonus action i can't turn an action to a bonus action all right that's fair okay i'm going to move around and i'm going to try and get a little cover right here i'm going to move there and i'm going to hold my attack until there's something to hit i'm going to try and make a little wave at yasha toya ah brain yeah 20 i'm so proud of you what hexblade's curse opening your mouth right there that was so useful so useful yep that hit me (laughter) that's a 13 that's a 1d6 plus 1d4 that's eight damage plus one cold damage so nine damage five points of damage and a constitution saving throw constitution saving throw goddamn it 11 so i just took-- that's a lot i'm going to use my bonus action take a slash at that imp i can only use it as an action right okay i'll burn my attack hitting that bloody imp no i'll hit it with the enchanted one i'm really hurt and i just took nine points of damage yeah 19 to hit that's seven points of damage i'm going to pull back behind this tree trunk then and get a little cover to figure out what to do next because i'm really hurt yeah i can't heal or anything my god i can't do anything 16 ah learning jesus these things are so vicious oh my god (groaning) shit liam and i'm going to get a little closer i'm going to start running towards the ruins that'll do it i'm going to look at the imp and i'm in infernal i'm going to say to just-- terrible there's nothing but death for you here i'm going to attack vicious mockery on him and show him the bottom card i have to learn some-- yeah that's a-- yeah it's a wisdom saving throw i'm trying to figure out how this works but-- it's not a lot but that's four points of psychic damage and he has disadvantage on the next attack roll it makes that was just my bonus action i'm going to use my action-- no that's a-- it is an action you're right that's what i've got right now just trying to get its attention oh my god we're not doing well he's the only one who's down but we're all hurt oh god no fuck man glad you didn't do detect evil he can't follow you both have disadvantage vicious mockery part of the plan you have so few actions does that work there is no body we need a body oh thank god is that imp still there is the imp still active i'm going to blood maledict i'm going to curse of the eyeless on that imp the one that is attacking nott oh for fuck's sake i'm running at the closest imp can i get there all right i'm going to take two swings for fuck's sake nope that was a ten can you bonus action anybody stabilize someone that's smart you could dash she has got two more rounds regardless yay how are you doing man this is-- oh man one imp is going to kill us all one fucking imp we have to stabilise fjord is what we've got to do caleb caleb's doing okay i'm running right at it let's try some different dice here for fuck's sake i've got to stop rolling that die this is-- yeah no 11 this is so embarrassing this is so embarrassing do you get advantage because i'm engaged with it ugh look at it scoot god i was about to say i'm going to run to toya and pick her up i've got her i've got her i've got her because you were the last face she saw i should probably be the first thank you you did the right thing you don't need to be the first thing she sees she'll just start screaming all over again thank you we're going to need him that's definitely a cloister it's a nu-gget (sighs) get her back home i know we're going to have a talk i don't know if she feels that way either but although-- it's going to take some time i think and also we're going to need the body and honestly only one of us was here for those at home i'm pointing at caleb because the rest of us are under arrest so congratulations on single-handedly defeating the creature that killed several guards i'm sure you will be well-rewarded and compensated let's take a rest that was so unpleasant i think i'm going to multiclass master of none
