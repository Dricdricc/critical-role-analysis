up just do one more louder that's just usually what they want just one more louder does he have the golf cart i'm going to grab the mic and help to bar it i'm periscoping all this shit this is the most concise direction we've had if i can get to my car i think i have a kit for this but other than that i'm not really sure what to do okay is the rail system for the television broken well you know the giant tv in adr5 is on a big swinging arm so we can break the glass if we just give this thing a big heavy push you can certainly have at it i'm working on the tv oh no these stats are a compliment man dear god did you roll them legit how crumpled does this look i'm going to grab the tv and i'm going to take a running throw with the tv okay oh boy i'm using a different die too that is that's 18 out 24 13 have you really drawn a map i say run and duck into the kitchen and see-- and just run and duck into the kitchen no why would they put it here this is the worst place to put money i'm going to go through my bag and see if i have anything grab the sword and let's run out it's a caduceus i know what this is this is a thing it's the snakey thing hold on this might-- i'm going to grab that i'm going to run quickly into the men's bathroom that's right behind that little hallway oh i did pick up that rod i'm going to run to the bathroom and try and find some fucking advil underneath the god damn-- i'm going to find first aid and pills okay 20 no 21 i pour my pockets full with them and take four i get nervous man i open the door and i'm taking some of these in case and-- i hadn't really thought about it worst-case scenario we feed it the dog if it tries to go for us upstairs i don't know 19 has it noticed us i'm going to gently start pulling people back towards the door i'm gonna take two more advil i'm gonna offer them around is there a golf cart covered in vegetation are there any remnants of a golf cart we can take turns if he's terrible we can just take turns throw the dog in the water your friend is dead 10000 years ago let's head towards the valet i'm going to gently stealth towards the valet yo god i'm killing it he's just gassy 20 i'm using a new die i don't even know what's happening if it's marsh i wear clogs for god's sake my shoes are useless this is going to be awful okay there's a roll five percy is not capable of rolling below a ten protein powder style yeah i'm going to try and hentai this thing i'm going to do my best to concentrate at it and see if something happens no i want to just-- this feels weird and i feel stupid roll to attack what do i add to my-- well it's been a while i'll find out what do i add to my roll to attack oh spell save attack bonus so that's 14 five plus one oh so just the plus one so 14 2d6 times two you don't-- double the dice you just double the dice pretty good that would have killed any of us wait i'm going to try something i'm going to try to fire something with the not tentacle hand at the dead creature no he's not moving that doesn't mean dead i'm going to try because it was moving earlier this is weird feeling better you have all your knives do we see any golf carts or our cars left right eight is it a blue scion or the remnants of a blue scion no it's the fake brooklyn building wait maybe if we try to cut through the vines and get into the doors they have those awful little stairs inside these buildings anyway we could maybe just climb up inside on the vines to get to the door you go up you're light we stay down here text doesn't work here we can't see i'm going to look outside i'm looking out the door now nair it's made of nair that's a terrible idea i think if it's the last of us we need ashley johnson and then we can make a decision this is not just about me not wanting to submit to cannibalism you should go first i'm still a little upset that we talked about eating me before the dog which is really-- do i have any power left to my phone it was a normal-looking bird that's helpful this is not tomb raider that looks like a very high number 12 did you roll for the dog too yep that's a thing i don't know this is not a game man there's no hit points to get let's observe outside i'm going to peek outside i can limp i'm fine if we live that long i will take it up with my sag representative and i will photograph it once my phone is working again there was no stunt coordinator in this vo session so outside is goop i'm looking out okay so there's foliage are there any phone lines still hanging there was that table a while ago all right let's make a quiet walk of it because you're not going to move fast enough to outrun any of that weird shit in there travis can i get a piggyback ride please thank you that's cool it's legitimately the magic word one gentle step at a time 17 you're the fucking hunter i'm running towards where they-- i'm running after travis i'm okay yeah wait oh god oh really oh god okay i'm opening up my bag and pulling out my very expensive hardcover copy of the wicked + the divine and i'm tearing my least favorite pages and starting to roll them into a torch if this is the last copy on earth i will kill you and i've made a bullshit torch out of comic book paper where are you this is amazing i always thought there was something really fucked up about that animaniacs cartoon i think we need to deal with this shit it's the fucking o'briens what's your agent doing for you man yes oh 14 i was reading i am going to cast-- i had an epiphany i had a fucking epiphany and i cast chill touch on conan o'brien chill motherfucker i also have some basic massage and this is coming into play (counts quietly) 20 on a hit the target takes 1d8 necrotic which is seven and can't regain hit points until the start of my next turn and is he undead he has disadvantage on all of his attack rolls until the end of my next turn i do that and then i run behind travis i run behind laura 1d8 plus two you take the ground o'briens we'll deal with the flying o'brien everything will be fine oh no they're quick oh wow i'm going to run towards travis i have my movement whatever my movement is as a bonus action i'm going to give him some advil and give him a slap across the face and then for my main action i'm going to chill touch the liam in front of me come on motherfucker 18 and that's eight points of damage necrotic and then advil and slapping for my bonus action not yet say please this is the funniest he's ever been really conan o'barden that's not very good it's magic all right you're fine i've stopped slapping you where am i oh there i am i'm going to get away from travis and head back a little back towards the main group and i'm going to cast mage hand about there and i'm going to cast mage hand can i make it do things when i want to cast it or is it not until next turn that i can make it i'm going to have it start retrieving the other dagger for laura 11 we should totally kill these liams we have lots of advil can i send my mage hand up there oh shit he's not 30 is he he's like 40 fuck that fine i suppose with everything going on i'll do another chill touch at jerky mcjerkface 13 as a bonus action i'm looting the shirt (laughter) good call it just took conan o'brien for us to turn on each other that's all it fucking took i'm going to book it towards the tower as well i'm going to swing wide and as i swing wide across him i'm going to hit him with the chill touch yeah conan 17 that's seven points of necrotic plus he's at disadvantage for attacks he's frozen like a statue you roll to hit i think but you get an auto-crit you've got a throwable weapon that's a start 11 chill touch at the conan o'lichman i should roll a d20 14 that's six points of necrotic plus disadvantage six six necrotic i take a step closer to the lich and hit him again with the chill touch i'm going to just keep hitting him natural 20 travis and double dice roll twice or double it 14 points of necrotic damage i've thought about this so many times that was pretty good i'm going to take my skeletal freezing hand and start slapping him down into the dirt (yelling) you're terrible at video games you're awful you're just terrible you make mortal kombat look bad i go to loot the body or what's left of it i don't know i'm going to start grabbing bones does he have anything on him is there anything i find in the pile i'm going to turn around then and go look at the water tower towards the tower i cast hellish rebuke if he touches me i cast hellish rebuke oh bixley oh hey are we going to do this all right we're going to do this according to imdb early 20s i don't like to pin it down early 20s with time change or without because you've also got the crazy time shit it's the medieval era you die before 40 really you guys are going to live forever they really have a giant television on a swinging arm makes it really hard to get tea he needs fanart well no because we'd be playing each other then yeah that would be fun i would like to be grog that would be fun we don't actually know how the game is played i think she's got it tattooed on her arms yeah he's intimidating you did it was amazing legitimately right now in my car i have a quiver of arrows i do still left over from the photo shoot i haven't returned them to my friend ashley yeah i haven't cleaned out my car so i have that i have my laptop and all my work stuff and phone chargers i've got a black velvet frock coat large leather boots-- i'm not kidding about any of this-- a hardcover copy of the wicked + the divine thank you for putting that on my character sheet and some nail wraps thank you for putting that on my character sheet although not the ones i used in the game because the ones i would have used in the game would have been the limited edition hamilton federalist papers i have outtakes from recording today of caitlin glass singing whole chunks of it travis and it's such a problem weirdly i would have thrown out wizard i'm surprised i would have pegged wizard it's like coming across coyotes in the wild i'm so happy to see it and i don't want to call attention to it either it's awesome but now you've got the pokeball though the pokeball's great she's been bragging that she's known for a while now too and she just lords it over us i want to be teddy ruxpin so you can be the little caterpillar dude who follows him around all the time sam and do you not know your tiddy-- teddy ruxpin motherfuckers you just don't like it because of bears i'm first mate and then we all take turns being the captain matt does a thing with his voice and he did that thing that night someone asked will you ever use diplomacy again yeah it's just really complicated because in order to use it i have to get hit by lightning and inevitably that's going to happen and that's a wonderful counter to being hit by lightning at the moment until i can sit down and do something to it we fought a lot of bandits if i recall there were a lot of bandits a lot of bar fights and people threatening us with mugs there's a whorehouse in westruun yeah no that's cool pick up we were talking about that it's a broom people we've all stolen shit from chris hardwick at this point what's the big fucking deal yeah i'm chaotic good i may take one you've made me feel like i could maybe do it people want to send you money if i dm it won't be dnd though it'll be something else guys if i dm a game it's not going to be dnd i will repost the professional photograph from prom i have to ask if i can the site may have been down so check later i do know we broke the site tickets are still available no if i do a game it's probably and i don't want to confirm it tabletop vampire was a big thing when i was a teenager i really like tabletop vampire it's very simple ever i really like the reefer madness musical from a few years ago it was really funny the first musical i went to see was tom daley's gypsy in la that was amazing book of mormon the reboot of cabaret they did with alan cummings was pretty spectacular i got to see that in new york a few years ago my parents did a number on me i think i'd be okay my parents assumed i was gonna usher in the apocalypse they're still waiting for it really i had hellish rebuke and i didn't get to use hellish rebuke that's the dog i'm excited about all the fancy armor we can now make with black and white scales because we have black and white scales did the t-shirt contest stuff get moved to next week do you all agree with the stats that liam gave you i felt highly complimented on mine just sleep yeah you do start to recognize voices and listen for things you get a little bit of the tech brain but other than that it's really fun it's one of the reasons i'm enjoying overwatch is that i barely recognize anyone which both makes me sad and happy i just saw the new shadowrun book i don't know if i'm up for that that was the most scared the group has ever been we bit off way more than we could chew it was great that would have been very sad i wear mine in the hot tub just my jacket it was amazing down to the fruit on the fruit plate oh yeah the brownies even between us we all walk away from the table during breaks going (gasps) no matter what the fuck was going on oh yeah we all have a little bit of interesting youtube ephemera they've only found the strawberry so far is the only thing they've found of mine i've got some other weird shit we did a close encounters coca cola commercial back in the day i had a whole cult watching me drink a coke somewhere i don't know girls are pretty in the feywild i'm just saying that shit's going to go down i know it's too much percy's a vicious son of a bitch i saw about half an hour of it i enjoyed it i don't want to know-- maybe it's a thing about working as an actor that you don't feel that drive to know any more working on it how much is planned and how much is improv-ed we never have conversations with matt about what we're going to do unless we're gonna do something that he needs to know about no other than using the shower a couple times when the water wasn't functioning that's pretty much yeah no we're all rangey individual regrets percy doesn't believe in them he just believes in good life lessons other than the regret of his existence he's pretty down it's like once you've fucked up that hard everything else is just whatever i loved our fight and i'm sad it never got to see its inevitable conclusion the conversation we had in the craft room afterward was possibly the most satisfying do you remember you were like okay what would have happened if i had put my hand in the shadow you were like what would have happened had the skull in your hand i'm so excited for it it's my favorite thing going on right now i know pirates
