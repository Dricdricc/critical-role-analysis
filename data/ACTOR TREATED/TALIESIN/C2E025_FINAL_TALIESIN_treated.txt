just saying they could've held the baby five more hours i feel like they could've done it we're so tired and it's great how did you know it's been a while is the monkey smokey or the bandit i can never remember that was a good one if we see those teenagers also we should probably call them off at the very least we can leave word with their employer and if we run into them we'll call them off we'll have rissa meet us at the prison maybe later she can call them off and we can head to the prison (as fjord) yeah that sounds great (as taliesin) never mind (as fjord) yep well great yep i don't know anymore who wants the node by the way fair let's go take a look at this prison they're literally on a mission to find the kids right now technically go back to work can be one word if you say it fast enough grammar very lord of the rings not very lord of the rings and it looks like a big factory that looks like a evil willy wonka factory kind of thing what do you know about that machine he built anyway come across a couple vampire hunters sorry is it steam-powered or is it-- it's a magical power source then maybe they just let it-- they've cornered it into a-- honestly we could just show up and say we've been hired to try and take care of it and go in we technically have been hired to go in and take care of it we're just working in trade no they know not by the city so by a private contractor i think we're going to have to do a little more research but i'm feeling pretty good about our prospects we heard you have a bug problem we're here to take care of it i mean i suggest we wear shoes and pants but you know we could have a letter from your father perhaps yeah but they'd be perfectly happy if we-- we're going in knowing full well what we're getting into there's no harm no foul there okay you really want to break into a prison i feel like we can make that dream come true you're so lucky she's not watching right now she's probably watching hi laura i would love to see if there's any sort of sketch or blueprint of this thing that we could just take a look at first and maybe have a thought of our plan of attack no i mean of the machine just to sort of see what we're getting into we can go on our own if you like i mean i like pies but i'm a bad example of so many things (snickers) this brings me back to some home games yes we have our money back yeah no that's a good thought we're going to take a stab at this death machine we were curious if you could-- i like the description if there's any information you can give us about the machine just so that we're not going in cold like if you know if it has any vulnerabilities to anything if you can sketch it for us so we can get a sense of-- please don't tell me that you're going to do that okay but i'm not going to be able to make heads or tails of any of this shit eight does anybody understand gnomish it's very hard to get a spell in there we start pulling plates off-- -- start cutting our way through one specific spot we could eventually get to a point where you could get some spells in there you may have to tank this is there a front and back to this thing or is it just a whirling dervish it could possibly be blinded by obscuring the lens not you in per se but if we show up as representatives here to dismantle the machine and you hired us to go in and do some work whatever works we should get some honey or something i bet some honey on the lens would be a real pain in the ass do you have any honey of course you do what do you have why do you have molasses this is suddenly very exciting is this why your skin is so smooth you've been giving yourself a facial every night magic molasses i was thinking if we had a small glass jar of it we could give it a throw it could help it depends on how strong the clockwork is bubble gum and we do have some friends over there that we just sent their young interns away on a-- in a very gentle bucket or pot it doesn't have to be hot it just has to be-- has to be a little hot there's so many walls being broken there's like fourth wall fifth wall sixth wall it's too deep we’re in the eleventh dimension now this is getting a little heavy can i remove that no how about just a huddle up huddle up let's just-- no we can put him in the center i mean it could be warm we are professional robot dismantlers well we're going to stop and pick up some tar on the way there and-- i nominate the human to talk i'll keep an eye on the guard-- not on the guard i'll keep an eye on the worker yeah yeah we could do that thing do you remember the vaulty thing let's do the vaulting thing all right you're going to do the thing over the-- vault up if you get near the fence i'm going to try and jump on top of the fence all right we're going to need the (mumbling) i'm going to jump on top of the fence no i'm just going to do the (mumbling) yeah like the razzle dazzle yep oof ten can i try and push up into a handstand all right yeah natural 20 oh no disadvantage 15 up and flipping back up and i'm going get the swords out i'm going to start slowly working on moving down the fence with both swords doing a spin and trying to actually get a little flip going a little acrobatic-- i'll need you spotting 'cause i'm not great at this i'm going to jump onto your shoulders now so i take a jump and try and land on the shoulders straight acrobatics all right you go away i'm trying you that's a natural 20 sorry you had a great fence and we're working on an act it's true that's nine we should be at separate ends of the fence right now because i made my way down the fence with yasha a lovely fence it is no then we don't have to put it in we'll just carry it we'll carry it we're going in to kill a robot it's fine what else do you bring into a -- what do they think we're going to do with a bucket of tar let's lean into it poppin drok-- i won't i won't speak i'm not going to speak i feel that beau-- i tap beau on the back and make her bow a little bit pull her back up to be fair we are oh of course that makes perfect sense and of course a man of your stature would be smart enough to know that such a thing is true we honestly-- we will admit we may have a favor a very minor favor to ask if everything goes well and we do in fact survive this encounter in return also we will be gathering very valuable data on how to defeat these sort of automatons which will be put into your possession and would definitely help you deliver something that could help with the war effort this sort of data could get back to the people in charge and help them defeat machines in the future we're trying new techniques new ways to defeat these sort of automatons i think you could go far we'd be happy to help we may discuss perhaps if we can help-- we have two friends who are currently in your system and we would be more than happy to discuss a means of maybe resolving their issue with you not innocence but just coming to a conclusion that is mutually agreeable man i love bullshitting persuasion god please for once in your miserable life oh man eight i know hardly waste your time of course we are anyone want the node or caleb well who's going to be throwing -- we'll heat it up caleb will heat it up you'll throw it in and then i'll be using some ice to try and cool the thing down once it's in there once it starts opening up the armor we'll just go to that one particular plate and start ripping a hole in it chopping the plates off we'll get through doors set the node set everything we need into action what kind of feet does it have again ball bearings we'll see slow it down i don't know we'll find out tank this and you'll be all right it's just swords fjord you got a plan jester no we took a long rest it should do we want her to have anything pre-cast i don't think duplicity will matter but maybe a spiritual weapon already called up just have it already let's-- oh then let's wait then all right you're welcome to try certainly not me i mean if we die does it matter we can talk to the guards on the way out yeah but we're going to be in the prison when we're done that's fair (laughs) assuming we live mr schuster you look terrible i yell very loud to see if anybody responds to the name mr schuster oh that's a 15 worth a shot when's the last time you opened it until we knock on the door i imagine let's heat up the tar i'll hold it since you're doing the thing i also have immunity to flame so or not quite immunity but i don't really mind flame we'll probably need some light in here too excellent i turn to one of the guards is there any light in there or are we going to need to bring our own fantasmagoria i'm definitely having some yeah actually it's got eyes and not ears i don't think when we saw the blueprints was there any way for it to detect sound or was it all visual all right let's pretend we're whispering we can do that let's cast pass without a trace i'm going to light up my sword that would be our last 2nd-level spell wait let's-- maybe not pass without a trace because once it sees us it doesn't matter anymore so let's not do that yet i'm going to light up my swords yeah with ice that brings me down to 49 hit points so that's fun wow that’ll be a lot of fun that's thrilling there's a door over there do you want to sneak over and see can we put some light in there and maybe take a look at what's in there yeah since we have an orb up don't we no we have a torch caleb you want to use the torch to take a look in there maybe i'm keeping an eye through this hallway and i think i'm going to slowly start scooting but against the wall thank you we can all get in that room if we have to that's the hope but we have these other options over here is there anything i can see from my perspective from where i'm standing right now i knew you’d say that that's a 16 do you have a plan so you can get up and get a little height if you want and we can also-- those with range maybe maybe not maybe it would keep pounding until you died we don't even have to put the tar inside it could be outside all right yasha we're going to be on the outside then this is scary and dangerous work well we don't have any range you're going to be on the outside too i thought we'd put all the ranged people in there and draw its attention to attack them and then while it's there we can all gang up on it i'm going to attempt to hide in the corner oh yasha before i forget i got you something i hand her one of the silk flowers from the festival it doesn't press well but you know got for you if we live yeah i'm going to stay super crouched or the cat the first unexplored room sending the cat to take a look-- this may be the end of the cat 15 plus cat i have an interesting idea jester is going to cast her spiritual weapon and put it right in the center of-- yeah a big nice shiny object to distract are we all pulling against the walls i'll roll for jester so fucked it's going to be a lot of dodging seven for me as well and jester is six do you have advantage we’re so fucked is it divine fury still did it lose a blade just now hex ma’am hex the robit thank you that athletics is already sweet though you also have the mouth you can throw the tar up in there go for it probably that’s a ten-foot blade reach can i see anywhere where there seems to be a crack in the armor and make a-- i want to see if there’s anything that looks like a good target to start doing some damage to is there a plate open or anything at the moment near me i’m going to try and get to the side without the blade i’m going to try and chop open one of the plates on the back i’m going to start hacking away at it actually even with the blades there’s an open place right now is there a place for me to start poking the tender insides i’m going to try and find one armor plate and start going to town i want to get to its left hind quarters i’m going to run over to the opposite side flank it with the lollipop mm-hmm first attack is a natural 20 2d6 with ice damage that’s (counting) 17 points of damage next attack with the same sword actually i’m so sorry that’s the wrong sword that’s 18 points of damage because of the summer’s dance then the next one summer’s dance again is not quite as good 12 that does not hit okay going for a third strike 14 is it worth seeing if it’s going to-- well it’s blinded so it’s got disadvantage if it tries to even hit me with an attack so i’m going to try and back off and climb up that little hill i’m going to try and hop up that hill really quickly yep as high as i can get to get out of its range yeah right over there is good that does not hit and now it doesn't have a reaction anymore we can't hear you we're in a tight box first off we're going to have the spiritual weapon take a swipe right at where the plates are already broken and hit it again which is a bonus action and a plus seven to hit oh that's not it it's around here somewhere there it is that's a 15 wait wait (counting) yeah 15 i don't think this is going to do anything i was thinking of trying maybe a-- we could do sacred flame or if you were nearer i'd say cure wounds or we could do a guiding bolt (like jester) we're going to do guiding bolt you roll this one that's 4d6 radiant damage no just 4d6 i feel like we should open up a little bit i think she's going to see if she can crawl over to the door so she can hide behind it in case something bad happens in fact she might be smart-- she has to keep the spiritual weapon in visual range right okay she's going to just use that as some cover that's a lot oh wait no everybody poops unless they're an android because then they must be destroyed poop poop so we now know at least a 17 will hit blinded and restrained right now no stop i think it would still go poorly but let's see if it comes to it i got a crazy idea you first please hey beau no he actually only did four points of damage sam only did four i can't even-- i'm rooting for nott then i look at you and i feel weird i'm going to run in and try to do a little bit more damage in here i'm coming in and taking three more shots i caught it it's all good that one misses that one hits that's a 19 that's okay (counting) that's 12 points of damage for a third slightly less exciting attack natural 20 but its magicked up okay that's fine that's two to three so that's five so it was a five and then six because this is doubled i'm going to see if i can hop back up out of-- am i ever getting out of melee or am i not getting out of melee it will still get an attack of opportunity on me though without disadvantage now you know i'm going to stick around for now i'm going to keep a flanking point i’m going to move a little bit so that we’re spread out around it so it has to make some decisions that's going to be a lot of movement should i try something offensive or healing-based do you think how are you doing caleb okay so we're going to do this we're going to run out and cast healing word on caleb level one yes 1d4 plus four so that's seven points but i can use my action for the bonus action you can't up a bonus action to an action man so i can't cast anything higher than level one either can i i can only cast cantrip at this point i would have done that in the reverse order if i had been thinking about things well what do i got i got a-- oh caleb's healed and that's good do we want to try let's try toll the dead it's a wisdom saving throw you point at one creature you can see within range and the sound of a-- you succeed at a wisdom saving throw or take 1d8 of necrotic if the target is missing any of its hit points it instead takes 1d12 necrotic damage 2d12 boom i think she's going to back up again you're a beast you're great is there enough gut to hit 16 to hit so that's not bad (exaggerated texas drawl) hexblade's curse step all the way back might as well because you can always run back there do you get to try and make it not move i don't still get to take my attack of opportunity even though that happened he tried to and i try to make a jab i'll take no advantage i thought i might be flanked that's a (counting) 24 to hit that's (counting) nine points of damage yeah nine dex save dex save 22 for me ten for jester okay so 14 points of piercing damage is that the whole or did you not do the whole thing i'm up i'm fine you want to go first got any thoughts (counting) eight points of slashing damage oof that's rough i'm going to take two swipes at-- i'm going to try and move i'm going to try and move somewhere where i'm flanking is there any flanking available at the moment i was about to say is it in any way that going to give her a little cover at the very least i'll move in and then move around-- well no goddamn it i'm going to take a couple shots and see how this goes because i can use some hits that are all right yeah that's what we're doing first hit i'm not throwing away my shot that's a 22 to hit let's get that first thing that's 12 points of damage next strike that definitely hit that's 24 (counting) that's ten points of damage i've got that one really soft blade and i'm rolling it and i want to see that one little opening and i want it to bend the sword bends and does that chinese martial art thing where it goes and pops all the way into the center of it and i go wrist deep into the thing i got a new die baby does it look familiar motherfucker it's the nega-snitch i found the place where the snitch came from i had the woman make me one out of iron boom motherfucker it's been middly but it's done okay today gil has been a help today oh no we're immediately going to help yeah we got 1st-level lay on hands to get her up you did so well no really you did some good stuff in there you kept it sitting yeah i want to take a look in the other room too and give them a proper look liam you get ten hit points and you get 12 you get ten from jester i'm going to walk over to the door and start beating it with a sword you can't dex cut this thing you can't pop it in eight no go ahead the three of us will get that door open at some point we'll cast detect magic-- i mean the fact that we're going to leave the door open and it's not coming up but yeah we'll go get the core and i figure we're going to do a thorough investigation of the whole thing once caleb can do a detect magic it's like a weaponized version of one of those balls that you throw up in the air and it turns inside out i'm going to keep cutting off the arms so we can get to it what could you have possibly have been doing matt sorry we've had a short rest and we'll do a quick search can you do a detect magic spell caleb oh yeah come on that's all right go fuck yourself beau come on all right come on we're going to get you guys out of here (strained) we're going to go i hold up the glowing crystal you should see the other one (laughs) do i buy this i want to have an insight versus deception check on you all right i ain’t going to mess with you i just want to know nope that's an eight unless you roll really poorly come on nott we did we may need that later sadly it did work us over quite well i'm going to take the crystal back i'm so sorry we may need this he doesn't know about the schusters no we mentioned vaguely that we might want something we have some friends that are currently interred here for financial troubles nothing dangerous nothing violent we were wondering if we could make a deal for maybe some leniency if that's possible also we do have a bit of the mechanism and if everybody here is all right i am of the opinion that if anybody asks us it was your brilliant idea to let us into that cell in the first place to take care of this problem if anybody asks we know who is absolutely responsible for this you saw something in us you took a chance and we're grateful for it all right come on man for fuck's sake that's a six i don't have any persuasion i don't know why-- somebody should pick up but we don't have our talker here right now yeah that's no problem jester will be happy to pay (laughter) laura you can text right now that's okay laura will text if she has a problem with that fjord will pay half so 75 gold each seven okay so that's all right bump bump oh and look at that it's all done look at that it's all done that all happened it's as if it never was that's what you get for getting knocked up man right there sorry (laughter) kids are a deep financial drain man we never understand what's happening either best not to think about it roll for dubstep it's us open it up we have a request oh that's just mean i'm so glad we understand each other take care of them i'm not even going to go there explains why your face is doing that i suppose it's not a good look on you come on let's go find a quiet place to sleep i'm exhausted long rest get your tinker toy going to take it away i will only stop if there's something interesting in a window otherwise i figure we're heading back to pick up the crossbow skype-five if there was possible to buy some food i want to have some camping food for the rest like good stuff oh yeah just really good food some meat veggies just (grunts) done we're eating good yep we're going to be eating really good maybe the lesson was for us i'm not sure i'm so excited ooh nice woo that can happen that's okay that's very you it's very you look at you becoming a people person or at least a bird person fuck you too we got to get on the road we can't thank you enough we'll definitely come back in contact next time we're rolling through town we leave her the drinking tokens they need use i think it's fair very much taking you up on that that's going to end well something very positive's going to come out of that relationship let's get on our way soon let's make our way where was this the three of them yep yep maybe you hit him enough so that you left a clue yes to be fair it’s not like the money would do her any good right now they’re going to take all of that so if anything-- really it’s our money now i’m going to have access to this haversack for a while i’m just saying sorry oh boy i’m going to get in trouble oh god no no it’s like playing d&d with general zod i mean i’m happy to do it but it is a little weird (laughter) bless you never again this is the most complicated revenge plan i've ever heard marisha i know these fucking assholes are like one of us when are you going to join our misery and i'm like no sleep is all gone
