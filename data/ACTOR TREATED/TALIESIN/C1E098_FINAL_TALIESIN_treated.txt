all of the flashes are on this show i play barry allen eobard thawne jay garrick oh my god yeah that would've been even better don't tell him let it roll i've played a little it's fun so if we loot tary's body do we get all of his stuff no even not in canon in the game you are a loot drop oh my god yeah we level up for that just as something that happened during that whole family conversation i was scanning the room and the bookshelves for anything interesting anything out of sorts anything out of place i didn't want to-- yeah i didn't see shit i just rolled a three that's nothing i appreciate what you were going for there plastic covers no plastic covers he may have opened a bottle of wine it's a stand-up comedy club (laughter) that doesn't help that's almost beside the point oh that's still-- no actually it's unfortunately the opposite lilah is it lilah perhaps we should talk to this lydia as well because she is obviously in a position of being told what she is going to do with herself stop it travis god i can't-- we can pass on this for now please that's true life needs moisture to live all right gauntlet dropped is there shade in this establishment could be worse they could not be afraid of you that's when you know you've really found the right bar the rats were like we reserved this table two weeks ago you have to make a phone call just let it happen shifty eyes oh we're going to get to see the real bar i'm in the center as well i don't feel included in this okay now i feel better that's all is the password i am what i am not sure too strange a reference never mind that's exactly what i said the real bar no this is special i'll join you we could buy korshad a drink thank you to drink same did you order the drink for when he comes back what table did the bartender look at when he said that yeah that's a safe 13 very fair pike which one of those two is vax's which one of those two belongs to vax oh that one i'm taking a sip of it that's fine i put my whiskey in its place and take the whole cup he has to sit and enjoy his drink that's whiskey that's supposed to be-- never mind go ahead do what we do any time there's trouble sit down pay attention and do everything she says have a sip of this it'll help okay now i feel like i'm on a listing ship does this one still work we can do this one this is a lot of drink that i seem to have taken on 12 of them 12 men is that conversation breaking up i would assume you've already had this stuff at this point we've been sharing a cup around this is too much for a human being to handle the interior of that bag looks like the pirates of the caribbean ride it's a little weird in there well there that's where i think we could come to an arrangement we're not particularly invested in the power structure here we're here for sentimental reasons the estate and just enough property to maintain a modest comfortability we don't really care what happens to the fortune so long as your family's taken care of you keep your house you keep your things you keep a little bit of property to manage what do you think i mean they did make this bed i'm suggesting to you that maybe it is not your job to save your family's power and allow them to keep going as the way they have but just to give them enough that even if they-- that they can continue with reasonable means maybe not necessarily living the life that they were living before but living far more comfortably oh i imagine so it's just there's a difference between saving everything and saving enough to keep them comfortable possibly and enough income property for them to be relatively comfortable reasonably comfortable i'm sure we can take a look at the assets and come to a very very reasonable arrangement and you in turn-- well we could have a discussion about what that would be worth to you i have no interest in making an arrangement that doesn't please you we're only here again for sentimental reasons we are not invested beyond that please god you've been terrible today 15 we'll also need some operating capital for this it sounds dangerous so we will take the job but we will need to also charge a very reasonable fee i think on top of this we do i'm feeling pretty good about this one we will also need all of the information you have on this creature in the mines and if you have anybody who has access to that-- and we do have another mercenary at our beck if we need that's actually very fair you're already one up vex says yes and i am so in the mood to kill something (laughter) cheers this stuff burns everyone on the count of three we're going to stand up very quickly if we misty there we could also camp for the night we can misty there camp for the night that'll do whatever it is it's not leaving the mine well no one wants to die or he could pop in on you anytime wow that happened we could make her walk first into the mines i am perfectly content to hold onto that chit for as long as we need she was employed she's reachable through employment we can just find out how to reach her you have to be able to hire her i'm sure there's a system you promised you'd keep that secret you're going to fart awkwardly and we're going to yell imposter in the morning yes we actually do if we're doing our little circle i would say that a little bit of a distance about half a mile away they don't talk back but yeah can we speak to dead why don't you two misty there somebody start setting up camp for tonight you can still misty we're still misty-able you can fly in talk to them and fly back out i mean land and then-- i'm going to set up the tents you know you're standing in the woods protection from acid would probably be very-- recently awoken we're golden gods how many of these creatures are there then this is a stealth mission i love starship troopers i'm excited i don't think they'll know i think anybody who was there who saw it probably died at the center of it i mean you can i mean we've gone to all this trouble but if we want to add to it i mean this is just what we've been doing no i understand i respect the art form i'll unload everything it's from medieval times only if you actually do the interpretive dance i love toastmasters is bacon what we're fighting for this is the most burning man thing that's ever happened on this show i'm flashing back bacon speech i always imagine occasionally keyleth gives a speech that's like what's-his-name from animal house not really why yeah it will hopefully not come in handy a vest of several items now i think that's been working out very well for us it is pitch black down there though isn't it yeah that's actually true i think that that's a really good idea shooting an arrow down there so when we're ready we've got something to light the-- well then they'll be easier to kill up here than they will be down there this is why magic freaks me out fire a fireball into the abyss will it just eventually stop this is why magic's weird worth it it was worth it it didn't cost us anything and that's information we didn't have and now we know great baby beast is not at the bottom-- it's not at the bottom of the topless pit two flyers plus the carpet let's have the flashlights ready but not activated did your voice just crack becoming a man okay i think it's better especially-- have we seen a tree that we can port to in case of an emergency or some sort of object that we can port to but there will not be a tree down there laura and do we have an escape route if we need it well all right yeah it's bigger than the first one how much weight can the carpet take you're 300 pounds right okay so three of us on that carpet one big one one little one and a medium i'll join you on the broom yeah okay then that solves it no this is very clever i see what you're going for oh my god they're right there the blondie channel target should now spend five feet of movement to automatically escape from non-magical restraints such as manacles or creatures that have grapple you are parkour let's go (singing) and a partridge in a pear tree i'll hop on the broom you hop on the carpet 27 let's get a little closer celestial that would be amazing oh we have that low-light version we have the red-light version of it you don't speak celestial except they're lensed and contained a beam of red light and just start to see if i can make out what it is what does it say it's an incubator this isn't a coffin it hatched i snuff the second 30 i rolled a 19 and my initiative is 11 i am going to debate hard how dumb i'm about to be where am i goddamn it okay so i'm far away from that little bugger aren't i okay i'm going to hop off the broom actually no you're going to move towards it i assume okay that's fair i'm going to hop off the broom activate my boots and activate my gloves and start running through that little choke point and i'm going to get as close to and possibly on the wall of that choke point as humanly possible the other side of the choke point okay i can get about there that's fine that's as far as i can get right now that will be just fine the gloves are charged the boots are on and i'm heading towards the wall yep i'm not on the carpet you can move the carpet forward though what do we get you're over on the corner i don't know if i have another and you reroll ones right didn't you move wait no you moved didn't you that's fixable no is it a bonus action yeah you burn five feet of movement to get out of it you parkour around the rocks as they try and-- see what happens one day it's going to be epic so is the wall hitting the roof i'm going to run up to the top of that wall how far will my movement get me in that case-- oh fuck i've got nothing i can do well then i will burn my action to dash up and i assume i can get part of the way down the wall as well with my action yeah so i just want to start making my way i'm going spider-man that was definitely irritating that and i'm going to cast hex on that little baby and he has disadvantage on let's make it his wisdom checks that's a lot of actions this creature i haven't actually technically attacked it i'm amazed he didn't already have it out of the bag puny god and he gets flung in a random direction all of us we don't have advantage on this do we i'm going to burn a resolve 17 wait that's magical i have advantage the cloak wouldn't-- against spells and other magical effects it wouldn't have given me advantage on that save yeah we should head out and bug bomb the place grab the body let's go really quick just look around is there anything of value to grab before we run we pulled you out i think we're flying up and if we see anything we'll just take shots at anything that's rolling around if anything is visible let's just do damage on our way out we can't tree stride there's no trees you know at this point it might be should i reroll yeah i'll reroll 18 i want to start taking shots as high up as i can see i want to start taking shots at these things i'll live with that 17 nope ashley and i'm going to burn a reroll it's the end of my resolves ten is there anything we can throw down there to really piss them off bug bomb i'm at 57 hit points yay where were you at i feared for you man why you make us kill a baby that was great these two have to be the first to go down because loot drop
