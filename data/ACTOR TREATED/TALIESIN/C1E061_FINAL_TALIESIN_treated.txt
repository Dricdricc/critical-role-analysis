read your contract it was a free $50 coupon for lyft i'd like to take a look in the cave as well a little bit just observing the entrance to see if there's anything written any type of language on any of the entrances or otherwise 21 nothing of consequence no that looks dark and there was a giant cosmic bear in there i think in general it's probably best to respect anything's home on this plane of existence i'm not feeling this one i don't know what can i tell you i normally like to gamble and i'm not feeling a gamble on this one it's just not pretty enough it's really not pretty enough we've already won something here well yes because we don't care if they die is there anybody here of reasonable intelligence who wants to stop this from happening just checking (deadpan) please whatever you do don't do it my god please if you're going to do it have a light source i hand a torch is it a bear skull oh i thought they were saying this out loud no but i can keep very good count though all right we keep taking it from her i'll take that bet i'll take a three-gold bet 200 seconds nine (sighing) oh bloody hell no not at all wait so the candles and skulls were there or they weren't there the whole theory of a path is you're supposed to somewhat stay on it i imagine whatever we decide right now is exactly what happened yes what yes of course we camped out right before that you are he wants something big in the front i'm all right with that he's under contract which means that there are places and things he might be able to help us with it's worth having him i feel like hats are almost a traditional sign of something a little iffy present company included of course could be dangerous we don't know actually know it could be anything it could be many things you're very clever about that stealth plus ten advantage versus magic well there you go i'm hearing this cacophony and i'm slowly getting up with a sigh and moving in the direction of the campsite slow walk you've got time keyleth can you druidcraft some cotton no we're going to save them you owe me six gold vex could you go fetch a pail of water there's nothing to be done about that it's a campsite correct i'm going to start wandering until at least i have a sense of the size of it just the basic features of the area come on that would be ten vex what did it look like the area where they are were there tents just dirt was there a fire pit single fire pit lit set of drums violin if we can save one we can everybody possibly i haven't seen it yet i'm going to try and get a little closer to it gently i have packed my ears i'm backing up natural 20 i sit i pull out bad news and i start to get a good look no i'm just going to cripple you calm down the instruments are noncorporeal i believe one way to find out i'm going to take a shot at the violin i haven't done this in so long 17 to hit the violin 12 points of damage 12 no round two the instruments and the campsite i think the campsite just might be a campsite i want to try and douse the fire is he starting to make his way out of the camp i'm going to shoot him in the shoulder with my retort gun ooh just barely 16 taking another shot rolling like shit that's better 20 thank god it's been so long where are all my dice just a nick 16 points of damage (cackles) really it's more of an intermission it's a trap it's not actually musical instruments have you not figured that out yet this is quite literally the land of literalism at this point dozens this is the best simulation of our old home game that i've had i find that very reasonable we literally have no idea what we're up against in any direction cute and dainty also means scary and dangerous i feel like that went rather well took less than three tries to figure that out just have to desecrate a relic i feel like we've desecrated relics before how's that book going but i also will admit i kind of want to see the pixies yes we are i think you would look fetching in a new lined winter jacket you're our guide guide us we're supposed to go where we're going so you're supposed to get us there how do we get there garmelie i'm so curious as to what happens if you're going to renege on our contract i'll also say if we are going to attack the were-creatures it would be nice to have a little help maybe from the pixies if we explain our situation we can make a decision and either help the were-creatures or-- it will be the last word you ever say natural 20 i will say that from what i gather of this realm it probably isn't enough it'd be kicking the hornet's nest certainly i think they're probably hanging back a bit i don't know if they'd want to get this close the two of us could snipe something out isn't that brilliant he's already burned the mansion i'm a big fan of hallucinatory terrain that's of course assuming that the little green rocks work here there's an awful lot of reasons why the little red rocks wouldn't work natural one no 11 i don't think we can leave until we take care of this we were running from the pixies so we have to try harder it didn't work i feel like they're terrible communicators this is going to be appalling don't i feel like we all learned a very valuable lesson right now let's sit down and camp and in the morning we'll go and kill some pixies i'm going to attempt to cast minor illusion on the other side of the wall just an image of myself is jameson his real name or a nickname that doesn't jive i think we have to pick a terrible idea and stick with it until it becomes far too much for us to deal with i propose we take a nap go back and deal with the pixies one way or another you'll take first watch she needs to rest sleeping what yes what that's nice all right i slowly crawl out i pull out a piece of parchment and i write hello fairies we're napping and i put it on the tree above us and go back to sleep all right fine my watch i'll get up i sit up and take the watch i will take the watch and i will make some tea with the tea set we're about to find out then aren't we i am joining you for this ridiculous tea party i specifically did not join those conversations your charisma's up by two which means-- there is tea would you like some tea i am tempted to fashion the thing that i use to pour my molds into little sippy cups that can be shared we are aware we need to have a conversation good morning so we thought we would just trick them oh that was him we're on a mission though no not to kill well you're a bit intimidating we are wise enough to not judge a man or woman by their size good sir stop antagonizing the grog statue and we have a bog to destroy there's a cancerous tree that we have been sent to destroy wait no we need that i wouldn't advise that i cast hex on the main pixie i do it's not very nice is it 27 a lot but they die quick what's the best check to give him i can give him disadvantage on an ability check so wisdom or intelligence i feel better about killing them just couldn't let it go i'm so sorry i just couldn't let it go 27 we are some fast motherfuckers we were trying really hard not to shoot first where's the one that i hexed do you think they're really hard to hit because they're small don't forget to trinket is it an action taking a shot with retort with the little pistol at the fucker i've marked dear god almighty 16 to hit shoot again that's better 25 okay it has been way too long since i've done this it's making me a little nervous there we are that's 11 points of piercing damage that's with three points of necro in there and i'm going to take one more shot at it with-- remind me if i can do this-- deadeye with sharpshooter all right deadeye sharpshooter thank god this is just sucking oh my fucking god i miss all right now i'm diving behind that tree bottom right heading that way yeah did you just say snapricot this is going so poorly assholes you also have an inspiration die yeah i'm looking at it yeah advantage versus magic on his saving throw it's on his sheet which means he found it somewhere a lot of good it did you we would be getting our asses kicked by a group of werewolves right now trying to settle this amicably does that go through her there's one on the other side of her okay from my vantage point i'm going to sit down take out bad news take another deadeye sharpshooter with bad news at the big fat fucker by the tree i don't can i take a step out to the left as long as she has less than three-quarters cover i'm okay okay so i'll move to my right a little bit then and i will shoot that fucker that's right in front of me yep sharpshooter and with deadeye that's a natural 20 that makes the grit go away anyway so nice that actually wasn't the golden snitch i was just feeling like they had something on me okay so this is double the dice roll the dice double it and then i add everything lordy this is going to be disintegration six 12 22 28 points of damage yep yeah i rolled really low flutters back up barely nothing fancy just hitting it again that's a 23 that's better 24 points of damage i call out one and back up behind the tree kill them all build a dam sorry actually the one i killed turned him-- she's pixie dust going to be a beaver again i've never seen this before inspire vax the guy this ain't going to be no thing it's going to be great it's going to be beautiful isn't it hilarious that we all have work tomorrow hot and cold to tell the tale of the death and end of vox machina to little people i'll go do you want to go first i'll go first i'm going to flip around and take a shot at that jerk right there with the retort pistol not the bad news standard shot that's a 31 to hit and that's 14 points of damage i reload i flip around the other side of the tree over to this side so i can get a good vantage point on that one that thinks it's hiding right over there i use my bonus action to cast hex on him yep to carry it over and i take a shot at him that's 22 to hit ten points of damage three necrotic i'm going to burn an action surge and take three more shots at it i'm going to roll a sharpshooter for that one as well which is great because i rolled a two and a natural 20 that's natural 20 with sharpshooter that also means that i lose that grit this is going to be great that's great ten 20 30 36 points of damage i'm taking two more steps and i'm getting that next fairy that thinks he can fucking hide from me i'm taking one more step out so i can see him actually i have pretty good sight don't i i've got two more shots i'm going to do the same thing with the sharpshooter deadeye combo that's right i can't get hex until next round though 27 to hit that's 16 points of damage another shot at him same deal 28 eight points of damage i dive back around the tree and that's the end of my turn here's two more d8 roll them twice whoa you're going to leave an impression in the tree you just clapped a fairy to death that's actually literally the opposite there's one left i walk over and scrape the tree we are going to finish off the fairies yes really it did it was all your fault really you were very helpful hit hard repeatedly no you burned your lower-level spells we're starting to be they do that here i guess it's the only way out of here it's a violent world i am abso-fucking-lutely looting this city are you mad i have a dollhouse at home there are things that are necessary jesus 13 i'm taking the crystals too the dead crystals i say we get to the edge out of this forest and then maybe call it a night then they trapped us they didn't really let us out we're tapped we had a long day you did you've grown
