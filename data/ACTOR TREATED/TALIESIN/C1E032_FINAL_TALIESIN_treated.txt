the castle spread the word you're literally going to steal from my great-grandfather all right i'm going to check my family grave the family crypt oh that's right i know the city well enough to take us through a relatively-- well honestly if pike weren't here i'd say fine but (sighs) how do you think i am pike (sighs) there's a secret entrance to the castle to the west in the woods i think perhaps if we made our way there we could-- camp out perhaps it would be a roof over our heads if we got there and we could take care of anyone-- i'm not allergic to cats let's make our way to somewhere quiet 15 with disadvantage clang clang clang do i know what this sound is i don't think i've ever rolled that before 14 16 it should be around here does this look familiar to me i think this might be it i don't think they're expecting anyone from here abandoned pike can you take a look at this cough before we take a rest how many spells do you have left i think we should take a rest i don't know i've had a cough and i'm complicated no (sighs) no did i heal as well i do feel better should i randomize which corruption point vanishes oh it's compounding i feel better i feel more like myself (coughs) i'm still coughing but i feel much better thank you it could be i'm not quite finished yet we'll see where we are tomorrow i'm going to take care of a little business outside and then we'll seal up the opening i'm going to charge the diplomacy glove grog already sealed it we can't do it in here because it would make too much noise i'm sleeping (groans) yes i don't know if i can do both of those things but okay yes i don't know anything about this thing except that this last time this last time was different than the first time this last time didn't (sighs) this last time i felt more like me and less like i was being drawn somewhere i wasn't entirely me but it's hard to describe i felt like i had contained it a bit i feel like maybe maybe i can keep it under check i don't know i would expect no less vax i have a sister i'm hoping i shall no i'm running really low no no oh god yes i'm going to sleep before this happens 22 once we're inside the castle we'll be able to-- not even wait a while we'll go in well we had a grog let's see if we can keep civilian casualties to a reasonably small amount no i think it's going to take all of us to defeat the briarwoods once the briarwoods are gone i think a lot of this will get a lot easier wisdom advantage nice (sighs) to whitestone do i recognize this part of the passage please defeat this door doors of whitestone curse you doors let's all push i'll join 12 i could have done that well fine i could probably confirm this this is absolutely the dungeon i would like to start making my way in that direction i'm being stealthy 21 i'm heading towards whichever cell had been mine the left path shh i would say it's almost safer for her down here for now no i know all of them i did live here no because that's a spell they were going to feed her to something we'll be back there are things upstairs that we can't protect you from that we are going to deal with first there is war outside right now damn grog
