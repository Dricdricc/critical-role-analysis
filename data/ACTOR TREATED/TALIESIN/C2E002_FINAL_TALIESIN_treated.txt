that's the same embarrassment that you feel about us the way we're feeling about you now by far the most fourth of all of these books it's easily the most fourth thank you this is new just went for this it's going to slowly darken over time it's going to be keyframed and photoshopped i'm aware i've already been told that's it's going to happen traveling carnival of curiosities i'd like to make a counteroffer you'll be fine i think maybe it has nothing to do with us i think maybe we were just caught in the crossfire sorry sir trying to keep my mouth shut exactly how did we kill them exactly thank you yes you see-- oh are you waiting for me to speak yes he's the only one natural 20 about fucking time you little shit no just shocked to see someone die in front of me not more than-- it's the one accent that i really have trouble with bastard the one that we know is a problem this has never-- anything like this has ever happened before and thank you for the record i don't owe any of you anything-- --i swear but thank you and i'm ready to help with this no that's an act that's not anything it's just a show it's nothing special it's just a guy making a buck all right he's fine by the way where's the obnoxious one the really loud-- is this part of the show by the way i was just curious i'm going to be very helpful and not go in there with the two of you while you try and get her out i'll stand guard i have nowhere to go how many kittens is that again she didn't you're putting your neck out for toya for some strange reason and i don't know why she's perfectly capable of handling herself not that i can remember they all look the same after a while busy yeah nothing like this hundreds possibly thousands of shows yeah thousands of shows nothing never it's not us which other two oh your friends you call them stinky and the little one all right thank god if i'm going to listening to somebody's life story i'm going to need a drink you gorgeous what's your name adelaine i would like a round for all these terrible people and one for myself what's the difference between these three beers i've honestly got to admit they all taste the same to me let's get a round of von brandt for everybody i don't know i'm going to ask for one of each of these beers because i want to have a tasting competition i'm not going to be drinking alone how'd you etch a deck in the table oh you think that's what they look like i'm already in my cups she's blue it's very true i'm from the circus oh yeah quite a while long as i can reasonably remember at the very least it's been a while it's nice i like it they're good people work hard that's a very funny story actually me too thank you these swords-- you buy a drink and we'll see how much i owe you for the first round mother always told me to never give a story away for free i already like your mother i can tell i'm going to join you on this one 16 there's only one way to find out i'm looking at her waist what's on her waist i'm going to guess ten i want to hear you say it anyway that's 40 days it's the second button sorry drinking i did order two extra two extra you're no fun are you trying to learn magic is that a thing he's family we take care of each other he's a good man well they have all my things and they have all my family i'm going to figure out what is going on try and find out what's actually doing this i assume since it's none of us it's going to happen again well i-- i'm sure if we sleep on it we'll think of something that's fair a bit yeah where exactly am i going to be sleeping by the way i can sleep down here but it might be nice-- excellent you don't mind i'm going to pull the swords off finally and start getting comfortable out of the performance clothes there is a button for it all but the one you bought me to be fair i didn't give you that story i very carefully start unfolding my robe and it has my swords very carefully laid out in there from the closet i do a little prayer and put everything back on i am of course you seem honest well the swords are magic according to my mum they go back in our family generations to a very unusual rare line of tiefling that came from a demon of ice that lived inside a volcano our family and i take this with a grain of salt were royal guards were entrusted with these magic swords and these swords can only be activated by the blood of the royal family so in honor of any fighting i ever do with them i make sure my blood is at least drawn once what am i fighting against that would be deception all right i'm lying like a motherfucker i walk downstairs i've already gone i'm having breakfast i'm leaving a note with the barkeep for yasha if she comes back well i mean look at me i go into my bag i do have a disguise kit don't i i think i do it's so weird to just have things now yeah i have a disguise kit it'd be a little tricky for me i look like what i'm going to look like but the rest of you could do a little work we could just shower this one that would be enough i tend to find these things don't blow over necessarily as more they just eventually decide someone's guilty and take their revenge on them not this particular one but yes none taken really a little taken but that's fine she's right immediately the two of us are going to get hit with this do you want assistance with this oh with advantage i assume i've just got some very basic black robe that just-- i'm sure i've got a set yes please this is a lot of work it's a natural 20 that'll do it now i'm kicking myself no never mind i didn't do it at the time i can't do it now no retconning never mind has adelaine noticed any of this let's call that a-- 14 thank you i go single just a little bit after and i rolled a natural 20 yep it seems to be iron like my will me and my magic swords who was he would be my question seems to be the most appropriate thing to ask at this point these small towns most everyone knows everybody else we're the logan's run of d&d retired fisherman do we know where he was retired from and where he was staying maybe where he was drinking he had to go somewhere is that with the weird e spelling i'm always a fan ye olde it's pronounced the when you see the ye the what is this a metaphor or is this actually a real thing i was doing my rounds we've been doing a pub crawl i down my shot what did the man drink out of curiosity what was his final drink i'm a bit of a macabre person myself i'll take one more and i'll get one of my own we got a reader while they're doing this i'm going to saunter over to the card player not there at all i just sat down for a moment with this solitaire player they say that solitaire is the game for the death-obsessed there's inevitability to every hand most of them are doomed from the start no matter what you do any interest to buck fate and try your hand at an opponent for once no money just friendly i slide the rest of my whiskey over i've been called worse i'm just a man who saw another man die yesterday it's been heavy on my conscience and i was just wondering if there was anything you could tell me about enon i'm regretting it myself has he that's not what other people have said why do you think he went why do you think that happened to him fuck the circus so that's what you think happened to him then i feel like there's something evil afoot again i've been called worse sure you have in your time as well i take my cup back down it i love small towns awfully convenient that rule's been around for as long as i can remember because it makes people think the show's dangerous gives them a thrill we're not really worried about people having a heart attack we want people to be worried about having a heart attack because then they're more excited to come see the show this is how these shows work before my time it's a boilerplate if you were trying to hide doing something to someone it's a great candidate if i was trying to get away with something terrible idea wait what what kind of weird start at the docks but i'll keep that in mind i was about-- nope nevermind i was about to be very impressed but i take it back what does usta mean very good i'd like to avoid the guards for as long as possible i'm comparing the snake to the snake that's tattooed on my hand to try and get the heads to be the exact same size you think anyone would have wanted him marked or harmed in some way this is just a snake this is a big weird snake i'm looking at no i've been looking at the snake this entire time nine looks like mine much bigger i'd say the docks are his home if we could figure out where he lived he was last seen at the circus you don't happen to know what happened to his son by any chance i take the compliment i'm putting it my pocket i'm keeping it for later well she's making friends with everybody i don't see any of you making friends were you being sarcastic-- oh no you weren't okay catching up on that only the pure of heart make their answer out of riddles back to the tavern you're going to probably you know poof i can maybe put a rope through the window i got rope i'll go through the front like a proper person right and then i'm going to drop some of the rope out the back window for them (singing) 50 feet of hemp rope it's a standard how you're already so ahead though we are at d&d jury duty i'm sitting playing with the cards any progress that was a power move right there no you know what i'm going to take it how long have you known this one anybody who's watching this happen that explains a lot i feel like there should be some more gossip then there is that's very true i leave the rope tied in here can we use your cat reel it back up in so that there's no trace of us until we need to get back there no i'm telling you that your cat is going to haul up a rope it's not that heavy of a rope it's just hemp well if i throw it back up there then i imagine you cat can knock it back down at the very least i assume he's an asshole cat aren't all cats asshole cats i assume he's going to-- that's fair not that big of a town there's three rooms and they all have windows oh for god's sake i pull out a big thing of string oh well then i'm taking my string back i'm going to do one last thing before we leave which is just tussle the room a bit so it looks like it's been robbed just in case they do come in 17 12 i'm just going to try to meditate on the strange death and see if i can feel anything all right just see how this goes 17 maybe we have to go back to the circus it's early enough maybe we should just-- i hate to admit it but maybe-- it's not us it's like an emoji is math or something seven i'm in my black hood i've got my hood up now we are just the worst this is just terrible it's where we camp they're not going to talk to you without me so i'm coming too i'm fabulous i'm going with the girls because the circus kids won't talk to them without me no 17 which of the tents is currently occupied toya and kylre share a tent that's right it would be desmond we have a wagon we were told to set it up here if i recall that sounds right if i recall we were specifically told to set up tent right here what's the easiest tent to get to without-- i want to go with whatever's furthest away from the guards what's the easiest to get to without-- i'm going to go back there and do our traditional (bird call) yuli it's mona and yuli i'm going to try one of the other tents am i getting the sense that any of them are in over here i'm going to very gently lift the back of the tent up and not go in through the front and just-- (whispering) do you know what's going on (switches to normal volume) assume we're whispering because this is bullshit how is it what's happened i could be worse they couldn't be worse and then yasha yasha'd i don't know did toya see anything did she say anything no i've picked up a few scragglers they're idiots but they're helping what do they think happened what are they asking what would be the point yasha's the newest but she can be flighty you've never met it-- well nevermind oh god that's a new thing now circus shitty in a tent over there is everybody still here they've not taken anyone away other than-- we're carnival people we've all got our issues you don't end up here if you're not a little weird first blood oh for fuck's sake i'm going to do my best i'm going to quietly sneak out the back of the tent again and sneak into the-- oh god i hate all of this 13 with advantage i'm not going to make the noise i'm just going to-- we're going to go in the tent (shushes) that's what i'm trying to figure out what the fuck is going on they're with me it's been complicated gustav's in deep bosun's in deep what did you see i don't know this is ornna i assume ornna is the fire dancer for fuck's sake they're going to kill every last fucking one of us unless we figure this out what do you think i don't know i think that they're trying to cover something oh god i miss pass without a trace so much that's a number that's so good i'm going to have a tiny bit of conversation with her her name's beau she's helping she's awful you have a lot in common i'm going to walk by the two twins because i'm circling the tent trying to get a look and be like i've absolutely been talking shit you're both terrible i give them both a kiss on the head and keep walking they may not let us leave they may be killing us all they're weird out there they're very weird out there ornna's in the tent with us while you're talking to the twins i'll be talking to ornna oh for fuck's sake it's not fucking gustav it's like she's never experienced boredom it's very weird hey ornna (sighs) i mean i know your feelings on all this what do you think really what exactly would you have done they were useless well that's on me and-- that's on me they would ornna ornna i've got a little ipad button on the back of my pen it's quite nice ornna you might as well come clean this is classic you i'm just trying to-- oh fuck you too it's no secret that ornna and gustav have their differences but this ridiculous i mean she knows damn well that half the circus would leave if he got fucking arrested and died but this is not his style i just grab-- what do you mean evil kind of vibe he's what that's just a name it's not actually like real thing that just-- [stammering] what do you-- i grab and push you down into the ground and hold you (shushing sounds) not yet girls we're not supposed to be here can you help us handle this (sighs) we'll do what we can if something goes wrong nudity usually works [laughing] which one's nancy which one's drew just one more question this season got dark season got dark
