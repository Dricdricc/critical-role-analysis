talking about no no it's cold very cold she was great wasn't she zahra is great as well the clouds disperse the immediate danger over but the royal family lies on the throne room floor catatonic upon inspection their souls are missing and their bodies failing the party recalls the four glowing orbs they recovered from the clasp headquarters behind modeth now identified as soul jars and through a rigorous and tense evening all souls are successfully restored to the family a few days pass and sovereign uriel tal'dorei calls the party for audience he thanks them all for their bravery heroism and for saving him his family and quite possibly all of emon as thanks he offers them a place on the tal'dorei council and informs them of his intent to throw another winter's crest festival to make up for the ones ruined in westruun and here via assassination attempt where they will be celebrated as heroes he has also commissioned the construction of a keep for them on the outskirts of emon as a sign of his very deep gratitude a week later the festival begins the populace is out in full force to meet and celebrate vox machina but during the festivities the party notices uriel's son gren speaking to another child-- one with black hair and golden eyes they immediately spring to apprehend the child but he escapes with uriel's son they give chase following him into an alley and through a portal of some kind the party finds themselves atop a large island drifting through the astral plane surrounded by a perilous bramble forest they fight their way through eventually coming upon a gothic mansion towards the center of the landmass within the party makes their way to the inner library where numerous kidnapped children are working all about the place cleaning nervously the dread emperor as he calls himself stands from his chair the child illusion fading into a golden-armored man with long black hair four children chained at the neck to his breastplate he attacks the party with fierce magic mind-controlling all of his child servants to attack as well with the first blow dealt they realize that damaging him also hurts the chained children one boy accidentally falling in battle to keyleth's magic eventually they succeeded in destroying the dread emperor and return to emon with a host of lost children happily now found six months of peace follow as their new keep is constructed and the party scatters to their separate business until its completion upon their return they assess their new abode with delight naming it greyskull keep they then send out job inquiries seeking guards for hire and servants after an impromptu try-out they settle upon their new hires to a lumberjack old spice commercial make it happen brian blessed my favorite kind of pie all right of course i know yes it was really not my birthright i was not raised to rule i still have work to do outside the city ripley's still on the loose and knows far too much and i feel more than a little responsible for her and what she may do honestly cassandra had a better upbringing than i did for this sort of work they expect better of us i know i understand we are held to a different standard and it's difficult perhaps it's time for a council perhaps it's time for shared rule there should always be a de rolo in whitestone but perhaps we could share the weight yennen would you be comfortable sharing some of this burden i think the de rolos keep the castle but i think we use the castle to-- quintumverate five a religious leader someone from the farming communities someone from the economic community someone from the trade community-- from the citizenry from some known community yes interests will be thought of and there will always be a noble to be a tiebreaker when necessary and to judge from a place of (sighs) greater good all things considered i think that you're more trustworthy than i am at this point let's not forget that i was the one who let you down first i'm going to give her one of the stones you're going to be so happy when we have instant access to the treasury if anything bad should happen if there's any need of quick retreat or quick communication this is a one-way trip to us and in return this is a one-way trip for us to you in case of emergency you were born for this you were instructed in how to do this where i never was i will organize-- let's not forget that within six hours of meeting each other i ended up handing over an enormous sum of money to you it was quite a bit of gold if i recall you have it written down don't you that's so endearing yes really (laughs) all right all right in that case-- alcohol does make everything better you're doing very well thank you i won't forget i can't even think of what the revenge felt like anymore it's not it doesn't weigh on me just regret of how much better i could have been thank you i will try to be better that's my plan (laughs) you're strange you know that no we like it don't change boonzy
