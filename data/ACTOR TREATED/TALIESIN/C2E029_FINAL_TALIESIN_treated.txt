that was the one thing i couldn't say on talks was my first thought when molly died was i just lost three days off of my artbook schedule oh god oh no please no i'll be the first to greet him it should be fine i still look like a guard it's definitely probably starting to turn a little weird let's head upstairs and take care of this i think you're overplanning let's just go upstairs we'll tell them everything's fine and then we can kill the two of them it should be fine [laughter] two escaped prisoners one got them out damn shame no we got an-- you really not following i felt like that was really clear i'm going to see if i can get them to leave the house and if they don't leave the house then i think you should probably shoot them with that thing it's a number i'm going to position myself in the corner between that-- hunch against the wall try and lose my breath if that makes sense i grab nott by the scruff and lift him away her oh thank you there's a whole conversation there that i'm excited to have when we're not having okay-- we need one for questioning man we caught one of them nope no we got you my deception-- that's 15 i have his face though i have the face of the one-- i'm not wearing a costume am i i mean i look like one of the guards oh no where's my initiative i can top that i got a six i'm also going to peek my head around the corner and i'm going to blow a little bit and cast sacred flame it's a dex 16 save i didn't think so that's 14 points of damage i hope so that came together pretty nicely you're really good at the whole fake hostage thing too that was great acting it was very-- oh that was great we still got two downstairs did somebody see something i'm going to-- i don't know why i'm being quiet we should head downstairs 12 i also have a thing i'd like to do nope probably for the best ashley johnson has nothing on me in this realm yay [sympathetic yelling] two (laughing) the lowest i can roll we get props [cheering] i'm actually going to turn around and start searching that hallway i want to search this little hallway for a switch or some kind of panel to open this thing from this side all right is there anything i can do yeah no i don't find anything after adding my negative investigation number it's a one hey fella hi friend what oh yeah oh i can do it cannot be mocked yeah it was dex for me always fun aw there's a tiny table you can move i see that this is no longer fruitful get a little momentary frustration i'm going to drop this ridiculous form i'm in and go back to normal i'm going to dive underneath the door take a look assess the situation i'm going to take my staff and i'm going to whisper to it it's lunchtime children let's throw a swarm of insects right into the middle can i put it right on top of that problem in the corner so it can't quite be seen by anyone down the hall but close enough to bite even if i go all the way okay how close can i get to him can it make a bite attack i think i get a bite attack on first appearance 30 feet can't move yet it's cool you look really cool hi i'm very impressed now that i realize that we're in fighting shot i'm going to back up so i'm to the far left corner that's as far as i can get all right i'll go invisible until my next turn yeah you don't know me that's what it feels like all right i'm going to send my insects further down after them i'm going to push to the far corner of the hallway and take a look down to see if i see anything as far as i can get oh then now it's over hey cool a minute it would be very us well i mean if that's the options i'm just going to just tap my staff and cast dispel at third level yeah it's a second level spell right what third level all right so i'll cast that well i mean if they just asked i would've-- i don't know okay sure that doesn't look that good that's very good are we back online again so are you both healed now i'll throw a cure wounds at each of you just to get that out of the way here we go that's (counting) 12 points to you and ten points to you and that's all my 1st-level spell slots that's cool wow you worked so hard on it language i'm going to use a little thaumaturgy to make sure it's actually got some noise to it i'll puppet it a little bit i don't have a coconut i-- so yeah i'm going to give it a little bit of sound i can make it sound-- i'm going to use thaumaturgy to make it sound like she's in pain so-- i'm holding the crystal up like a microphone can you give me like three big deaths three medium deaths and three little deaths (laughter) some open mouth closed mouth kind of shit i'm just going to need a lot of-- i'm going to need a palette to work with yeah i think i'm going to-- oh god-- we don't want all the magic in one place that seems like a bad idea i think i'll pull off and hug the wall to the left and get as far back from that corner as i can do i have time to do a thing okay oh my god this is so embarrassing this is not going to be good what do i got as a-- it's bad enough i'm looking up reactions [groaning sympathetically] five i was also supposed to be against the wall by the way there you are right there thank you five i was waiting for that a wisdom saving throw that's a 27 (laughing) ah all right let's see what i've got okay i feel like you're going to be a problem i'm going to cast blindness on this beautiful beautiful singer that is a constitution-- let me double check yeah that's a constitution saving throw against 16 hmm oh it's happening you know i'm just going to scoot a little-- no i'm fine where i am i think it's just-- yeah that's fine shh solid okay yeah okay this'll be fun i'm going to-- let's try something weird i like weird i'm going to take a couple steps towards the wall and i'm going to get a little closer to that terrible little bard there i'm going to put my back against the upward wall so that i'm out of range of the big blue am i like 15 feet from the bard perfect i'm going to cast spirit guardians i'm going to start whispering into my big purple crystal and then tons of tiny little adorable sharp-toothed fairies are going to come out and start biting and eating a lot they're adorable that's a wisdom saving throw for half damage ooh 16 all right that's fine it stays up forever let's see where's the damage oh there it is one two i don't have enough dice for this that's great let me have a d8 so that's (counting) nine points halved of radiant damage half of nine points of radiant damage as long as he's in the range of it he's at half speed that is my action as a bonus action sorry i'm learning this i thought i had a thing i could do sorry one second i don't have much as a bonus action i'm going to-- can i see caleb as a bonus action can i cast healing word as a level two spell only a cantrip now okay nevermind then well this has been exciting manage a bed bath & beyond it's going to be nice why are we standing next to each other oh wait once he's within 15 feet of me he gets half speed oh no he's not walking once he enters the field he also i believe-- 16 is the-- 18 so half of 18 it's radiant damage is radiant damage doing anything to him okay hmm i'm having a little regret that i didn't pack that faerie fire man who knew i was drinking tea last time i got to pick spells i'm curious about these rooms back here those grates that you've still got covered over what's over there yeah i want to run over there-- i'm going to run over there it'll get me that close i would like to be a little further away so that i am not in blast radius with two other people yeah looks to be a little better darn it yeah i'm going to use my action to-- 15 okay i'm going to turn back around that was my action to take a look in there aw man okay that's my turn 14 22 points i'm good okay let's see what i can do with this first thing i'm going to do is use my bonus action-- to pot a very nice plant oh man it's so hard to do this okay i'm going to use my bonus action to spare the dying to you so we got that no spare the dying for me is a bonus no more death saves i'm going to run over to beau i'm going to tap her and use-- where's my 1st-level spells is it cure wounds but i can cast it at a 2nd-level if i have a 2nd-level left i'm going to cast cure wounds but because she's unconscious she gets all the hit points back not just-- [cheering] you're at 21 hit points you're at 21 hit points level two plus five it means he doesn't have to make death saves at least for the moment but probably could use some healing and i've already used all my actions i'm going to back up against the one in the corner so i have a little bit of cover no the other corner yeah a little coverage there we are i'm going to run over to shak√§ste and while i'm running i'm going to use my bonus action to down a potion of healing which is-- let's see if i'm doing this right that's seven hit points that i regain i should mark that as used then once i'm there i have to use an action to feed him a potion correct okay here's the question does the potion also get my bonus i figured not but i thought it was worth asking i'm going to give you a potion and let's see what i roll that's (counting) 15 hit points you're awake again i'm going to use the rest of my movement to get some cover behind the table i suppose is the closest cover i've got right now i'm getting partial cover smoke them if you got them man seven points oh my god i'm feeling a little better just cup around that's a lot of calculator monks man hey welcome back do i get any sense of what this is i'm going to do detect undead i'm going to see if i can understand what he was 16 i figured i don't know if there's much we can do with this this is a bit-- yeah no you don't want to drink that let's sweep that away why don't we i'm going to try and start figuring out how to open that other gate that i'm next to no i was just going to hit it with my stick until the lock broke or hit the lock with sacred flame or something fun just blow it oh really oh yeah no i want to watch this looks like fun that was so cool wow after you i mean really people aren't good that's not how this works i mean things that you do are good or bad but people are just people you guys keep doing good things and all i've seen is you doing good things i'm not sure what the confusion is about yeah i know
