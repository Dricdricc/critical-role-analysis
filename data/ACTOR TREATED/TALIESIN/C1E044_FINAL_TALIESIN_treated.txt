yes no as i realized as i came out of the haze of portland i'm the new voice of crazy dave in plants vs zombies garden warfare (cheering) thank you (incoherent grumbling) you really don't like the hair do you i went fishing for that one that was nice one scotch to bind them all together well we're only going for a day we could also leave word for where we're going or god forbid if something happens to us they know where to retrieve our bodies i didn't catch that let's head to the loch that's what i would assume is there must be some sort of underground structure some part of the ruins we have robbed cadavers we're running out of good names aren't we we've finally gotten to the end of your list of good names it doesn't matter if it's going to be daylight if we're underground i'm actually hoping that it's the worst decision we make because then everything's uphill thank you i'm just trying to bring-- better double-check that any remnants of ruins around the loch 25 i'm going to put some pressure on the ice with my foot is it giving or is it not giving no i'm walking i'm just testing the ice i'm going to take my mask and put it on and use the glass to create a clear view into the water thank you 50 to 60 feet deep give or take about 30 to 50 feet oh that's a perfect idea we can at least start setting up in the meantime congratulations that's good to know that's what tails are for we can unblock some of the blocked entrances that's what we're going to have to do is unblock the blocked entrance it's getting weird tonight i'm good wake me up when you're done with your shift a bear basket hello yes no i'm pleased for the distraction honestly i feel-- (sighs) i don't hear anything anymore if that's what you're asking i think-- i think all i'm manifesting at this point is scars honestly i feel a little lost now i'm really not entirely sure what i'm doing with myself thank you i know i've been thinking a lot about why we're together and what we're doing and the conclusion that i've been coming to so far (sighs) and pike being the exception to this rule as she's the exception to so many things is i think we're very broken people but i think together we are far greater than the sum of our parts i like who we are together and i think that's important and i like the influence that everyone has on each other and this includes perhaps you taking some strides with yourself (sighs) it's good to want things it's very very good to want things it's also very very good to have things it's good to-- it's good to find the things that are important to you and move towards them i'm in a place where i'm realizing that i have to make decisions about what's important and i'm a little envious that you seem to be ahead of the curve on that i know never and i apologize for any of the mistakes i've made and honestly any of the mistakes i'm likely to make but i am starting to imagine a better version of myself i'm not quite sure who that is yet but there is a destiny i think for us all together we've been given mighty deeds to accomplish we will rise or if we fail no one will ever know (chuckles) 17 i pull out bad news and i'm just going to try and use the scope to trail it's very pretty i don't understand what-- was i i don't think i was there all right i'm out (snorts awake) rickshaw rickshaw-- (snores) (mutters incomprehensibly) (laughter) (mumbles) something rhymes with world i've been breathing on them and that's canon folks i would actually say breathe underwater would be the safer bet in case something happens if we have to escape we don't want to necessarily rely on your consciousness yes they're like oh look fish i'm not going to eat that i'm so bored of it could you build an ice tunnel perhaps take some of the ice and actually structure a-- but there is frozen-- we could take the existing ice and create-- you can control water can you control the water in the mud okay okay i was just throwing it out there i'm going to try to grab the rope ugh that's a 12 since we have bigby's hand why don't we use it to-- wow that's your wisdom modifier holy cow that's awful that's amazing i've never seen anything like it let's go i think we can risk it for now smash are we death star chickens what's happening 32 staying center let's all go down into the spiral staircase you've milked a lot of snails and you've never seen anything like this i think we want to head down down is the way to go that's a disadvantage roll we get two tries each it'll be great (laughter) i have a sword it's a very nice sword that i care about quite a bit i'm in the middle of this or into the hole maybe it goes further down oh i read bullshit i'm going to hop over to where the doors are 13 14 is it yeah that's awesome yeah you have an initiative number 12 no not cool that's 19 it is the burrito supreme of creatures it comes with everything there's a fuck-you beam too there's like literally a fuck-you beam that's really good oh boy first thing i'm going to do-- so it took its reaction so does that mean if i run around it it can't take an attack of opportunity on me or is-- i'm going to try and run past it full speed yeah okay that will do i'm going to-- what's the smart play here yeah sorry i'm going to cast hex on the little fish creature i know that sounds odd but that's what i'm doing that's fine i'm going to take a trick shot at the beholder so i'm going to shoot for the head that tends to go well oh thank god no that's going to miss that's a 15 all right i'm going to take another shot same thing headshot that's a little better 20 20 hits so that's-- god damn it i'm rolling really poorly that's eight points of piercing damage plus he has to make a constitution save or if he missed his constitution save that means he's disadvantage on attacks until the end of his turn okay that's-- good fucking god then just i suppose with my last attack i'm going to shoot that fish person just 'cause we should really clear the board that's better 20-- 31 (blows raspberry) eight i'm going to take the hit it's going to shoot at me isn't it she may not be dead she may just be really really wet and broken i hate beholders so much she's possibly still falling it could be a really deep hole doing so much math wow make a sandbag he's reading 'blindness' right now what god you even make that sound weird first i'm going to deal with this fucker in front of me so i'm just going to pull out my sword and slash him and stab him and see what happens it's a one-handed sword that's 19 to hit all right and that's ten points of damage sorry i don't speak fish (laughter) so my other question is my attempt to cast a spell while in the cone-- does that cancel out that spell so i can't cast it anymore i'm going to make a run for cover towards the-- where's the laser pointer run that way there am i still in its-- okay and while i'm running i'm going to take a shot i'm going to pull out the big gun and take a shot with the big gun and i'm going to attempt to make this a legs/wing hit and i'm going to try and knock him down oh shit okay that's fair no they're not that's very fair in that case i'm going to just do a sharpshooter shot and see how this goes roll well and i have inspiration which i'm going to add to that so that's-- that's 18 to hit thank you that's very useful where's my other d12 why do i never have any d12s there they are nine ten 11 12-- that's 28 points of damage and reload and that's the end of my turn okay not dead it just feels really uncomfortable it's been a while hasn't it does grog travel with it since he's hanging from the chain no you're fine ooh so you get another strength bonus you bump up one he's not down but he's looking pretty rough (laughter) okay i'm going to circle around the side of the wall just buck myself against the wall i'm going to take a couple shots with bad news for a first shot i'm going to be doing-- ah fuck it let's take a sharpshooter shot let's see what happens that's 18 19 20 23 24 that hits 25 so that does 11 21 points of damage reload firing again also another sharpshooter shot 23 that's better that's-- oh wow so that's 36 points of damage using my action surge reloading another sharpshooter shot that hits that's the same i have 13 for-- yeah that hits six seven eight nine ten that's 26 points of damage i reload one last time and i am going to try and hide behind that column right over there big money no whammies trinket with me if you wouldn't mind and we're going to walk up to the altar and push the sarcophagus open i'm going to-- very gently i'm removing the leather armor from the body i'm going to use one of my re-reroll a saving throw that can almost buy a book 21 oh shit running over do it do it do it do it i take out three of my shards of residuum and i place them in where the crystals are as an extra offering i can use my rerolls as well correct i can't use my-- six yes and your brother yes yes everyone everyone that we could save whitestone would be honored we still have the fire ashari yes we haven't had a near-death in ages i am so sorry i am so sorry oh god never sleep again
