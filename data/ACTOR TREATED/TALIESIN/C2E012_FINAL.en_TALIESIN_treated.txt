right ready thank you previously known as the knights of requital we have book boy too he could probably tell if they're the same or not with his-- with his brain yes well the eyes in it yes we had them would we have noticed if they were hand-signed or if they’d been printed these are the most intense public officials i've ever attempted to swindle so i'm not entirely sure what we do at this level leave a mark on a tree etcetera if you agree to these terms and then we leave a mark on a tree similar sort of thing a bag of gold in a trash receptacle i'm saying that there's nothing to commit proof other than money actually exchanging hands we used money for these things all the time back in my day so if that letter asks for some sort of assurance or some sort of money to be placed please hire a couple people you can leave some money in this location for them and if they find that money then they know they actually consented and agreed to this whole argument it isn't that complicated i don't know if richters have fans i'm baffled by the notion of building a box inside of a larger box inside of a larger box to hold papers but fine let's start by talking to our friends before we start investigating our allies i keep trying to make a sound it's just nothing's working beyond actual personal stationery i think the notion would be is that you would actually send your actual handwriting in something like this because that way they would know that it was you you would be very careful how and who you would send that through you wouldn't want a second person taking dictation as you plotted to overthrow the government it's good there's a bathroom on the way to that that works out well maybe a birthday card i thought we were going to take the sewer to get in there perhaps we should just have a two person reconnaissance for now too soon could you parkour the wall i knew you were already there i got ball bearings man (laughter) call me pinball wizard yeah that changes things the landscape a plank of wood will work too we have rope i have pitons and a hammer and rope to a point it's standard carny practice to be able to fake boils and stuff with a disguise kit to leper up a bit sure could fake some sick on people you can just drag me in i can make a scene have we talked about the other house yet because the distraction was obvious was it a guard dog we’re in we're going to need a bigger boat about an hour and who said i was going to do my face we don't want them to look at it too closely oh i'm going to do that too i've got a plan you're not going to touch my clothing no we're not setting fire to my clothing i'm going to mess up my junk what fierce no back at the-- do we have a place where i can work or am i going back to the leaky tap or is that too far away an hour painting my dick no i'm going to need some privacy for that (laughter) really i thought you wanted a distraction a denny's whatever the worst pub ever no i'm going to scramble everything i'm going to get some beer i'm going to get some mayo i'm going to get a little bit of everything i'm going to put it in my-- a little bit of hot sauce no problem we're going to put it in my-- i've got a little water sack i'm going to mix it all up and put it in there and wait till we're ready to go d20 proficiency bonus intelligence modifier that's 11 i have no intelligence bonus you can see that's the brilliance is no one's going to look that closely literally forever shit i didn't even think about that god damn it i'm always ready to make a damn fool of myself no i'm fine i'm perfectly perfectly fine i don't need to do any of this i'm fine no i don't -- i was born in a place like this i don't want anything to -- i'm going to give myself a little (grunt) sir there's -- (vomit) i'm going to go for it right in his face magnets how the fuck do they work that's nice 21 i'm going to start crawling along the floor and i'm going to cut myself a little bit on my neck since i'm used to it i don't mind a little blood i'm giving myself a good cut maybe there'll be a little ice fleck i don't know if i want to activate that if it'll work on my fingernails but what the fuck i'm going to start crawling leaving a trail of vomit into the next room going no no yup off in the distance you hear you have no legal authority over me (vomit) i'm just running the hall i'm crawling in the hall (vomit) i'm still bleeding from the neck i'm going to immediately -- i'm going to go limp then the minute the door's open i'm going to make a break for it i'm out i'm going to bolt full speed all right athletics or acrobatics athletics oh yay that's nice nine it's magic i'm possessed i turn to one and go (in a guttural voice) the power of christ compels you i'm going to use devil's tongue and i'm going to do a couple points of damage to him vicious mockery it's only a couple points on vicious mockery where's my -- i'm not used to magic it's so weird charisma modifier is zero is it i'm blind where does it go it would've been a plus three modifier sorry i'm trying to find that i'm not used to magic yeah never mind all right i know is there a window in the door (cackling) are there bars on the window all right i'm going to peek out the door to see if anybody's coming for a minute i mean the little door window no window in the door and the door is locked okay i'm going to start gently meditating on breaking the window or opening the window if it'll open how long has it been i’m seeing how-- is it possible to open the window god all these numbers i used to be good at but i’m not good at anymore ten that’s fine nope one i’m going to jump out of it yeah that’s okay carry me i’m going to jump into your arms while you do that wait no i’m trying to understand the scene here i thought they were looking at him well if i’m already-- because i didn’t know if i was just standing-- i was already-- towards… i know i’m going to save that for later that is in fact hot sauce i’m going to empty out my canteen into the fire i was making a distraction fools seldom differ i jumped through a window full glass it was great well some of those are sequins but yes essentially it’s not about the plan it’s about the desire to improvise oh yay i had very little so thank you for that it was probably just an attempt to steal medicinals “finalized the plans” we can just promise them money i thought that tied the whole thing together what kind of dog there’s a guard dog it was a mastiff was it a well-kept dog or-- was it a dog of pride or just a dog of-- does it look like the sort of dog that you can actually be proud of or is it just a utility we have a cat then someone would have to get the dog back i’m just talking about getting the dog-- no somebody’s going to have to retrieve the dog if the dog goes running this is the subtle one i’m not showing anybody-- there’s no more of that what if the dog runs the guard will have to get the dog back it was a great plan i was thinking some carnival masks from the other direction everyone’s going to be pretty fancy-dressed masks on sticks if someone stops you if you have a mask they know why you're there i was really expecting more there be the chaos you want to see in the world thank you looking for melrose 11 i was about to say i don't need much i'll pay that yeah i will get reimbursed at the end it's for the best because now there's no paper trail just in case they are trying to-- now i'm really worried about it actually and i can be in the back and be drunk and lookout that's a very good plan 19 we’re so good at this we’re going to sit in the sewer like so much clown candy-themed too mysterious whispers i don’t think that’s true the blue works stick with it you know all right advantage that’s awesome 19 i am what were those guards’ names if we hear the dog bark we can walk by if you also hear me make the same sound again that means trouble if you hear me make noise-- oh we had ring of truth cast you can't lie i did solid she's got the other end sometimes there's balconies french roof i heard a dog barking i feel that this plan was no better than ours we’re keeping an eye on the street i think we're on a corner like far enough away from the house not to be a problem 21 you look like a guard i got my cards out (hiccups) hello pick a card 11 no we had it coming 15 rugs are the new doors that's a number that seems fair natural 20 this is hard being outside it's okay someone had to do it so i know that we can see if they're coming through we may need to distract i'm going to go fuck with the dog i push the cat away with that and do you want to go out do you want-- we distract crownsguard can i assist i was about to-- yeah i know yeah all right how's your evening going gentlemen want a free tarot reading i'm on a five-minute break for the entertainment i sent the cat so the cat should be-- that many stories there you are dear i'm running with them to see what happened there you are dear good god there were those hooligans that were roughing us up earlier are you all right i knew you were going to be okay anyway do you mind helping i know fucking-- nope four hey i'm only a little drunk that's fair yeah that's fair you're a gofficer and a nentleman thank you very much you had time to think about that wait yeah we can disguise you well no the charm won't work i was thinking about pushing straight through the front door again i've got a coat and a mask masked mm-hmm that's nice it's in your short rest button short rest is down at the bottom is this a thing that really happened slightly ahead of the house so i can see if people are going to be approaching the house i put my jacket down and set up a little busking a mild busk oh no i'm on break one on the house i'm going to very slowly put my stuff together and fold it all up move around yeah but as long as i have an eye on the main thoroughfare nope seven seven you know what kind of fold she uses in her undersheet it's like that as i'm walking away from the house i start singing loudly drunkenly (singing) i saw the moon in old in the darkness i'm going to sing loudly as i'm slowly drunkenly making my way hold person yeah we're going to start flanking to the back natural 20 i'm going to take cover we've got to get out of here we've got to get out of here 14 this was something entirely different what happened no you would be doing better if you edubated every night that was a clusterfuck that was amazing you're all terrible people i cannot wait for this shit i am in this shit
