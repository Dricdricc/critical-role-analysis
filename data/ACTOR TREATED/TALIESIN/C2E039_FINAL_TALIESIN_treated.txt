you obviously can't read while i'm painting your face say it with me you did this to yourself he's a snake person deep in the single digits over here this is a cleric thing the wind-up these are indiana jones and the temple of doom villains it means they hurt a lot of things it means that they could actually do damage to us possibly they could be glass cannons we're probably about to find out no i was following your lead are you in the single digits or double prone still means you're disadvantage-- no they have advantage i'm going to shake it off a little bit i'm going to-- yeah i'll stand up i'm going to back into the corner i'm going to use my bonus action to just-- no i'm not going to bother with that for now it's not really going to-- if you go down you go down at this point no healing i'm going to do is going to keep you from going down if you get hit by a triple i can just get you back up (conflicted stuttering) i'm going to do a-- where'd it go these are cantrips healing word on beau i mean eight points of healing i'm going to hold the channel divinity path to the grave spell for yasha mm-hmm right as yasha starts to move i'm going to you don't know it's going to make yasha boss i'm going to cast channel divinity on the angry snake in armor yes you'll find out hot i needed that today thank you that's also a ramp isn't that harder terrain to get up there denied it uses a reaction for that that's bullshit yeah i'm very curious to see how this is going to go i just want to look her over what is this room what is happening what was going on 20 21 priestess of zehir what was this place before you found it do you know its name or are you afraid of it as i'm large goofy grin i'm going to start touching one of the other priestesses and i'm going to start the process don't mind that cure wounds i don't know can i or is it too-- fair all right i was wondering if i was pushing this too far yeah oh man dexterity check oh no eight i obviously do cast the spell don't i can i start that's cheating doesn't seem very helpful i'm going to start poking around some of this is this attached to the walls i'm going to talk to the moss i'm going to ask the moss to make sure you have a very comfy sleep do what they can you guys take care of that one no beau is definitely not feeling okay is there sign of blood in or around the fountain or in any of the grooves i'm seeing if the blood makes it all the way down here that's 21 anywhere where there's moss am i finding these matching holes ugh ten i'm thinking about plugging these holes don't do that how many points down are you right now we can both use-- wait what can you turn into stone that's not a bad idea we could do that with-- we have-- it's a little morose but we've got some dead people let's definitely check those bodies you can take it (whispering) seven days i would love to take a last look at the snake iconography and the bits that have been added to see how well-- i don't want to fudge them or anything but where's there a keyhole are these things attached to the wall what's the deal oh man it would be eight i'm worried about what that might do i don't know this is obviously an older temple than they're giving it credit for which means there's probably things here that are older than snakes yeah i don't know i've never tried no it's perfectly fine to stack graves it's actually very efficient it's a great way of using if you have a limited amount of space over time you eventually end up doing that that's common practice yeah apparently they do that can we understand any of these glyphs is there anything that-- i don't think we want the water to go into the ground i already tried and it didn't happen or it's just mean i just suck as a healer did you take it with food or did you just put it in your system that's a very nice paintbrush it doesn't look weird it's just algae right does this seem like the stuff that's in these people i've seen several heads come off and i've got samples of it available to me including the crazy dude the one that was super-- and this is not that so we're looking for a keyhole let's assume that bad things are going to come out of these holes at some point i have thoughts i don't know i mean if i were going to make snake people i'd put them in a room with snakes and i'd have a way of calling the snakes when it's time to start changing those people into snakes maybe the blood sacrifice is what lets them know it's dinner time yeah but i think they're going to-- yeah you got it i think we've got to move this fountain what do i know about this god about this snake god let's let that inform us as we figure out which of these socket the gems go into do we want to do all three at the same time oh well that's fair can we throw a little light down there to see if anything tries to bite at it it's locked and we have the key i'm making an athletics check ten i'm going to let the trees know that we're here i'm going to let the trees-- i'm not going to touch the tree but i'm going to walk up i don't know the last time you had people in here but we're going to try and pass through if you want we'll take some fruit if you want the fruit to leave the chamber if not we'll try and do our best to leave it be we respect your space here cool does this look or smell like anything those people eat i don't see how those things are non-interchangeable it's like i got a lemon tree yeah fjord how are you all drinking what is it that you live off of how is this possible in here i'm going to quickly out of fear cast eyes of the grave one more time yeah all right these are carnivorous are the trees the same color as the blood of these creatures upstairs is it a similar-- i think they've been feeding these things is there any signs of animal life in here is it any more complex of an ecosystem i feel like i'm missing something i think it's for fruit collecting i think maybe you should draw what you see yeah that's an interesting question why don't you have the owl see it and maybe you could see through the owl or you could just eat that i am going to sit on unbelievably high alert and this place is giving me the heebie jeebies i'm making my own light source on the staff now the old serpent i imagine they are speaking of the previous owner of this temple probably beneath us we are the warden right now we've got two wardens this is what i'm estimating-- i'm going to take a look-- you're making a terrible mistake stop please is it wet in here or is it dry in here would you say out of curiosity-- can i use create or destroy water to try and dehydrate these vines really badly -- certainly try okay can't pull it from a creature i would know that okay i'm going to try and-- god the only thing i can think to do at the moment is just do a sacred flame to try and get it to let go while i make my way to higher ground because maybe we need to give it blood i don't know 11 bad-esque hulk smash i can sometimes influence plants i'm going to try and get them to stop i'm going to try to tell the trees to stop we're not here for you let go and stop this or i can't be held responsible for what happens to this place do not join the cycle of life and death here do i get advantage an intimidation check all right no wow that's a terrible roll-- and a terrible roll seven no no eight that's okay i'm going to use my bonus to cast spare the dying anyway on nott you're stabilized darn it last turn just need to get nott to higher ground to higher ground would be nice anywhere where we can see clearly i just-- do we know where we're going yet are we still being attacked by these things (sarcastically) happily sam and 20 are we taking ten minutes or are we just moving on now well all right then i'm going to just pull a little energy out of the crystal and i'm going to tap nott on the forehead and cast cure wounds at level three you have 30 hit points that's good to know too i'm going to inspect these two plants if there's anything that would have been difficult to get to past these two plants i feel like maybe those are the-- they might be -- i'm going to cast some-- i'm going to use my light maybe to give everybody a little view knee bone connected to the-- posthaste possibly north the warden garden south i'll take a look can i -- i'm going to keep some distance to see if anything snaps at me i've gotten a little jumpy not very good 15 can i get a sense of the sort of animal that would've laid-- yeah this is the south-- fountain feeds the-- also can i figure out being in here do we have any idea how those portholes those four portholes up above would feed into this room how healthy does that egg look they're lizard eggs aren't they mm-hmm how healthy-- oh yeah yeah there's some reptile-- large reptile eggs in the-- it appears to be a hatchery of some kind yeah i'll take a look to see if-- god these are terrible 14 it could be where once the eggs hatch they come up or this is how they get the eggs down this is a nesting area all right what's the west side really quickly oh that's better 19 no but i think it keeps going down i think they just never quite sealed it up they're not expecting problems and they don't seem that bright i guess we'll take a quick look at north just to finish things off 22 is it possible to tell if these eggs might hatch anytime soon or are they that's left of them all right let's do that my nature is terrible which is ironic but i rolled a natural 20 so that should do is this true both look similar both seem-- there's probably no direct danger leaving these things untouched for now i think we've found a way down there at the very least how big is the entrance into that little unfinished-- does it seem like it's separating from the rock even a little if i take a look at it from the side aw man low intelligence that's a 13 throw some light in there i'm going to keep trying see if there's anything that connects to anything i'll grab a couple of the fruit that were on the ground and put them in my pocket put the high people in the middle maybe i'll be in front of you just so we have a cleric on either end five oh thank god got a brand new map got a brand new map she doesn't see the other side of it i can do one who's going to take it poison resistance all right i'm going to cast protection from poison on beau level two you have advantage on saving throws against being poisoned and you have resistance to poison damage that hurts i apologize for this i don't think it needs to see i'm not even sure if it really-- do i know how snakes-- it probably can see in the dark i think that we need to stay far away from this thing i think we need to get its shield away from it wizard and cleric in the back simultaneous hey 38 is that just straight no yasha got to roll too eight although that will be good because if i go right before yasha that means that i can-- oh that power of mine doesn't work as a big simultaneous smush it's just one attack but i have to choose which attack that it-- yeah i still keep my reaction oh no wow i'm going to give you a quick pop since you could use a little bit of-- you're welcome i can't keep doing that just a quick cure wounds really quickly where are my d8s that's not a d8 ah a d8 that's nine points of damage yeah my bonus actions not a lot i can do with my bonus actions at the moment for my bonus action i'm going to cast a light spell on the other side of the wall really quickly so that we have some light in this yeah just on one of the columns then i'm going to take some cover oh it's an action never mind can't do it okay well i'm going to hide i'm going to pull in the back and hide yeah just around the corner so i can't get hit by a bow i'm going to advise you do the same eventually we've already done some damage he's about to take more damage there's a bubble oh my god isn't it technically a sneak attack at this point i thought you did rage as a bonus action damn it that's so cool i'm going to run out into the room i want to run out can i see both of these creatures how far would i have to go to see both of them shit i'll just see one of them then i'm going to cast bane that's a 16 charisma all right you know what bane does i can tell you you have to roll a d4 for every attack or saving throw you roll a d4 and you subtract that from what you get i don't even think it is concentration is it there's no 'c' on this thing oh there it is never mind i'm an idiot no i'm going to hide back in yeah i was going to say would you have spent that spell would she have been able to spend that spell if she couldn't-- nevertheless she did smart they need the d4 and at disadvantage i've never used bane i should really start using bane bane yeah you doing okay marisha and there's a d4 negative also also the little-- avantika and-- which you are-- fuck you hydra oh that a fucker's oh okay things can still go wrong and the other one that went well jester you first no reactions none of them i mean no because i mean-- (groans) it's good that we burned those two actions for that i feel like that was a good use that would've been-- that was about as disappointing-- sam and if you've ever had fluffernutter that's about the flavor of it yasha are we-- i'm going to yell down to yasha i know what he's vulnerable to i'm going peek out and cast my path to the grave before yasha's turn on the hydra it's now vulnerable to everything the next hit is double damage it's what we did last time next hit is double damage i'm back to hiding just plow so auto-advantage it's okay it's still holding you still have it though she can also back off without repercussions is that a natural 20 against you (counting) oh can i see from my vantage or can i not how are you feeling all right that'll do the problem is the fucker behind you minus technically isn't it flanked right now too no we can-- oh not on that side of things but you see the other side it's wet unless it cracked from throwing it oh yeah i'm getting nervous got to admit i'm getting nervous i'm running out of cool shit to do there we go if it's a natural 20 then the bane doesn't even matter yeah the 20 is the only thing you can roll with a bane that would definitely have no effect matt and we need a fire no i'm going to-- oh no he doesn't have fucking-- i'm going to pop my head up and i think i'm going to back against the wall so that i can actually see what's going on for now because i'm starting to get nervous i'm going to use my bonus action-- yeah fuck man i'm also going to look at that undead motherfucker in the corner and-- pull your weight i hate lazy people you found one of my buttons i'm going to do a bonus action healing word on you it's not a lot eight points of healing then i'm going to use my other-- i can do this twice i'm going to use path to the grave again the hydra has a problem one more time yeah i'm using path to the grave one more time on the hydra once and this is now my second because it resets after a short rest is that including the-- yeah did you also do the thing where the first hit of every-- correct okay we need fire and also attacks i'm curious if i buy his bullshit or not all right thank you ugh ten oh with negative d4 yeah she's hard to hit even with the bane goddamn it goddamn it i'm out of healing we're within talking range you don't have to yell at-- oh thank god you want to go first actually i'll go first i apparently have more 3rd-level spells than i thought so that's exciting i'm going to cast spirit guardians at level three i just tap my staff and a bunch of creepy little glowing fairies start flying around me that's a wisdom 16 save minus d4 just need a two i'm so sorry i wouldn't have dropped the bane then i'm so sorry i didn't see that it was concentration that would have changed my plan-- i'm so sorry that's fine did we figure out what the constitution of this creature was by the way i'm just going to do what i was going to do originally which is i'm going to do a level three guiding bolt that's fine please what's the plus to this where is my spell attack-- fuck 13 fuck man bonus action i'm going to vanish i'm going to move two spaces over to my right no like-- yeah right in front of caleb just to get funky fuck man yasha please yasha might as well get right up in there i suppose fuck i'm an idiot i'm such an idiot i've got to get better at this i know i'm seeing things i should have done no bonus i'm an idiot roll for balls that explains a lot that's nice thank you for not shooting it in the pool because that might have killed you beau would have taken an automatic death saving fail large groups of enemies it's a great idea
