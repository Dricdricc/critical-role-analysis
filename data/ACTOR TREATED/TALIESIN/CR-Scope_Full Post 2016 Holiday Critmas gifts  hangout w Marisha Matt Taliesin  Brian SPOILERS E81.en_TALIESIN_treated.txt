everything away oh that is a lot of sugar this goes in another pile and this goes for the laura pile yeah everyone is walking away i'll keep going hi i'm going to move okay i'm tense about bleeding because i used the x-acto knife the wrong way that is true not as often as i should because i don't mind it fading that way also you can get new colors so maybe every few months and then sometimes i'll just stop i haven't stopped in a while but i'll probably-- i'll stop and then i'll do it again it's always doing weird stuff if you want to have this kind of color and not dye it all the time they actually now make conditioners that have premixed hair dye in them and it will stay forever it's nuts you can do that oh yeah erin branch this comes from is this australia again yeah holy cow yeah another one from australia wow oh my god i get a feeling that this was a christmas themed-- there's more strange candy oh dear this is for you guys actually you have a box you have a very personal box and a card and i have something in this stocking wow no we have enough of that in real life i make that roll often enough as it is this is my escapism this is not skyrim there's probably

oh matt and wow never enough is there oh i love page poetry a page of poetry very nice this is a form that i am a fan of i only saw the hour hand it's ridiculous that's just ridiculous okay i'll make sure liam gets his package it's genius considering the weird stuff that comes from the mail this was very smart everything is in a plastic-sealed envelope really clever because things happen in our mailbox things that should not i'll make a liam pile it's actually not the biggest bath on earth but it's comfortable i don't have a hot tub yet i keep meaning to do that it's just such an event someday in the near future everyone will be able to do this no matter where you work this is definitely a privilege of the job it's a big privilege of the job there have been some tectonic shifts we've discovered a lost temple of crit role mail i don't know i just handed it to you i didn't really think things through boy did i not think things through how does this box work i don't understand like fucking magnets ah that never ends well where does this come from another one from australia there's a lot from australia what you're going to die you're going to die no finish that and then

it's the lyrics to the song the parting glass i am a bit of a singer when i get drunk this is the inevitable irish wake song i used to actually sing it with my historical recreationist friends every memorial day and it's a very tearful song i can see how nearly dying would inspire this thank you so much at some point i'll probably end up singing this on geek & sundry when we have a really bad day probably a little liquored up thank you so much this is fantastic i'll try to not cut myself from where ma is maine not massachusetts i always forget which one is which now i have the massachusetts song stuck in my head you're doing great one of us is going to cut themselves eventually i know us in real life oh this is something that i was sent that we have to deal with carry on here have a gift

figure it out what that's crazy oh my god i'm having trouble opening this well i own a lot of art and so the thing we do is we shuffle things out so we actually every six months change out the walls a little bit and move everything around it's what you do when you get to a certain point where you have a lot of art in your life it's time to shuffle every now and then i have one right here also if there's anything to open this with this is too hard to open and i don't quite know what to do i don't know (chuckling) i love shrinky dinks aw man i used to love shrinky dinks when i was a kid don't

than animus oh shit okay yeah that stuff-- there's still some left from that where are you at even i can't ask i don't know how they'd answer oh that's just wonderfully cruel i am down for that every now and then things get a little crazy and not everything ends up on stream not everything is up on stream but we pretend because this is crazy plus some ones that people didn't add i know i'm getting to it after all that we just started looking at that there's still some stuff in the tub that we should look at we love new york we have a lot of friends-- actually the real cassandra de rolo lives in

inevitable pain this is a perfect-- oh very nice oh yeah (singing) who controls the british crown who keeps the metric system down we do (speaking) okay that's enough this will be for my favorite cocktail the pint of whiskey someone asked us what cocktail should i drink while watching critical role and i sent them the recipe for pint of whiskey you take a pint glass you fill it with whiskey and then you tell anyone who tells you that's not a cocktail to shut the fuck up it's the recipe for pint of whiskey (russian accent) the big box (russian accent) the big box we are not sure about-- we just got our first series of what cons do you want to do this year letters and we're all staring at them like deer in the headlights yeah without losing our minds and letting everything suffer letting our health suffer (high stressed-out voice) at this point yeah i think mine's the one with the s on it i don't think that's right that's probably not mine what is up with everyone's handwriting being so nice i feel like such a slacker this is some intense hand-- i can't even get over the handwriting i'm sorry i'm having a moment with this oh my god it looks like a font aw now that's classy yes i know what to do with this it is a monogrammed handkerchief it's got a little stitched de rolo skull this is such a pretty box be right back i'm leaving you yes all right i'm going

do you see what's in its mouth that's not a packing peanut wow wait let's try it here we go what kind of batteries is there a thing maybe it might need to be flipped does the thing need to be pulled or anything yeah it should be-- we'll figure out how to light it up but boy does it light up we are going to need to get some batteries going on over here double a yeah we're going to need to get some batteries in this motherfucker they might be in backwards sometimes people flip the battery oh yeah i know oh well there we go they're just guessing there's not a switch under the back yeah i think we just change out the battery we'll see if that does it oh well here i'll pull my lovely hat off and it kind of fades in the back so it's longer on the front then it is in the back we could beaut you up we could see with a blacklight we could give you blacklight tips when you go out you'll look like there was a crime scene oh yeah we're not done there's still more i think no okay woo thank you guys for sticking around for a long-- yeah what's what oh that's remnants of bad decisions yeah oh my god yeah there's the remote to you well that's a thing that happened that one's already opened as in all of our friends that is a really big wallet for matt i have a funny feeling that's fucking gorgeous from colorado springs i love colorado springs could be that will hit talks this is why i love the

used to do improv together holy cow two more to go this insane-- saving that for last okay is this the one that got left forever oh yeah no one had a car big enough to pick up we'll see if that actually-- i got it i think it may be fine it may have just been glass i would say be careful because there's probably going to be a bag of glass i get that feeling that might be the thing it might have just been a big sound bag going crinkle crinkle it's a painting of a horse head because they figured you didn't have room all right let's-- we can definitely leave this yeah we'll keep cutting i should probably get out of the way here there are layers (surprised laughter) oh yeah the glass did not do well we're going to have to very gently get this out of here the signed edition we didn't think through enough to get one for ourselves yeah that's-- there's a couple of little ones left in there i think but they're mostly letters and we tend not to do-- although there's anything that's package-sized mooglefish marisha and oh no i thought it was a baby bird inside we kind of snuck under we did the old-school hollywood they're killing them by the thousands out there yeah i think-- oh
