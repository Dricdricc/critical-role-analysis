it's the 'build' theme this was a great decision oh no there's not oh my god i got the spaceman which one did you get it's what's-his-name it's liam neeson i'll trade you a cyborg for a spaceman oh my god this is actually-- no that's power rangers that's not voltron man i know yeah i did but i'll show it off again it's a really awesome power rangers shirt with the classic megazord who are you gonna believe guy with the comic book show i may have a small let me find out this feels small i've got a large never mind oh this is really cool look at that you should definitely read that you should definitely definitely read that please read that i'm not even kidding read that you read it like on the break read it good pronunciation i sent the announcement sheet to you well no i remember some of them i do wednesday at noon to two on this very twitch channel is the wednesday club and this week we're gonna be talking about image comics which is now about 25 years old this is the thing and we're gonna talk about how they started and why it's important and then all the cool stuff they're doing today which is some really cool stuff good books hello sea cows the worst of like five worlds oh yeah oh please we're all on board turn trinket into a-- okay okay gotta put the foot down before this gets weird we're not doing hero's brunch i don't know how my guns are going to work underwater at least 30 minutes you'll just get a cramp you have to sleep with a glass of water by the bed we could try to craft some goggles yeah they are for close up but they're not attached to my-- water could get in yes yeah i'll put them in i've got a pocket my big question is what am i going to do with my guns i'm gonna have to look up my first range increment unless we web or turn into dolphins or-- swordfish eels electric eels not that i don't know this isn't going to work but i'm going to try and see if i can get even with like maybe an electric pulse if i can light the powder if the powder's wet the powder's wet once i open that thing-- they're not going to function underwater it's okay no i'd be worried if they did so there's no way to put a bubble around me or anything is there like some sort of bubble or i could even put the tip of the gun out of the bubble and fire but as long-- the combustion has to happen in air how do you even know all this not me just the firearm well if i could have it around just the combustion point and have the barrel sticking out of the point that might be a thing out of what we're not taking apart the bear okay i've got a crazy idea i wanna i wanna build-- i wanna build a watertight vest for the guns basically just a packet that keeps that section dry like a protective-- like a soft bag that is waterproof that would use some sort of stomach lining of some animal or some leather to build it i couldn't reload the gun one shot or would it just be one shot-- yeah 'cause it might-- well like it would-- just around everything but the-- well the barrel would then have to be-- that's-- one shot each i'm going to need some way of defending myself or i'm going to have to take an animal form i may have to have an animal form it's kind of small isn't it a very friendly yellow fish i was thinking maybe some sort of half-octopus merperson they could take down a ship right he's catching on when i'm an animal none of my bonuses-- my bonuses stay so my vestige will actually-- we'll find out i suppose if the vestiges will be functional while i'm in animal form i'm turning into one they're not actually whales they're orca they-- yeah like with cool tattooing look we can have different animals like he can shark and i can whale if we throw a little bit of rope together we can make some quick harnesses including harnesses that include a little bit of a netting for the stones as we get them well those of us who can swim quite quickly will try and evade we'll try and hide and keep looking for them diversion scatter grab and run that's about right pretty good well that's the thing about these sorts of encounters is that any plan you have is pretty much going to be out the window the minute you see it anyway half more a plan than we normally have it's much like those people who give you instructions of how to survive an encounter with a tiger it's that you think about it but you've never actually met anybody who's said yes i've met a tiger that's exactly what i did and i'm fine no anybody who does that's probably been eaten anyway it's a terrible idea you don't try and look bigger you don't do any of that you're gonna get eaten you survive an encounter by a tiger by running really quickly in the other direction or hopefully hacking it to death before it kills you well it was just my suggestion let's see what can we do maybe-- we have one night maybe i could try and craft some sort of concussion explosive it wouldn't probably hurt it but it would at least maybe shock it give it a-- stun it to just blow something up underwater well all right very clever you wanna ride the lightning it's okay it's an animal that already has a black eye to be fair no worse than anything that happens to a killer whale at seaworld at that point yeah i went there i'm so sorry it's been there i'm sorry my personal alignment is already so far down sorry shit got real on critical role yeah oh no i know what-- i know where my money is going at the end of the evening they have a different larynx system (laughs) wet-erase boards (all laugh) make a skin i was gonna say we could make a diving bell but it would be very hard to travel with but we could make a micro diving bell it's basically an upside-down pot that you stick your head in and you take a big breath of air but the problem is moving with it is bad whales or a shark you might want to go shark for one of them especially if it's just handles if it's just like hanging onto a piece of rope a heroes' sundae bar (sings zelda music) that's cocked 11 hit points wisdom saves advantage no fear no poison are they heavy or are they light vox machina solving problems that don't need to be solved i put my ear in the water to see if i can hear him yes best of the best it does hello water-based culture would you happen to have some goggles lying around we could borrow maybe something that's to communicate underwater i don't know i was actually just contemplating that because you know how frustrated you get opening up a crab when you're going to eat it-- i wonder would it be ironic if the kraken gets frustrated trying to peel off the armor it'd just be a wonderful irony i'm so sorry sir no i don't know let's-- just not reflective that's a very fair point he is not wrong and that's not a bad idea fun scary fun technically speaking we can't quite feel fear at the moment can we or is it just a general malaise of fear (all laugh) i have a thing just for you just for you pass that down later i'm collecting some seashells and taking a bit of a walk and eventually we're chilling are we bringing the bear we're bringing the bear all right is it possible to grab a spare set of goggles and choker just in case we'll return them all thank you excellent three i've already got a small bag of them if you want to keep them-- we could trade later also a skipping stone you didn't think of that did you if it's hairy we won't need pass without a trace at all we've got a plan i'm going to be a whale we've got some rope here it's going to be your job once i'm a whale to create at least a couple handholds with a harness you know how to use knots right you can do some basic-- i knew you would keep going the dallas two-step the sweet caroline good for tension i'm also gonna grab-- i should not be allowed to drink this i'm going to take you aside really quickly and give you the extra set of goggles and the bead just in case i'm-- you know how i get with my hunches you'll know if we need them we have them just an extra set i'll take one just in case well that was everything i could've hoped for at first yes sure oh now we're really in trouble i love it the rusty doty's another knot that you know kind of a natural jade how heavy are they they're magnetic i don't but i can fake one pretty quickly if we have to we never needed a compass is it possible-- well we're too deep now but-- you have a compass don't you and i'm going to hand it back to him this is going to be weird i'm going to take out a chunk of whitestone residuum and just compare the color and see if there's any relation look at my sheet that's a natural 20 (all cheer) it actually occurs to me that i might have some magnets on my person can i make an investigation check i had quietly in my head been using them to keep my coat down when i was running around with the spider boots i wouldn't say it if it wasn't true can i make a roll to see if i happen to have some on me yeah they might help with-- i'm going to try and see if i can use them as a very base dowsing rod for these stones okay in my head you have zinc all over your nose there's just zinc yes we're really pale people this is probably a good idea no the navigator yes i feel comfortable we have locate object we have a compass i'm a science man they can't see the map yet aberrations an animal they're not really aberrations that was weirdly helpful that's really genuinely helpful (all laugh) (garbled voice) why are you doing this with your face i'm not entirely sure the creatures down here have eyes i'm going to examine the sand and just gently dig around to see what's around this is fascinating i'm just digging for whatever good to know there's a red filter you do have a red filter if we have to use an opal we can so we can be far away when we activate it let's not cast it near the portal though very good filing it away let's see how we feel everybody knows about the sea bear when it's time anyone ever seen bedknobs and broomsticks okay stealth checks yay i'm so sorry for doing that to you it was really unfair plus ten 33 hut hut they get the job done he kind of looks like kelp -- -- maybe he's blending it's just a face in a giant brown--taliesin  (darth vader-esque breathing effect) marisha marisha let's hunt some scallops that'll do 20 this was for a larger creature like giants did these ruins crumble or did they sink and is the stone-- does the stone feel natural or does it feel like stone that would be underwater does it look like the parts of it that have been underwater are doing well or does it look like it's eroding as something that should've been above the surface and there's no writing visible okay compass i'm with you i'm going to gently pat at the base of the wall not disturbing anything investigation 13 very gently if anything we're sucking at this shh i think we put it in the bag of holding and it won't matter i imagine like neil armstrong let's curl around 33 plus ten we're going around no i perceive nothing one i saw nothing no they don't as far as i know i'll help 13 this philip glass nervous breakdown you're giving us is really-- we think we find him and it's just a rock rock ugh nine shh oh no god damn it yeah you could've used luck 17 not cool yeah he is very pretty coldstone that's a great idea i don't get any-- my cloak doesn't get any bonus against this does it that's better 23 (imitating oprah) you take 18 points of lightning damage it's a really good meatball so that way it'll stay lit over there i'm gonna use my bonus action to cast hex on the kraken i'm gonna hex the kraken no i just want to know where it is there's nothing i can do to it i literally have only one power and that's to electrocute it which does nothing really good they're really good and they're a problem i'm going to dig the lodestone out of the dirt i'm gonna spend my turn keeping an eye on the thing i just hexed so i know where it is and i'm also turning to tary and going (whispers) find the next one we've gotta get out of here yeah once i've got the lodestone i wanna-- well i don't have the bag i'm gonna put it in tary's bag and i'm gonna try and see if i can get some cover as far away from that thing as possible whatever i can do yeah fuck you i'm not happy with any of this how can i you did this to me oh yeah that hits not speaking as percy this is legitimately nightmare fuel right now i'm not sleeping tonight i do i have a-- shh don't tell the internet they'll find-- okay oh no it can regrow tentacles you should see a doctor about that this is monstrous like velcro pants hypnotic pattern like a boy scout bravery wasn't it easier when you just had to rhyme it's nice to see someone else going through this he's not a pirate arr i'm fine three of them oh god i want to die please help there from you yeah that's really confusing on a fundamental level eh get taryon out of the kraken's grasp with grasping vine oh no ooh drop it drop it all over again nope don't say it 21 god damn it that's a 19 yay 23 that'll do okay yeah i'm going to try and-- is acrobatics a way to get out of this i'll take acrobatics (all laugh) all right so here go let's roll well i get advantage on this right okay just thought i'd see if i could sneak that through i rolled a really-- i can't reroll that with resolve can i no 'cause it's not a save 16 do i have anything-- with anything else do i have anything i can do is there a bonus action thing i can do here no i am just-- yeah i think about how easy it would be to reload my gun right now if i had one that's-- yeah blessed you hit a creature from inside of it-- there's literally nowhere your fists could go that wouldn't hit it how do you get un-swallowed we'll resuscitate the kraken if it comes to it if we have to resuscitate a kraken-- taliesin and grappling with many things keep fucking with him thanks chat room i'm sure chat room was you don't need no stinkin' patches take you to a goth club yeah worth it that'll help oh i like that we all keep doing that with the fingers she does she found the next one sure augh oh my god i am not having a happy time 11 points oh i have a saving throw constitution-- i have a concentration-- no we are grog is in the belly of the beast he's happy he's in a better place yep here to help it's like watching creamer in coffee in reverse (sings) god damn it thank you for that it's good nothing bad happened if only we'd brought your robot player's handbook says a lot of things doesn't it do you have creature statistics dm we're gonna get little fey minnows full-contact stats there's shade being thrown in every direction tonight isn't there they sing like disney characters they braid your hair for a bonus action have we finally broken mercer wait i can do this it's a hunter shark but it's fey because it's dyed its hair with a pastel pattern caramel caramel ow yeah no we're in this is how he's been plotting our death you know i'm not having any luck getting out of this thing ah god and i get the distinct impression that the whole point of this creature is there's just no escaping it i'm gonna start trying to cut my way out of this thing i give up i'm cutting my way out no i'm gonna use my longsword attack with disadvantage i can't it's just gonna-- yeah it's just a tentacle with the intent to leave oh that's not bad 23 okay i do not have hex anymore so that's-- 13 and another attack also 23 also 13 and again 28 yes they're both 16s i know it's a metaphor oh 15 drop it drop it drop it i am booking towards the big red-- no the other way i'm booking that way yeah oh and it's not red oh that's so weird i'm heading the opposite direction of that fucking nightmare monstrosity yes i'm gonna get behind that boulder and hide if possible bonus action to hide or no so for my bonus action-- is minor illusion a bonus action or not i can't remember i haven't done it in so long and i'm feeling so useless yeah oh i'm gonna use-- i have a heal i'm gonna heal i'll use my bonus action to heal 1d10 plus 12 where's a d10 that's not bad okay 18 points okay good i get 18 points back yay yeah that hits 26 points of bludgeoning damage yeah that's fine oh god you are annoyingly cheerful there's no room for anything else in there does it ever not hit whoever actually succeeded in changing anything from the inside let's be honest here you become part of it just know somehow that this is a metaphor for what this is bad ew unless you're a cod grease me up for all the good it did me what what what did you just grease did you just grease that with tears clink i'm going to gaze at him as a professional gazer i'm going to gaze at taryon and just allow my head wound to just bleed out i hate you and you throw a knife does it have a limited number of tentacles but if we keep playing it may have eight then seven then six the grog and keyleth show i would watch that you didn't pour it there's options you put that kraken on hot pepper gaming lode liquid hashtag we will save the kraken oh wow a lot happened there yes good jug yeah i love everything that's happening and the kraken you're alive what are the chances it dropped any of us while this happened nothing kinda what i was expecting to be magnificently frank oh god god damn it from the tentacles three 18 and she's out just barely god damn it we've got all three yes bite the tentacles aren't you unconscious fuck man (groans of pain) okay okay i'm going to-- hm i know she's making us feel really guilty right now i'm going to hack away at this thing right now so i'm going to try and hack away at this tentacle to get out disadvantage correct god i'm really not enjoying this that's a 17 19 i know that natural 20 is just going to waste 13 and i'll take another one that's not going to roll well here we go my third hit is 16 so i'm going to burn my action surge and i'm going to take the alter self that coin you gave me is-- what does it give me just full movement yeah so i burn my action surge for that i'm going to go find my healing potions to find out what i have but i'm going to do that-- yep moving right along yeah fuck we really need to leave badly no does the shark at disadvantage 15 15 4d4 yeah we're running

got-- other than-- yeah i got nothing other than trying to distract it yeah i pull back through the portal obviously but is tary-- tary's still held on (groans) good good i approve of this they do but-- and trinket runs well and she's unconscious how many tentacles does the kraken have now only one-- i mean it's not like you're saving them by not hitting them at this point yeah no matter what you do kraken ain't dying kraken got ten thousand hit points he's not even vaguely dying thank god yeah but we are out of options i am totally okay with a hail mary want some d6s or are you okay if you do enough damage to it it may vomit them out do you have-- yeah and the tentacles don't get a prismatic spray of their own oh man a patch addams it's just jerky you've sewn into you (groans) nope straight yeah yeah no it fires electricity i'm going to hold my action for-- -- for the vague hope of something useful to attack-- i've already burned it and it laughed it off just to attack the kraken-- if it gets close enough just sword just-- oh god you'll decrease the resale value of these books with how much you've been cracking the spines tonight i'm just saying got to get a healing potion in that guy stat get it get it in him ah fuck but if you can heal him for a point-- in any way possible-- okay this is not good people i am very far away right now i'm gonna get you a new d20
