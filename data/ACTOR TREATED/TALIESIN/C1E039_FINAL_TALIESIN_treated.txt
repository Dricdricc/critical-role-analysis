you the world this could go worse oh shit okay these creatures have no eyes i'm made of smoke (sighs) okay as long as we're all clear here what's going on that's fine and i can just dash well and can i still move around and do things while i'm trying to revert or is it-- reverting am i just stuck reverting can i just make the decision i'm going to have my concentration on reverting but in the meantime i'm going to-- i have to use my action (sputtering) can i dash into one of the creatures it wouldn't know that i was there it wouldn't-- okay well i had the thought of maybe i could attempt to get them to attack each other i'm attempting to tap them to get them to think that there's something happening where the worms are to get them to attack really natural 20 motherfucker (screams)

buy you good ice cream i'm going to go to scoops three motherfucker (laughter) i will use an action surge and start turning back into a normal human then oh i'm going to move behind it then that way no i mean far away from it and then i'm going to use an action surge and start meditating on it that's what it feels like motherfucker yeah that ended it trinket's there too (laughs) can't win i'll say it if it makes you feel better as you should be you're defying god casting time no taliesin and consult the book i read the card too i didn't see it all the damage shake it shake it shake it you've had a lot of time to think i want to hold my turn until the other worm returns not going to move anywhere just going to stay right there i held my action until the other worm returns there's a rock slide to its right damn it sorry sorry we live in a cold cold world no one deserves anything you touch me when you're trying to touch the worm i don't know how-- damn i'm going to shoot the purple thing with a violent shot i'm going to drop all three points into violent shot if i roll a six a six or lower it-- oh never mind then oh shit then never mind then i'm just going to take two points of violent shot so that's-- yeah yep seven i rolled a seven wait i get to reroll something don't i where is it where is it aw do i get a reroll yeah one save reroll per--- okay i'm going to pull out my new gun and take two shots god damn it (sighs) that hits that's a 21 i'm just going to roll the other one too and that's a 30 that hits so that's plus 12 eight 15 25 that's 27 points of damage bad news is down i toss it to the ground i pull out the new one i take my shot just to get its attention to get one in the mouth your balls of fire wand i'm going to take another shot at the big icy worm i'm just going to take two normal everyday shots because things have been weird it's got to be close to death now that's 17 and 24 yes well that's my third-- third attack is to reload i keep track i'm good 21 points of damage oh yeah i'm staying where i am go grab the gold let's get the body and we'll get out of here we have to search the body as well i'm going to check the frozen body is that the dead man is it possible to move the frozen man or is he just really stuck in there keyleth can i borrow you over here can you warm him up and see if we can get him out of here we know what happened to him now though run i say we grab the tea set and the skull and take them to lady-- no actually maybe we should have it identified first i think that would be wise certainly can't have anyone else moving in here we should find out what that skull does i can't look at him i would agree i don't think it's necessary for us to claim ownership for it we just need to have it cordoned off and make sure no one else other than us can come in let's bundle it up in the tapestry well let's take it to somebody who-- i think we should take the skull and show it to someone who might know what it is yes grog we can hear you and while you're there spend some money at gilmore's glorious goods gilmore's where all of your magical items can be procured with a smile a week i'm exhausted don't forget grog it's the reverse whisper they're not talking there's just tongues in ears okay we're running out of the house we're running out of the house i'm following him out of the house so it's going to go poltergeist on us isn't it because you're really bad at it and it's hilarious no it didn't i'm going to pull out my sword and pick it up by the eye socket i'm going to carry it on a stick it's going to look weird with a cloth over it but please go ahead we do actually have a way of magically transporting to whitestone as long as they're on you as long as you're holding them we'll keep it locked in my workshop for now we can make it a night and we will make sure that they know we have to deal with the house i'll actually-- i've got a great idea i'll take the skull to whitestone and i'll see you in the morning i was just thinking it'll be a way of getting the skull out of the house tonight that's a very fair point we're not leaving-- i don't think that's a good idea i think we'll get answers from allura that's fair let's let uriel know what's happened i've got to get home and work on a few things anyway i've got a broken gun yes i think that would be best we'll count it back when we're-- that's never stopped you before like a mother i was just thinking that it's a redefinition yes i'm going to try and do a quick repair to my gun also yes well-- yes but i think i'm more useful as myself rather than anybody else i think on a certain level you're possibly making this more complicated than it needs to be you forget you have clout part of the point of clout is that you spend it you spend your clout i know you're not used to actually having the means by which to just simply get what you want by asking for it but you could just ask for it that's the most privileged thing i've ever said that you've heard (laughter) well a little subterfuge let me-- let me attempt to see if i can defuse this relatively easily i will need some gold no but that's a very good point so later i will be asking for some gold to help me fix my new gun all right okay we may have to have a discussion at the very least i'm going to need 20 gold at the very least 20 gold at the very least oh i do just not for your daughter that will do i will take you to white castle though i do i wish to speak to the warden well he will agree to be indisposed in conversation with me i'm percival fredrickstein von musel klossowski de rolo iii and i'm here on the business of whitestone 19 shush who is this person what do you do sir what do you do sir excellent he's a performer you may leave we have no need of you guard escort the commoner out of the room now that that's been taken care of who is an authority that i may speak to cyrus hume i'm percival fredrickstein von musel klossowski de rolo iii of whitestone it will i am of course the newly appointed ambassador from whitestone and i have been brought down here because apparently you are holding one of my performers a performer who is meant to be heading towards whitestone in the next three weeks to perform for my sister oh small plain female (dismissive sigh) yes he is he is one of the official performers-- they're supposed to be performing at the new coronation of a brand new temple in whitestone much has been arranged much has been paid for and i don't want to explain any of this to the royal court casting-- no not yet 13 if you were to be agreeable to helping us move this along i would remember the favor whitestone would remember the favor damages shush performer well sir i appreciate your candor i appreciate the cut of your jib and i appreciate that you are a man of honor and of your station it is very very rare to find someone who respects such things obviously the damages must be paid-- who are they do we know what happened i don't care who started or finished it obviously we will pay for the damages out of your troupe's pocket quite we will write a check for our friend's pocket but for the damages i feel that some responsibility must be taken he has a very fair point what good is subterfuge when there's such an opportunity to create a ballad some sort of ballad about a cautionary tale you chose so poorly you chose so poorly it is truly impressive how poorly you chose you may come pick up your gold from castle greyskull in the morning it will be waiting for you of course sir in the meantime here is 20 gold for your trouble on top of the gold you will be expecting for all fines imposed (high-pitched) one all right bring it bring it yes i take it (overly dramatic) oh where are you going with this it would make me feel better if he was thrown in prison great everything's fine (laughter) won't it be unfortunate when you find out i have diplomatic immunity i blame you for this all right how much to get both of them out yeah i'll bring it 23 now for the love of god just wait until nightfall and dimension door out of there you're welcome wait until nightfall i assumed you wouldn't we're already walking back the troupe may want to get out of town for a bit as well i check to make sure the skull is still there please tell me they stole the giant painting damn it no they could have rolled it up and stuck it where the sun don't shine some caverns run deep i'm going to spend some time working on the special barrel and see if i can get that up and running 18 all right it's locked nothing good ever happens to you in my workshop it's just not a good place for you too many things we're going to have to collect him before we go i'm going to shoot off a limb like batman i suppose we'll have to put it off for a day then i think so it's locked very far away right now in a very secure room well do you think it would be safer somewhere do you think there's something you could conjure perhaps around it or should we move it to another room we could always send it straight away to whitestone but we'd have to let someone take it to whitestone it could be there today or we could keep it in my room or we could move it perhaps into the temple of sarenrae oh but you can run it over and run back wow oh my god and somehow the coffee has not been poured on your head that's the greatest magic trick i've seen all night how are you still dry it's witchcraft why don't we just let it be in the room for now-- let's let it be in the room for now nothing happened last night i'm going down i have to go get my things anyway so i'm going to go down everything seems fine doesn't it the door is steel reinforced lined and bolted to the wall it's not going anywhere this room is designed to explode it's hidden in the room i go into the room i shut the door behind me i check my hiding place and it's untouched and perfectly reasonable i return it to my hiding place which if i have to reveal it later i will happily tell you where it's hidden shut and lock the door behind me everything's fine let's find your brother if anything strange happens make note of it well he can't he doesn't have the key anyway i throw ten gold at him right now just in lieu of-- i throw ten gold it's the very least let's go find your brother 18 (puffs air) sorry for the love of god and all that is holy nine 14 with resolve i'm going to look for gilmore what i don't know nine i'm going to hold my attack for if the dragon comes towards us and i'm going to run into the-- okay is he taking to the air i'm going to try as i'm running-- do i have enough time to try and take a shot am i going to be able to keep up with he group never mind damn it never mind it was a thing wasn't it someone won tonight that's so nice
