actually this one it's going to be matt key is taking the reins on this one so i don't even-- i'm not sure he's settled on what's going on but i think we were talking about maybe brian k vaughan and looking at his whole body of work which would be a lot of fun tv writer and comic book writer could be cool that could go a number of ways sorry it was a face card oh oh you're the dm now lord of the quadroads now (laughs) you want to pull another one oh there's no other-- no the wish card goes good roll laura lord of the quadroads now owes you a favor huzzah we're doomed yay there's nothing we can do anything to get you out of the wine cellar is such a good idea you're not getting a tax break i did i also sent you on a tour of the frescoes it was quite nice it had been years since i'd done it without being on fire running around yes check one carry on carry on you're not allowed in that room (laughs) it was amazing-- i wasn't there but it was amazing you only have what i told you later it's pretty much-- i had things to do i wasn't entirely clear about what you were planning to do my god no it's great you didn't die you weren't kidnapped your soul wasn't taken you weren't-- yes you watched the-- for god's sakes yes a lot could've happened they have these little vignettes on occasion that they use to sort of-- it's like a nice little trap they just like to grab people and use them for various things no one really knows because no one ever comes back they're sort of the shadow court i suppose they would be the-- for everything that you saw in the feywild they are the thing that the feywild is a little sketchy about and a little worried about i respect that (laughter) i don't know what that means i have a book about that (laughter) i had the least vacation-y of anybody's vacation 'cause i have technically been on vacation for many many years i finally took the mantle of responsibility for not necessarily-- i'm not ruling whitestone that's not how it works but i did take on a lot of the civic responsibility yes i hired someone to help run the-- my workshop and then we drink so with the help i had time to start working on a few projects i finally made a new pair of glasses well i tried to make a new pair of glasses and then i rolled again and tried to make a new pair of glasses and then i realized it's very very hard to make a pair of glasses when you can't see what you're doing because you don't have a pair of glasses so then i actually called tary and said please fix these for me he made very very nice glasses i think they have your name inscribed on them they're really gaudy white gold white gold please (laughter) yeah the riflemen of whitestone (whispers) musketeers (laughter) no i get vetoed a lot these days (laughter) it's not completed yet we're also trying to create some series of illuminations at least within the main castle in case the thing in the basement that we're still working on ever turns on us and suddenly we are un-magiced which is a constant fear i've upgraded with taryon's help we've upgraded several of my inventions i've had a proper sword of my family crest made i finally got the glove more-or-less working more working honestly but i'll get into that later i've been desperately trying to get you to stop going out into the woods to stop searching for that bloody thing that covers quite a bit of it at this point time and things in the woods on occasion we go hunting and i've also been training men how to use their guns so there's been a bit of that technically an honorary member of the grey hunt i'd say bless you you're gonna pay for that oh my god i can feel the radiation well-machined it can you are technically a civil servant as well so you're making money there wow that's a lot of cards he's now going to become whitestone's fedex though well we were leaving from whitestone right that's right as you were saying it is based on that festival and of course whitestone has its own paganistic rituals dating back many many years yes you have now i've so many text files to send you my word so usually at this time the winter solstice especially when we have a new master or mistress of the grey hunt there's usually a celebration or a ball and they're not every single winter's festival but it does happen but since this was the first we decided to have a fancy party she was bestowed with her crest and otherwise and we all dressed up you don't get a crown you get a cloak-y thing with a medallion piece you don't really have to wear it it's just something you get to own but i also had a piece of jewelry commissioned for everybody this one specifically because i had to go find our friend in the fire plane i have this design and this requires some gemstones and i have a limited amount of dragon scales from five dead dragons and i was curious if you could make a hero's crest that is built around these five dragon scales so that everyone who helped to slay these dragons will always have a token that proves that they were there and they were one of them and then i also need one made without the dragon scales as well he'll call thank you goodbye they're beautiful and at the ball i present all of these to you and each is just a bit individual and they are crested in the gems and in the dragon scales to give this color wheel of the red the white the blue the green and there's one that doesn't have the dragon scales but it's just got this flourish around it and we give it to taryon because these are meant to be built upon as we will build upon ours your accomplishments will be built upon yours as well anywhere you like all right or you could use it as your piece clasp you could put it on your-- you could put it anywhere you could put it on your gauntlet they're just something so that in the worst-case scenario anyone will always know who we are and we will know each other it can't be replicated there's no one else who's made anything like this there's not enough material to make anything like this and we've got to figure out how to start putting your accomplishments on yours soon you have several already you defeated a leviathan think of it much like your book profiterolos so we just have a wonderful evening where we eat too much we drink too much we dance and we all look fabulous yes i'd like to sail i need a vacation teach us some sailing songs it will be fun god damn it i don't think i've ever done this before i'm not entirely sure oh my god you've done this before haven't you we've never needed you more (laughter) i don't know what that is the blood is blue (laughter) no-no-no-no-no-no-no this is a group vacation this is what this is now the one that got away rotary club i think we wish to stay i think-- that's very fair wow natural number (gasps) no no no you are a sadistic bastard that is the darkest thing i've ever seen that is amazing next vacation i'll go diving for pearls oh yes 21 21 21 i think i know how to pierce them lovely it's the sea hairs that squirt the ink you could walk away right now he'll never know does everybody speak common i was just curious if he was walking up to people and they were staring going oh no and walking on you'd better have been able to actually convince them oh god oh god no yes okay my stuff and vex's stuff here take a look guns swords boots oh no that's a good question vex i don't-- i grab the door and shut it it was either grog or your brother those are really the only two people who could be possibly responsible-- i'm not missing this i am following oh god she's going to kill you the stuff in the closet is probably-- i'm going to go find vax i have just turned the corner towards vax's room i'm probably just now in eyesight can i hear this why don't you come with me and i'm going to go show you while they talk kiki we've always been friends i want you to know this is nothing personal but this is-- and i open the door and show you and then i shove you in and shut the door for a moment this is so great i vaguely wonder what you actually had planned for this this is bedlam at this point he wouldn't have seen you get shoved in but he would have seen me in the hallway at this point if he passed her you're going to have to help us clean at least our personal belongings oh i know i know you had nothing to do with this he's useless you're not so i'm going to make you help on his behalf worse than hell legitimately worse than hell this is making me miss hell i would like you to meditate upon who is responsible for this this is your boy i'm taking no responsibility for this one some wild dogs attacked our room i'll speak to the manager we have no idea we came back and they were in our room pissing on our stuff this is not deception actually do i know whose they are i don't know where they came from i'll do deception persuasion well deception's higher but i'll try persuasion (laughter) no god damn it i'm honoring myself it doesn't matter anyway that's 27 i mean it was upsetting your property our property this is our problem all of us has this happened before i've never seen them before either i've never seen anything like it how good a job did you do on our stuff i know it's hardly your fault this is ridiculous we have a lot of foreign guests as well in our establishment back home so i know how things can sometimes get a bit crazy and i certainly don't want to put any undue pressure on you excellent do they actually have little cucumbers drawn on them i see doty appear correct doty they're going to take our things i know why you're here are our things even in our room anymore tary call him off call him off call him off no we're getting another room i know i know you have to fiddle your dangle i'm well aware we're going to sleep we do not tell them what our new room number is that reminded me of the old home games quite a bit that was like watching an eight-year-old juggle a gun (laughter) oh wow i don't know what they're looking at i'm walking from the cemetery however far that is that's never going to get old yeah i'm excited yeah happy new year everybody while we're whispering about things-- that was amazing pike if you need anything just let me know and i completely understand the awkward position you're currently being put in keep an eye on the odd one jb she reminds me of me at that age that's not a good thing see if you notice an interest if you notice an interest in that one please let me know maybe i could figure out what she's interested in and show her around maybe the guards have generally been alerted to be wary kind polite and less important that they stop them from doing anything too terrible more to the point that they just write it down and report it immediately (laughter) oh we're bringing out the moderate silverware heavy food back to the pool house with you oh you said what they'll figure out that the poor food-- i feel like they're clever enough for that one best to feed them well at least i know continue to be charming yes i'm so excited for the calamity that's about to be brought down upon my house there is nothing short of full dragon apocalypse at this point that could faze us we can live through this we'll be fine to be fair i've also already started drinking i pull out the flask of courage that i've brought oh there's a lot of courage we make it every year it burns a lot you're going to get drunk but you're not going to get sleepy let's do this we thought we would give you the cornucopia of our experience well that's the next 30 minutes technically it's my sister's castle but certainly that's code yes yes fine the trickfoot clan absolutely the v on this shirt that looks to be a tome of some sort it appears to be some sort of very naturalistic bow and arrow scanlan i imagine the a appears to be a bird's mask and a pistol also scanlan the c is some sort of natural wooden crest of some kind in fact this is entirely grog and scanlan which i think it's about time the john doe of demons really i'm going to sneak next to jb really quickly if you want a more proper and private tour of the city consider the offer open just think about where you'd want to start the offer does stand though have a good evening i don't think he's figured out what she's talking about oh i'm sorry i thought that maybe you'd want to see the-- and the-- oh very well then in the tour oh yeah i mean no yes no (laughter) how did she do that cheap shot at best a dream what dream i see your reasoning it actually makes perfect sense to me i'm going to say you're in a room of people who were raised by-- at least 60 percent of the time ridiculous people who have their head screwed on straight i don't necessarily know if-- do you want to bamf or do you just want to talk we can probably just talk to him or maybe we could have him sent for yeah i'm a little worried about leaving them here unattended or at least a tom waits one grog you'll take the loud ones tomorrow and i'll take the quiet ones do you want to get them all because you asked so nicely also i was thinking the carpet might be a fine way of moving them around the city i will definitely agree that there are sections of this city i would absolutely agree that you are the master of at this point (sighs) it's going to be a lot of brothels and bars i am so excited for this we'll do the tour first while you guys are off freaking out with the-- yeah
