oh man i'm so sorry that's not true is it why would they do that darkest timeline critical role critical role darkest timeline this is a little love to youtube now you've got four days to figure your stuff out i may have picked from the remains carrion-like as well big nope a tab with a conversation of possible rooms for rent later nein nein will do n-i-e-n nein is he in fact trim just checking if it was an ironic nickname or not i am watching this from the table this is the show is it a clean shuffle nope i don't see shit can i try to perceive this too 18 that doesn't seem very nice follow them outside and rob them sorry we did get rooms claudia sheed claudia sheed (yelling) claudia sheed brilliant thank you i normally find shouting people's names really loudly tends to bring them to your table we could look have we had food and drink yet i'm interested either way so i'm going to stand up and start heading upstairs come unpleasant one let's go i'm going to look for what looks like an office for whatever door seems most inconvenient the one on the landing it is taliesin and friends from out of town bryce sent us from alfield we have come from very far to take a look-- converse well to wrap it up a bit we've just recently got into town we're looking for employment odd jobs we were recommended to you to be the person to talk to about what actually is going on in this city we're new to this city we don't necessarily have our thumb on the pulse of what's going on we just figured we would make sure that you were aware we were here we don't want to ruffle any feathers and we don't necessarily know who are the right people the wrong people to work for that's very fair sounds easy except it's really not grace of the platinum dragon speaking of tourist looks how much of a problem would this be in general excellent is there a shrine to the dragon as well ixnay on the angers-stray eh we're also always big fans of underbellies especially if there's an underbelly with a heart of gold are there names that if we hear we should trust (whispering) caleb that's all right we just need your cat i'm tossing frumpkin in the direction of that in the basement i need to know what your cat's seeing what's the cat seeing oh for fuck's sake they're making asses of themselves aren't they you gave us the basics though we were listening to the description of this insanity except that they told them their real names and where they're staying groups of people are always idiots never trust a group of people i specifically used to gather people into groups to make them into idiots it's just what you do you don't-- that is exactly what i did it's how i met you it's why i keep you around yes but we weren't a group of people we all hated each other you just told them your real name i've literally only met one other person named beau it was a different beau i'm eventually falling asleep but before that i'm going to go take a fucking bath there is a bathhouse i'm going there anyone who wants to come with me is welcome to do so it's just a walk is it going to be open at night i'm going to go and try and find out i'm going to and try and find out i'm just happy with my company three 15 that's not on the way then you know nott i notice i notice the way that you eye things on occasion not right now and that's fine and i would hate to get in the way of any of your business your business is your business and i'm perfectly fine with that but it's good to remember that there are people who need what they have there are people who need every bit of what they have and there are people who would be much happier if they had a little less well that's a skill worth developing that's a skill very much worth developing if they seem grumpy or angry and seem overly concerned with an enormous amount of money that they happen to have or using it to just be mean or cruel to somebody that's probably a sign that they'd just be much happier if they just knew exactly who liked them and the only way you could ever really know if someone likes you is if you don't have anything over them and the easiest way to get to that honesty is if you don't have anything oh yes unless they're grumpy because they don't have enough because if you're hungry you get very angry you get so angry when you're hungry beau has way too much so you should probably take some stuff from beau that's fair (laughter) beau really needs to know who likes her i'm so excited about a long rest you're going to get us killed you're making tijuana bibles you're making tijuana bibles for your religion is there going to be nudity and sex in these because then it's basically a tijuana bible don't google tijuana bible oh i did it before you woke up sure happily that would be no problem blacksmith's is filthy we'll go there first you're welcome to take a look at the job postings if you don't want to take a bath but i'd highly recommend a bath baths are great yes very fancy that entirely depends what you think it's worth wow i'm so excited it's not the first time i've been called-- actually no it's not the first time i've been called that that's fair it's not molly this is me but not our gold sam and thank you why would you want to be famous no i have no interest in becoming it thank you very much i have most everything i need already why would i need more stuff no i prefer to keep it on the down-low personally i'm going to look right back at him do i have something in my teeth i'm here for making money this is what happens after you go to meetings is suddenly you want to be about something be careful i'm well aware this is entirely for the sake of my mirror i'm very well aware i propose a plan i have a plan for this i have a plan we're going to take our scrap and we're going to sell it so that we have some money we're going to take the good feelings from that money and we're going to spend it on hot water and inappropriate friendly nudity and we're going to have a discussion about what we're doing with heat steam water and a little bit of cash i just find it's easier to have this conversation when everyone is sitting around naked in hot water i take five steps and then i go i don't know where the blacksmith is well if we got there then yeah probably works for me why is it called lodge of the eclipse is there is a taxidermist is what i think she's asking is the board between here and there the job board we can do a couple to the archive couple to the king's hall just pick it up higher than ten i feel good about everything that just happened or the platinum house we've got mr memory board here to scan the thing works for me i believe in you stitches get-- eh snitches get stitches stitches are just-- sam and snitches get stitches-- wait-- one of the few it's time for a bath this is a dark mirror man a dark dark mirror i've learned one thing in my travels always hit the bathhouse first every major town oh happily early 90s river phoenix hair going everywhere of its own volition i walk out of the changing room and walk by don't even-- just give a kiss on the head took you bloody long enough to find us i'm for the record tattooed a lot okay i apologize that there's no art yet i'll get around to that there's a snake tattoo that curls all the way up the arm that goes all the way up into the peacock-- people have seen the top of the peacock but the peacock is actually roving into a big floral piece that goes down into a snake that is swallowing the hand there is an eye in a pyramid piece with another eye illuminated above it it seems to almost go into the hairline all the way up the back there's a moon and sun connected to the shoulder piece that all interconnects the whole thing's very complicated it is all upper body yeah except for-- do you actually know what that is yeah no i don't each tattoo has 15 meanings they paid us 60 gold for three days i've never made money like this word of mouth you don't need a big public thing three and one dead it's going to be very hard to search for us if they don't know if it's nine or nein also if we're going to get him back we going to have to have an agreement about the fact that while there's going to be a certain amount of advertising necessary for this kind of venture there are many of us-- and i think it's fair to say-- that want to keep things quiet as quiet as possible bless you my father just threw me right in that's how i learned no that's a terrible idea it was awful but here we are wow that brought it back i don't think they understood that was an invitation that's exciting one assumes there's a mist that's just covering everything-- i mean nudity's going great and all but this is more about comfortability thank you i don't know what a wheelhouse is but i feel pretty positive about the metaphor in general my god the money i've never seen anything like it three months' worth of shows like that and they're so lazy [whisper inaudibly] i vouch for her for what it's worth it means what it means you run into your friends who are also heading in odd directions i tend to find it's easier to look into somebody's eyes and figure out if they're lying to you if they're naked and boiling i like to think you're scratching-- you've got a sword in your hand for god's sake i say we take the beast again keep it on the down-low we'll figure out a way of getting credit and keeping our reputation but keeping it quiet marisha and god i hope his name is harold i felt demeaned but in a good way yeah we're up then yours was in a locker it's a really hot hot tub i'm ready for monster hunter backflip let's find a herald the maudlin herald come on nott it'll be fine we'll see if we can meet anybody else who you could make feel better about who they are esma short for barrymore really oh wow that's a number it's a minus two 700 gold pieces just for the entrance they are aware that there are several of us we are just representatives of a slightly larger group of course but we can all get entrance from this writ you need all the names of everybody involved well we're called the mighty nine aren't we well let's just send seven of us down for now oh really i've never felt such hatred than this moment wow god damn it we walk away then they're going to send people down there but then they'll know as someone who actually has towns that they can't re-enter again for reasons that we will go into later over booze-- it's best to keep a clear reputation we can just run back up there's a blacksmith who knows i think the blacksmith will get ten gold for telling them if they find out there was a manticore down there that-- it's an emergency plan it's a good plan b i'll grant you that i'm going to juggle that was impressive if that isn't a beer-worthy story i don't know what is the master from doctor who this is the smartest feat you've ever taken we got to kill that guard wet bar boom we're clean we're relaxed we're ready to go into a sewer i do too it's time to eat some roast beast let's carb up hm why would you get a room at the pillow trove oh that's very clever actually well done are you still expecting your package sometimes i expect things to show up and then they don't it can be very disappointing but it's all right i'm sure it'll show up not that it matters if it doesn't i didn't expect you to say that that's very true i was just waiting for the drop to look at the shoes and you look back and yep no those shoes don't get in here when i was young we would stack three up and put on a coat
