that's not nice swished it right to left right to left yeah wet uh yeah no (laughs) i'll take that yes (clears throat) he's inside i'm organising getting any materials that we need no i don't think so not yet we take him to the castle i suppose at this point he'll be taken care of of course he'll be fine i am going to go back the castle sit down take this off and i think sleep for a long while we'll take him to his room i'll make sure someone cleans him up dresses him puts his things away you're welcome to take him to his room that was so subtle technically chronologically it wouldn't have happened yet yeah i was really looking forward to it to be honest i was actually hoping to be around the corner for a chunk of this 'cause i was heading to scanlan's room as well awesome 14 all right now i am coming around the corner i've waited long enough four if you can learn to use your feet i am going to wander into the room with a nod and just sit for a moment no i love you so much i'll be passing this around a bit honestly i am thinking about going through his things so no i don't think it is thank you we make it here i forget and then suddenly i remember that i met you all in a prison cell it's not fair is it it's just one day you lose so many people and then just one day you stop and at one point in your life you decide that suddenly for no reason there's just-- you're just not allowed to die yet your life just isn't your own anymore and suddenly you've done what you were supposed to do and now you're back and it's just not yours anymore is it and what of everybody else it's not fair any of it i don't know i know my life isn't my own my life is all of yours my life is my sister's my life is this castle's my life ended i'm very glad to be here (laughs) i just miss an awful lot of people that's all and i don't understand how we get to choose i know i know you don't grog i'm so grateful that you don't to the unyielding unfairness of the universe and that it decided that we get to keep this bastard hardly fair that's why i was thinking about going through all of his things we could just leave him in a gutter somewhere make him think he's reincarnated a hundred years in the future i don't know i keep thinking of terrible things to do to him now i know i-- well we were all troubled i feel like once vax is awake we'll really have an expert at this sort of thing available i wish i could hear that you're not in the room you're not in the room asshole i know i don't know if percy is that-- has that much of a lack of propriety he's really debating though how much have we had to drink i think that's a great idea i think i need somebody with a better mind for this a bit that would be cruel well you're a decent person should we i've got an idea we're gonna need one of your nightgowns and some of the pudding from downstairs kitchen (all laugh) i'm gonna send for some desserts from downstairs oh i'm well aware that's fine stale is better well first we're going to have to strip him we're gonna put him in your nightgown we're gonna just sort of leave him hanging off the bed and decorate the entire room with all the desserts we've brought up and just smear them in interesting patterns and-- maybe some latin everywhere just wonder what happened let's just leave him a tableau i think it's a fabulous idea we're gonna braid his hair as well i'm gonna smear in some of it on his forehead so he can read it in the mirror backwards and it's just gonna say 'no never' (all laugh) gently gently with your-- you can fit that oh that's true it is a small head let's do two lines you sir are a man of the world what a great idea (all laugh) i'm going to retrieve two of my scarves from my room (all laugh) with two of-- of the-- uh yeah couple of neck scarves not too tight gentle (laughs) i really i feel like i'm getting so many more chapters it is time for sleep he's still sleeping it off i don't think he's actually like woken up yet it does yes good fascinating to know really really such impropriety well there are things to do i suppose there's still a list of things that need to be taken care of good morning i don't remember what oh ah the night got weird it's good to see you too welcome home (laughs) very glad to be alive yes she is i think that might be fun (all laugh) the girth of things you do not know could fill such a cavern i did ah i love you i'm so proud of you wow thank you i didn't need that and that's how you put on armor (all laugh) he's got nurses the nurses were given some instructions you're welcome dear seemed the least we could do keeping him in the manner in which he is comfortable (laughs) no but if you do need a room-- (all laugh) it does don't hesitate to ask if you do need anything i am powerfully aware poobah de boink steady are the winds caused by the farts of kings (all laugh) indeed yeah (whispers) we'll be back so i'm told it was like a goose you just wait and i flipped the dragonslayer longsword for the gloves of missile snaring that was the last thing i did no not really (groans) not for a bit don't talk to me sorry i say we go to vasselheim we'll walk to our keep-- we made a double-check not a terrible idea at all we'll need to install the teleportation circle at some point perhaps seems to be the word of the day (all laugh) one a day that's the hope can i roll a perception check on his hands 18 good to know no seems a bit disrespectful i would love the notion that the one time that we actually follow through with this very simple and basic thing that we aim to do and just everything goes to shit really lovely very us my god your notes no these are amazing i think we should make a tree and head in that direction all in favor of jumping through that tree-- how paranoid has everybody gotten wow this is getting weirdly personal what high schooler hurt you people haven't sold you a subscription to highlights i am genuinely worried about everybody the other side of the tree i'll join in this history check this is bothering me 26 how about we just ask a few questions to see if anyone remembers his wife maybe she left some sort of connection to this place yes but they just say shkshkshkshk (all laugh) if you wanna help build tension lootcrate will help you build a lot of things today oh stop it build suspense build character (laughs) sorry shit that was the saddest advantage i've ever seen i think it's a great idea we've had a very long week excellent that's very true actually or so similar that it might be a problem it's just there's a lot of clash i'm keeping my mouth so shut i think knowing his work is underground may be enough thank you (laughs) woooow i think perhaps there will come a time but that it is not yet time to put the staff to rest i could watch your moral panic all day it's so delightful i wanna see if i can find two small stones while we're walking through the path i wanna find two pretty reasonable fire-starting stones yeah just a flint man nine damn it i'm gonna keep looking (sighs) no it's not yeah i was just thinking that he needs a gift not yet i'm all right with that (aside to marisha) well i just want like another one two --what you've goooot show me what you've got (everyone laughs) what what quivering palm the potion of broken heart (whimpers)
