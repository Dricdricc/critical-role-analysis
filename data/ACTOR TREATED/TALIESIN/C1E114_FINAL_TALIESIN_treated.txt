the last thing vox machina ever sees immortalized on a shirt it's the grinning face of our destroyer we do it's october which is wonderful and great we're going to be covering monsters we're doing monster books we're going to be talking about the origins of groot and some of the big creepy monsters of yesteryear and some modern creepy monster books i vampire and etc fun that'll do natural 20 15 15 this a lot i'm having a hard time figuring out this damage this is not cool dude i'm at precisely 70 points where were you earlier fucker no plan survives contact with the enemy that's the truth 27 22 i mean 22 i'm so sorry you should've sent the guy in the hallway in first maybe i regret nothing he's wearing it like a bangle from the 80s we've got to figure out how to get grog back i feel a little better that's all the conversation we can have in one action no time to respond to that yeah we're all ranged except for-- remember you can reroll things right she took 100 and-- yeah all right the first thing i'm going to do is deal with this skeleton that's right in front of me because there's-- actually yeah first thing i'm going to do is deal with this skeleton in front of me and take a slash at him with my sword so that's-- doesn't matter does it 20 to hit i'm going to do 1d8 plus i'm actually going to burn two points of lightning into this too from cabal's ruin so i'll see what one of that does that's awful eight points of silvered piercing damage plus seven points of lightning damage 15 did it that's fine next shot i'm taking the shot with the skeleton that's next to vex yep and i killed a thing so i get a grit back that's 30 to hit all right i have to switch dice that's 1d10 plus 1d6 psychic i'll burn another one point of cabal into that 14 points of damage plus five points of psychic and one point of lightning i get another grit back and now where are there other skeletons who's getting it i'm going to take a whack at the one that's right next to keyleth yeah yeah but i'm not going to do-- technically is my weapon magical okay so animus will do yeah but right now i'm better at clearing than anything i'm not going to be the one who does damage to him yeah let's have a little fun for my third shot i'm going to turn on him first i'm going to cast hex he is necro disadvantage on intelligence because fuck that guy and i'm going to hit him with animus i'm going to drop a point of grit for advantage damn it well that will do 31 to hit and i'm throwing all of cabal into it so that's 1d10 sorry i'm trying to do this 1d10 yes i know so that's not bad 15 points of damage plus six points of psychic damage and let's drop six points of lightning damage into it three four five six that's not bad 21 points of lightning damage actually there was one more i'm so sorry i forgot to do the necrotic damage on top of that so with necrotic damage that's another six points of necrotic damage okay still what i expected i'm going to burn an action surge i'm not going to hit him again because i got no more-- if everything goes well i can do 24 points of damage to him i'm going to use sharpshooter fuck it let's see if that does anything i'm going to add sharpshooter i'm going to burn my last grit for advantage let's see if that hits this is probably not going to hit is it that's a six that's okay yeah probably didn't hit yeah this is really shitty i can tell 17 to hit so i've got two more shots i'm taking another shot with no advantage yeah 19 to hit last shot that's better 24 to hit just on the cusp so that's my 1d10 plus my 1d6 plus my other 1d6 is that right yeah that's 15 22 points of damage plus five points of psychic damage and two points of necrotic damage i'm going to break line of sight behind that wall just head up there a little bit about there yeah actually still against the wall though what and me no you aren't that would be bad no it should be good now really that was a rough six seconds he's engaged by the way with bigby's hand got to drop concentration someone's got to hit him really hard wait i would be happy to let you take that i mean personally i normally would yeah moving on oh thank god they're such a nice miniature which is what he has disadvantage on it intelligence checks does that bigby's hand vanish with the caster well you got a little bit of a fall it's about 30 feet from where you are right now that's not bad that's doable yeah right now it doesn't matter at all this is amazing there's very little of value that i can do right now so i'm going to-- hmm not with my-- fuck yeah i guess he's within range so i'm going to burn my bonus i'm going to use my bonus to reload i'm going to take my first three shots and i'm going to take out those three skeletons across the way i know but it's going to refill my grit so that i have a better chance of hitting him so first shot actually here i'll take all three actually no just in case something terrible happens that's 20 to hit second one is 25 to hit and the third one is a crit so i get one back already and then let's do 1d10 plus 1d6 first one takes 17 points of damage plus four psychic second one takes 12 points of damage plus two psychic and the other one takes eight-- the other one is fucking toast i'm getting into twenties here not worth it so that's one grit two grit three grit so i have four grit back i'm burning my very last action surge now that i have some bloody grit i'm trying to remember can i pull sharpshooter with a grit point or can i not take sharpshooter with-- i'm going to take a sharpshooter plus violent because what else are we going to do so sharpshooter plus violent shot-- one point for violent because it makes it a gamble i don't have advantage i don't know why i'm rolling like i do here we go so with sharpshooter yes it's a crit i rolled a 19 so crit on a 19 which is double dice not double psychic just double damage right yeah it's just double so that is that oh man this is great so there's that and then i have the psychic that's right here so damage is-- oh my god-- 11 and then i double that no i rolled them twice so 11 (counting) 48 1d10 so with violent shot-- it's 2d10 and then i double the d10 plus 18 now i'm adding the psychic damage 48 plus nine points of psychic damage i've got two more shots and remember that you take half that damage at the end of your next turn mm-hmm so for my next shot i'm going to burn a point i wonder if a leg-wing shot would do anything here all right i'm going to burn a grit and i'm not going to do sharpshooter i'm just going to take a shot and that's 24 to hit and that's 13 points of damage plus four points of psychic and strength save versus 20 he drops a little bit of-- well i don't remember we used to say prone so i don't know what you would call that yeah oh no but i thought it was like prone if you're standing but 15 feet if you're in the air all right that's fair that was fine just for fun then let's take one more shot and see what happens that's a natural 20 it really is i'm going to die i'm going to fucking die he's going to kill me now aw man i have made a terrible mistake that's 20 points of damage plus oh really 12 points of psychic damage so 20 points plus 12 which is 32 and his next round he takes half that as well oh god i'm not comfortable with that and i'm taking another ten feet back i'm starting to back up a little bit because that was more than i was intending (breathless) yes that ends my turn that's the only die you ever roll man got to get you up there man never mind it's not my turn anymore i can't say anything heal people or do a-- yeah that's clutch it's cool next round you can do it next round he can leap off you wait what you got one i know i'm freaking out liam and --me--ha--me-- no it happens to the best of us i know this is a lot i am not to grog is that right okay so i have advantage from cabal's ruin not yet i can wait-- actually yeah i'm going to use my reaction my once per short rest my spell swallow i take half damage because i'm swallowing the spell 66 points of damage i've got nine charges left on cabal baby no is that one legendary action or two it's fine this was not going to last long did he take his bleed damage from me keep him distracted he's out of legendaries this is everything i wanted you can use mine whatever you need i only have a couple i have him hexed i took how much damage did i take what is the saving throw i can't so that's fine mine's gone it is not a 20 none of us are on these platforms though those are all skeletons i'm going to take a shot at one of those nasties that have followed them through since that seems to be a good use of my energy right now first shot is a 29 to hit i'm going to just for fun drop two cabal's ruin in there for my own amusement aw now i feel bad 15 points of damage two points of psychic and six points of lightning damage to shadowy jerk number one i'm shoot it again i'm going to drop a grit for advantage 27 to hit i'm not going to drop anything into it i'm just going to hit him that's nine points of damage plus two psychic damage oh fine then i'm going to target the other one with another grit for advantage that's cocked feels bad i liked that roll yeah same roll (counting) 24 all right and i'm going to drop one two three four five points of cabal's ruin into that one drop motherfucker three four five that's ten 18 points of lightning damage 13 points of piercing damage and six points of psychic damage fuck's sake that's everything i've got right now i'm going to try and scoot around the-- i'm going to get a little further back so i can grab onto that orb if things go shitty no he won't die you've got to trammel him you can't kill him although you can probably hit him with it and not hit vax he has one last legendary resistance he has disadvantage because he's currently under hex no it was your hex yeah your max plus two that would be amazing the dragon cage is not concentration is it yes no no nobody's actually hit him with anything since then that's a 25 if we get all three in that's the only thing that gives us a fighting chance we get all three in and then we get one round this is it's hard to do we've been hurting him so that's gone there would be an effect if it were halved we would know you can visually see when someone doesn't take the full damage he was also connected by a sword to a chain he's going to throw a boulder at us he has a third spell we got hit by meteor again fuck me fuck man nope 16 so what's the total i'm okay yeah that would've been the end of us right there okay we've got to start putting some trammels in this guy 59 you're still up oh let's go this is on it's fucking on right down there is it magic all right so i have advantage natural 20 yeah i can't be paralyzed anyway oh yeah that hits that also hits all right so that's (counting) 22 i'm at 22 hit points that's fine i can handle that yeah but he keeps healing-- marisha and i'm in melee with this thing i'm going to take a shot at him with the sword i'm going to give it a swing well this is fine it's my sword so it's a 21 to hit all right i'm going to drop two points of cabal's ruin or at least one point of cabal's ruin i want to try and end this shit no the birds that's 13 points of damage plus one lightning next thing i'm going to do is take a shot at that terrible thing over there and i'm going to burn a grit for advantage and hopefully get it back by killing it dead here we go thank god i did because that was terrible 25 to hit and i'm also going to put one more cabal's ruin into that just to put him down that's 16 points of damage two points of psychic damage and two points of lightning damage for my third action oh god i'm going to run down a little bit i'm going to try and get three of these guys in a line just a little bit i'm going to be one space away i'm not going around that way but i'm going to try to back around i don't want to get too far away because i'm not done with my movement i'm trying to get the shot as i run i'm going to drop a grit for a line shot piercing shot i know that's a hit that's 31 to hit that first one is ten points of damage and three points of psychic that's 22 to hit and then dear fucking god and i get all my grit back that was 38 to hit i'm going to run in next to scanlan and as my bonus action hand him a superior healing potion can i not get quite there oh in that case if i didn't have time keep a little closer to the orb in that case for my bonus i'm going to take a healing potion what is a superior worth get some healing and stuff boy there are two skeletons they'll go down quick can you put the ball slightly into the ground or no he's still hunter's marked which is remarkable i'm so sorry i said that out loud goddamn it it's not going to be that bad no he doesn't know which of his toys to play with scanlan can hold his action 88 he takes radiant damage when he hits vex now are you okay that'll do strength modifier that's the end of those skeletons though they're about to go away st louis right close your eyes and roll this got weird we don't know the more the better she's got a high strength but we want to try to end the round i'm going to take a step to my left and i'm going to drop a grit and i'm going to take a line shot at those two skeletons and make them go the fuck away that's a 27 to hit that'll do 15 points of damage plus five psychic that's an 18 okay and i get my grit back so i'm now going to back up against the wall all we can do at this point is take two more shots at vecna so i'm going to take another shot i'm burning some grit for advantage and i'm taking a sharpshooter shot shot number one natural 20 that'll hit and let's double that up where's my d10 where's my d6 that'll do that's nice that's (counting) 31 points of damage plus three points of psychic damage so that's 34 plus he's going to have a bleed next round and i get a grit back and i'm burning my other grit for another shot and yeah that's another crit 19 and that's not quite as good but that'll do 26 points of damage plus five psychic damage which he'll also get half of that bleed next round and i get my grit back and i'm going to use my bonus to finally reload because that was everything i had got to give a little pressure freedom of movement would not have 7th-level's something fierce though yeah i love these they're cruel but i love these but he made his save always so is this a concentration spell and that's not a concentration spell i would have gone with the tower did he take his half damage from me by the way from the crits that hits shut the fuck up there's been a lot of damage done this round hasn't there there's been a reasonable amount i've got a weird question if i burn a grit point for an arm shot can i make him drop his hand if i burn a grit point for an arm shot can i make him drop his hand i know it's stitched on-- if i hit it a bunch-- that's fine i was spit-balling i'm going to curl around the corner and i'm going to hold my turn for-- who's the last of us to go i'm going to hold my turn for any spells that he casts and i'm going to blast him three times the second he casts a spell on anybody right after a spell i'm going to hit him man he's looking way too smug is it i can't feel anything i take my shots i'm going to take my shots shot number one yeah as long as i've got reaction i knew what i was doing that would have been 25 these are all sharpshooter fuck it no it's okay and he just took from me because i took my shots it was 26 damage plus one psychic for the first one goddamn it the other one hits and again goddamn it 24 damage plus one psychic and the third shot probably does not hit third shot does not hit if we're not careful this gets worse no yeah we do not want to kill him this just means we have to live through one roll i'm holding my action for any movement or anything that he may do i'm holding my action for signs of life next round so now you can only try and read it anybody can try and read it any six seconds as long as it-- what language is it again so long as you guys all hold-- can he do it without arms okay because there's a lot of people grappling him what can't deal you can inspire yourself he has healed 50 though in theory yeah he wasn't like 20 points away disadvantage huddle in fear at this point hi i'm back there come join me i'm fine i'm 88 should be texting that fast did we just get janked we just got robbed it's hard to get out of here isn't it okay that just happened what holy fuck man wow yeah it is late okay that could have gone real bad yeah nope it's so late love you oh yeah oh we ain't done thank you blindspot oh my god
