there's a witcher wild hunt medallion paperweight this is not kidding around this is kind of intense it's a paperweight you could brain somebody with this that's a bottle opener right there yeah i have a cameo in it i'm stealing some of this stuff it is the six degrees of lin-manuel now isn't it kevin bacon has been unthroned lin-manuel on the show we're doomed and they have their own shop also and if you're interested you can go and shop at 826 and they have super cool posters and books and buttons and all sorts of stuff that you can get that they put out that are super super cool it is such a good date place yeah the actual quality of the date is not guaranteed but the quality of the venue-- marisha and a very small one a very small wedding or a wedding with small people i say we starting making our way and deal with this is it possible they're out of bad news' range or is that even humanly possible all right i double check speak now or forever hold your peace i'm doing this 1200 1200 feet 1200 feet all right taking a shot oh that'll do 30 okay reload actually i've got a better idea hand them one of the stones we'll find you when it's safe hide wherever you need to stay away from the castle we will find you when it's safe sure i'll take another shot actually let's head as a group towards this i say we run and we take everything that's heading towards us i'll wait until they're close enough that i can get a good-- i'm taking my first shot i'm also making it a wing shot wing shot first one 30 okay 26 points of damage and he has to make a strength save against becoming prone same thing with a drop i don't crit on a 19 yet do i oh i know 32 to hit i believe it's-- i used to oh 19 it's there i just couldn't see that just barely hits one of those again okay ten points of damage and a constitution saving throw i'm going to do a resolve that's even worse do i have to take the worse one for the resolve can i burn another resolve just to fuck it because this is annoying me i'll find out okay that's a 12 do i feel-- i'm going to take on the fall-down i put bad news away and i pull animus out because it's closer now so i can take easier pot shots at it 31 how many shots can i take a full round of shots or-- i'll take a full round 31 26 and 33 where are my d10s at that's not a d10 there we go that's three shots it's 17-- i'm making sure i do this right because-- 24 points 34 points 41 points of damage plus-- three it's three yeah 41 points of damage plus ten points of psychic damage that was three shots oh that hits that does not hit it's not helpful i'm going to activate my spider-climbing boots and going to reload and i'm going to start walking around and pot-shotting anything on the ground that's giving trouble if i see somebody i'm shooting until they stop i am going to cast on whatever the biggest one is and i'm going to cast hex which i still have and i'm taking my first shot 28 gun jam i take five points of damage before i went down i do 15 points of damage plus four points of psychic damage before the gun jammed it also would have taken six points of necrotic damage to it so yeah that's nuts i'm rolling really poorly yeah it's just rolling poorly no no we're dead we're going to die i'd love to do it again we can also take out his ride 13 oh go ahead i don't have my sword working he's currently a veggie burrito at the moment let's keep him that way i dunno why are you asking-- i'm having my own problem we have to start moving in a direction not if you place it right reroll i'm heading that way i'm going to use my action to try and clear my gun tinkering check so that's nice it's 18 it's fine i take six steps forward and then i use my bonus action liam laura and i'm going to use my bonus action to move my hex to one of the wyverns that is currently under the net the wyvern yeah it's fighting everybody too right okay it's going to make life easier for everybody why why this is not what this book was meant for i'm going to get a volume for next christmas you have a plus two i'm a little rough i could use some love yeah either of us i'm a little lower than you but you're-- yeah we're together stumpy legs did the lizard man take damage by the way it's not in your bag warmer warmer colder colder warmer they're very distinguished they have little fun mustaches okay okay now that this is happening i've decided-- i'm already committed to this wyvern and rider over in the corner that have not ceased to be a problem i assume that they have not ceased to be a problem at this point but they're going to become a problem if they kill those guards okay that'll do so i'm going to take three shots at that wyvern i'm going to start shooting at the wyvern so first attack he's held down by a net all right i'll take a sharpshooter shot at him so that's-- oh for the fuck's sake that's a gun jam yep that's another one i've got a lot but i keep-- ugh god that hurt okay that really hurt took ten points of psychic damage because that's funny i'm irritated i'm putting that away and i'm pulling out bad news and taking a shot with bad news at him because i've got just enough of a round to do that another sharpshooter shot because i'm irritated come on oh for fuck's sake yeah i died i'm dead oh yeah but this is getting stupid you know it's almost worth-- it really does suck that legit sucks oh yeah no i am i'm paying a deadly price for this shit right now i'm going to run toward the-- that's some sort of bastille weapon over there is there a-- no to your-- yeah right there what's the thing in the circle i'm running toward it okay i do there's another d8 those are very nice-looking d8s once you complete his instructions you can do anything you want yes i'm low he's trying to argue that you'll be taking damage and i'm trying to show him that he's wrong sorry you're welcome i'm at 59 that'll do okay i'm not very-- i'm not being very useful at the moment but yeah i'll get back there yay thank you yeah i had a whole crew of people i've got people it's take damage you have to take damage you have to complete all of your actions you can't do that now though we're a little weird tonight this is a musical episode general chaos general calamity okay i'm cool i'm going to try and-- okay out of curiosity is that little trebuchet there is that more-or-less pointed at the wyvern right now i'm going to-- is it possible that i can get this shot off in one round it's not like i've got a lot of options here like everything's going pretty iffy as it is there's honestly not a lot i can do about the bird right now if i try to run from the bird is it within striking distance of me okay well hardly matters all right let's-- 'it hardly matters' is the name of the game i'm going to see if i can get this-- i guess i'm going to make a strength check to try and-- standard strength check wait wait wait i'm burning my resolve is it just saving throws it's not-- oh okay so i'm not burning that then then that does not do anything i rolled a two so i got a three then i'm going to jump over that thing and run into the tent 'cause i'm goddamn useless right now now i'm going to burn an action surge that hits okay i'm 64 i'm going to burn a bonus for a heal so i'm going to-- i'm going to burn a second wind my only second wind and take 16 points back and then i'm going to burn my action surge to try and fix the pepperbox the animus box thankfully the difficulty is not horrible okay and that's fine again so the animus is back in action-- yeah (laughter) run you don't know him like she does this is technically a magic-- because i'm weak yeah something that does more damage than the spiritual weapon high has no one noticed that she's doing this yet by the way no one has commented that she's doing this she has a small cow wait is that with sneak attack ooh what what you're going to carve a christmas animal out of her i'm going to peek out the tent just one step i can see that the wyvern-- i take a look at the field and i see that-- okay so that's happening but i can see that we have a problem with scanlan so i'm going to take some shots at the creatures that are attacking scanlan i'm going to attack the wyvern not the rider first shot-- actually you know what i haven't tried this yet and this could be fun i'm going to try a piercing shot and see if i can hit the rider and the wyvern so starting with the wyvern and then-- all right come on don't be an asshole eh that's not terrible 19 oh for the rider that's 25 i'm going to take another double shot at the two of them that's a 26 to hit and then the second one which jumped is 30 to hit better 15 points of normal damage three points of psychic damage which means i still have one shot left that's fine i'm going to take one more shot i'm going to do a sharpshooter shot at the wyvern i'm also going to just to be an asshole i'm going to do a push shot at him i'm going to do a torso push so that's double-checking okay that's fucking terrible god damn it again and another ten points of psychic damage and i've lost that grit point because i burned that grit point on the bird so ow run back in the tent god damn it and deep into the tent like halfway into the tent i did well and then i jammed again i've done like 30 points of damage to myself his heart breaks before the arrow hits (laughter) don't you're a horrible person i have two guns to fix at some point okay do i get a bonus if i'm not in the middle of combat or is that still the same tinkering check so number one yes that goes well that's a 17 that was on animus and then bad news which is slightly easier to fix does not fix bad news is broken yeah i'm going to need to sit there with some money and spend some time with it in theory i should have some vials left not a gallon's worth we have something else where's the body we can interrogate him just because he's dead doesn't mean he doesn't have to talk to us now the defenses of the city i think he'll know that he's dead so the trickery i think it may be-- i would say it's probably either an appeal or a threat i can threaten him i can threaten him i will threaten him if necessary but we can try the carrot before the stick how did they find out where we were what are the strengths of their army what are their weaknesses who in the city especially also other questions may lead to other questions (quietly) how did they find out where we were how did he find fort daxio but we don't know like-- who who within the city still fights-- who within the city still fights against the dragon who will be our allies who can we trust thordak doesn't trust anybody no that's where they-- that's theirs or what does thordak fear four we have the stone you can find the boys with the stone if you would like to use the stone to pick up the boys-- i say we sleep here for the evening we also can go through whatever materials the invading army left behind cannibalize them for our own i suppose we can eat no we can't leave anybody here but it's interesting if we're lucky he's going to send more troops to attack and we can be long gone by then we can't leave anybody here we either abandon or we rally at this point and now that we know there are forces underneath emon that is good news that is very good news they saw us we could meet them at emon they're marching towards emon we want them here we don't have four days 55 men in a broken citadel is not a plan it was a plan before it's not a plan now these things have to change so we have to be very careful of where we go and what we do or we can send half the troops as many as we can tonight stay here and in the morning send the rest and we can go with them well it is a fort they have a system i need to sleep 'thank god' all right why what's happened oh yes i just assume that everything is going to be bad news for the next-- just assume that i'm going to assume everything is terrible every time i see you for the next two months yes we're alive oh no we'll put them to work they will be useful yes all right asum i assumed well things have not been going well on our end how about yours well to the room daxio was discovered and attacked prematurely a group has already-- a small strike group came and attacked the fort did damage-- i wouldn't necessarily call it significant damage-- decimated it broken clock that's a very good guess grog i've completely lost my train of thought this changes much we should also probably tell them about xanthas that we did have the room there is worth telling is that he had already turned and was working for the cinder king and he is now no longer with us we're going to have to go to emon there will be several armies we will have allies there will be troops to create distractions there will be troops that go into the tunnels there will probably be a group of troops that go in to try and pierce the lair we will create chaos it could actually pick up the people there we do have-- well we do have our own tunnel into the city that we can show-- is anybody using our tunnels into the city if the keep is clear that does give us access possibly clear access allura signed up for this fight and we're going to lose many more gilmore doesn't want to go either unless gilmore feels like volunteering no actually allura won all right shit's happening
