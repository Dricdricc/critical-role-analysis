(cheering) squish-squish that was fantastic the horn is on the carpet it has been specifically not touched i think we should put it in the bag of holding it'll be fine in the bag of holding well i am percival fredrickstein von musel klossowski de rolo iii and hello and we would love to report to the emperor of your great hospitality at this unfortunately early hour and we would look forward to reporting of all of your kindness and good housekeeping i would hope not to imagine it you are too kind good day good evening well that could've gone worse the metro's running at this hour let's go drinking we could do a pub crawl we'll just have a beer at every pub we hit on the way back to the keep we'll un-stone her once we're back at the keep it'll be fine percy was the third of seven children born to a noble family who lived far to the north in the ancient castle of whitestone with so many siblings to share the burdens of lordship percy turned his attentions to the sciences engineering and naturalism one day a mysterious couple named lord and lady briarwood came to court during a feast held in their honor the briarwoods violently took control of the castle killing or imprisoning everyone who would stand in their way percy awoke chained in the dungeon only to be freed by his younger sister together they fled chased by the briarwoods' men as they ran percy's sister took several arrows to the chest and fell percy kept running eventually jumping into a freezing river and floating unconscious to freedom he did not remember waking up on a fishing boat he barely remembered the next two years as he slowly made his way as far south as possible then one night percy had a dream a roaring cloud of smoke offered him vengeance against those who destroyed his family when he awoke percy began to design his first gun (gunshot) oh wait this is in here can i throw this oh no you get the horn we're drunk feels like eleven weeks it feels like a very long time garden gnome i'm drunk quiet is good they weren't particularly connected until the very end he was dead before they were actually connected they may not know who we are we'll let them know but we may have time we hurt them very badly the mind flayers have been down there for ages there's nothing new i think this will also be a conversation that lady kima will have some-- i think if we have allura here and begin that conversation then we can have allura's insight yes i think we tell allura before we un-stone lady kima everything that's happened-- no let's wait until allura's here i think and we can-- we're going to have to trust somebody do we know that there's a second horn tiberius we're having a lovely breakfast tell us a story tell us a story from what i understand-- is it possible that it's not possible to destroy this and instead it has to be banished somewhere perhaps i'm of the opinion they probably want to banish it somewhere no this is good this means that there's no reason necessarily not to trust them we just know that we don't trust the horn and that's a perfectly reasonable way to come at it it's perfectly safe in the bag i like half that plan but then they're going to tell us to go back for it i think we just keep it in the bag of holding she'll never suspect yes that's genius that's a very good plan no we don't this was a fabulous breakfast good night let's not forget you've still got a funny toe that's awesome don't do that we're going to face her towards the wall we're ready to pull you away when she starts to move and we got a very fancy hat out of it why what can it do history check can i do a history check that's a religion check not history check i'm doing a history check if you want to do a religion check 22 if we're going to trust anyone i think this is a good-- i trust the organization they have a sterling reputation always the worst time yes there's a guest room i'm going to go get our d20s back (sings) mustang scanlan you took all of our crits thank you otherwise hey free copy for us which is really cool no mercy for percy we love you guys so much that is so badass so fantastic she does holy shit holy shit i just rolled a 20 look at
