that's a whole different thing i'll say the game is therapeutic i don't necessarily know if broadcasting it on the internet is therapeutic but the game is i work things out it was a few weeks ago i was with you and i was like man i'm in a mood percy's going to do something messed up man argh i need to put it somewhere i'm going to kill a guy somebody yelled at my mom three states away grr true story it's true though because we've all done theater there's that family thing that happens in theater but then there's that pre-show jitter that happens with theater i don't get the pre-show jitter i just get the family vibe it's really nice no but there's a fair point also to say and i feel like this is true even of my home games that we played before stream i think of-- and i know i'm going to get a list of movie titles you think of your favorite movies and so many of them are about making a plan and executing it perfectly and then everything going fine and like that's not fun chaos is fun complete lack of control is fun you've definitely inspired a lot of vaguely drunk conversations about what we're going to do next between a bunch of us we've started talking britney you don't know but that you know okay glad that's making a map right there people legitimately tweet quotes at me and my only reaction is i said that when did i say that i don't even know the context anymore thank you i'm very proud of that one i'm going to be a jerk i can only think of one of my own life needs things to live i'm so glad that has weirdly-- i was so tired i'm so pleased thank you sam that has become a thing i can never escape it ever again oh i was so tired i think the air of superiority may go it may not but the anger issues i don't think are ever going away he'll never stop pretending he doesn't have them (percy voice) no yes of course oh current character audience whoa god probably sorcerer at this point which i know would be a little weird but i'd make it work i'm not going to multiclass but if he did that's where it would end up white phoenix shirt very solid feeling it this is fine i feel like we've talked about this before and now i'm drawing a blank other than lin manuel we had like three iterations of me before i was really functional i think i will admit i really like matt's doty-face it's like a cartoon bird i like the milk/water/mayonnaise jar that asmodeus ring that was a deep cut man some sort of soul litigation do a little faust play mephistopheles i'm a little worried i don't know hell makes me very nervous right now i've got to admit i'm a little nervous i usually only accept meat from friends covered in blood
