i have not seen a picture of my brother without his it's so adorable oh he's watching right now and i just called him adorable i feel so bad season two season two art i have poofy arms now i like my poofy arms i've got little poofy arms they're great so much art it's very impotent thank you for running with that don't make it too hard (grog voice) it's true it's very true smooth well done i'm kind of a big deal that's fair we could have them write a letter and we can seal it and then it would be official governments function on paperwork people have to take this seriously we have money now it depends on what we want we can't bankrupt the treasury or anything but i'm sure that we can dip don't put a number on family that's actually a very good question actually that's a really interesting idea is there anybody in town who could reenchant our carpet i'm asking the yellow pages we'll talk to them and see what's possible i'm going to craft that thing that i've been wanting to craft so that was that we talked about shut up can i use my resolve goddamn it 11 well i'm doing the whole kit and caboodle well if i can break it up into chunks then that will be-- taking it apart i'm going to take it apart i'm going to put it back together and i'm going to add the fifth barrel okay can i give it a once-over i hate you the difference between those rolls are really impressive whoa okay i'm going to point out that i just rolled my die before the game started and rolled a natural 20 on my first roll five i've got all the little bits i'm going to definitely-- i've learned my lesson so that gives me a three and a-- that'll be funny oh i also have to make some ammo for it since it's individual ammo so should i just roll for that on the harpies that we own i'm going to assume that i can use some family connections to finagle a few horses we have an instant teleportation as a worst-case scenario we'll actually in theory beat the letters that we sent that's okay we have proof we're getting another letter if anything goes wrong we'll hear about it and we can come back we got it he's senile and gentle they'll be kind at least he'll be going home to a very nice surprise well we have a really big fat tree right in the town who taught you the phrase bag of dicks heading what oh god that's right well the good news is we can let you go you're free and clear the briarwoods will not be a problem anymore and whitestone is rather pleasant at the moment oh that's right i suppose there is the matter of testimony but we can open the cell at the very least for his own protection but that's hardly a matter anymore yes all taken care of so it's not hump day but we're not quite waiting for the weekend yet oh grog by the way did you think i'd forget thank you if he dies you don't get the gold coin back i had a really bad day i had a really bad day i was possessed by an evil smoke demon she's going to try and undo some of my poor decision-making that's a good question i would agree perhaps send him i will send him-- how about i send him with a letter making sure that he is well-employed if people would just learn oh never mind i'm not sure what the price tag on a-- yes i'm going to make my sister pay and i should also mention i don't have any money at the moment so this is also-- i gave your sister all my money i did well it was a long time ago but it was all my money i think so i'll do it it's my problem on a certain level well i have some heavy lifting on my shoulders i'll take a bit of it on now we're here to seek an audience and we would be more than happy to have an escort this is an audience that the king is going to wish to take better 21 we have no intention of anything funny later later it's going to be fine touch√© i step up i'm stepping up i genuflect if you would your majesty yes first of all whitestone is once again ruled by the de rolo family and i must also at this point offer our own apologies which are in order while there was a supernatural flame of distrust in your heart it couldn't have been ignited without the embers of our own rash judgements and poor choices it is difficult for men of action to necessarily pay attention to the smaller details of their world and their realities and for this we do apologize i wish i could say it would be the last of it but again it is a difficult world and we are prone to action and for that you have our apologies i would also offer my lord that perhaps these infernal powers are attracted by your innate goodness and that would be worth meditating upon i am not there is another de rolo the briarwoods were sloppy in their extermination of my line and family cassandra de rolo now rules along with a-- triumvirate i suppose council of leaders pushing to build the economy once again in that sense i'm sure they would be delighted by the opening of trade and perhaps continuing with the plans for a bridge worth discussing at the very least with the new rulers of whitestone your majesty i know well the betrayal you feel and i urge caution this young man was an unfortunate victim of my wrath when the briarwoods visited he is a citizen of whitestone and-- i would like to have him be the official letter carrier for any-- the first set of correspondence to the new rulers of whitecastle so since he-- whitestone my god i'm hungry about 12 i'm coming up with this shit it's not easy i know constitution roll (fart noise) i should also mention that my lineage has now been restored to me and i am now of royal descent once again and so again with my companions' permission and we will discuss this in the future but i would like to put forward the beginnings of the proper paperwork to perhaps have greyskull keep designated as an embassy with all the privileges and rights that that presumes i will confer with my peers desmond the debt that i owe you is larger than coin and is-- and it's ongoing so if you can think of how-- what sort of trade you would like to spend your next years of life pursuing whether it be in-- drums it is drums it is you are a terrible person i'm a terrible person but you're the worst whatever work you would wish desmond is available to you breaking in the new year look surprised i've got a reddit page open behind my dm screen i think we're perfectly well-suited for now since i am also gold-poor i'm writing it into the letter to my sister that we owe money that they are to employ him in any way he sees fit i also made sure in the letter that they know that he is returning to whitestone with this money so that if he somehow-- if it's mismanaged by any of the guards or otherwise that it will be taken care of you guys are doing a great job you're great you look great you're doing great you're great thank you that went well i know where you're going with this you should finish the thought do we have the blueprints to greyskull keep no but being able to study them we might find places where-- or he might have hidden an escape-- there might be things about our keep we don't know we'll get the blueprints just to help we're representatives of a foreign government what did they want you just really want to see gilmore he just has really nice hair it's different from actually knowing things i wanna see how this pulls together i follow grog how often did he go into the diamond nest tavern did it follow some sort of regular schedule or was it just out of the blue i feel this has been very helpful grog are you feeling all right i'm fine i just want to check in to see how you're doing the sword is a bit iffy this is what happens when you spend time on your phone that's not nearly as much fun burt reynolds perhaps help him with his pitch grog it doesn't mean what you think it means he's in a cast he's been playing with a cast the entire time we're quite the opposite of low profile this is my favorite thing ever i think we obviously-- any friend of scanlan is a friend of ours and i think if dr dranzel here-- may i call you dr dranzel that has a really nice ring to it professor dranzel dr dranzel and i want to know if you're really a doctor later but i think perhaps maybe there's a little tidbit of information about this that you're holding back with because-- i would understand we're new we don't really know each other we're not really on that friendship level yet but my point is we could be friends like that we could be-- i'm trying to see if this works you know what i'm doing i'm attempting friends i'm attempting i get advantage on charisma rolls am i just rolling charisma oh persuasion roll with advantage oh that's nice 23 if it's the house that i think it is it's already been-- pillaged pillaged is a good word the rumors were not incorrect but-- do you remember with the agon-day with our utler-bay and this is the point where i buy you a beer and i put the coin down you should see if there's rooms downstairs team downstairs it is let's all meet no because that would be very complicated to deal with while still being part of the political infrastructure of the city here done excuse us lovely fellows we have prior business we'll be talking again very soon i grab keyleth and we slip behind them and into the kitchen 14 (singing) too many cooks (laughter) jethro tull would be a great name for a sith laura and if there was a piece of advice that ever lived such a life lesson i am he made a little rainbow they can't see it because it's off they won't be able to see it celestial elven we don't know what the other ones say though you know primordial do we smell anything what in the living-- i pull out a small note that i hold in my right hand i hold up a beautiful elegant note that i show in my hand and put it in my breast pocket once he is free then you get-- in our custody then you get the note i have not given him the password yet that's good because man this was some bullshit where did he leave from i'll take the other door

mean on the door that i'm next to i'm going to hold-- i'm going to stay where i am and hold my action until i see somebody i want to shoot in the hallway this guy's annoying you can move while prone that's hot with science room's kind of busy in my opinion yeah let's keep point i'm holding i can't take my turn now can i oh god no she's standing or i mean she's not but-- oh wait i'm gonna pull grit shot to the hands with the new pistol that's a 21 to hit all right drop it let me double-check against my against my dc no this does no damage i don't know what my dc is hands yeah did we-- are
