doomsday cards we're working on marvel masterpiece unopened we've got some kirby cards some classic avengers cards we're doing a little bit of everything we've got a couple we're working on though marvel universe series one of three is what we're really working on i was wearing smaller people on my feet so it helped over half those facts at the beginning are actually true even if they've been goosed a bit the bees are true one now that's dark but that's where we are only today though today's the last day this is the first time i've ever said this out loud seriously go check out alpha for this show it's worth it it's amazing oh my god yes but probably not any you're going to be happy with to be fair i may make a post later on twitter tomorrow or something to really talk about it i have a lot of feelings about this show are they watching twitch by candlelight just hear the sound of a wine aerator in the background we brought everything we could i'm so sorry can you keyleth then it doesn't matter yet until we bring him back let's bring him back where are we we can find it then well now we know what to do we were too late and we have seen what we're up against and now we need to focus we can't let it be over yet we need to focus we're going to find these diamonds grog can you put her in the bag and i toss him the body i'm going to use every dex i have i'm going to slap fucking hard strength check oh athletics that's better 10 yeah i'm going to follow the eye i need help finding it i need help be very careful i've got the flashlight box out and i'm going to try and use this as a container if we find it keyleth can you thin this we need to see make the mist go away (louder) can you make the mist go away i have the box out ready the burrowing eyeball are you sure (laughter) i think that's a terrible idea what makes you think that you're bleeding out your eye right now i kind of want you to hold it yes and that thing should be difficult to get out of it it is a big case well if we're really amused by it we just set off the light crystal that's in there and let it blind itself in there for a while that would be funny we have bigger problems diamonds and delilah oh yeah we're going to want to have a word with her later vex vex he needs you here now i need you here we're not done this is not over yet we are in trouble we need to find a city the two of you i need both of you here nothing is ever what it's supposed to be i know let's get this done how do we know that she is against us this was vecna she may still be with us we're not done we need to find diamonds can we find them while we're here can we find them where we are where are we i feel within a tinker theory is how figuring out how much diamonds-- that'll do i feel like this would be in the wheelhouse god i am rolling just the worst 13 i know where there are diamonds there is a second thought if this does not go well which was-- there was one place where we saw that many diamonds in one place before thordak yes but not everything left the city there's enough there it didn't get randomly distributed i'm sure that they have it and i'm sure that we can make a deal i have something worth money we go to kraghammer rest there vecna's in a box more than all of us combined i'd imagine i don't know we can look in the box without there's a glass thing so we can look through the glass what if it's the vecna dimension you can buy my vote yes you do you can buy my vote we are wrecked heal and sleep let keyleth make something big we have one problem at a time we have delilah and we will deal with-- we're going to talk to her we're going to see what we can learn we're going to be very thoughtful about what we talk to her about and we're going to find a way of making sure that this is the last time we put her in the ground by hook or by crook tomorrow we go to kraghammer we make an animal i don't think i'm in the right mind to even think of anything to say to her that isn't just rage at the moment let's get up there they seem like they've quieted down small miracles that's weird i'm not getting into it i am but everyone else isn't that's the hard part sam's scamming you we had to hide at the other end of the building man that was nuts these are all long rests we're all getting long rests i'll take second watch vecna comes back and we all die that'll do that's a 21 is anybody else waking up at this point i grab my stuff and i immediately run down the tree vex i need you to step away from him vax if it is you i hope you understand and please just for a second thank you we're fighting the perversion of death itself this is what i would do to torture us let's figure this out before we hand him back anything that's older than we are i'm keeping some distance oh i believe you're you i just have to make sure what brought you back i don't even know if you would know yet pike does he have a heartbeat is he undead have you tried turn undead it's not your heart i'm worried about if he's not you will not survive this i'm sure it's going to be fine let's just take a minute and reflect on every terrible thing that's happened over the last 24 hours and be careful for once i'm so sorry this is madness it's him in there let's just make sure that it's him that is the rest of him could vecna put vax into something designed to hurt us i believe it's vax it's the rest of it what would happen to him if you tried to turn undead if anything awful happens he should survive it if you're dead we'll just have to be extra careful and we'll have a little more understanding of what's happening when has a random miracle ever just happened if we work for a miracle that's one thing but this sort of thing doesn't end up on your doorstep you know that does he i'm so sorry i cannot wait for you both to be angry with me later no not yet thank you not yet we're not sure let's not even begin to have this discussion if we don't have to i think that we can be physically optimistic go we have to figure out where you came from 'cause you're in a pouch this is looking better all things considered i'm going to fall down on the ground tmi problem we were not effective we need a plan we do need help we'll all try and keep each other alive i was about to say we can give him that pouch and then he could have perfect proof then you suggested we sleep and suddenly we don't need diamonds anymore we should probably-- i get the distinct impression this is-- we technically go to the feywild about once a year at this point at least some of us but since we are here i'm not going to pretend i have a plan i don't know what we're going to do we are frighteningly outmatched it's not like we can stop you oh my god we wouldn't come by if it weren't an emergency i think what vax is trying to say is we need patrons we need patronage we're not enough we are not enough for this we are going to all die horribly if we try anything like that again i don't know oh god we have to deal with this we need to get a slightly longer list and we have to start begging we are going to owe favors we are going to owe our lives we are going to lose we'll see we also probably want to alert the mortal coil that everything has gone to shit maybe if we do something even stupider than holding hands in a circle i had to burn a resolve i burned a resolve i've got to make sure that i can use the resolve can i use resolve on this okay in that case 20 he is abundantly real this makes me wonder if you've been doing it wrong this whole time vecna-dar you may not want me in company for sarenrae i just don't want to say the wrong thing this is a deeply-inappropriate convincing mena-men-mechanism it is working all right you're a terrible person let's do one at a time i think we're a bit beyond that at this point we're eventually going to have to tell somebody in charge what's happening but to sarenrae let's get this ball rolling no in for a penny let's let people know we should probably tell them what's going on people should start to prepare themselves for what's coming we can't just keep this to ourselves this is going to affect everyone you're not here you went shopping so he's going to tell us a date that will mean nothing to us because we don't actually know the date we left because we don't know how dates work bidusday bidetsday bidusday biwhatsday biheyhay this is like watching the dnd icon crash well that's convenient did you just say ps to someone did you say that out loud let's gather the boys and alert whatever government we can this is the best retelling of this ever your picture is going to be up in a small office by the gates critical role it all seems so stupid (laughs) it's a 20 oh god this is everything i ever wanted let's hire new guards oh gosh you are keeper of the giant eagle ac is that the takeaway from this you should have killed the guard i'm just checking oh wait is that the-- this is the most hilarious thing i've ever seen either that or that guard we left alive that one time ran into grog and sounded the alarm it was probably vecna what would be the odds of that one guard seeing him this is a very big city are you sure we could spend some time here have a drink see the local color i think the priests of the temple are going to alert-- give them the basic story of vecna to the fire ashari and then to the fields of elysium to the fire ashari then to the fields of elysium just i dream of jeannie us there that's next we're going to alert all of the major cities of the continents that things have gone pear-shaped tree stride stride like a tree seriously that text is really tiny i've never taken it into account it makes me feel old thar amphala we barely escaped he's in the north new plan mimosas wow no one's learned anything of value probably used them probably really wanted some ice cream tell it to the necromancer pal at the break he said i quit and he walked out
