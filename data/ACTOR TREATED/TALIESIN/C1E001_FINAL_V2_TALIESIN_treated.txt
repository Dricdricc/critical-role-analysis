my name is taliesin jaffe i'm a voice actor director and i've been playing some form of dungeons & dragons and if you can't tell by my black clothing a lot of vampire the masquerade when i was a teenager there was a problem i'm playing percy the gunslinger i'm the reason all the rules are all messed up i think before we do anything we should find a place to sleep wouldn't it be nice to put everything down for a little while with an indefinite hold we have business in the city this doesn't terrify me that shouldn't be a problem mostly we are looking for lord greyspine if i recall we have business with him how long ago would you say this was thank you perfect he has to do something i don't think they have rainy days we are looking to set up a meeting there's only one way to find out there's no sense attempting to be subtle everyone's going to know that we're here and what we're looking for by morning (groans) we think there might be something rotten in the mines i'm assisting in this persuasion roll good god 21 i'm going to go walk over to grog really quickly i feel like we weren't going to discuss that i felt that that was in the past did we trade the troll dick for something i'll rustle up a few that's fine why not it's what i do apparently we're going to make some beautiful comment cards yes thank you whore dwarf you're all going to have comment cards that you are expected to fill out when you return back to the bar we have comment cards so this will all work out well well all right i think we should all turn in our comment cards i can't stress how important this is no no really no it's fine speak over me i don't care we're going to give him a few extras so he can have more comments percy was the third child of seven children born to a noble family who lived far to the north in the ancient castle of whitestone with so many siblings to share the burdens of lordship percy turned his attention to the sciences engineering and naturalism one day a mysterious couple named lord and lady briarwood came to court during a feast held in their honor the briarwoods violently took control of the castle killing or imprisoning everyone who would stand in their way percy awoke chained in the dungeon only to be freed by his younger sister together they fled chased by the briarwoods' men as they ran percy's sister took several arrows to the chest and fell percy kept running eventually jumping into a freezing river and floating unconscious to freedom he did not remember waking up on a fishing boat he barely remembered the next two years as he slowly made his way as far south as possible then one night percy had a dream a roaring cloud of smoke offered him vengeance against those who destroyed his family when he awoke percy began to design his first gun i say we have brunch and we go to the manor-- laura and i want dwarven brunch they're small we will go back there i don't think it's the next order of business but i think that we're not leaving the city without dealing with that did you not fill out your comment card that sounds very positive very good i think that went well now i'm curious if there's dwarven coffee thank you it's like being in new orleans for the weekend every meal is going to come with something alcoholic oh god bring it back just say yes i want to double check see if there's a bell to ring or there seems to be some sort of calling-- ding ding ding-a-ding if you must yes calling at the very least i thought you would go right there yes percival fredrickstein von musel klossowski de rolo iii you can simply call me percy thank you we're here to discuss some business with lord greyspine and we have of course brought gifts and our charming company that's a shame we brought this half-barrel of ale right here and some-- well this is definitely official political business i will also say could you direct us to the quarry we are new in town he's been drinking since very early this morning what was your name again magrim of course you're the servant you are filled with poise and sophistication and of course above all protocol i would not wish you to break protocol which is why some simple directions for those of us who are wishing to do some official business you'll be right on your way and your house will return to order every time we break into someone's house it turns out poorly good man good day we'll be on our way thank you we are off the reservation divergent you're making a fruit basket it looks like a fruit basket it's the ale of the month club that is very fair are you a dwarf made of stone she is better at this i'm going to let her do this laura and well several things actually several things bring us to the mine my name of course is percival fredrickstein von musel klossowski de rolo iii we were here to call upon your expertise we imagine that we are not the first strangers to kraghammer to come through-- in the last few weeks we believe one of our compatriots had some dealings with you perhaps not as pleasant as the dealings we are hoping to have yes we're here to mend any broken bridges so to speak we'd be happy to clear out anything unpleasant that we happen to find in there in the meantime it's not help sir we are simply respecting you as a businessman as a businessman i'm sure that you would disagree with unceremonious charity whether it would be to give it or receive it we are making sure that our dealings with you are fair and balanced i doubt that we could find anything of more value that what we have already brought you and write comment cards yes i am going to make a fumble i am going to attempt to assist a sleight of hand with a bit of a fumble he is distracted by a bell just try and like practically usher our guards in that direction since they seem to want to go in that direction let's see if we can push them in that direction well we can certainly help lead on i take a shot right now 19 we run straight in oh yeah 27 i rolled a 20 plus seven 27 i have 27 initiative wow oh my god i'm sitting down and i'm busting out bad news ogre yep nope first time that's a 30 attack 19 actually might natural 19 that does critical for me i've never criticaled with this either what does that mean (counting) 27 points of damage that's doubled i can't do anything after that that's just reload bad news travels far and fast (valley girl voice) they're just like dead this one moves around and this one runs around to there no attacks everyone make an insight check i literally get a one natural one i'm really not paying attention he's running you gave him just enough time to regret everything that had ever happened well done bad life choices make a pity roll (clicking) sitting down you're all so fancy i'm breathing deep taking aim at the wall resetting everything i'm staying far back at the moment just taking aim do i have to take new aim or can i have myself already trained on-- i'm taking my round to aim i just took aim took aim just a gun this gun doesn't do anything fancy just shoots really far really hard oh my god that was really helpful
