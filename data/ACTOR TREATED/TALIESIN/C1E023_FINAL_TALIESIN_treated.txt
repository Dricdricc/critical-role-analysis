grow on trees emon by way of kraghammer i just need to pick up a little bit of ore on the way out so i can work on making some more ammunition on the way to kraghammer we'll prod that in great details of the internet just saying i went there it was already there too late you did what you had to it's halfway i think kraghammer is in between us and emon it's not hard to get a little bit of ore i'm just going to pick up some and has antlers on her head i like your antlers there's nothing it's just a very reasonable reason not to take you too seriously i have a brilliant if slightly inebriated thought i have an even better brilliant yet slightly inebriated thought my thought is i can probably find some of the ore i need to procure at the same time that we find this groon fellow and at the very least you can strike up a quick conversation with him you can give them a medal you're already been arrested today yes what happened to my dice okay 14 hello charming my name is percival fredrickstein von musel klossowski de rolo iii thank you i was sent here in terms to hopefully negotiate the purchase of some black powder i heard-- i gingerly enter i would hope so how much for a barrel or a hogshead's worth i can it's as if i can see the spittle myself how about 400 even and you can direct me to some ore as well i thought you might have a friend i love percy 25 i'm sure you have a friend you must you seem so amiable my good sir you have a deal i gingerly put the purse down in front of me thank you for all of your help you've been so kind i might do that i'm going to walk over to samson's place and become very excited at the prospect of a new accent 43 from the russian judge mr samson the strange fellow down the road sent me to you he said you might have some ore he said you might have some raw ore for sale that i might purchase you'll excuse me if i don't come in i'm covered in explosive powder of course no yes just some iron ore actually i have a little invention which sends projectiles at great speed ingots would be preferable yes what could you give me for approximately a thousand gold's worth i certainly can't carry that much with me right now let's say about a hundred pounds' worth let's say 350 gold and i promise to always shower twice before entering your home for my next purchase all right 24 of course you are a gentleman and apparently a worthy smith as well i do bid you good day then good man i will see you when my need arises again very bathed in fact quite bathed i'm going to come back and join you actually if you could just help load it onto the ship that would be lovely sure certainly if we can put it in the bag of holding that would be fine i yes that is in fact a pig's head it's complicated let's go i keep jumping into things why don't we take a day or two to recuperate and then make our way to kraghammer you cleaved his head off with the blunt end of the knife plus six wait wait there there's his heart breaking had i i hadn't noticed i have had dealings with them before i find them untrustworthy (sighs) yes we will attend excuse me i have a bit of work to do downstairs i've already gone (screams) (laughter) so that money that we're owed why don't we do that i think we have time for that
