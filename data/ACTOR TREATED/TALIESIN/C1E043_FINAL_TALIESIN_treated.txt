butlers i'm buttling in book of murder as sir arthur conan doyle so that's exciting it's the weirdest accent i've ever done it is all over the place i'm at this point prepared for some decompression of some kind no one can be expected to move at the speeds we've been moving at for the past week perhaps grab an early-morning drink and find out how much news has actually reached this town about what's happening out in the world right now that's actually an even better idea perhaps she will go to breakfast that sounds right yes it's interesting because i sleep at night and these voices from nowhere consistently remind me that there's a black powder merchant in this-- kima i think is an excellent idea no she's related to lillith they actually are they are related that is true our friend from previously with that let's find kima perhaps that would be the best course of action that may actually be a good point is that including what we got from my sister let's buy some potions oh

things that we should think about purchasing i could use a bit of a top-up just because who knows when the next time we're going to be in this direction and perhaps considering that we're going to be
