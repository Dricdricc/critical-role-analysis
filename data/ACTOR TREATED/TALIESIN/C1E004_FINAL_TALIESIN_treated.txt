i got one too my brother who also works in video games gave a talk at gvc this year and it just went online and not now but later you should watch alex jaffe's talk on metagame balancing it's really really fun it's fabulous and you learn a lot i think that's a great idea no nothing can be there that's a number is that the thing that you wear upon your head i would like to take a look into it if possible and see if it makes sense i am a builder if we were all hidden we would have a distinct advantage if you like could we be hidden from them would there be a way to cloak ourselves from their understanding i feel that we could come to an arrangement we would require of you at the very least safe passage once we have helped you reunite with your people for ourselves and for a friend of ours who's lost in the darkness who we are here to retrieve freeing all of our people what are you doing all of your 20's running out do their powers work with reflection but if we approach them using a reflective surface to view them can they peer into our minds through a reflected surface i did the chasm is a problem we also have a flying carpet we can repair the bridge if we had to at least put a rope across some of us can fly over them well we can all have water breathing before the ones we killed or after may i examine-- without removing-- may i examine your device 16 it may be the key to returning you to your people i won't touch i will just look can i understand how it functions so it's magic so there'd be no way to build something to create a feedback loop i wanna try and see if there's any way that i can take a look at this and figure out a way to build some sort of feedback system he wants a coconut radio plan two-- because if they can't see what if we blind them with a really bright light what if they are so blind they can't actually see us coming can i attempt to build sunglasses even better that's as white as it gets once they have visual contact they can influence us but they need to make that visual contact in the first place if we could perhaps put some light spells on the back and the front of our shields so that we are guarded from it my god and we've got light spells two fronts i'm behind this plan i'm gonna do a little bit of work on that first trick arrow on the trap arrow since i've got a little time that's a-- what am i rolling oh it's just an intelligence roll right yeah i don't have a number for that ah thank you 17 i was just trying to make an entanglement arrow it's a trapper's arrow i'm gonna be hawkeyeing laura out at some point i got a couple of them i get up and look around 18 how do you feel about lacing it with gun powder goblin poop cocktail both mind controlled i'll do that at first but then eventually i'm going to just have to jump into the fray gonna be buffing us like a vampire slayer she's just quiet 'cause she's feeling smug about the last game do you think happy thoughts 22 die rolls do not light up until you see the black or greens of their eyes yeah you're a terrible person that's a 15 29 it's reclaimed it's very nice yeah whoa he's still standing up kind of oh my god yes and you have an entrapment arrow now oh shit fuck ah this was a good plan yeah 19 gonna wing it you can hold initiative just in case i'm going to push off and wait for grog so i'm holding my turn god yes you first or

have-- partial cover it don't matter i can ignore it i ignore three-quarters cover i'm awesome so that's double 1d-- i should have gotten some bonuses on that i'm an idiot plus five it's just double

fast god ah yeah that's gonna hit armor class sucks i'm at 39 i wanna say that's gonna hit i'm out okay percy being pummeled and pummeled again loses your gun falls from your hand as you slump to the ground your eyes roll back unconsciousness and darkness i'm sleeping thank you you suck oh wow i feel much better very happy today he's made it gurps in high school took a day it is it's working out i'm digging it i keep reading and finding things i'm not doing that could be more interesting so that felt great just google grog if i say it so you can understand it what's the point so many questions going so quickly and the kitty shirts were an accident this was not planned i played a lot in school other than matt i probably had the most experience playing d&d and playing roleplaying games so i was really excited by the gunslinger in pathfinder just 'cause it was something i hadn't done before so i found it the most interesting and unusual but i was not and i also felt it was a hole within the group that could be filled very well no someone asked how the group yeah is there still a cow in the bag as we've learned we do for tone17 i played a modified malkavian and a smetty if you can believe such a thing which was badass oh my god really i was a dragonborn paladin contraption that was such a good game for learning the basic mechanics such a well put together game laura was hyperventilating coffee i feel significantly more badass than my character if we had the power to bring one guest player for one session i would love to see joss whedon do this i admit i would like to see joss whedon play d&d that'd be interesting okay i'm throwing that one out there i ran a rifts game as well in high school then i ran a game of vampire the masquerade and i was in a bunch of them couple rounds of paranoia and hole because that's funny hole was amazing borderlands 2 and i'm happy-- i wear a codpiece i wear a codpiece that keeps everything in check human fighter hulk's on a scaling power level 'cause he just gets too mad well technically we already did if anyone would like to make us costumes tiberius would be mine i'd take tiberius i'm a wow player on occasion i haven't played in ages the day that bear dies it's gonna get ugly so much black to wear the demon-possessed royal family was my favorite yeah that was my favorite fight just using the light also we were shooting i was getting to shoot holes in the glass getting the magic carpet was also pretty badass was that on christmas yeah we had a whole little thing it was really nice mine's really old it's probably either monster or paranoia agent i'm gonna go that far back yeah all the way back saw a question about percy's home and his family percy has a really really big family that i don't mention in the video and he has not been home yet he has no interest in going home yet 'cause that's terrifying so we have not dealt with that the group's worst decision in d&d was the dragon i think grog you were still freaking out like a month later you were feeling really bad that's like star trek or star wars lord of the rings but i see game of thrones on the side we wouldn't have game of thrones without lord of the rings you said that that just came out of your mouth ooh you had me at marvel terrible idea i've got a sons of anarchy doctor who t-shirt i'm a really big fan of i'll wear it next week i like your shine on me shirt i love that you own the shirt from it they still haven't heard my favorite voice from this campaign yet 'cause we haven't gone back to the city yet that's so cool i think we should save that for wait until they actually meet gilmore not the gargoyle oh my god yeah i'm trying to catch up i like the little green gelatinous cubes i think they're fun and then if you make 'em right you can just make 'em out of jello and eat them when you're done that's awesome i know what you're talking about he works for us now wow you fell that's not surprising is that why you play so much war machine is because for once you don't have to be responsible gurps 13 i was yeah 13 years old gurps mansions of madness we played with scanlan of course we do it's hard not to think about it with sam that was a good video i have some videos of the tarot game and a couple of us he deserves a break seriously and for charity it's hard to read this quickly the world is cold and unfeeling triple threat saturday greater than three too forgot you speak-and-spell
