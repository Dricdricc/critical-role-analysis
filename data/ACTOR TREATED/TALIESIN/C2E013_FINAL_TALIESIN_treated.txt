make sure sam exits the plane first sam exits the plane first 14 i'm going to head up to the other side of the void yeah i’m going to sit there i'm going to start one of the blades up and i'm going to hold my attack for anything that crosses my path actually i'll say the minute i see something it's vicious mockery but we can't see him have i heard any of this happening or-- oh for gods' sakes i am going to run straight through the-- no i'm going to stay at the edge of this and i'm going to use vicious mockery (demonic voice) stop where you are yes that passes yeah blood maledict with the added-- disadvantage on that he still has disadvantage yeah i did no that was good if i run up behind it do i then get advantage because he's flanked i'm going to do that it's all nonlethal once you stabilize it after you put it down to the ground all right first strike with the-- no i know i'm paying attention first strike with the scimitar is a natural 20 does that do a thing then for him or is it just double damage okay nothing weird in that yeah no i miss things i don't get special damage to him do i so i don't have enough movement to go for another run in and if i can flank him great if not i'm still going to take my shot all right that's 21 to hit 22 oh god i don't get the d6 on that so that's five points of damage i'm going to bounce off the wall after the other one hit and spinning around and finally taking him and knocking him out with the little spike on the side of the sword right in the helmet someone go deal with beau i'm pulling the armor off did i feel anything when i hit it did it set off the blood hunter spider sense at all all right just curious i got 50 feet of hempen rope with beau's i was going to say with beau's rope because she's also got the hook there's no bows i'm going to put 116 platinum 12 gold 116 platinum we can't stay here we've got to move everybody who's looking for him thank you we can start heading back in our direction at the very least get further away from-- i don't know it seems kind of small doesn't it who are these people who caught this person would be another question they might ask we got to be careful no one is a hero for very long that was a metaphor do we need a little greasing there it is you just rolled over it oh for god's sakes you can't reason with angry people should i expedite this come on friend we just need to ask you a few questions and we'll let you be on your way as long as there's nothing too inappropriate happening devil's tongue wisdom save second level are you trying to weasel out of my-- or advantage so you get one more roll it's a wisdom save so it's ten plus my wisdom modifier so that's 13 we're not with the empire we're private individuals just trying to get by we wandered into a lot of chaos so we just want to know what we're getting wrapped up in right now what's the beacon it's right there is it important why i'm just trying to understand friend help me help you what is the beacon for the rebirth of what this all sounds very complicated to me i am personally of the opinion that we just let everything go my friends are your friends you're making a very very good argument and my friends are your friends we're all here to help sorry to tell you but i think your friend may have got hit on the end of something fierce and may not have made it i thought i saw someone fly by and take him out i'm sorry we're trying to fight corruption in this city in our own way we just need to know who we can trust and who we can't i know my vote but anybody else eh not our problem that's fair charm spells are mean like an hour i can do two people that's rude i'm going to start moving towards untying him unless anyone's got any-- if we're all good-- insight check do i get advantage because he's friends with me double insight that's not bad 21 personally this seems like more than i feel like taking on right now i say we walk away and you'll know that our silence means that we were trustworthy in the first place have you ever pawned anything before now we're getting silly he's not going to leave without the beacon did he get worried when we said we were going to take a look at it one more time agreed no you first i walk over and scrape my radiant sword against the orb just seeing just going to give it a little tap i’m not cutting it i'm just tapping it does the radiant energy have any effect on it what's your name again friend help us out here i'm molly and i-- give my friends more to go with give them something some reason to trust you to make sure that this is not going to come back and bite us in the ass i mean that's what we're looking for here is a reason for us to be able to walk away should send him to a monastery how did you lose the thing in the first place that you need to get it back by who i don't have any wizards well i have one wizard but-- well to be fair they are kind of arseholes how did they take it did they come to you sent by whom your empress which empress would this be i don't know anything it's part of my charm i say we give him his armor and that thing and be on our way this is none of our concern that could be funny too well we're not going to give it to you we're just going to leave it here i think that's fair we didn't give him anything we found him he attacked us we defeated him we walked about our way we don't know what he's going to do i'm all right with this anyone else unless you've got a strong opinion otherwise caleb on that thing unless you've got a strong opinion on that thing otherwise you don't have to stare at it some more if it's beyond you then it's beyond me i say we just let it go okay we're getting into singing no i'm calling it then just give him his bits give him just the armor we'll leave it right next to the bit there are good opportunities and bad opportunities and this one is giving me the vibration that perhaps we should just leave him be well he's going to be a little irritated at me in about half an hour i'm going to start fraying the rope just a bit so that it'll be breakable with a little bit of work are we off mm-hmm just give it a little-- i wasn't going to break it i was just going to fray it we were literally just doing that and boy i've got to tell you that you are really overestimating their fondness for me right now (laughs) your stuff's over there i'm going to say right now that was the easiest 20 platinum i've ever made in my entire life no that's fair i think he probably has some thing whatever they do why are you so keen on this one i mean that was a lot i don't want to get involved in that that's crazy let's roll do we want to end this really quickly we could go over and get involved in that since you seemed so keen-- marisha and oh now you don't want to but it wasn't he also technically memorized it bad at this shh (laughter) or you can take the lowest no okay ten no i'm standing with fjord in shock and horror i swear we just had this conversation what changed you can turn into an alley walking at a very gentle pace in that direction stay in school so sorry i'm so sorry oh goddamn it i've know you too long now i feel sick what a perfect stay in school moment i have a hooded lantern we can put it in in the meantime tinkerbell i like this plan we're going to see if we can find like a-- would they sell a lead box at a magic shop we need a safe is what we need let's hide it with the skeleton for now we’ll put some of your thread on it and that way it’ll be down there unconnected to us just in case someone finds it and if they do we’ll know the minute they touch it for now teamwork fine let's do this before we go in we're going to go to the basement i say we put it behind the skeleton do i get anything from it is it a normal human skeleton ten an alarm and a lock i like this plan it's a good plan i think we're going to need you upstairs for some identification i think it would be less suspicious sleeping down here so noted and if someone spies on it i don't want them to see you with it you can spy on anything i imagine i mean it's magic right is that really going to work it’ll take 20 seconds to get here from the second that alarm goes off one night well can i help with this yeah i can is this survival seven let’s put it behind the skeleton if i came down here i’d look in the crates it’s the first thing i’d do i look in the crate awesome nope never mind damn that was good thought though thread lock one of you if not both of you so we’re going to go in and out of this room several times tonight that in no way is suspicious but that’s fine i have had this roommate whoa there should be an annoyance check this is so great there's money and loot let's take a look we're going to want to take a look at these boots these daggers let's not be hasty well we're not going to speak of that in mixed company but they're dealing with other problems let's divvy up the loot i've worked it out that's 19 platinum apiece and two gold pieces apiece with two platinum left over mm-hmm mm-hmm mm-hmm yeah all right how do they look i think they clash a bit but-- no not really they're caffeinated sorry oh they're very comfortable and they keep everything else clean i'm playing with the longsword i'm going to parry boy that hits ow i hit her with the flat of the blade any effect any effect my god it works it's amazing you're a remarkable judge of character you know that i think what beau is trying to imply is-- i'm going to use something a little more basic do you know the story of the scorpion and the turtle and then what happens the scorpion rides on the turtle's back across a river the scorpion stings the turtle they both drown what is the moral of this story that's true but the full point of this and the point i'm trying to make is that with a group like this with very untrustworthy people you've got to trust each other-- because you have to trust somebody you can't trust not anybody because you're just alone we don't trust you you've tried to steal from us twice you've tried to steal from us not me us this is where the circle has to start we will support you in doing some ridiculous stuff but you have to keep it outside and that means sometimes you can't do the thing you want because it's going to be better for everybody else and sometimes everybody else is wrong but you have to go with it nothing there's been no earned trust-- i actually did take a crossbow bolt knocked myself unconscious trying to save your life i saved your life and it doesn't matter we start from scratch this is where it starts when we didn't want it so if you really don't trust us i'll happily take that 40 platinum back right now god you're making me agree with her see no we're in it for what we can all grab together that's how these things work this is why the circus worked this is why the circus was functional so do you think it would be a good idea to explain to him that he almost got himself killed tonight turning on a bunch of people he was working with he almost got himself killed tonight for nothing and you're not nearly as smart as you think you are i try not to have ideas about people they just get in the way if you do bring all of this stuff so he can actually do something useful no he created this situation i'm all right with this well we get to tell him now don't we and stop expecting people to earn things you just have to sometimes go with it we literally caught you stealing our stuff here's an extra platinum i did when they catch them stealing their stuff yes they do her fjord's stuff technically she was stealing here you can cast friends on me i'll tell you everything you want to know oh gods suddenly i'm compelled to answer everything truthfully oh no more of whatever you're drinking i can't help stop ack i feel that there was an extra platinum in there take the items and the unearned trust downstairs oh no that's coming too take the things we'll see you in a bit natural 20 you would think so but no i think they're doing something i heard something it sounded like a thump yeah that's something we can find out in the morning there's a way to do it we're going this way d10 no con modifier okay all right six huh all right we'll wait for you i'm going to wake up and go see what the girls are doing i'm going to point out because i took tough-- so i'm at 49 hit points but now i burn through more to use my swords trying to rip the cart off the dead horses i think we would need a proper smuggler for that a well-built cart with a secret compartment no i don't know a smuggler i don't know anybody in this city oh god we have some reading if you like i'm going to grab the copy of tusk love (laughter) bam bam that's a daycare i’m normally not impressed by eccentrics so this is really impressive it is we had the talk i’m willing to let it slide that’s fair ah sword boots daggers oh not right here of course i think that’s-- it could be dangerous it’s better if they initiate because then we learn information immediately that’s what i was thinking i was starting to go in that direction of is this a real thing this is clarota aftershock let's go shopping at pumat sol’s and then we’ll divvy up everything when we’re in private i think we’re probably going to need a couple of healing potions as well i’m going to window shop then thank you it was expensive greater healing potion yeah potion of healing careful if you’re filtering by type i was having a problem with that it's potion of healing it's black it's not green blue or purple it's black text it took me a second to realize i was doing a look around to see if there was anything new 12 the cloak was the most exciting thing wow ten episodes the bag this is really bloody heavy you could actually-- i know someone who might really enjoy this if you don't want it we took them all outside and they stayed there i think i know somebody who could really enjoy this and i'll hold on to it for a friend i think yasha might get a kick out of it i've known yasha a long time she makes her way back around we'll eventually need a bath and we'll find her again it’s worth holding onto i think i’m pretty good with this ugh i'm wondering if the guards are already there looking at the mysterious explosion that happened in that house oh sorry friend i've got one of those faces people tend to recognize oh i'll go with it lucien don't know you fuckers don't know shit so excited
