i did hi sorry for those of you on twitter you now know what i was just doing yes i'm going to be at oni con i'm flying to oni con in galveston texas at 630 tomorrow morning yay huzzah so you can see me at galveston texas between now and sunday i'll be there i'll be rolling around i'll be a little jetlagged it'll be great i do know sam got purpleheart since he's not here we can show it i am quentin quire kid omega of the x-men for those of you who read way too much x-men so this is my throw-together because he has a mohawk and so few people do the way you're putting that is a lot worse than actually-- i feel this is a little one-sided four yes doctor ripley professor anders i agree those eyes make you look far more sarcastic than you normally do (shouting) argh god (laughter) i don't entirely know where to begin it felt-- it didn't feel like a surprise i don't know it didn't feel good i was hoping it would i think i wanted him to recognize me kerrion i don't know i was hoping it would feel better a few years ago i had a dream i had a very intense dream and in this dream something asked me if i wanted revenge if i wanted the means to have revenge and all i would have to do in return is offer up the souls of those i took it was a dream it was just a dream i woke up in the morning with an idea and i built that idea i thought it was prophetic and lately i've been feeling a bit of strain and recalling it but it was just a dream it's not the first time i felt inspired in my life i just-- it wasn't real (sighs) maybe a year i was fuzzy at first i wasn't really me anymore i was a fisherman for a while i didn't do anything this was something to do with myself this was something to work towards i don't i don't know i've never thought about it it didn't matter i don't know what to do (sighs) when i started this i talked to a man at one point he was the captain of one of the vessels i was on i told him what i intended to do and i showed him what i was building and he said that if i really wanted revenge if revenge was what i was after that there would be no stopping it and there would be casualties along the way and i would have to give up things and i would have to hurt people and that was the price so that last barrel is because it's not just five names i know i'm going to have to keep hurting people and that this thing existing is just going to keep hurting people it's the knowledge that it never ends it's because i haven't just killed five people i've killed a lot of people on my way here i've killed them with you and it's to remind me that this is what i've chosen and i have tried to and i certainly have reason for these five names they are not good people these are not people who should be allowed to live i was hoping that once i'd finished serving revenge that perhaps i could serve repentance i no longer feel in control i no longer trust myself i wouldn't expect you to trust me but i trust you dice plus what for which persuasion and deception persuasion six deception two no i'm afraid i'm going to disappoint you i trust that you are all here in the service of justice and maybe friendship but i'm not i'm here for revenge and as much as i would like to believe otherwise i know that's not true and i think i need people here who are not here for revenge i don't know how to stop this no one does anything purely for one reason and i could justify it but i'd be lying i want to hurt them i want them to know it's me i want them to feel remorse for what they have done i want them to pay and if this thing is real if this is really what is happening now i hope that wherever they go they suffer forever and beyond and i'm so grateful there is justice to be found in it but it is not justice that i am motivated by and i couldn't pretend it would be i am so grateful there is justice in this but even if there wasn't i would still be here i've never had to think of this before i think if we get out of this either i'm going to need you to save me or finish me if it comes to it well i do want to save this city oh god i hadn't even noticed so sorry i will say it did get out of hand and if i had known then what i know now i would hope that you would restrain me in those moments where i seem to be going further than i should knock me out and take me to a temple i didn't know it was going to disappear to be fair i thought that maybe i could stop what was happening to me i panicked yes if i start to turn against you if you think for a moment that i am out of control please please do what is necessary the moment that i turn on any of you the moment that i even threaten any of you is a moment i am not in control no matter what is happening especially with the cough thank you i barely sl-- i don't i-- there's still two more lords in the city and there is the castle they know we're here now good idea have we been to the alcove yet we haven't been to the alcove or the barracks yet the barracks are right against the castle though yeah with keeper yennen the barracks will be our last stop i believe just because it's outside the city proper and it's up the hill we might be able to stay at the alcove which is a magic shop that used to be in town i know the proprietor or i did if he's still alive it was a magic shop right an arcane boutique we could get an early start once the light hits all right no that's fine actually can you move the wyrmwood box because all i'm-- we're sporking breaking in the new box dice in a box yeah 18 i'm an 18 it's as if the gods defy you 22 i have really good initiative i'll go first i'm going to try and break grapple obviously since that's what i have to do it's still at home acrobatics 28 so that's my action but if i now spend an action surge i can get an action do i get three attacks with the sword i just picked up since i'm too close to use my gun right now i'm going to draw the rapier that i just picked and start stabbing at the terrible thing all the while screaming (screams) the butt flap of my soul is down i'm well-dressed at the moment yes so i get a negative two to attack so i get a plus one to attack on top of my-- minus one not minus two got it that's 25 that's a one misses and that's a 14 dex thank you so that's 1d8 plus dex that's a nine (yells) (yells) don't sound so upset about it like a rhinestone cowboy wow i want to tickle you see what happens it's never going to stop being funny there will be a pajama night for christmas the 20 hits the 15 does not 19 hits against the wall is it true that we can't kill it except with sunlight i'm going to hack at his neck with my sword a couple of times 28 22 22 ten points 15 points ten points i'll back away from it that does not hit i'm going to really quickly also do a second wind i think we should probably just kill it urine flying everywhere let's have a full rest they don't know where we are yet we killed everybody can we tunnel our way to the tree i'm agreeing with the women because i want to live to see the morning and all the wine we stole we stole a lot of wine and try and relax wisdom saving or just wisdom eight marisha and fuck you matt am i still coughing that mustache is getting very iffy i have a very low wisdom and i rolled really badly why don't we seem all of us so we can go take a look around while you talk to-- and we have the earpieces i have one now i have the hat of disguise on underneath just so even if it drops i'm still not me where should we meet we've got the earrings so once we find a place we'll let you know if everything goes wrong we meet back here in two hours otherwise check in every 30 minutes do we need a code word no the four of us are sticking together i thought trinket the donkey we'll go to the alcove he can only tell them what we look like if he's a very clever artist what part of town is the alcove was it the north the east or the west manor eastern manor yes we're looking to buy a few things and we were wondering-- actually i used to do business with simon is simon around he was called away on a special project what sort of special project he lives at the castle oh we're actually looking for something a bit more complicated and a little more dangerous i don't know what that is let me show you and i'm going to walk over to the wall find a dusty wall and i'm going to trace the symbol on the wall i'm going to wipe it away we're hoping that we could purchase a brief amount of sanctuary we need to keep moving so that they don't catch us can i try and pour on top of it not all of them i can't drop the seeming can i i was wondering if you were about to do it can you do it simon whisk was a good friend to percival fredrickstein von musel klossowski de rolo iii percival fredrickstein von musel klossowski de rolo iii percival lives and he's coming i will make sure that you are compensated when this is over can we sleep here for the night we have spoken to him we will speak to him again today good day everyone let's meet over at the lady's chamber once you're finished with your business what sit in the back i do i speak celestial i think we do maybe he talks to us i try and catch his attention we follow that could be inferred what happened last time who was your informant what did they find underneath whitestone do i recognize this person i remove my hat hello archie not so sweet these days i did not think you would have lived it was difficult leaving my friends are strong who else survived i may have a plan how fares professor anders he lives in the house in the east house in the north lady ripley lives in one of those mansions who lives in the third house we burned one of them which of the two is reviled most i have a plan well that's part of the plan here's my plan what do you think of a distraction what if there was a way to start a ruckus at the vedmeyer estate start a fire maybe start a ruckus of some kind the third house they're going to be waiting and expecting us so if they think we're attacking one of the houses and then instead we attack the other while everyone's rushing to deal with what they think is the next attack we attack the second home and then when they prepare for us to attack the third home that's when we attack the castle today it's just one we've already dropped one will it put my sister in danger they don't know that i know she's alive perhaps keep her just to surprise me it's a part of it definitely i want them to know they need to know yes from a distance we pick a fight with a house from a distance so we can get to the other house and pick a fight there but you can also do this from a distance so we can get you far away you could do both and i'm going to give you a second arrow as well the arrow it's an arrow you know what it will do to the roof if it works okay cool we're going to do this now actually we may not need it yet that may actually work out well once we've-- once it's up can you actually write it in smoke coming off the house really so the northern house or the western house so this is the mess and this is our actual you're the mess so probably from about here you can do it from the other house it's sight-based you're a little boy we're making very reasonable plans with this i have put my hat back on yes not anymore i'm not that would excite you i don't know why i thought you went to shoot the arrows in the other house all at the same time then on the count of three i'll also go around back can we see any of the damage is there any smoke rising from the house yet is there anybody else in story mode of minecraft that we should mention now you know our pain we heard your voice at target we were walking through target and were like hey guys you started talking at us--
