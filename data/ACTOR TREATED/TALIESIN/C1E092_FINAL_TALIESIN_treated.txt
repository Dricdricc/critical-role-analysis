a predator bottle opener primal yeah right there this is going on my chicken coop man my brother was singing the praises of this box this week oh no does it do-- it turns into a dinosaur the box turns into a dinosaur i'm going to see if i can do this really really quickly so you're going to do a loot crate ad man it's pretty short and you can do it during the break maybe yeah it's pretty short pretty easy thank you eric loot crate yeah we don't actually have a-- that happened we don't actually have a subject yet we're going through and taking suggestions from twitter and from the chatroom but we will have that probably figured out i'm going to guess tomorrow and probably a graphic on monday but wednesday 12 to 2 we're talking comics and it's going to be fun so we'll just-- come and join us and we'll chill (accent) talking comics you got dis what what happened how'd it go i'm not entirely sure i mean they didn't react-- did they react strangely to you when we came into the bar no i think that's actually very impressive it is actually a process of divination technically that's just very-- somehow you wandered right back to it no she was going to research the notion of other options other than dealing with the deal we have downstairs all right e-r-i-n-y-e-s air-in-es well do you still want to look into other options or do we want to just-- we could take the deal we could reverse the deal it's very impressive i would also like to point out that the definition of 'research' in this instance is just reading the notes that i took last week reading and doing actual research you did you did reading of the notes i wrote i don't feel like i should have lost that one (sighs) was it actually an imp imps are very common everyone's being watched it's a city under surveillance gold armor or wasn't that the one at krieg's house which one did we see was it just-- i don't-- oh in the basement oh my god that was a long time ago that's like seven haircuts ago i'll trade you something for it my glasses it was worth-- the joke was worth the ring alone i would imagine we were going to give it back we just want to see it can i aid with a history or religion as well can i help with him with that history or religion all right an 11 on top of that so-- it is the symbol of asmodeus i would have instantly recognized it at this point you of course you were going to say asmodeus because it's like written six times in my notes and i'm literally staring at a sketch of it in my notes i'm going to take a long look at this thing is this some sort of mark of-- is this a marker some sort of favor marker is this a signet of stature is this a-- you don't just put this on anything all right yeah please oh yes please it's a nose ring i think that it is in fact a-- some sort of-- i don't know it's a-- napkin ring (laughs) for tiny napkins that's fine i don't care oh object scry there is a spell that does that though-- object history the symbol on this object though is more or less the ruler of this dimension so it could be useful for something i was actually thinking the same thing i don't understand how that was-- the owner of this establishment we're staying in works for a man he doesn't like is curious what would happen if he wasn't working for that man if he was suddenly for reasons unavailable and for that we would probably be arrested if we dealt with it inappropriately and we would be in a position to be-- make our enemy accessible i suppose we have to be a bit cagey there are ears apparently everywhere even here as actually-- strangely excited by that plan as i am-- well where we need to be yeah out never came up you're our out we leave all of this behind once all that's taken care of at this point we have no other plan they're all pieces of shit the only problem i have with it-- -- and the only reason i'm even being vaguely hesitant about any of this is because they're all pieces of shit including the one that we're making any sort of bargain with and they are professional bargainers and i know we're missing something i don't recall-- so i said i would have it within a day or so if i recall-- and if we're going to decide to trust him we could also show him the ring and see what he makes of it this never ends well let's forego disguises we're going to just drain ourselves the more we pretend to be something we're not and obviously it's not helping us not attract attention well we could-- keyleth could keep her wings and armor and they'd be probably possibly less likely to question any of us if we're walking around with someone of reasonable stature yeah then we're all dead i would say it would be safe to assume that a prison in hell would be so big that there would be sayings such as 'as big as filling-- try attempting to fill a prison in hell' i feel like this is just-- i think we're like walking into idioms at this point wait for it wait for it we don't have one starting to crack a bit (laughter) i vote we take the deal i say we take the deal at sundown all right no i was just swinging i swing back i said i'd take the day either way i'm entertained nothing but winners oh boy if we're going to go outside and take a look around i think now is the time to do it do we want to show our friend downstairs our ring all right heavy is the head that wears the crown (laughter) they would never believe it if you told them if you feel it start to fade we'll find some cover and let you-- -- do your thing i don't think i don't think that anybody here is necessarily against duplicity i just think they're against duplicity against them whomever they serve we'll pop it over-- pop it out if we need a 1984 metal magazine so if anyone asks we belong to her is this just to peruse i was really enjoying miming reading i'll be fine i can do this really okay no okay well carry on let's walk about while we do this i will read out important things-- oh i can't walk with this can i i have to leave this on the table i can actually faff all of this you are an evil person yes all right this contract binds the scribe and recipient into a deal-- -- of chosen escalation for an unending period of time or this contract is voided by an agreement on the part of both parties upon agreeing to and signing this contract the recipient is bound to their agreed obligations and parameters within the first pact as is the scribe upon completion of the agreed obligations and parameters on both sides of the initial pact the first pact is considered complete and concluded the contract as a whole remains until the predetermined period of eternity allowing the recipient should they feel inclined to invoke and trigger the second or third pact any time thereafter through verbal acceptance in relative proximity of this contract the obligations and parameters agreed upon within the second or third pact then become binding and immediate to be fulfilled on part of the both parties within an agreed-upon period of time upon completion of the agreed obligations and parameters on both sides of the second or third pact that pact is considered complete and concluded this contract remains in effect through all pacts and thereafter maintaining any agreed-upon specifications and obligations that remain outside of a pact's completion for eternity (big inhale) any violation of this contract on the part of the scribe immediately holds this contract null and void requiring a penalty payment of 15000 gold pieces to the recipient to be paid immediately any violation of this contract on the part of the recipient immediately locks the claim and ownership of the everlasting soul of the recipient invoking the laws of this pact primeval under the control and dominance of the scribe for all eternity sending the soul of the recipient immediately upon death to the scribe to do with as they see fit first pact the scribe --your name here ipkesh-- -- agrees to enable safe passage into the depths of mentiri specifically the bastion of flesh unharmed bastion of flesh the recipient-- your name here-- agrees to be the instrument of assassination leading to the death of-- utugash -- or should-- a name i will not say out loud-- the herald of --something i will not say out loud-- with the revealing or leaving of evidence that could connect or incriminate the scribe in an act or reasons for the act yes in perpetuity though so the second pact is we get a bunch of stuff but we have to do what was it the-- agrees to introduction and installation of at least two of-- okay and then the third pact is our soul our soul for somebody else's life and the first pact the scribe enables safe passage into the depths of mentiri specifically the bastion of flesh unharmed i feel like that's a little thin (percy voice) i feel like-- i feel like the first pact's a little thin (laughter) that's fair (chuckles) do they have a branch here i was strangely hoping that your father's lawyers had a branch here that would be-- i suppose that is a growth industry this is interesting i'm going to think it over i'm going to leave it and we'll be back in the evening i thank you for your time and patience don't yell here we're going to get mugged aren't we (laughs) well let's take a look around i think indifference is the common courtesy here to an awful lot the mentiri is the prison that's the part of the prison prison has parts 25 minutes 25 minutes until your spell is dissipated but once it is we can do locate person he had a cloak did he not i'm also getting in on that i'm looking for anything of value never mind i want to go in it's not tary we have to give him a name everyone use code names that's the most you thing i have seen happen all game yrat what are we calling the two of you that's somehow worse all right what no bill and ted all right wode and wade my word freddie minxie this is happening quickly as we enter the shop we all enter the shop charming jared i think we should allow this poor creature an attempt to redeem himself what is it that you sell here that would please our mistress please impress us what do you have that's unique expensive is lovely don't get us wrong but we're looking for unique odd so proud of you right now we found a single walkie-talkie is it working right now we hear you utter our description to anyone and you will never see anything again we've got plenty perhaps you would like to shift back to your normal form that number does not please the mistress i don't think does it wow take a slightly different route back just to try and see more can you scry him since you've seen him before let's scry ourselves a chain devil wode it's cool brah party on wade let's scry yeah who cares what is the vassalage that is a good question shit no i have a very active imagination when i eat i say we take the contract i'll take the contract i'm the one who's already touched by demonic forces i think i can resist the temptations of the second and third pact and i think i know what to add to this i think we need to demand a guide and i think we need to demand safe passage out of the prison as well and back to our original plane as best he can all right (laughter) we don't actually have it with us we'd have to go downstairs but i will-- yeah i'll say-- i feel my weaknesses in my heart and i know where they lie and i definitely know they exist and i-- nothing in this agreement tempts me i have temptations but they are not in this contract i think so and i'm already-- i don't know what's going to happen to me when i die we were messing with you-- -- but if you feel the urge to actually take it upon yourself-- how so no actually not on that one i'm not going to say that i'm never going to do anything stupid again and i certainly wouldn't necessarily want you to stop me if i were but i'm not going to do this sort of stupid am i i'm pretty sure it doesn't if i die before it's finished-- then yes but if i don't complete the third pact or if we don't activate the second or the third pact then i'm fine-- yeah then there's no problem whatsoever oh yeah if we do not kill who we're supposed to kill or if it leads back to him then i'm-- to be fair we're already here you know it's entirely possible that there'll be several creatures fighting over my body when i die and my soul when i die already bless you but no seriously i don't know what any of this means well you'll already be here so we won't die and actually it's not that clear what would happen if i died without completing the contract i might just get brought back so yep i'm going to go down i'm going to sign it we're doing it some quick questions-- i need a guide someone who while is not connected to you can help us find our way through the city find what we need answer questions somebody with a little bit of the lay of the land somebody to help not with the actual act obviously but just to run us around what happens to our soul-- what happens to my soul if i die in the process of this and if we don't complete the contract then-- are they in breach or just me perfect safe passage into the bastion of flesh once we're there we're on our own with access to our foe can it be arranged in writing i would be very pleased if we could complete this contract if this contract becomes null and void not with us getting to the bastion of flesh but with our return to our plane with our enemy harmed we get what we want you get what you want not we get towards what we want you get what you want that is a question for the ages isn't it (laughter) you'll help us arrange our own passage-- we have a way out of this material plane we just need to make sure that we're-- is there anything in the prison that would not allow us to leave under our own power do they take our possessions before we go in there that would be-- quite pleasing that will do you do not have knowledge of whether or not our magics will work in that prison that's fair that seems fair i suppose the last question-- and this is just my last addendment is that we own an artifact of this plane we would like it if possible to be identified and for you not to speak to anyone of what we have or what it's worthwhile and to keep our presence-- confidential as much as we keep yours confidential mutual confidentiality i want to-- can i show him the ring grog would you-- greg could you please show him-- i have to sign it with my own name i imagine anyway-- can you show him the-- your piece fair last question the final question how powerful is the herald of vassalage we would have to get into his stronghold and this creature itself a horn devil what is this 'we' what's another dead pit fiend in hell what about the bastion of flesh all right i'm signing i check to see his name is it his real name that is signed mm all right not the full name but enough oh no wait it's happen-- no i'm not doing that no i've actually finished it what's a devil to a man who fears no god whitney warned me it would come to this it's my sister you never met her any advice would be welcome we want what you want would you know where to get a silence spell out of curiosity one would be-- two would be even more helpful make-- make the-- the weird little magnet things happen and take the survey if you have a moment oh man i for one am going to have some sleepy time tea warm milk of the damned that'll do wisdom saving 19 do we have any souls is it not that bad or is it just slightly above awful okay put some hot water on it and-- that's fair i'm going to use the gun barrel to sear it a bit you'd like to try my eraser don't speak so loudly i didn't say not to whisper act natural yes don't act natural be as cool and calm as possible that's the spirit just like that any luck on those other materials silence spell or two how many of us then you'd be down a spell do you think that sounds like a reasonable plan or do you think that's-- are we doing it now or later this is us looking at silence spells with advantage 30 natural one there was something about that coffee cup being there there we go i turn and break away from the group and head in a slightly different direction for a moment and sit and nurse my elbow and try and just look like i'm dealing with my medical issue and really try to look like i didn't notice the thing that's watching me now meh deception nine do i have any of the soul-- one moment i'm going to pull out a piece of the soul the edible soul and just about to eat it i'm trying something i've got the shard of soul out the soul shard giving it a smell and i'm going to not quite loudly but with a bit (disgusted sound) and i'm going to huck it in the other direction with distaste can we try and give it the slip it won't work i'm going to dust myself off and try and just meander into a shadow i still have pass without a trace i'm going to see if i can just vanish stealthily i am being actively watched i'm also going to-- can i also use my boots of spider walking to see if i can crawl off the street a little bit and see if i can-- disadvantage i hate disadvantage so much that's cocked it doesn't matter though it's awful yeah never mind i fail i'm just-- i'm going to keep talking over the headphones trying to keep up with where everyone else is but walking off a block in the hopes of sort of bullshitting my way through this do i recognize what this specter entity is i'm going to try and keep pace with that thing is it following me i just had five of the worst rolls i've ever had in a row that was just ugly there was just ugliness happening and i don't feel it's gone yet it's not the dice it's in me shut up thank you i'm going to take this opportunity to try and turn another corner 23 better 27 no tell doty to get in tell doty to get in maybe yes perhaps we should bend them back can doty put it back magic carpentry well that's my kind of ridiculous i think this is a brilliant opportunity what before we do this can we have a ten-minute discussion about whether or not to-- there's actually three more guests still waiting in line i'm going to gingerly go over and very quietly say we are a remarkable opportunity if you're willing to be quiet and maybe have a little faith in the truth in this very dark place heal her that is the most condescending hmm i think i've ever experienced let's put it this way we're sneaking into this unholy compound in dis basically a city of hell to do something inappropriate we find you tied to a table we figure that maybe you're in the mood to -- who put you here 18 28 can you point to me on the map okay i'm going to do a couple things blow the cover for ev-- well i'm going to take my movement to run around him and shut the door using my boots 'cause my boots are already active oh it's too big oh okay hold on then i'll-- you know what i'll do the acrobatics roll to try and shut the door and-- that'll do 22 i'm going to take three slashes at him with my sword disadvantage on the attack rolls but i am prone okay so attack number one that don't matter 28 just do attack number two that's 15 and uh 24 got two hits with the-- what's-- these two hits so that's-- i'm using a sword not a gun so that's-- that's 18 points of damage 18 points of damage and you know let's just burn a little bit of electricity too just to hurt him as well that's everything combined and then let's do a-- where is-- here we are let's do a-- where is the damage 1d6 lightning so let's just burn two charges of that as well i'm out of d6s for some reason that i cannot comprehend thank you and let's add five points of lightning damage to that as well do i get an attack of opportunity disadvantage or no point of random order before he runs-- random point of order isn't this a surprise round damn it he noticed us okay never mind end this (whispers) drag him back in here that may be the end of the-- oh nope not can grog not see to the right of him yet yeah okay you know we have ear pieces we can just talk to each other you are aware bring him back in what's to my right a hallway and a doorway you know i don't think i'm very useful for what they're doing right now so i'm just going to do a little bit of a poke around over there to see what's happening and listen what am i going to do shoot a gun right now you can't do that that's not how this works that's not how any of this works those cages are empty and that chest is closed that one i look around i'm going to run through into that smaller room on the other side i crawl up on the wall because i can and watch in horror we gotta eventually get a candle on this a handle and a candle that was helpful that was two out of four possible answers really don't google that shh go to sleep go to sleep oh tutonka i know tutonka are we still in combat mode right now i want to check out what's still covered by dark very gently i'm staying at the back i didn't have a chance to peek inside any of those doors did i peek in through the window of any of those doors did i slew peed on before it looks like a happy little robot from up top cool cool could've been drinking in a bar like a normal person but no tied to a chair uragash night
