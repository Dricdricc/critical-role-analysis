oh god not really okay no how are you doing this okay yes yes yes ♫ bum bum bum ♫ well done good call travis hosted by brian wayne foster or two three biscotti islands literally the first thing they teach you ah i heard your name whatever they're saying i heard your name what language were you speaking goddamn it i don't know that one try not to do it-- well-- that's an improvement that's impressive let's not get ahead of ourselves i'm going stay and keep an eye out on deck that's how you get a pinhead man nope (laughter) i've got nothing man i don't even know how much chocolate have you been eating and for how long whoa oh wow how deep are these waters i'm trying to figure out how much of this is-- obviously a lot of this is bullshit all right 22 yeah even just general vibe all right everything's been-- a little omission maybe all right i honestly think we need to feed you something that isn't chocolate that's a squirrel i know that one squirrels are great i was just about to go get something with something that's not chocolate in it that's probably for the best i'll be back oh boy i'm coming up with a veggie plate by the way the sort of things you're embarrassed your parents bring up and putting it down do you have any future plans here is there something that you're moving towards do you have a place that you're heading a goal anything that's great you're doing great then but there's a direction a cardinal direction that you're making these friends in or do you-- oh would you look at that you mind if i take a look at that really quick you can roll it it's all right i'm going to try to move some stuff and see what happens oh man awesome oh no damn it was almost a natural one i'm so sad that's a six huh that's really cool though i imagine doing that all day that'd be great yeah i can imagine doing that all day wow rolls really well too i'm sorry i don't actually even remember why i asked for it oh that's fancy there was a twirl and it went back i'm going to detect magic to get a-- yeah okay no one's got anything sitting on her okay same vibe those were all over it then this is apparently a mary poppins musical act calligraphy's very impressive caleb just a second just thought you should know there's a couple interesting magical auras on our new friend i thought it would be impolite to point it out or to dispel anything i try and respect people's personal intentions but if you feel the urge to do a little identify at some point that may not be a bad idea i don't know just to make sure that everything that's there is meant to be there i'm not getting a bad vibe off of this one just a lot of sugar being held up for a while in a dark confined space can make people a little loopy no i also agree i think it draws an unfortunate amount of attention (laughter) that's fair that's a very fair point i don't know if she's necessarily going to listen to you she's a little-- that's very true you do have an air of authority you do right now i'm feeling really awkward about this whole conversation purely from your face your face has done nothing and now i'm just-- that weirdly makes me feel better i'll disengage straight up then that's fine i'm going to go over and cook something i'll be finishing up some stuff in the kitchen i'm going to run by caleb one more time to have a chat about what he saw just mention we've got two magical spheres on board the one's like a clock thing-- technically three i was thinking it's like a clock maybe that means time-- i don't know if time's passing or something or at least let you take a look at it for a while or something maybe i don't know it gives me a chill not sure this is dark even for me this is dark i'm finally walking in because everybody has vanished off the ship and no one is eating anything what are we-- okay i like grabbing feet here we are oh yep i'm on it wow that's cool do that again the fourth wall lies i'm excited (english accent) don't touch it mum it's evil the two corpses what can we ascertain about them are they wearing clothing nudists get trapped in here all the time i want to be by the corpses i rolled a 19 that was not a sick beat do they look like violently ended or do they look like people who fell asleep and never got up yeah 19 they definitely got a look like they saw something wicked awful let's take a minute before we-- just going to do a quick cure wounds just one oh that's good take 13 points of healing let's take a second here i think we should-- i think we should talk to the locals before we do anything else oh these fellows oh i can't pick somebody else pick i don't know yeah i don't know yeah okay that's level three right yep there we are speak with dead i'm so sorry friend you have one more task to perform before we can let you rest what killed you the wailing creature what color was the curtain the wailing creature hid behind good to know how did you end up here what's the name of that-- what does the name halas mean to you well that's no help do you know how to get out of here i'm going to give him a little pop and seed him for later mm-hmm thank you well that was a little helpful maybe they're all bad so we already know what two of these are i feel like i was told as a child not to put things in my ears but i guess i'm doing this i wonder what's behind green sound a beam there's a screech there's a gas i don't know what goes next feels a bit extreme that says that the door is trapped not necessarily that the door is unopenable i mean there's a lot going on right now i'm going to double-check these bodies for things before we go if anyone wants to help me with an investigation check-- sure seems that they were robbed before they came in here it's weird oh that's even crazier i mean we did just cause a giant lightning thing i feel like our presence has been announced i'm going to light up my staff at any rate although we should probably have someone check ahead just for traps nope yeah but we'll know it's there just in case oh well then never mind i was making light i mean can you see anything beau i'm going to roll eyes of the grave too just to see if anything-- i'm rolling eyes of the grave just for the hell of it i'll be after beau i'm paying attention (singing) tiptoe through the tulips or we are i'm going to try and use thaumaturgy through the door to see if i can affect the flame before we enter well that's weird we're not in there yet no i was just curious if the magic would follow through apparently not or whatever is in there is not real i don't know 24 so many toys today hey oh (oohing) i love a good ladder i'm going to try the candelabra again see if i can get those flames a little brighter i'll reel them back in all right that's good to know i'm going to maybe throw some illumination up so we can see the window a bit better yeah i was going to say i was actually thinking about getting up i would like that that weird corner ladder yeah i like a good loft position since i was a kid my favorite thing can we see his feet i would check for things but okay let's all just be very careful before we do anything for pete's-- sacred flame three there's a long sigh at the beginning of the round this is a death trap this is a fucking death trap i'm going to hit it with sacred flame going to hit this guy with a sacred flame yep dexterity saving throw nah i didn't think it would be that's not bad that's 14 points of damage spit it out come on yeah let's all maybe be a little more careful about the-- is there anything i see on the top of these cabinets there's all this space above and i want to see if there's anything-- all right come on i'll take that that's a 17 hey-- oh god everybody's-- twiggy can you grab that stack of books over there and throw them at caleb or take a look at that let's take a look at these let's look at this lock see if it seems trapped or something or i don't know here wipe it on this that's okay hey caleb what's the title of the first book that we opened by the way not opening it just looking at the-- that's very interesting maybe here let's bring it down to the table and we'll open it from a distance i'm taking a look at that other book really quickly as well yeah i can try i'm going to try i'm trying to cast light on the other side of the glass on the glass on the other side of the glass no i can throw it is it a touch spell yeah you are not wrong yeah i can't put it on the other side of the glass because i can't touch the other side of the glass probably i'm going to head over towards that other ladder really quickly well there's that weird desk behind there have we looked in that desk that's behind the-- yeah what was in there maybe i'll try dispel magic why the fuck not i cast dispel magic on the desk give it a go i'll head up to the stained glass let's take a look to see if there's anything in that desk i'm grabbing the debate book and we're looking at that desk and then we're taking off completely goddamn it i give up let's go find everybody yep this place is weird i did grab the debate book i like that you never check for traps it really adds to the unknown been fun kids oh boy turn it around this way oh boy there's a lot happening here i think manifest and then on the top of its turn it's both oh boy i think we went-- we may have-- 19 oh boy 18 oh wow fuck it i'm going to try it i'm going to try to cast bane on this thing is that insane i don't know if that's insane it's a 16 charisma that may be insane that means attacks and save rolls are now a d4 negative all right okay i'm going to turn invisible i'm going to run towards-- actually i'm closer to that hallway yeah i see them over there i'm going to run towards that hallway full speed this one yep wow that was a roll that's a lot of rolling right now matthew okay i saw a bit of this go down nope i'm back lightning-- i was basically going to try this before anyway i'm going to start heading so i can get a better view towards the edge of there yeah just so i can hold if i need to yeah there's no caleb i'm going to yell duck and i'm going to ready a shot of sacred flame actually sacred flame's not a bolt it's an appearance i'm going to hit sacred flame on the crystal on the one behind us the one at the end of the-- behind fjord hmm weird all right that's my turn fudge no no no is the dragon the closest to it i mean-- 19 goddamn it yeah that hits ten points 11 points ten points and i'm on fire yeah is it a straight d20 oh 19 on fire thank god minus a d4 just in general fuck yeah bane yeah i'm on fire can i do anything about that that's okay six points of fire damage is fine i'm going to book it towards that fucking altar that's 30 i can spend an action to go but people are still fucking down aren't they fudge i'm going to do something dumb don't leave a man behind i'm going to-- this is going to get weird halfway through my run actually right before i start my run i'm going to cast meld into stone laura and it's not concentration casting meld into stone so that when i end my turn in theory i will not be on fire any more because i'll be inside of the stone thank you yeah i'm actually just going to walk-- i go and i'm going to take my 30 feet straight towards the wall i can't see anything but i can move i'm going to walk all the way i would know how the spell-- i'm going to get as much movement as i can and then hold for the turn we are making some interesting calls tonight it's exciting you got a shortbow does it get an attack of opportunity you also still have this i think just in case that's another roll if you need it we're hoping oh boy i'm going to-- oh fuck she's not there is she i'm going to come out of the wall i see them hmm yeah no and i'm going to do the we're running it's bad i'm going to-- i am going to-- i'm going to use my action since there's no one to heal-- ah deborah and which is really frustrating and there's not a lot i can do i am going to-- fuck man this is such a bad call i am going to cast-- so sorry i'm doing this weirdly-- i'm going to cast-- where is it goddamn it where did it go i'm going to cast blindness on the dragon it's a 16 constitution with a negative d4 oh wait i can't do that actually never mind it's not but i can't do it because i don't have any 3rd-level spells left oh it's a 2nd-level i'm a crazy person yes it's not a concentration spell you are blind for a minute i'm going to take the rest of my movement and hop into the fucking orb the bane does fade matt and i made sure you saw it i was yelling at you and making a fuss are you okay oh god come on god fucking damn it oh my god oh my god fuck i am ready with stabilization magic for everybody everybody's going to be fine she could have grabbed him worst case scenario goddamn way to go that's-- did you get anything from him yeah aw man i wouldn't touch that that's a lot yeah if you stick around i'm going to be helping every-- i'm doing a thing okay 23 points to everybody who's hanging around for a few minutes 23 points sometimes mysterious spheres just happen to you if i'm learning anything i mean maybe sure lets pack some food and some tea and stuff before you go you're going to need some-- yeah i'm going to go get some food oh that's weird yeah i'm probably going to come out about halfway through your shift with a pot and two cups another day weirdly i think i'm great yeah i know no well in the morning we're going to comfort everybody we're going to take care of them we're going to feed them it's going to be our job to feel good for them and bring them back around they did good work they just don't believe it something's happening i don't know what but something's happening and you did good thank you do better next time to keep everybody safe you had some weird-ass spells up right you had some weird-ass shit that i didn't know about i saw them but i never really poked you don't have to tell me what it was did you have some weird shit that if i had prodded it would have been a thing all right okay let's just do that then
