pissblossom it's like the kids' choice awards for adults we'll plug our other friends who are also nominated i have never cared so much about football in my entire life as i do right now which is saying i don't necessarily care a lot but definitely-- i think he's lighting the set on fire no announcements until i get back i think zahra it occurs to me you come from a family with power connections well we're looking for any ally we could and we were curious if-- i had a feeling it just felt worth asking is kashaw around by any chance as well kashaw is kashaw around yes of course we have to send a letter to the slayer's take at some point that should happen sooner rather than later trying to wrangle a beast or seeing if they know of anything that's in the vicinity that we can at least feed to it in the meantime i would hope so to get to the next vestige and to perhaps make some friends the more the merrier we have a sigil we can teleport this is a teleport sigil this is not going to require his attention so we need him but he can do it the worst job in whitestone that's an awful long time talk to the slayer's take and see what is already on the continent no we want to find a creature that would threaten a medium-sized city we want to wear it down a bit before we go in for the attack we want it to be breathing heavily we're going to find something that's already on the continent he will be happy to attack it yes six people cannot wage a war we're going to send them a letter yes we're going to make kashaw take the letter it would probably kill the dragon i was going to find kashaw and see if he would run the letter to the slayer's take and be our emissary and convince them to do this so that we're not doing everything ourselves literally everyone if we could find a child in a pub who could take it kashaw is possibly slower than a child just to get rid of him they would say yes strapping the strapping age no they started they are working on it now i'd buy that yes it was proposed well we're going to have to if we leave the city anyway this is not an army this is something for the population to do while they pass time the dragon shows up they're all going to die no matter how many times they learn how to put the spear forward and it's convincing the slayer's take to join we're going to have to bring them some dragon parts ooh that's very clever we could sell tickets kashaw how would you like to be anywhere else other than here right now that's exactly the sort of enthusiasm i was hoping for we have need of an emissary to the slayer's take we need to convince them to help us kill the next dragon she does we are in your debt i'll have the paper drawn up and anything you can do to put the weight of the situation behind us and make sure they know how clear it is and how necessary this is and how desperate we are and we'll figure out ways to make sure there's money in it for them or at least dragon parts excellent and white dragonhide we have white scales mostly i was thinking of also offering them whatever we can take from the dragon itself once it's destroyed we keep some scales we keep some teeth we split it i like this i'm going to have it drawn up i'm seeing this going down i've walked away oh this is going to be awful wow that is cruel first rule of fight club what are the chances i would have at least a basic portable writing desk they're not that complicated 16th century-style just something to write on just something with paper pen and something to write on it's basically a fucking clipboard no it was called a writing desk back then it was called a writing desk there's a thing it was that big and you put it on your lap it was a writing desk i'm writing the letter up i've basically gotten it together i've explained the situation briefly i assume they're aware of the war and the current reality i'm getting there in this i'm asking for their assistance in killing a dragon for this assistance they will get all bounty of biological remnants of the dragon with a small percentage of scales and teeth kept for us asking for 20 percent but negotiable we want them to supply either a local or give some intel into where we can find a beast large enough for this dragon to attack information that we have on this dragon so that they actually help us strategize any ways of defeating it and any other help that they could give in defeating this creature and as a token of our goodwill we are sending them a small package of black and white dragon scales and a dragon tooth there's more for stuff it's in the letter is there a way to enchant me so that i have his voice and then he'll listen more closely don't answer that there's a rider at the end of everything i send no mention of whitestone oh the rock that's a really good idea no we'll leave the rock here i see it every time he does he smolders oh we're leaving today we'll get our luck back tomorrow it came at such a high speed i wish it came so quickly anyway back to the game how many cups are currently sitting with the teapot cabal's ruin druhah thanks or a little water let's go talk to jarett we'll have appropriate clothing set up and prepare ourselves for the trip in theory we all have water skins don't we it would have been in a tale of a one-eyed merchant would they have been in the walls is it possible to be in the walls of ank'harel we'll make waves well we're going to have to get someone's attention i am absolutely not let's go change and then let's be off i think that once we arrive he'll find us or she can i point out that now we have to learn an entirely new lore we've worked so hard and now spices rivers canals fusaka oh god i'd gotten everything together and now it takes a day to do disneyland we'll run into a lot of common common is common for a reason wow yeah whitestone is not functioning trade them for water you stabbed her bear while maintaining eye contact we're changing out of the winters into the lighter clothing it's a shame kit's very busy or else we could get summer clothes getting married or something okay actually there is a solution for this i'm going to find him a white silk and cotton linen cloak very simple to throw over his armor the way the templars used to do so you won't cook in your bloody armor yes it'll attach to the sachet yeah it's just a heat sink well let's go i'm reaching for a door handle i'm going to stand on the carpet and will it to fly seems worth a shot i do believe in fairies i do believe in fairies i know it i've killed several of them they're definitely real i'm going to look out the window as well yeah i am are we on the first floor or second floor is that a good thing ten-ten at halftime that's not good okay i understood all those words individually i know those words as well i would pay good money to have you explain how football works to me this is a bit awkward continental we're sadly on a mission he's respected across the continent it's possible can we leave them a bit of water where do you keep your personal water where do you store your water in the house pour the alchemy the little one's for us today the alchemy jug this is where it's going good day i think it's our turn this is what a d10 is for hold on one second i think we head off to ank'harel oh we can mist i think it'll be fine we're mostly water i think it's our water i think we end up very dehydrated at the end of it it's okay now i'm moister was that a global warming metaphor it's a one-camel town i'm going to slimer the kid you're a terrible person i'm still going to slime them on their way out scarring children for life we're leaving them with a promise that we'll be back to finish the job we can follow traffic there's a traffic line then we'll take a late night once it wears off then we'll camp if it's only a day's travel at some point we're going to see the city 300 feet i say we camp outside we're still clouds i'm going to de-mist there seems to be a section where people are camping let's just for once take this by the book we want to make sure they know we're here no sneaking into the city at worst we've got the pretense of being emissaries from emon looking for help no we're going to try and be truthful as much as possible although nobody say the w word it might just be guards yes that's right let's camp for the evening yes where were the other people camping for the night well let's camp 40 feet let's camp with them i'm perfectly okay it's not like they can come in no one can enter who can't be invited we're going to camp next to their campsite we've been too used to being careful i can re-mist as long as the eight hours hasn't passed we can go in and out as you please isn't that correct they have giant spires yeah and they're going to say who are you and we're not going to be on the list you've got a good eye yes get close enough to the other group that they are aware that we exist but they couldn't quite make us out so just another group of travelers camping for the night it's magic it's not like they've never seen it before we're going to mansion it's 200am it's time to mansion and go to sleep unless there's a brazenly loud group around one of the campfires goodnight all i am ready for bed i'll go last it'll be fine we're going to let them know who we are and what we're doing this is just that we have a very expensive tent it is our very expensive tent sam taliesin and that'll do 23 yeah 24 actually 24 oh yes of course i thank you for your advice we will heed it well what is your name sir the strangest thing you will see this evening will be us that could not have gone better everything we can do is strange magic be prepared that not being from around here is going to be trouble i make my way quietly in the night to grog's room i was just kidding sorry i gave you a lot to think about didn't i sorry (laughs) two ones there is a god and he hates you they're going to learn adequate the ploy is to be honest this is a radical shift we head towards the gate we come for an audience with many people to be honest we are looking at many avenues of possible help contacts trade anything that can help us in our time of dire need i didn't know that that die went that high his face is usually not the trouble one last question for our good friend at the gate one more thing good sir if you were going to find a place to sleep comfortably quietly and without incident for the evening in the city is there a place that you would recommend to a friend where you would put a brother-in-law that you liked it is absolutely yes let's get arrested right now we're going to need to talk to some gentry we're going to need to talk to a library and i should also mention not just a tavern is available but we do in fact have three titled people within our crowd so we can actually talk to people of standing and note with very little difficulty it holds water on every continent only people who are not titled think it doesn't let's find a tavern find some rooms let's go to this bazaar get the word out of what we're looking for i am so fearful that he's about to try and buy meth from children no what about that was legit they were carrying fruit oh god i can't life marisha and i'm also looking for a soothsayer anything out of the ordinary and/or a soothsayer card-reader bones-reader whatever they have that's like that i am city-blind apparently i'm looking for anything out of the ordinary but specifically a soothsayer a card-reader a bones-thrower where did it go investigation i rolled a nine oh i'm terrible in urban areas i've learned this i get flustered i've never rolled a decent investigation check it has never happened beyond anything interesting everything is too interesting a soothsayer of some kind perhaps it might be a good way to start getting the word out of the sorts of things we're looking for we're looking for a cloak we're looking for a merchant with one eye and we're looking for rocks-- not anymore i suppose and those are usually the most trustworthy of the untrustworthy people you find in a city you mind blowing a little bit of money on this i have a song for your next playlist i'm so excited yes you're not there five for the moment he knows there's three of us we search for a garment we search for a man and we search for answers towards the future that we inevitably run to we search for a man well i didn't say that far he doesn't need that he's fine oh we search for a man five more five more wait let's consult the cards that's the third question the cards say the cowboys are not-- we move towards a conflict what should we know what should we be prepared for that will do yes i feel that was money well spent well we know we do not necessarily look for a man which is important we know that time is even more of the essence than we first implied and considering that almost every soothsayer i've ever met is as crooked as the day is long the word is now out that we're looking for them we should we should grab scanlan let's maintain a certain level of plausible deniability we're going to die let's get a room how are you rolling that it's going to be a living baby and you still haven't these earrings are tapped you know that there's hookah i've never tried hookah before no this is the only thing i actually know about this continent is that there's tobacco it's not very private and privacy is definitely higher on the list i can literally only see my mother when you describe this image by the way (laughter) should we put some cards on the table we've been searching for a friend of ours and it's been very complicated she's got one eye she's been around for quite a while are there many merchants with one eye yes that sounds about right not an animal thank you what are you smoking at the moment by the way it's very fragrant the cards said our luck perhaps this is a good way to ignite it we are still waiting for scanlan to get here and then we'll take him to the next stop i'm going to put a gold coin on her tray so you can keep smoking and thank you for the time spent in our company i'm grateful for your time thanks mom it is burned into my head i'm cool no what do you mean we're cool could not be happier there's so many valuable lessons that can be learned at any moment i think that's precisely what happened no we're not (laughs) he's legitimately smarter than us we are by the way walking to our next destination oh i forgot we got hookah oh my god is it just tobacco we really don't actually know how have we not stopped this those are gold coins you're not making it rain you're making it hail for god's sakes i have never hated you so much before in my entire life i'm having a glass of this we've just paid a fortune for it we are saving a bottle may i sword it i'm going to sword it oh there's no weapon in here oh we're private in the room it's not no weapons it's just no usage of them i'll just pop it (slurring) not very good (slurring) but if-- (slurring) you should do that again that felt really good i'll do it (slurring) this is so weird (slurring) we're good (slurring) what do we have to do (slurring) that's really good bile (slurring) no it's very good (slurring) i don't think that it's that kind of place (slurring) we have to move (slurred) percival fredrickstein von musel klossowski de rolo the third of whitestone (slurring) whitestone (slurring) what (shushing) (slurring) why're you talking just (shushes) day drinking yes i'm so happy right now it's like yelp but better i'm going to knock (knocking) (slurring) we're fine can i attempt to start looking around the room to try and find anything interesting and try and be useful investigation 12 does anyone mind if i fill him in on the future of draconia it's going to be slightly slurry but at this point at least i'm english again we have the next several weeks we were going to attempt to free the populace from their new lord and master but in order to do that we are here on a mission we're searching for something we're searching for a one-eyed merchant warrior and a cloak i've never found anyone who doesn't have a code who lived very long to tell about it we are looking for the one-eyed merchant warrior who wears the coat of cabal's ruin mistress asharru we do not have sadly a week or so the dragon falls in two weeks sadly no one else will do not that i want to inquire of the sort of business she's in because that's inappropriate but is she in the town at least if we were to write her could we get word to her quickly is there anything else you can tell me about her i know what work she does we need to save the world sadly but true we at the very least need her blessing there are things that have been released upon this earth that will burn everything and they will make their way here draconia is gone tal'dorei is gone all swaths of civilization have been wiped off the earth not like we've seen is there like a lighter fight that can be found arm wrestling or-- i don't know what would be worse less than-- a wok of truth maybe this is really uncomfortable i'm sitting and i'm starting to compose a letter flouncy i'm going to show everybody before i hand it in i'm going to write the truth top to bottom of the world is peril we are facing a battle and she holds or knows of an item that would turn the tide and i wish to know its price or know its rental i'm holding it before i hand it in i'm going to show i don't feel that there is any deceit-- there is nothing i can think to say beyond the truth we are either dealing with honest people or we are not i'm also putting my rank and title and letting them know that i'm willing to-- i'm willing to give away vex vex is entirely up for sale no i'm not looking to recruit this person i'm looking to rent or buy an object that she owns or perhaps even trade and we'll put 400 gold as an offer of a meeting liam and and that time is of the essence yes i want to check for anything unusual if there's anything iffy about the rooms oh for the love of fucking-- no nine obviously yes what with-- not-- no it's so rare that we're actually given an opportunity to be honest about everything we might as well try it once see if we like it good trinkets is there a magic shop oh god 19 punch and judy box yeah good day be pleased i'm stocked up on eccentricities but if you have any oddities for sale i'd be very interested percival hello honestly this is my first time in the city and i'm trying to get a sense of what's available for sale and what sorts of things one would find in the city so really i'm interested in touring your stock especially if you have anything exotic god we've found a hipster well that's interesting what do you call that interesting may i may i take a look at it thank you interesting i don't know it's quite nice though isn't it yeah it does look a bit-- what were you hoping to unload for it now see we don't know what kind of healing potion that is and those other two vials could have-- there is an expiration date on those things and how long have you had it a number of years well in that case they've probably gone stale by now i would say 75 gold at the very best 75 gold will not do you for that then for the belt obviously we've already established that that's in the silver range and certainly not touching the gold 75 gold for the entire set no and of course that makes sense that a hundred gold for that entire set would be very fair 100 gold you've had it for so long this is going to go terribly where's my persuasion ooh that's almost a number oh good 16 200 and an acknowledgement and compliment to your stunning hair i'm attempting to flirt very poorly yes come on 12 keyleth i feel like i should have learned some sort of lesson here i'm just not entirely sure what it was hardly matters i suppose i'm sobering up a bit which we should probably do that we do it's 400 in the afternoon perfect wait hold on i have to open my pokémon we are in fact a group of ambassadors from the continent of emon from the cities of-- not that one that one see listen to me i'm not taking credit for that this is good this is very good of course i'm laughing out loud trust our luck our luck is going i'm walking into this i'm walking into it some of us will be doing it until the end of time are we finishing tonight
