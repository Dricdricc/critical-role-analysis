it's a magical instagram he and i used to perform at the ren faire together it was a thing oh shut up suck it my coat she's an amazing coat designer she's got a-- she did the coat she's an amazing cosplayer and costume designer and you can find her on sickhorse all over the place you could wear it in a boat you could put it on a goat at work or on the go if somebody says they're one thing but really they're just not all that who put this one together has that not publicly been seen yet is that not out yet we are fiction now there's no time to do anything else other than this i think a short rest would not be a bad idea i think we start moving in that direction and when nightfall comes we make camp we can find some more boar if we have to yeah should've been at disadvantage do it it's a one he rolled a one i'm grabbing the sword and taking it to a corner and i'm going to stare at it for a second it's barely been a minute of real time can i assist with a whisper to the sword you do first no it's not stupid because he's a terrible person that's why he's taking a picture i was going to say something to it if i were you i'd put it back or else it will be the last meal you ever eat because i will find an abyss so deep and so far you will never taste a drop of blood again and i'm not touching it i touched it and put it down and let go and said that to it i'll start summoning my own fucking mist man i'm not fucking intimidated by this shit i love a whisper i want to do this with great pain and sadness little busy little busy keyleth i'm debating whether or not to touch the sword and i'm debating whether or not you should touch the sword we have to move it it's a bad deal best time for a joke can you do that grog i'm going to make you a deal we're going to deal with this as a family and we're going to get you something much nicer right away we're going to replace it with something a little less complicated perhaps it's time to be a better badass you don't want to interrogate it because if we interrogate it we're going to have to make a deal it can use you on kevdak what do you think we should do with it oh we've already poured it into your mouth i think i'm perfectly content with it being someone else's problem i'm staring hard to make sure it's not going to fight this well let's think about this i'm going to suggest something that's going to sound a little iffy but i swear to god i'm being clever send it somewhere where it will be content let's not anger something where do we send vampires but they would be using it in the nine hells and it's going-- no that might go poorly yes i am i know i know i don't think so but what do i know that's fair yes on the sword i'm going to kick myself if i'm right does it all right let's-- go ahead i'm curious in my mind i have a worst-case scenario but i'm tempted to ask you to do it just because i would love to be wrong what let's camp here for the night no we were in a time vortex really it's time to sleep no no no can i borrow your broom for a bit it's early i might as well only if you want to double the amount of time it takes me to work on it all right it's very boring hit dice just restore at the end of the day correct yeah just to work on the broom all right oh with advantage very nice it's new now i have to remember i got a new number natural 20 are there are there la-new york-la-new york sorry yeah i gave it to ashly this week it was working fine the other ashly can i at least have the tether done or is it still in progress for a dex save if you fall off all right can't stabilize yet but at least there's a-- okay excellent yay to a constructive day that was-- you're quite good at this we should do this again sometime yes this was actually agreeable all right i'm so excited can i spend my tinkering check building a waffle iron i'm just kidding i'm kind of kidding i'm going to put that aside for later let's head towards the town we walk it's also very inconspicuous i know you're not a fan of inconspicuous but there's nothing you want to be conspicu-ed by here do we want to do that first or do we want to deal with-- oh yes of course it'll be right next thing we do we don't have to stop there that's fine westruun it is i wouldn't have let her get that far back i would've been hanging back there too how big is it ten we could stop by later and tell them that both their problems have been handled well they know their problem's been handled because we sent all their people back to them when you're in 50 episodes this is the first one well that's where we'll send word if anything happens in westruun let's not make promises laura and i would agree oh there's many ways we could do that i think we could draw out their worst very easily hmm how committed are your people to trial by combat what can you imagine would be the most exciting show they could possibly hope for some of that is how smart are your people i've got a thought it's dangerous but i have a thought you literally walk march right to the city gates and demand a challenge if we put you right in front there perhaps we let pike stay with you i doubt there's any of them who will not want to watch that and while they're watching the rest of us do our best to get everybody as safe as possible they won't want to sully that fight no one will want to sully that fight and if things get bad-- we'll pull him out how many objects are you attuned to right now what do you have right now that's good that's good what does the amulet do that's pretty nice we need his knuckles this is going to end with a fight between the two of you there's no denying that yes we defeated the people who left me in a horrible state i think we will have no problem defeating the people who left him and then what but then what how does that save the city it's not just the hostages though it's a city under siege i just don't think it's feasible to empty it they're in a place though where if we can get rid of the goliaths at least they could function with the dragons not over westruun very clever we can do this we've got lightning let's rest up and wait for the dragons 23 20 okay that's a good idea i take that back that's a great idea well they know we're here now yes they know we're here now because now his body's missing i don't know if they're that clever should've left him up there should've cut him down tomorrow one more day up there would have made no difference to him and it's going to make a difference to us because we have to move tonight now respect him by freeing his daughter they know we're here i don't think they did no tonight's fine there's nothing wrong with tonight i just figure if we do it and we should do it and obviously this is nothing if not a sign that we should've done it sooner that was our reasoning last time no we do this i think we do this tonight all right do they know we're coming what are the things that we face inside the city what should we fear inside the city we have one more if we want it vax we have to put it back he's going to save his daughter one last time we're going to put him back up for one day we're going to wait for the dragon to pass and then he will be buried on his land properly with stone and dirt thank you and thank you for bringing him this was helpful jesus christ we wait for a dragon pass the day after the dragon passes we strike i want to tinker for the evening as well 21 whatever night we have time i want to keep poking at that i'm going to lend her my resist lightning ring so that she can study it and hopefully come up with a resist energy potion matt mercer white courtesy phone matt mercer white courtesy phone we're doing strategies i'm so proud of you i'm so proud of you you clever fucker good god we were strategizing we were just we're figuring out some strategy for how to make this work by candlelight so we're watching the other two head back towards the-- i imagine the offering was a little light they may not be very happy with leadership that leaves them in a place where they're being taken advantage of that's very clever might be time to move on for them to leave this is not a good deal for them anymore i think it starts today he'll play candy crush there's no bad idea when we're workshopping and mix a little black powder into the dirt hit it with lightning and it'll go up do we have something fancy to put at the bottom yes that's actually even better curly that's embarrassing all right all right so i say you your dad and maybe pike walk up to the front door and then we get ready to hit them with the doozy once things start no pike you're going to lure them out and we're going to hit them when they come out we're not going to evacuate several thousand people it's just not going to happen so why not just look like them and if you need to you can make a bubble could have a rope tied to him can you remember who you killed two days ago oh well that's fair i don't think they care who he is i think you showing up at the front doors is the best option at this point i'll help i'm going to get some-- all right i did i gave you a little bit of black powder i have a little bit left over i gave her a third of a barrel worth like twice this i'm going to have to deal with it eventually but i'm fine at the moment if it's hit by lightning it should be fine he'll be tied to a rope you can make it move when it's time could i assist with that okay we can do the head can you get me out of there once they come to attack yes i'll be the bait i can be the bait i'm going to have the severed head of your father talking to them up to you all right sister's good for an escape route well if everything goes wrong we meet back here at the very least yeah but i'm just talking about what if we have to para-rescue his ass out of a fucking pickle that's perfect we have that option if it comes to it it's all right and again like any good plan everything will go wrong it's time let's just keep our distance let's get them out of the castle and coming out at us you're not going into town why are you going into town we dug a giant pit in front of the main entrance we can hear everything that happens plus i like that this is that deep in your notes is which heads are on spikes it's like a best of season one that's great sam and okay go ahead (eerily good crow noise) (eerily good crow noise) that's good enough that's good (a panoply of crow noises) sorry (laughter) don't you want her to read the note oh shit yes roll with it roll with it no no at the end of this fight can i have your tie i mean you're not going to need it anymore oh sweet jesus put that on like a japanese businessman why did we even bother to plan taliesin and we are still on the rails it'll be great we're all going to fall and die in it it's going to be great
