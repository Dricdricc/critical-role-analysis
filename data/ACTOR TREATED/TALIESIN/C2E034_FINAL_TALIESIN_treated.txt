honestly i'm still not sure which of you is sam that was great max long game motherfucker you've got it because i was going to go get some milk too two milks also one hot please two milks one hot what is happening i don't know anymore what's your typical rank on board ship if you don't mind me asking very cool caduceus i don't-- okay yeah (laughter) i apologize if we're anxious we just want to get our business concluded as quickly as possible and move on to more pressing matters i mean if you see marius or know that he's around you're welcome to tell him that people are trying to deliver something i get the impression that he's a friend and i also get the impression that he's probably used to a fair bit of trouble and we're hoping not to be trouble well it's complicated i'm not even going to pretend that i entirely understand it myself we're-- again i hate to ask personal questions but-- bastard have you ever sailed with marius by any chance i mean do you have an impression of him as a sailor or-- i'll have to say that we might be the answer he's looking for we're removed from the actual situation we're more delivery by happenstance more than anything else we have our own questions and problems and concerns which can only be answered by someone who has a better grasp of the situation i know people and turtles wow persuasion 21 sipping my milk milk mustache (laughter) you wouldn't mind me asking for a brief description of him so we can identify him when we see him that would be most advantageous super cool that's pretty cool sure i imagine he's probably a little jumpy of people if he owes money and that sort of thing that can make someone very mistrusting i would hate to invoke your name in front of him but-- thanks friend that's great oh of course not well i mean is orly giving the vibe that he is enjoying the company or giving the vibe that he now wants to enjoy his drink in peace well we got one more problem we got to deal with which is your mom's problem and that's the one where we're going to maybe have to get a little difficult yeah do you know anyone who knows how to get down to the sluice weave or has ever been there by any chance i don't actually know what i'm talking about to be fair (whispering) i like tortles yeah we've got somebody who's a bit of a problem we have to deal with as well this is a completely separate issue it's somebody being impolite to a friend of ours so true you've had your creole i was waiting for a fluorescent light to turn on no it was good you were engaged hey we didn't really talk much last time you were in your own space well here you are i think perhaps it's destiny do you believe in destiny but you dream about islands and you go to them i know i like you let me see you eat a meal then i'll figure out what tea to give you well i suppose if the stormlord put you on this path then you're with us now because of some divine intervention i think it's important to follow one's feelings on such things i commend you yeah caduceus caduceus clay it's a pleasure thank you they've been-- your friends have spoken very highly of you in your absence i never understood that penny oh no okay that's-- oh wow sorry sprinkle is there something we can throw hold on is this a good place for thaumaturgy fuck it let's accent this free round for anybody who has any information is that something you can do then yeah i'm going to get a little smaller so that i take up less space in the boat i'm going to turn into a shaggy-looking half-elf literally probably look a bit like shaggy from scooby-doo it changes the amount of volume but i actually do change volumetrically in size though i can get several feet shorter it's a firbolg thing i can seem up to three feet shorter but-- well i did it anyway you've just described every environment that life can manifest in are we calling dibs on the boat i think i saw it if i recall she pointed it out didn't she when we were-- i'll feel confident in my knowledge that's fine yeah this is everything i wanted you'll be all right 25 frumpkin go take a look at that if you wouldn't mind based on that description i want to see if i can figure out what buildings would be directly underneath do my own mental map of what has been described oh dear make an intelligence check all right that will be fun maybe that thing is maybe directly on top of what you were looking at i'm keeping an eye out are we just leaving a boat here is that the-- no better than what i was going to do oh yeah see nugget here's the situation everybody else is going into this thing in the tunnel i don't know if you want to go into the water if you want to just hang out here and hope that everything goes okay or if you've got a preference but i'll tell you what you can hop on with me if want to go with us on this adventure if you'd rather just sit here i'll leave you a little food and we'll probably be back in a couple of hours yeah of course so you just want to hang i guess you want to come with me animal handling 20-- i'm sorry not 20 18 hold your breath on the count of three oh you'll be fine we'll just give you a little-- i can just give you a little tap if anything goes wrong i'm going to slow my breathing i'm going to take one last look around to see if anyone notices any of the commotion that we're causing perception check yeah my perception check was bad for me which is an 11 i've slowed my breathing i've calmed myself and i'm just going to take a very gentle dive and move in yeah we tied the boat athletics check that one was not so good (laughter) never done this before i can thankfully hold my breath a long time the puppy is having-- am i feeling a twitch or is it having a-- oh that's better 18 he wanted to come i'll look around let's head quietly in that direction i think might be-- is this a fancy room or is this just a more of a-- 14 so you rolled low initiative you rolled a seven i believe so i'm currently in hold on yeah all right that's a 17 how well can i see right now okay i'm considered blind that's fine there's nothing much i can do about that right now i'm going to-- hold a sacred flame until i can actually see what i'm attempting to attack like until i can see well enough to-- yes sacred flame in the meantime i'll just stay to myself and maybe try and walk around to yeah just like there i could use a little light thank you sacred flame dex saving throw 16 (counting) 12 points of i believe-- is that radiant damage yeah 12 points of radiant damage that does not hit sure is it disadvantage because i can't see that's the same roll that's 12 i'm still blind at some point i'm going to have to-- i've never fixed the fact that i'm a cantrip down which i will have to fix at some point because this is-- i think i had this at one point and yeah it did not have that i'm going to just ready another-- actually i'm free now i'm going to try and back into the corner near that treasure chest i'm just going to ready another-- barrel it's filled with treasure (laughter) it's one gold coin i'm just going to ready another guiding bolt for the second i can see anything the water elemental is going to sit there and have a long thought about its relationships sea foam that's all you are i really actually have a-- it'd be easier if i could see where i am or-- oh that's much better i just tap the stone ten hit points is there an intense discoloration maybe of the mold underneath the grate is it a different kind of-- yeah you're so good oh thank you 27 you're in another game okay because i was like ten seconds away from casting eyes of the grave well there's an easy way to deal with this algar's got a control mechanism i think no (laughter) oh god shit woo [dramatic music] you know i think one of the bits isn't turning on it should be just about instantaneous yeah 17 17 the flaggy thing yeah algar might have something yes i'm so proud of you to be fair there is nothing better than dungeons & aquarium repair no i feel good that you're making this happen things are looking better yup there it goes nice nope four i'm going to get up and be like man i've got to get that bracelet off that guy god ugh i'm going to-- i'm going to try and get up and crawl around into the corner right there get as far into the corner am i within 60 feet of algar am i 60 feet from algar motherfucker uh-- it is a little dicey that's as far as i can move then i have no damn movement okay i'm going to-- let's see first thing i'm going to do is-- oh man i'm so sorry i don't quite have my shit together i'm going to use my blight staff i'm going to use my bonus action to cast the swarm i'm going to use it to get-- how far away well i mean they fly i figure they're (flying noise) so flying beetles they're going to go irritate the other side of the water monster at the moment no the water-- then for my attack-- hmm oh yeah that's uh-- sorry that's a weird little-- i actually don't have their attack information still plus what it's a bite attack i know i don't-- we haven't fixed it yet no that's an eight for my actual action i'm going to put-- i'm going to use one of my channel divinities on the water creature just to-- just for now i'm going to cast the-- path to the grave and then that's my turn the next person who hits that water thing is going to hurt i'm going to undo that none of that shit i'm trying to find it again-- i can cancel that and technically it's also divinity did the divinity get pulled then from that kind of something that nobody understands yet that i should probably explain to people at some point oh god now i'm thinking-- i had to that's nasty oh that hits ow i'm very low we'll see how this goes nine dexterity saving throw come on nope yup i'm putting it away i'm out no i haven't done the math yet but i'm pretty sure i'm out guess who's going to be healing you're out you're just not doing death saves it's got to keep stabilizing you i think yup 11 i'm good as long as laura throws-- yeah then-- yes also technically wouldn't my beetles get a bonus action anyway or i thought that was cocked anyway but yeah don't even-- i'm not rolling another character aw man yeah it's okay i was just hoping for even like advantage or some such why not he's running a fucking undead-- if i'm alive it's fine if i'm not alive it's not okay okay so it's not terrible it's bad whoa mm-hmm goddamn it it was so good technically-- it got bigger when we got in here that's my feeling anything not to go unconscious again sam and not for long yep still alive that's all i needed was just to survive the round and i'm out i have had nothing i could do this round 11 i mean so many things need to happen no matter what we're pretty fucked right now this is terrible and make sure you're not going to hit jester or i in any of those hits either that will kill us yeah and regardless there's a genie so fucking algar man that's good wow deep i'm still unconscious all right yeah 22 points of health oh what is your plan i'm not up yet i'm still in the water i haven't even started to get up yet okay even if i'm underwater yeah okay i'm already prone oh 18 okay the first i'm going to do is stuff sorry i'm just getting my shit together i'm going to do i'm going to for an action even before i get up i'm just going to cast cure wounds at a second level on caleb if i can just-- is it a touch oh yeah it is do i have a distance one no i do not i do i'll do healing word i'll do healing word at a second level it autofills so that's 13 points of health to you right now i'm going to turn invisible as my bonus action and i'm going to get up and start moving away from this mess i will just be visible my next turn i was going to turn invisible before i get up but yeah there there yeah that'll do yep but there's a lot happening it's just a (splash) everything's like that that was so stressful never too much ashley
