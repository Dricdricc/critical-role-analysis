yeah we've got something special planned but i don't know if it's official yet but i think that we are going to be celebrating pride month and we may have a special guest i can't say for sure but we're going to be talking it's stan lee he's coming out on our show he and his pansexual adventures throughout comicdom excelsior it's going to be fun it'll be a thing possible special guest it's really pleasing in the hand isn't it should we mention that we had to reprint some character sheets or are we not mentioning that i've now said it online old enough to get in trouble for drinking extras from a bad zombie video i think it's got a range stay tight stay on the ground i think they probably know we're here i think they probably know we're coming i think let's just trepidatiously make our way a little closer see what else is in this town see if maybe there's anything useful let's not blow anything up yet making our way towards the tower in a towerly direction no i'm not i'm all right with mine i'm 20 points down i don't mind being 20 points down let's get a little closer then and survey the situation and then take a break i feel like we're a bit far if we run into something on the way there though i don't want to be at peak performance yet this is going to be fun so let's take advantage of this we can do robes i'm all right with robes i'll take a robe i'll take a robe with the censer yes i'm carrying the censer yes thank you that's not bad 21 is there a nonchalant way of maintaining direction but getting out of its way way to be fonzies lot of fonzies smells terrible do any of the buildings look remarkable or interesting i'm trying to keep an eye out for any building that may have anything inside it of vague importance either the building itself is slightly more interesting or it looks like maybe someone has boarded something up to try and maintain some kind of vigil against the darkness i'm not entirely sure out of the ordinary i knew you were going to say that i'm not good at this nope nope nope that's a four that's a natural one some of them have doors holes where windows might be i felt orthax take over again free range undead i'll guide us towards something roll like it's a stealth roll and they don't even have bowels i go in last censer yours i'm going to use the broken tables and swords to barricade the front windows or holes i'm not sure which they are but i'm going to barricade them and the door use the sword to jam the door shut do you want to see what they're burning in the censer i'm going to open up the censer medium pace thank god we still have a thing 21 yeah 22 i mean we did not roll well but we're fine i'm showing keyleth what's inside the censer i'm going to give some of the herbs to keyleth to examine it's like on a charcoal comes in green and red available in the resident evil universe the resin's the best part whatever the opposite of standards are i know we have them we would probably have to dismantle a bunch of them i feel like it would be easier to wreck the operator than try to break the machine which crystal we can go over it we do have a magic carpet that would be the question it's a where do we come up b how do we tunnel without collapsing a building on us and c what if there's buried dead that haven't been able to break if we can tunnel under the wall and then come up in a building you look smaller than you are you would be a little zombie floating stuck it's like butter we are stealthed we've got to get through the wall he's making eye contact and rolling a die like it means something or maybe there are birds on the other side of the wall and then we can ride him well that went well can we ride him to the tower next time it will hardly matter actually maybe if we ask mr mistoffelees-- i'm going to never get tired of saying that-- to go up to the tower greet whoever's up there and throw them off just go up there and cause havoc no we can just send him up there and then we can head in through the tower he can just be a problem just say go up there and if there's anything living up there throw it off yes all of us yes it's just you i say we head in closer on foot if you want to ride mr mistoffelees up to the top of the tower that's one thing but i think just sending him up there or sending him to be an agent of chaos you could always get swallowed i get the distinct impression we're going to have options before this day is over well we're going in now aren't we i don't think you can call it a blink if you've got one eye i think it's just a wink i am excited by this plan i think that's a yes drop it drop it the city is mostly stone i don't know if we can burn it down that's the little chunk where the joint is it's just this little bit it just breaks naturally if you put pressure on that side (laughs) wow way to bring that back we've got a little shadow creature coming back around in a moment you guys do the scout we'll heal it was like carpentry of the damned sort of thing it might but it might just do the (buzzing exploding) it's magic it's the best i've got i could use 20 points we're taking a short rest i can add my-- you have advantage though on everything 14 however how much longer do they have attack the tower tell it to attack the tower maybe we can mess one person up if you rolled low enough he'd be like you don't know seattle you've taken us to seattle let's head to the base the less people we're fighting the worse it is it might be four we kind of figured out what it was it was a modified version of a spell we've seen before oh if we could maybe bring the top down here how big around is the tower he's looking at the tower can i do a little engineering if i were going to punch at it i think whatever was going on up there is gone i think it's happened that's fair she's not what i'm afraid of damn it it's a ten-minute walk i don't know i don't think we're going to bring it down it may just hover there if we knock this it may be keeping the ground up as opposed to being sitting on the ground at that point or walk up through the inside yes damn it they're dressed for an occasion fuck it just go we have one broom we don't have two brooms anymore we got a carpet and we got wings throw everything off the top break everything smash everything you can all right this is almost a plan let's do this it's far more let's make our way to the tower and maybe head up through the tower we don't have to necessarily fly up to the top i can take 50 points of damage i can take two earthquakes personally all right all right let's do it let's bring the tower down to us i say the movers and shakers get the cloaks let's head out and we keep them safe we are playing defense god i hope this works too we're distance anybody gets near them we take them out we're going to focus everything on one side of the tower we're going to try and bring it down in a direction here we go like a tree let's do this this is a terrible plan all right laura just trying to gauge matt matt's thinking about all the other people he could be playing d&d with right now (laughing) keyleth's got a cloak pike's got a cloak he's huge well we can look like cultists can you shift what we look like without changing it the dread pirate roberts is here for your souls it's gone from exalted to shamed never happens this never happens we are a bunch of assholes and remember if anyone looks at you close one eye just be winking always be winking left eye what are you going to do after surely you've thought so are we close enough now that we can start this i'm going to see if there's any structures that are within distance so that once they set up and start i can get to them maybe we can perch we can cover you from a roof 15 please now now to the end yeah let's just pretend that's not really happening i pull silence fuck broom let's do this the minute i grab onto your broom you can't hear anything so i'm just going to ride it down to the ground and then let go powerhouses together distance fighters keep their distance i'll take the carpet if it's available i'm going to grab the carpet anybody who wants a lift up feel free carpet's full i was about to say carpet's a bit full once i'm up i'm going to scatter how long can you maintain a beholder oh then wait until the moment that it's necessary that is true so they're not platform-y i'm hiding behind this glowing spire i'm going to take some cover behind i haven't seen them in so long who's left pike no i was on the carpet and hopped and left them because they had to go pick up no they had to go get scanlan-- it's 35 feet okay that'll work if you'd be so kind throw me here then i like that you found a goofy-looking beholder (goofy voice) hi ashley and oh balls i don't like it being this close that's terrible that's terrible i'm not okay with that roll back page you have to roll it's a dex modifier plus a d20 if you don't have initiative your initiative is normal plus a d20 i don't think you've burned since we've come through 13 they did not see this shit coming at all it did but i think that probably made a lot of cultists go away i cast game over 20th-level spell fuck you do you have a luck no you have all of your other stuff oh you didn't say me until we save or until his concentration is broken i assume actually isn't it just naturally wherever they're looking oh okay i was under the impression that the eyeball was passive you're holding your action for being able to move it could be worse but it would take math this is bad he has been grooming us and fattening us up for two years leroy oh man i am not-- this does not feel good i have a plan i have a plan yeah 20 i have advantage also against-- do you have resistance to any of that well they're top-loading they're top-loading oh thank you oh it's on you've got a death knight if you're feeling frisky i'm going to scoot against the wall towards myself as far as a reasonable amount of movement will take me because i don't like clumping i'm going to take aim at the asshole in the sky and let's do a couple of things i'm going to take bad news out and just to keep everything reasonable i'm going to burn a point for dead-eye and i'm going to take a sharpshooter shot on him minus five to the attack that's a crit that's a crit at level 18 that's a crit this is with bad news so that's going to be 2d12 that's going to be 4d12 plus six bad news i don't know if this also doubles-- i don't think it does-- but i'm pouring all of cabal's ruin into this shit too oh really yeah i burned a crit the grit's not burned so that's nice these don't double do they does my other rule also apply to this does this add to bleed damage now maybe not it's an outside factor that's fine i'm with you okay (counting) 32 that's 32 36 points of damage times two 72 points of electrical damage and then he's also going to get a bleed of 31 no he's going to get a bleed of 15 but he still has to roll concentration i'll take it and goodbye cabal i'll gain more when he hits me with some magic shit god fucking damn it damn it i was debating whether or not to hit him with hex and now i'm so sad i didn't oh well that's okay i'm reloading and i'm going to take another bad news shot at delilah where is she what is she doing okay let's burn that little bit of animus again and burn that grit point again for advantage let's hit her with bad news actually i'll cast hex on her as well just for fun and give her constitution disadvantage actually let's give her just in case she gets grappled-- let's make it constitution disadvantage fuck it and then i've got bonus and i'm doing sharpshooter again thank god i did because that was a terrible shot that's 14 we don't oh that would definitely hit i'd imagine not bad that's (counting) 20 points of piercing damage and five points of necrotic damage that's my roll shit vecna's been busy okay this is going to get interesting that's all i can do either one they're both good go for the first one pick one hit her with a mind bullet that's me under the effects of being confused about the confusion spell what do you have for a bonus yeah can we attack her we were talking about how much you wanted a monologue i really feel like this is the moment that's the end of vax i'm looking at it that's a small-- that's a dire armadillo that's okay burn sick burn can he do that with concentration what this is not going well oh shit wow you really went down i don't know what to do wow you are a terrible person oh no you can't dex out of something if you can't move oh man this does not feel good it does not feel good oh god hit her with a stick turn her to fucking paste well that and those drinks were really inappropriate you can just do it is that three more attacks trinket can he's about to be in a pocket dimension really quick not cool no god fucking damn it okay that's good we'll find out we'll just lay waste to shit until it stops happening we're going to keep doing terrible shit until terrible shit stops happening this is very much the beach isn't it feet are passe i've got nothing i'm going to unload a few rounds of animus into delilah since she's still standing she's still standing all right let's drop a point of grit and let's get some advantage on this for animus shot number one come on crit not a crit but still pretty decent that's a 28 to hit that's not the full damage let's do this plus let's do that that's 12 points of piercing damage five points of psychic damage and four points of necrotic damage i know i'll keep that off then for now all right let's take another shot same thing burning a grit because fuck it and let's make this one-- these are not the right dice to roll i'm really nervous let's make this one a sharpshooter to see if we can pour a little more pain natural 20 that's a crit let's get that grit back i've got to use my pen don't shake me i shake so much on my own that's 2d10 plus 2d6 psychic so that's four points of psychic damage that was a terrible roll and 24 points of damage yeah that's doubled it was terrible (sighs) i take my second shot i call delilah even if we die it's fucking worth it and i take it right in her good eye i want me to be the last thing she sees but it's down off (sighs) for my third shot mr armor and i get another grit back because she's dead armor i'm taking-- what's he holding he's holding a longsword let's get rid of that longsword i'm going to hit him and make him drop that longsword i'm burning a grit to make him drop it i know this is a lot i'm taking my third shot with animus and this is going to be a sharpshooter shot and that's not a crit but that's pretty good that's 29 to hit all right so this is 1d10 plus 1d6 that's terrible that's 20 points of damage two points of psychic damage and he has to make a strength saving throw or he drops his sword dc 20 concentration oh for that that's fine just because we're at that point where i'm panicking let's burn an action surge boom three more shots on the asshole no vecna i'm not shooting because he's laughing off my bullets and that's-- oh my fucking god 20 points of damage plus one point of psychic damage burning another-- i've got more i've got three more i keep killing things that's 17 to hit did he make a constitution save against the last one okay this is my last shot i'm burning another grit and natural 20 okay so that's going to be-- come on that's better yes he did he took 15 points of extra damage halved 18 21 22 23 30 points of damage plus five psychic damage and he's going to take 15 points of damage plus three psychic damage next round oh my fucking god i'm going to use my bonus action to reload and that's my fucking turn i know no there's nowhere i'm as far away from everybody as i can currently be there's nowhere else delilah's down you know what i'm going to start making a beeline straight for keyleth fuck it i'm going to see if i can get some cover behind-- i'm fucking bailing we can get grog back we've just got to get everybody up we're picking up armor revivify we will grab everything we fucking can this is no time for allergies fuck i got as far as i could you need healing like a mother don't shrug at me it doesn't matter anymore i haven't touched that game in so long you'd have to pick one of the two of them to hit you can hit them both there's a lot of dead bodies on the ground man that will do i get that vibe roll a one you're a liar you're a lying liar he would have-- none of us want this taryon's sitting with a cup of tea we've got one way down we are all having the thumpa-thumpa right now you're terrible no stop rolling that die it really was a one no you can't hello fuck one more round there's nothing we can do right now how close to you do we have to be they're bullshit we don't care that is my armor class i don't even acknowledge its existence i am definitely not amused where is your dad from damn it that's bad do you have a reaction 27 scanlan's getting whaled on if we're smart-- i'm heading towards where you are i'm heading towards the deceased body of delilah she can move to us never mind i'm going to be making a beeline for everybody else everybody's in that big clump you'll be able to move before you cast plane shift right so as long as we're all touching she can get to us we just need to clump and i move last so i'm fine is that right yeah i move last doesn't matter she just gets extra points-- come on we're in a nice little clump aren't we i think we're all in physical contact at this point except for me well working on it do you have all of his stuff next time we fight vecna he's going to be wearing some very nice boots i'm kidding we are trying to get out of here we're going to die here as long as we're all touching it doesn't matter where keyleth is but turn undead would help maybe healing or turn undead i'm coming up right i'm going to use the ring of counting this is actually proving to be invaluable later we need a bigger boat not yet yeah we just got 26 points back she's probably at the bottom nope which also means that all the fucking skeletons take damage i was about to say i know the stats of the dawnmartyr really well right now for reasons yep are we a reasonable chain there's nobody breaking the chain i'm going to move six points in the direction of delilah because i'm going to bring her with me because i don't want that dead body there do i make it in six moves and while i'm running just for fucking fun i'm going to take three shots at that armor and i'm going to push him the fuck back if that's okay i'm going to push that knight back i'm going to try and do a force push yeah it's about to be we're all touching let's get rid of that fucker we're getting the fuck out of here that's a 27 to hit the knight okay and that's a torso push i'm only going to take the one shot i don't even care anymore i'm just pushing him away he's pushed ten feet back from my position there's no save for that and then he takes a disturbingly sad nine points of damage plus six points psychic damage but he's ten feet back we're all touching i'm going to save the rest of my attack for anybody who tries to get in the way of this shit if anybody interrupts us i've got two more shots ready to go also burning a heal for fun as well i'm also holding onto delilah yay i'm not quite at full put your hands in it we're ready to burn fuck no you have a reaction there's no save this is it we're all here we're dying roll you're a good man we're not happy yet that's not nice nothing feels good no there was not a fucking prayer you know what i'm grateful that we're not--
