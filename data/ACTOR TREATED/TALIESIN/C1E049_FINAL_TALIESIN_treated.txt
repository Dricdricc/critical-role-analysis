you can do a limerick it'll be exciting what do you need what do you need pathfinder i've made an extra copy of your character bafta nominee ashly burch oh god i'm going to die what does it say at the bottom there you're not supposed to just come out and say it when we last left off we were in a cardboard box frost wilfred brimley stab the other person not yourself 26 i think you notice things and have an epiphany at that point rolling stealth plus ten 26 you don't know where you are anymore at that point let's pace and slowly approach that's fair you have knives you could cut your way through the back of the tent make the door make the door at the back of the camp and that way we can run them out the back of the tents make the door first all right i'm going to go actually right over here i'm going to hide over here and i'm going to try and get a bead on the guy on the tree waiting for the distraction just do it (sings) five gold rings this is the most douglas adams beginning of a fight ever oh hell yes if you'd conjured a will-o'-wisp it would have been you in that hole 24 amazingly i've got a bead on that guy who's trying to let the bears out of their chains i'm going to take bad news and i'm going to sit and take a nice calm breath and i'm going to squeeze off a shot and knock him on his ass so this is a trick shot leg hit wait before i do anything i still can use hex because the last creature to have hex on them died so i can use it as a bonus action to cast hex again can't i couple hours i believe might have been too long oh fuck it and it's a full day's rest it's a long rest that's fine taking that shot no not sharpshooter that's 24 to hit he has a strength saving throw yeah no he's prone he also takes 15 points of piercing damage cool all right i'm going to move to my right six spaces and i'm going to take another shot at the guy who's right ahead of us in front of the pit yeah right there i'm going to take a sharpshooter shot yep whoa that's nice 18 19 20 21 22 23 27 that hits that's ridiculous yeah i rolled an 18 so that's a better roll a better roll that was a pretty good roll 16 17 17 27-- 33 points of damage i put down the gun and i breathe i figured i would be part of the distraction i thought we had taken a short rest just not a long rest yeah 'cause we stopped and we healed that dryad can help kill him now he's prone though can he do that can i do a gloves of missile snaring yeah so that's 24 to hit it's actually-- i can reduce damage i can't change whether or not it hit eight eight points of piercing damage okay so i'm going to try and catch it and yeah i reduce the damage to zero and i actually can catch it in midair stab it into the ground can i use it again or no what did they roll to hit though a natural 20 so it hits no matter what i took eight points of damage can i get some closed-mouth ones okay now breathier cats with a catnip toy okay i'm going to grab the javelin really quick i'm going to walk over to the guy who's just starting to crawl out of the pit i'm going to look him in the eye javelin goes right in the face i'm using it as a stabbing weapon i'm not letting go until he drops that's fine it wasn't about the strength strength bonus plus five one plus six six seven eight nine 11 throw it away pull out the gun and shoot (laughter) first shot to the face that's still better 17 to hit okay that's 15 points of piercing damage i'm going to look up to see if anybody has noticed that this has happened all right i'm going to pick one of them and take another shot the one on the left i'm going to take a-- yeah let's do a sharpshooter shot on him yeah our left yeah that'll hit 26 that's 17 points of damage yeah can't even hit a bear yeah it's a very paladin thing i'm hidden by keyleth (uncannily good crow noises) i've been paid good money for that i can emote as a bird my turn look at that is there only one guy standing now okay i'll look at that guy who's right in front of me-- i'm going to take a push shot i haven't tried a push shot before i'm going to do a push shot on that guy in front of me that's 29 all right that's 13 points of damage and he pushes directly away from me ten feet yep that's good and then let's see the bear is a still a problem isn't he i'll sneak another shot at the bear this is going to be a sharpshooter and a trick shot i can't take both at the same time can i it's one or the other and trick shot i'm going to sharpshooter and trick shot and that's 23 not that hard to hit has to take a constitution saving throw no he has disadvantage on attacks until the end of his next turn yep yeah 25 points of damage i'm going to burn through my action surge really quickly and reload and take two more shots two more sharpshooter shots nothing fancy the bear 23 that's 20 points of damage so i have one last shot can i spend a grit to try and shoot the rope that's holding that guy in the tree disadvantage grit or no grit i can actually technically get advantage on the shot yeah so i'll spend a grit point on that natural 20 can't even kill a kitten with that no it was a one in 20 shot i'm cool i assume the one that isn't on fire but you know that's my opinion no yeah cool oh boy so your strength saving throw goes up by one two orcs what did we two-- two dryads two orcs let's eat the food that won't last and return cook the boar and return we can
