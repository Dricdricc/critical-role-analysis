just keep saying random things until it makes noise yeah i gave you about a page-- everything on whitestone and everything with percy fits on about a page of relatively small type it was nothing that he wouldn't have already known there was no information on that page that percy didn't know like nothing he didn't witness himself he didn't know who the briarwoods were he didn't know what was happening he didn't know even-- i left it pretty open whether or not the dream was a real dream or a demon or a whatever there was none of that information at one point i'm like i have a couple notes of things i want to add and your response was well i would get your shit together pretty quick that was all i was really given i'm like uh okay why oh no it could have been just a dream it would've been-- that would've been interesting if it had just been a dream and not really a thing and it was just him being a terrible person that's great (yelling) let's go on a pub crawl woo fire plane was a big one i remember you were almost irritated at the fire plane you were borderline irritated we spent weeks telling you we weren't going my answer is cheap i'm such a superhero nerd and i'm such a flash nerd and i would love to do a superhero i used to play champions i built speedsters in champions all the time i loved playing speedsters yeah my money was on you throw down in tal'dorei i rolled so badly i was just staring-- i rolled three ones two twos and only two rolls over ten the entire game i was like everything's broken nothing's working i'm paste that's just what happens i'll actually say and also for people who are asking percy doesn't carry the contract with him i know about the contract and a lot of people were like why didn't you pull it out that would have not felt-- percy would not have done that and he doesn't carry it because he doesn't even want the temptation that thing is locked away i think it's locked far away thank you for encouraging sass if i'm feeling awake and alert which is not every game sometimes i'm tired victor's always fun but i've got to be prepared (cheering) i was going to say practice one of the things that acting training does one of the first things they do is they sit down and go all right we're going to work very very hard on removing all of your shame because you're not going to be able to do your job if you have any of that audio but yeah removing that shame is not easy and is a long and arduous process that-- oh hello yes that's lovely i wish i had a really good cheat for it other than-- i started by performing and getting weird in the car that's a great place to be weird because no one can see you and then sometimes you notice people see you and then you get okay with that of just singing something ridiculous kesha is good i'm trying to think who else there's some good stuff sing to feel really ridiculous and weirdly other people's reactions to you being ridiculous will slowly make you feel better because it's never going to be the reactions you're afraid of it's actually strangely positive to be like (crazy voice) i don't care woo because people go-- it takes a while to beat that out of your system though it's tough thanks mom that's the most mom advice i think i just won money on that one maybe you also get their lowest attribute as well like no matter what-- for whatever bonus you get you get pulled down as well you'd just be very insufferable for a while i imagine that would be fun he was not prepared he was like oh okay this is apparently happening it took about three episodes to get really used to i feel like three episodes in i was like-- i thought it was good for us because we'd been worried about-- a lot of our players i think we're the only-- us and liam are the only ones who've actually played any other character and so i think there's been a little bit of nervousness about what's going to happen when that happens and i feel a lot better you are not my father you don't get to tell me what to do it's everything i could have hoped for and more we are there for you kobayashi that stuff blow it up we were in a press room a good dm in my opinion knows the difference between consequence and punishment you don't punish your players for making the wrong decision you don't punish them for going off the rails you don't punish them for staying on the rails you create consequence there was a guy up a second ago who was talking about that all his players got accused falsely of a crime and then they found the real guilty person and dealt with it he was talking about that what if most of the world still doesn't know they found the right person and just all assumes that they're guilty and still got off and just treats them like dirt for months that would be amazing and now they're just ostracized and everybody hates them make life be unfair like just be unfair don't be mean but you can stack the odds against them i love no right answer kobayashi that terrible situations where something awful is going to happen no matter what they're learning i'm so proud they're learning your reality with kerrek i remember changed your whole plotting quite a bit you were getting kind of aggro oh no i remember i call your current track in my head it's the be the lisa frank you want to see in the world (laughter) hey sun tree yeah one of my core principles-- i like that d&d has those little fifth edition boxes but i always see that as either-- and there's nothing wrong with training wheels we all need them-- as a good way of helping you be-- there's nothing wrong with training wheels sometimes if you haven't been acting for 30 years it's nice to have a box that teaches you some basics or if you're playing a one-shot it's a good way of remembering who you are and what you're doing which is important for anybody but i've never filled those boxes out for percy at all i don't think any of us filled any of those boxes out unless i'm playing a one-shot i never fill those out anyway it's a great episode yeah percy was supposed to never be happy that was one of his core character traits is somebody who will never be happy with himself or the world around him and will always be on a core level irritated at himself and others mostly himself and not anymore i was like what happens if he just lets that go finally and is like fine forget it i deserve a little happiness he's getting dangerous i'm enjoying it something's going to snap terribly i'm really excited yeah all it took was a bad relationship a really inappropriate relationship to ruin everything i'm so excited oh no it really is it's such a flashback to 22 23 it's great waiting for liam to make that speech that was amazing that's the next t-shirt just a group of shitty people oh yeah tary points it out a lot which i really enjoy of like you're terrible people yes we are woo long time i was about to say maybe the sphere is not going to come up until the next campaign for all we know i have no idea bend it to your will there you go oh just a player nice i think maybe if percy had never become an engineer i would have loved to have stayed in fighter class but maybe a fighter class and become like a really poncy fencer which would have been in the errol flynn style ha ha just can't build anything i don't know because he thinks magic's weird the rules are all mish-mosh you would be an angry nine-year old nice chun-li it's not that we're nervous about grog having the deck if anything it's that we're nervous about travis having the deck i can see that so clearly in my head i think the deck in the battle royale was my fault because every game i distribute-- we get a lot of mail it's mostly in my room i live in it now there's more mail in my room than furniture it's one of the reasons i don't livestream very often anymore i look like a hobo yeah except it's just paper i'm like ah papercuts god i distribute a little of it every week and that deck that he had that is what i had given him i was like here you're going to dig this and i gave him the deck with the letter it might not have been in his consciousness if i hadn't handed him a physical deck so you lock the kid in his room with a crate of scotch and open it an hour later the scotch is gone and he's like i feel great you're like that did not work if you can't tell we talk about this a lot this is a subject of conversation i feel bad we've actually held the line now sorry don't encourage him i meant to wake up and shave it this morning i feel really bad about it i guested a couple times on dungeon master then there was a sci-fi spin off that we did for several years they would be in costume with character sheets that they'd filled out and they would play through the game and we would be the npcs it was a pretty solid-- there was some great stuff you in the evil disney world was one of my favorites she played a psychotic murderous tinkerbell with a baby in a bag that she would beat on the ground to get people's attention it was amazing it was one of the best things i've ever seen in my-- it was so hard to keep my shit together with you with a shank and the baby in a bag the makeup smeared everybody smile oh it was so good it was an amazing show is dungeon master still running they put stuff on youtube every now and then too they haven't done that yet fire plane fire plane for me yeah definitely we were not prepared we can't tell he doesn't flinch he's like that guy who can hold his hand over a candle and maintain eye contact it didn't even occur to me that that pub crawl was going to be out of his-- like he was going to have to pull that out of nowhere until like an hour and a half into it i'm like oh god oh that was great on the carpet no hand it to brian because it's always funnier she knows where we are at all times audience he wears it well if anything i think it makes his maps a little better he's trying harder oh god i'm so mean i know i feel bad about that arm i do i could build him something i'll make him a robot arm i've made really nice roads it's true the roads in whitestone are great now it's going to take a while but we've already got several of the main throughways it's great
