yeah i gotta see that flute though no one is safe scanlan also just texted to say don't kill the giant don't kill the giant texted while driving i might add don't do that get it out now if scanlan were here he'd say we need to capture the giant by the way not texting it to us that's what he would want if he were here capture him capture him scanlan would say capture him you also still have a grapple arrow yeah i know i know yeah that one scene i love that one scene should we roll initiative okay (sings) all together now 12 12 we've got one over here two over here marisha and i'll go first okay i'm going to-- where am i okay i'm going to scoot in over here and make my way and as i'm running by i'm going to take a shot at his kneecap and see if i can prone him yeah i'm just going to knock him down 20 20 hits he's grappled and he's now prone but i'm going to do my 1d10 damage that's 15 damage he takes 15 damage and he's prone and i'm going to finish scooting down there we can't win i spent a grit point for that here i'm not doing anything else for this turn that went poorly do we have chain let's chain him up we have chained him never-ending rope doesn't grow on trees though sure all right yeah no i've got it i've got it very absorbent fancy robe that accent was terrible everyone knows that now vax and i are still getting something out of there i'm lowering him down on a rope oh boy heal our what are we calling him tiny heal tiny accent is just terrible we've got a distraction travis and forget the fight we can just send him off into the city and that should be enough for us to sneak in that's just a sentence you don't hear very often i'll take the first watch why not we're not going to be able to do that that's fine we're not going to be able to get him out i don't think well how are we going to smoke him out that's my thought absolutely except of course by doing that we've destroyed the roof of the chamber so there will actually just be nothing but ventilation it's open that we're talking about destroying that we're talking about destroying we're going to need to destroy the mechanism we've already done reconnaissance we know that there's a mechanism inside that room we know that that's probably what's keeping the brain i want to experiment on the-- i want to do a couple things i want to first take using my little kit i want to just beaker off a tiny bit of it and expose it to some organic matter to see how it reacts and expose it to a little bit of inorganic matter to see how it reacts flesh interesting now i want to try it on some inorganic matter i would like a couple things i would like one of the rusty instruments and i would like one of the diamonds please so that we find out if it's going to be useful if it's just acid it won't do a thing to the diamond or a sapphire fine and some cold stone i want to try it on some ice cream with peanut butter (laughter) on one of the rusty instruments and on a sapphire shutting it down interesting all right good on metal not so good necessarily on-- if the glass is glass the glass will break if the glass is something else we may have to burrow through it i'm going to clean off the sapphire we're good we're very very good i have a terrible idea what if we break the fall of the device with clarota oh so sorry no i'm saying what if we lure it into the center of the room and then drop the ceiling on top of it i'm a bit tired i'm so sorry i think it is definitely an option though if we can lure it out of hiding and get it into the center of the room is the elder brain directly below it yay he does not want to go against illithid his poor mouse nuts yes that's the plan i think it might be too heavy that's a good idea this is assuming the bats are going to be a problem i'm not afraid of bats do we have really an element of surprise at this point onward ho do you have anything to contribute we do have a giant piece of leather that makes us look like rock we can-- and we can attach the camouflage back onto the flying carpet we do he can call every single creature in the city to come to his aid more than enough to deal with us so then we want people to come into the temple at that point we're not going to set him on fire i'll take-- i want to save as much of it for the beholder as possible yes i'm going to head up top also in the fight i'll be more use from a distance anyway do we have any spare glass vials can i have one can i have a spare arrow vex can i borrow a spare arrow a sparrow i have a second i want to see if i can make a crude acid arrow out of a glass vial it's a shatter a straight up shatter arrow it's a proficiency bonus plus-- thank you please (sings) everything is cool when you're making an arrow ah thank you oh my god yeah nine ow i wasn't-- aw i wouldn't have put the acid in yet okay fine damn it all right i'm having bad rolls for this stuff man so that didn't work i'm just going to pour very gingerly i'm going to just pay attention yeah yes that's a really-- that's a really good idea actually to be fair traditionally that's very similar to how pyramids are built it was a good thought i'm just going to keep breaking-- i'm just going to keep breaking hinges until it swings you technically you could really go underneath it keep him looking around and remember that if you don't use magic and especially you have one magic attack don't try and use magic when the main eye is on you let's i think we should try this so if he makes the portal you have to get to the portal we might not how about oh god we're all going to die run away run away right now my god my god we're all going to die yes we'll do this yes he's just sitting here laughing they're psychic we do have a thousand-foot teleport grog for ground forces we do have a thousand-foot teleport so we could actually bring you into the room wow why don't we-- is it possible to drop off a group and then go back and get the rest a taxi it was such a good try which is why we're picking you up in the second group yes stealth stealth trinket should stay with the boat as opposed to fighting the beholder those are your options is trinket fights a beholder or trinket stays yeah what's the bonus for pass without a trace 30 they're bolted into the stone itself i would love to while we're here very quietly examine-- someone's going back so he's going back i want to examine the structure to see if i could find the optimal place and the weaknesses in the structure whether or not it's more appropriate to pour the acid on the stone whether it's better to pour the acid on the metal just to see where it would be weakest mathematically investigate 19 the bats say what are you clicking at us i was looking at the page i was examining and i've got four vials of acid i've got the three that we had and then i've got the fourth super-- that's a-- that's an omen of things to come so i'm going to start by taking our normal vials of acid and i'm going to pour very gingerly right at the sections i want to crack and start letting it burn okay i'm going to take the major bottle of acid and i'm just going to-- i'm going to just i'm going to get the more intense acid i'm going to just-- i'm just going to use the tiniest bit i want to maintain as much as i can i want to start working on it okay i'm going to keep gingerly slicing it through until it's just being held the minute it starts to give i'm going to shift to the next one all right i'm going to take the other half and i'm going to work on the other-- 29 (whispers) grog grog we're going to need a lever we're going to need-- wrench get a blade into the metal into the iron and wrench and you're going to get the second one but it should give using an axe i'd imagine yeah we're going to stick down and just pull it's not weakened we're going to - we have to crack it well yeah let's-- this is not going to be loud well it will be loud once it breaks yeah we do have a flying carpet i'm going to do-- would i have gotten enough engineering information about it to actually have a good sense on whether or not three to five tons would actually do anything at this point another investigation 15 all right let's go for it i'm going to-- i'm just going to show where i want him to drop this is the point take him all the way up screw you i want my final words with you to be indignant and irritated we'll apologize later they're the things we've been fighting die with hilarity or die not at all yes thank you oh yeah he's meat yeah ten ten that's a he attacks first 24 okay there's still a-- two questions there's still a stick floating in midair with a rope tied to it correct that's fantastic i have a plan also i've been curious about targeting shot-- if i use a drop targeting shot that won't work on him will it the one that knocks flying targets down to the ground and then they fall but it wouldn't do what it says i can do here where he's going to hit the ground i will hold off on that-- okay so i will just-- i'm going to do a targeted head shot i'm going to grab the rope with my bonus action-- i'm pulling out-- oh yes i'm pulling out the bad news i'm going to take a shot-- basically take a targeted head shot at him in the eye 29 i think that hits all right so this does a couple things where's my-- i know where the hell are my-- it's only ten points of damage but the nice thing that that does which is that for the rest of his turn up until the end of his turn he has disadvantage on all attacks excellent i'm then going to take the rope holding on and i'm basically going to do a swing so that i'm out of range for any of his attacks until my next attack i'm not swinging down into the temple i'm swinging around the outside of it so that it's-- yeah yolo everyone scratch keyleth off their t-shirt now (laughter) it's a little early maybe it's tense it's cool oh here he gets it halved as well that was me do i have cover i thought i had cover but okay 20 15 with advantage you're not in the room it's still technically speaking though we would still have advantage all right i'm taking-- i'm taking another aimed shot at the-- i'm taking another head shot straight into the face yeah that's 29 to hit i can't remember did we-- god damn it no i don't so that's 15 points of damage and he has-- he maintains that thing where everyone still has saving throws i'm then i'm actually going to-- okay so you are going to need a constitution saving throw okay 17 i'm going to duck i'm going to step back from from the edge just so that i'm not in its eyeline for a little bit i'm going to catch a breather so you would hold your turn until grog's turn i've heard worse ideas hundreds science it was a bolo-y thing the tanglefoot was basically like a wire thing yeah it was a bolo arrow that's how it-- that was how i originally pitched it was a bolo arrow okay but the advantage cancels-- advantage regular roll fuck you little plastic toy you're not the boss of me okay weird question (laughs) all right we've got a giant spiral machine hanging by two chains right now i'm going to peek over the edge and is there a way that if i happen to snap one of those chains that that thing would go slamming into him i'm going to pull over and make that shot i'm going to steady myself sit down and i'm going to make that shot fine i go around the other way 17 does not hit a not-moving target so-- thank you seven eight nine ten 15 points of damage 20 yes cool bonus action i'm shooting him again action surge yeah well i used my second attack to reload now i'm on my-- yeah have i actually moved all six of my-- all six of my spaces for movement i ignore three-quarters cover thank you all right i'm spending the last of my grit to do yet another head shot technically it's a head shot it has an effect i'm shooting him in the eyeball basically that's a 29 to hit that's 18 points of damage 18 points of damage plus the same thing everyone gets this-- so everyone gets advantage we were with you we were totally with you you want to do it crying i know that much that is how it's done no this is the end of like iron man 3 right now i'm kind of i'm a little irritated i loved it i'm going to hop on the magic carpet and start heading in and i'm going to get-- i'm going to get myself down and i'm taking a shot at the horn because i'm so close okay 18 it hadn't been for disadvantage-- that's the end of my turn kind of in the middle of a bunch of stuff here d8s it's like the thing at the end of time bandits we should just-- oh god yay thank you thank you thank you i just gained the ability to do those head shots like two games ago too i'm just so excited i can't wait we're offended i'm offended read book good we kicked its ass yeah we also have a couple people in the studio that should at least say hello before they leave too you gotta say hello
