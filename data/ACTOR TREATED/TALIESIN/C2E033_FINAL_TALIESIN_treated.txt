oh wow that's everywhere (laughing) that was a really good doctor claw this will work out way better than that tamagotchi you owned well that sounds nice well actually big sur is nice this time of year i heard the whole story between games i don't really-- you should just know-- that's a very fair point i definitely want to do that that sounds great i don't have any expectations so i'm not sure if that's true or not i'm going to take a moment to look through the sand and rocks and see if there's anything interesting 15 investigation wait hold on investigation never mind that's a six makes sense you're right this is spectacular he looks like a thaddeus why not a both a one a two a three i'm going to take a minute to try and explain to the professor what a doctorate is if he's confused all right oh yeah i'm going in forget this this smells weird i really like it never before it's amazing oh man i can't even imagine i think we can camp on the beach before we leave town but if people are anxious to get this done-- it also occurs to me this is an eastern ocean isn't it so it would be a sunrise or a sunset for this ocean we need an orrery now to figure this out i'm very excited without a doubt that's really beautiful that's amazing does it do this every night wow that's exactly what i thought too how long has it been here for that's beautiful i was just thinking i felt a little underdressed no one talks to anyone that commits mail fraud it was on the tip of mine but that's fair i may join you in that if that's all right i'll also humanize myself and put together something that looks appropriate for the sort of people i've seen walking around lot of pearlescent whites and greens oh this'll go poorly no i'm not one foot up and down straight intelligence check 14 definitely the same pink hair but tied back he's a thin adult human man who's got a little bit of a scruff going into a bit of a shaggy goatee if this is appropriate for it a little bit of the french restoration but nice pale opalescent whites oh my god okay yes that's fair it's muted but fun that's a lot of happiness and that's okay lighten up a bit i named the seagull in my head too steven steven seagull everybody at home gets out their swatch they got i don't ah oh sure aw no very impressive oh no he did not yeah i pop back up less of a cemetery more of a graveyard it's a pleasure to make your acquaintance only recently yeah aware of it but just trying to only dip a couple toes in i don't know what that means funny hair does she have a name you mentioned the lighthouse would we need anything to enter the lighthouse some token of familiarity or some name that would get us a tour to meet the proper people there gale sam and all right oh that's right sure oh my god your mother knows the gentleman that's so cool wait what this is the perfect time for a game of pictionary i'm so excited both of you don't look i don't understand what's happening it is amazing what's happening over here oh yeah yep there's no getting around it does it look like the same person when we look at the two drawings okay oh no i don't is there a thing oh well i don't understand what that-- that's fine let's-- go ahead no you might not have been i don't know there's a lot of blue people in the world i assume only just now this is the sort of conversation one should have in person i suppose perhaps he's hiding which is why he couldn't answer that question oh yeah i'll head to the lighthouse survey the territory works for me that's a great idea also on the water it's beautiful i'll find the door are you gladys i think we're supposed to talk my name's caduceus mother sent me that's not terrible 12 i am i am this is a long and complicated story i suppose we've been holding the north against something dark something threatens our small temple have you ever been to the blooming grove before it's quite all right this has been the first sign of the mother i've seen since leaving my home her temple is under threat up north i was waiting for a sign and i think this is the sign yes i'm so sorry how rude my friends and i-- it's only fitting is there any service that we can provide for you for your graciousness in allowing us into your lighthouse i feel that there is wisdom here would it be possible to learn more about this place possibly thank you i'm very excited what chase we'll get there it's an inconvenient moment right now we're having a moment right now exciting it's beautiful i'm not even looking at the view i'm looking at the lighthouse i'm going to compare it to mine a little bit i have my own responsibilities to her as well this place it's so different was it perhaps a gift from the lawbearer long ago it is beautiful i will admit we have many tasks that weigh upon us that bring us here i have two favors that i would ask of you and i understand if they're not possible very fair we have a friend in town in need of a good turn and this good turn-- we have a friend who's threatened and we're hoping to maybe glean some information it's my friend's mother she's having difficulty with somebody do you perhaps see the thing beneath the city i fear that he may be in contact with something inappropriate with disadvantage keep on target meta that sluice there oh boy i'm sure we can figure something out she does good work i do have my last request and i'll take these people out of your hair i'm looking for a sign of where to go next i'm waiting for the mother to speak is there a place to sit quietly and find her voice ah that's fair for your trouble i'm going to pull out one of my teas it's blessed from the mother herself from one of the graves of the less scrupulous families of the north good for muscle tension i find grew it myself you serve the mother well it's only fair that you be rewarded thank you for your time she's trying to get in the boob this is going to end poorly i thought she was really nice did you mean for that to rhyme or was that just-- it's the first time i got it that's where you find carpets i was about to say yep we get nine birds it's nine i like turtles it's time for oysters
