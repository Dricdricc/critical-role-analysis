cock goblins i will be in phoenix arizona at the amazing comic con and if you follow me on twitter @executivegoth i will actually tell you where i will be at the convention at various times you can stalk me i'll be very stalkable e-stalk just his head floating our first cameo first place for youth i'll have a link up to my twitter in about five minutes they help kids get through school they help kids who are orphaned and having issues get their stuff together and become fabulous teenagers like we need in this world yes great date wow you took that to a dark place you took that-- natural 20 no no this is by the way for anybody tuning in for the first time at home this is how we express that we have no idea what to do we're at home is kima still around is lady kima still around or oh not vasselheim i'm sorry allura i'm on the wrong page red meat red i thought that's what we were doing today they're the only functioning organization left in the city at this point well i say that we organize a group let's not get overexcited about the sudden realization that some of us can be a bit iffy we've all had a moment probably within the last three weeks i'm not saying i don't yes oddly you and pike seem to be immune but let's organize a group and let's at least open relations with them at this point we are going to offer them our services in getting this city back to a functioning level they don't want a city ruled by a dragon we don't want a city ruled by a dragon it's in their interest to help us clear the city not long-term and these are groups that think long-term let's make it a business deal we're talking about making a political decision this is politics they could i doubt they'd leave that's a terrible waste of an investment i am i'm relying on greed it tends to be exceedingly reliable yes thank you i'm curious as to other options that would be quite wise nothing is ever going to top the triceratops really absolutely i don't know i would love to i can i just can't get back instantly and i figure that they would have sent somebody at this point if things had gone-- they have an instant transport to us if they need to find us the council knows about the stone we would've heard that would be lovely whitestone is also somewhere we could arm ourselves more completely against something like this we're going to have to start-- my aunt edna she's a dragon-lady i don't know if that's the same thing i was mocking him yes we fought a dragon-- we killed a dragon for them whitestone and vasselheim i think definitely yes he's got a point you've got a point it's possible that vasselheim might be our next stop after we secure everything here what of whitestone we'll send word at the very least it's far north i'll make sure to send word we need like cups and string or something millions dead for all your reclaimed wood needs the best was watching laura go oh what a great i-- ooh should have stayed in school can i take a roll just for being a nerd i am proficient in history i want a nerd roll 24 book reading i speak elven so that's good (laughter) they've gone into hiding i can't but there's reason to believe so it's what it points to historically elves have in times of great stress taken important sites important places people and either cloaked them hidden them or moved them into the feywild until such time as the danger has passed there is precedence for this they've gone into hiding most likely you didn't have to know that big girls don't scry sorry i saw it on netflix i know i know coffee hasn't kicked in yet well they'll know soon enough we are going to need transport ah i don't think we're going to win this fight staying here i think we're going to have to rally power i think we're going to have to rally allies i don't think there's enough here for us to win we can go in shifts this is not something that's going to be solved tomorrow we can take a week and move people we're going-- we're not going to be able to empty the city we can get these people out and we're going to need-- and i apologise for the brightness in my voice-- i think we're going to need an airship like the one that crashed we're going to need to move quickly though from city to city and we're going to need to get word we may have to steal an airship or something i'm making a plan i'm thinking of a plan it's working there is an empty airdock that's currently not being used in the city we don't need it now but we're going to be-- need to move-- i want to live like teddy ruxpin this is all i've ever wanted (laughter) we have time this is not a one-day plan i think that's a good plan i already gave it to keyleth hey i've got a weird theory let's not send people with injuries yet so that perhaps pike can stay here and take care of them for a little bit we don't want to lose a wagon to whitestone we'll count to six and then we'll put the rope down and when we hit six we pull the rope and it'll hold everybody-- yes hold the people back we can get that many through in six seconds and keep running so that you make room for everyone behind you we don't want like-- it's not the bottom of an escalator whatever that is it's a thing i've been working on it's going to be great i'm already through i'm going to get everybody organized everyone please follow me we're heading towards the main castle welcome to whitestone thank you for that smattering of applause golf claps please golf claps we make our way to the castle things are not going well have you heard any news of emon and what has been transpiring there yesterday we were attacked by a group of chromatic dragons the city is destroyed there's no simple way to say this but we're under siege we were afraid that whitestone would be destroyed as well but it seems that they have passed over you so far but we fear for many cities' safety i was hoping that it would be all right if we moved a small number of refugees through to whitestone for the time being less than a hundred i imagine these are the first 20-some-odd that we've pulled through oh well yes nothing i-- anything i should know about so i will let you know to stop all business with emon for now be very wary prepare the city for a possible dragon attack things are looking dark and if it's possible any research-- any energy that can be put forward towards mounting some sort of defense against these creatures would be greatly appreciated who arrived the other day please bring me to him oh my god that's some pre-stream stuff everybody we've met you look very familiar (laughing) ah yes long gone thankfully long gone we're vox machina-- yes thank you for that (laughing) well first of all how goes the research into the-- well sir i have some bad news for you i hail from emon which has been attacked by chromatic dragons-- dragons have declared war on civilization a group of dragons have destroyed our city and they have destroyed other cities as well we are in desperate need of powers to defend ourselves with-- so i would be very careful and send forward-- send word ahead of yourself before you travel anywhere it may not be there by the time you get there things are looking grim and i would ask while you-- if you intend to remain and work on your research on this anomaly beneath our city perhaps thinking as to how it may be turned into a weapon for our use against these creatures would not be out of the realm of question and any information you do have of the chromatic dragons would be invaluable any research that can be done we are at war that's westruun westruun is no more sir yes extremely aggravating well we hope that you will find our winters here quite solitary and convenient on that level things are looking grim i must go i have other work to do to start preparing-- good day sir and good luck to you we don't know yet but we will be returning here cassandra will be able to get a hold of me if necessary i am going to go find my sister and make my way to the stone why isn't the internet working (frustrated noise) no he wasn't helpful but it was very helpful the way he wasn't helpful it's a strange strange-- everything's going to be all right thank you i will return very soon we will again with your permission hopefully be using whitestone as a place to regroup and prepare ourselves yes you'll hide i have thoughts perhaps of a weapon i don't know but we're going to find a way to stop them i'm not good at being the bearer of any bad news but this is very dangerous and i don't know what we're going to do (whispers) they don't have an airplane i shall return soon there will be a few more through possibly tomorrow with word i will and cassandra i'm proud of you you're doing very well here we'll get there they hurt good to know i did everything is fine up there the research continues they're happy to take people so and they are prepared for more they're also happy to be a base of operations as we put things together whatever preparations one can make for something like this to be prepared to hide (sighs) for now worst-case scenario they can go underground yes they have to grow food they haven't really recovered that yet there's also a-- i have one of those terrible ideas i get on occasion that thing beneath whitestone could be a weapon i might be able to turn it into a projectile a long-term idea i can make an antimagic missile an antimagic missile i've been-- i've been mulling it over yes i have-- that's actually part of the idea i have thoughts i'm going to follow them through and it may require some experimentation in the future but i think perhaps-- i take my life into my hands any time i build something i think that a non-magical approach to containing it might actually work i think the problem is-- i think the problem is that we keep trying to magic our way out of something that denies magic and maybe i can engineer our way out of it a little bit of information there will be more later i'm going to take a look at all the data and see if it's possible i'm trying to be more open to the clasp they're not turtles no i think pike should stay behind to take care for-- this is politics you're not supposed to like them no i'm going to leave one with vax i'm giving vax my gatestone i'm giving you the other one he's the one who's going to get stuck in a room alone if they decide they don't like him jenga stone remember it takes about a minute to work 33 this is going to be fun 26 wow quick question is he in flight or is he just sitting on the rooftop there's no easy way up onto the roof is there that would be my whole movement too wouldn't it though nah let's see i'm going to try to get a vantage point where i can at least get where he's only three-quarters cover so i suppose i'm going to head south down the alley to see if i can get a-- yeah i can get a good look at him there half-cover's fine so if i were to knock him prone would he fall off the roof or could i try and push him off the roof these are my-- the wyvern i'll try knocking him prone and see if that does it actually-- yeah it's either that or try and push him off the roof which could be pretty funny i'll try and knock him prone all right so i'm going to use bad news because that's funnier take a shot that's a 28 to hit and that's a wing shot so you have to make a constitution saving throw against 18 wing or leg shot i'm sorry that's a-- actually i'm sorry i have the new sheet strength saving throw sorry strength saving throw against 18 motherfucker but he'll still take some damage i'm going to take another shot at him too because eff that i was not quite prepared for this 2d12 plus six four eight 14 points of damage and i'm going to take a-- reload take another shot and try and knock him off the roof same shot ugh that's a three so that means i-- i can use my-- i actually can't do-- am i going to panic and try and fix this i can-- i'm going to i'm going to throw an action surge and see if i can fix this yes yeah 14 sure i shouldn't have gotten him that box should i could that does not hit i'm going to use my amulet of the shield and up my ac for that attack to 23 so nope nope i'm sword out yeah this is the first conversation i've ever been in in this group where i feel young vax hasn't gone-- okay where am i i can't see-- okay i have no advantage on any of these bastards at the moment if i were to attack okay that's fine and how would you describe-- these are like scaly people i think you've got that one guy covered at the moment so i'll concentrate on the--hmm tough call tough call you know what i'll have a little fun i'm going to pull my sword and i'm going to take a slash at the guy who's involved with-- that's 21 oh shit i forgot to use my bonus action can i pop in a quick bonus before that hex him oh it's-- that's right still the same hour it can only do it once a day right that's all right that's fine i can just do a little thing so just add to this would he be described in anywhere on his little d&d card as something with a dragon keyword so i'm just going to do normal damage to him okay so-- all right just checking i'm going to do nine points of damage slashing damage to him and i'm going to turn to the wyvern and take two slashes at the wyvern first is-- ew 14 wow that's 19 plus-- 26 points of damage and second shot-- 13 24 yeah that hits ten 17 18 19 26 points of damage that's my turn all right i'm going to start walking towards that wyvern at the bottom there-- yeah that way i'm not going to get quite close enough to get into the reach of that jerk over there-- yeah while i'm walking by him though i'm going to nail-- i don't even know if i'm really going to-- going to shoot him three times while i'm walking by because that's funny with sharpshooter it would be seven 19 that's-- 1d10 what did i do with my 1d10s because i wasn't thinking-- here we go that's 26 points of damage since i've got two more shots i'm going to start shooting at that one dragon-- that wyvern as i'm-- sharpshooter again that's a nine yay so that's 16 and i'll roll the second one just to have it that's nine nah nine'll miss thankfully will not-- that's great 26 points of damage and i'll get as close as i can get to him in this round also i'm going to spend my movement walking straight towards him 26 16 misses stinger hits constitution saving throw 20 so i took ten points of-- it's not going to live through me anyway i got this we should-- we should take what we can and we should also hide the bodies let's bring everything inside drag everything indoors yeah not crisped just scorched any-- inside just inside anything else to loot from these schmuckuses we'll take a breath in the-- yeah in the basement i say we follow the water i'll do whatever they say aye the city's going to need a black market well here's where we could help each other we need this city to stay alive we need the citizenry to be fed and we need people to know where they're going to get their medicine and when they're going to get their food we understand it's going to be tricky we need information we need spies we need to know what's happening in the city and you need people like us to stay out of your way there are ways that we can benefit each other we have safe haven-- and please by the way stop me if you feel i'm being too broad we have our keep that is untouched by the dragon's attack-- we have a safe haven there are-- options but it is very likely that we will be the thing that is dropped upon it from a great height and the most cooperation we can get getting into a position of power over this beast the happier we'll all be oh no i'm not-- i feel the urge to further discuss this also to be fair we're not representatives of the clasp we couldn't technically speaking open-- all we can do is-- i think the most fair thing to do-- to offer in exchange for this is perhaps some trade with the materials that are available in whitestone and maybe a promise of keeping a blind eye towards their business until the finished reconstruction of the city let them reestablish themselves until the city is properly completed you need an underbelly underbellies are function underbellies function for this very need the fact that we can actually get food and medical supplies into the city right now if we need to less than 72 hours after such a devastating attack there's no other system-- they're inevitable at the cost of people starving or not starving of course he can which is why i'm not saying anything that i wouldn't want him to hear anyway i just don't want to promise anything we can't deliver i don't think we could deliver vasselheim we're going to be busy we have too much on our plate as it is i'm going to offer what we can give and see if that's enough let me go back to him (deep sigh) shenn i propose a counter-offer i just don't feel comfortable offering vasselheim i don't think that we could necessarily deliver and we honestly have a lot to do well i will not promise that now what i can promise right now is some access to materials from whitestone which-- and i show him my gun hilt which is embedded with the gems i can see what's still lying around and we can make a deal i can also promise that for the reconstruction once this has been dealt with which is in everybody's best interest until such time as there's a functioning government in this city you will be treated with the respect appropriate of a group of people who are helping keeping the city functional of course they have i'll put something forward to the group if they prove themselves honorable if they prove themselves faithful and capable of keeping this city afloat then we will speak to whomever they wish us to speak to precisely of what they did no more no less and for that we are grateful that was business i'm willing to kick this ball down the field this feels a fair deal to me and it means that we can leave knowing that the city will in fact still have a populace while we're gone it is the job of ruling you don't have to vax this is not the worst deal i've ever heard i have met the devil that's not him thank you vax i will make the deal if you're not up to it but i want your blessing absolutely not i take a bow and i turn my back to them and walk out i would like to point out since you had such noble intentions towards my position on things this is your ego at work here i may be many things and i may be a deal-maker but i never forget that when i rule i rule these people as well i'm not better than them and you may think you're better than them but this is what it creates it creates enemies they certainly think you do and they are not pleased that could have gone so much better i think we could have gotten out of there with at least the hintings of an alliance as opposed to just-- bitter enemies this was a disaster that's not a thing where did-- you didn't read that-- (splutters) no we can't it would do no good who would be bringing food into the city in the first place they're doing it without us though they're not going to no of course not i wanted people on the inside keeping us informed and we just lost a very powerful spy network everybody needs something we are not going to bother we're going to go and we're going to find a way of killing these things and we're going to hope for the best in this city that's what we're going to do oh my god really we have a plus ten 33 the minute we see that i'm going to push her against the wall and i'm going to minor illusion a shadow right over her one day you're going to stop being afraid of me by the way and i hope that day comes soon the place there's no swinging by that's a caper that's an entire thing that if we're going to do-- this is one of those things that we're going to have to get everybody on board before we even start talking about it so probably a good night's sleep and then we'll talk about an airship i'm really on board with the airship just needs headphones that wasn't the kind of ship i was hoping to get (laughter) i suppose our plan is the slayer's take next well here's the question is do we want to head towards vasselheim from whitestone so we'll all go we'll take the last of the-- i can't believe i'm going to say this-- the last of the 'fugees accidentally smushed make it breakfast and we'll be able to build it back up i'm sure that some lucky dragon's going to come and shit in your bed it'll be fine it takes a good month to bathe a room in that much self-loathing let's gather what we need make sure that gilmore is ready to move as well we'll bring everybody through to whitestone and that they can come work in whitestone i can pack up my kit and i've also technically got a reasonable workshop back in whitestone i've packed everything that could possibly be used to make anything dangerous we'll be back it will be built back better than before that's what we do just to set up to make sure that the queen and her children are taken in at the castle i will i'll fill my sister in on how they're to be taken care of make sure that gilmore is taken care of there's a shop we can ask about that vax obviously we'll sieve the coffer a little bit because we're going to need it for the mission also let's re-employ our castle guards as the emon royal guards in the meantime and they can serve the queen and her children and a small amount of the green gem if that would be possible that's left over from the mining operation of the glass if possible thank you i'm working on something perfect gilmore will be of great help (laughs) i'm sorry to drop this all on you and i'm thankful it will not be the end of it sadly i'll be off in the morning we can teleport i'm going to work on that little project the thing i was trying to attach to my gun but wasn't working i'm going to try to attach it to my boot instead i can draw you a sketch that's better 22 and i've got one working piece i know each individual build i have to build the-- the actual device itself has to be built for individual usage it's not auto i'm going to try and build one and see how it goes i'm working on something thank you since the day i've met her i've given her every bloody dime i've made so yes i no longer even think about it anymore she's practically the royal treasurer she's just happier that way we'll teleport to the outside of the city and perhaps sleep at the temple of sarenrae we do always have rooms at slayer's take i would appreciate your help in restarting the economy of whitestone to be fair you as well we were just leaving that's just cruel we should get our rooms we have things to put down what's left of it that will be a trip that will be necessary soon but not yet i'm settling in whoa that's the last we heard very sketchy source he's looking well in the morning that sounds just fine brooding handsome he was so troubled we didn't think to leave her a stone did we i would have definitely suggested leaving her with one of the stones trinket's going to guard the castle individual i don't know i may want to have a conversation at the temple of the raven queen yeah that too we can do both i'm going to go to the temple of the raven queen i also want to talk to our mapmaker friend yeah i was going to say do you know who says if you love it you have to let it go the one who got dumped that's who sorry yeah you are i'm a terrible person
