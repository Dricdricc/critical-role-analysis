wait i made that list specifically so you could reference it that's fine i do these things it's okay i don't mind let's keep moving forward i'll go behind the twins we still have some cloaks they know that the orb was with two of the others so as long as we keep the distance everything should be fine it could in theory collapse the arches if you were so inclined how big is the ball again grog's not going to fit in that hole i don't trust you as a sphere artisan as legendary as your ball-handling skills are-- roll 2d6 i don't see how i could possibly help with this here's a question if you start thinking of it going in a particular direction does it keep going in that direction we could send it in a direction or we could send it straight up you finally found a worse pet than trinket well done i love trinket to control the sphere is it just will i can lend the scope of my gun if that helps scope just a series of lenses-- i let grog look through the scope i regret nothing matt's finding his murder sheet do we want to deal with these people or get around them what was his name can you send them down there the rest of them to help the other-- we tell them they need help down below in the cavern where we murdered everybody you're odell viscon might be one of them send them down there to see if there's a problem then cave them in when they all go how is it that grog is following me right now am i making that little sense we send one of us up as odell to tell viscon there's a problem down there and that we need everybody to help because we found something he's looking forward to vacation when this is all over anything you'd like not that but yes we found something interesting it's strange possibly dangerous possibly useful we'll stay in there we're going to get into the ruins and have our guns trained in case anything goes wrong remember if anything goes wrong it's been a pleasure working with you we think well of you and move on he appears in another game somewhere in deep valley 34 so they can only move at the speed of the orb since they have the orb with them how many creatures are left guarding us humanoids are the big problem we have the gem it may make the undead move towards it laura and move the behemoth away move the behemoth away i can assist in your inspiration can i assist in his inspiration including casting a spell we can stealth-kill these humans super quick we have to wait for the first wall to collapse then we may run well i would say collapse the tunnel then go we'd have to be lucky that's why we stealth-kill them now we could go for surprise kill if we want yeah i'm at great distance first one is 32 to hit second shot is 28 to hit first shot is terrible it's 12 points of damage i don't have surprise bonus at all do i second shot is-- oh my god what a terrible roll ten points of damage nope i'm so sorry that's not nearly as bad as i thought it was 16 points of damage that's way better that seven looked like a one i'm booking it running up to the center tunnel i think we're going to all get in and then grog i'm going to have you punch the darkness you're our hostage now i'm going to shoot as well very carefully see what's up there and find some cover i've been thinking about that i haven't come up with anything no we could try and find the object there are legends that say that the sword was lost somewhere near the city we are for as much of a moving still in the earth somewhere near the city we could find the sword i really hope we don't have to go back down there but maybe that might have been what they were searching for we're going to die she's a terrible liar we'd know it would be advantageous like hopping earth orbit it's probably what they were digging for i can keep blowing his mind like this it's quite nice how much of a problem is the move earth and how far can we go a thousand feet with the move earth we have to move quick it takes a minute to activate the stone though you would be down there-- that's the problem she would follow her can you follow her or we make a tunnel and we all go tunnel we collapse the tunnels behind us you lead us we go straight there less than a thousand feet i know that this is burning but we've got no choice under a thousand feet that's assuming we hit no pockets all right fuck (laughs) does anybody know that joke outside of this room wait that's right we instagrammed it it's a disintegration spell there's no closet we're in a tiny tunnel we know i'm going to walk up to grog and pike i grab grog and pike we're going to run together i activate my silence spell you two are in my silence spell but you have advantage do i have advantage well i might have advantage also i'm in the silence spell also not that i need it though natural 19 so 29 they can't hear you people who see invisible things can see it just in case is it wise to leave one of the gate stones outside the door you take one so if you need to port back to it it's here laura and nope i'm going to leave it in the kitchen so i'm going to put one of the gate stones in a corner so it's not so obvious yep and then you guys have the other one all right we're in the mansion hush ignore him wait shit might get really weird now you are actually perceivable but only to the things that can perceive because it's late and this is what's happening that's cool so you found a cavern don't we always that's a terrible roll i'm so sorry is it considered a salad if it's mostly cucumber in there how is this different than a sliced pickle you're in a cavern you can't have any dill what does keyleth think of dill we don't know do we we'll never know god fucking damn it well we're at least relatively safe here for a moment until they figure out a way to find us and then get rid of us keep rummaging wow it's been a long time you may never see your bear-- nope playing devil's advocate cosmic bear he'll look like eternity from marvel comics he'll be this star bear-- what worst case scenario we can leave the gate stone outside fuck the briarwoods we're practically gods let's be fair we're so fucked oh god we should turn off our cell phones more often this feels really good oh god we thought about leaving one as a marker for us that is the most frightening thing-- give him some distance that's a fucking dice tray that's not a card what are we if not risk-conscious let's get him a steak or something sword of kas not even once (laughter) wow way to bring that back and your father can we pinpoint when we get back i was about to say you've been thinking about it and the answer is no we can also maybe have a second to breathe and have a second to maybe identify that stone we took it's entirely possible that we could return to where we were with only a few minutes having passed plead our case i don't think it's in anybody's interest to have vecna controlling any of the planes yes perhaps sleep and return minutes later you definitely have been sleep cranky no never again this made everything worthwhile right here travis are you going to be reading that weapon for the next week aren't you not all of it that's the rest of the show if he reads it cum see us-- matt and time circled i am legit out of sheer panic going to take off all of my clothes and dive straight into that lake that little pond i'm washing i have had a nervous breakdown i am like yeah no we're naked into the water i'm in there yelling into the water right now because it's been too much coming back sopping wet and naked i'll say and we've got this weird thing that we're not entirely sure about since we're making a deal i want to make sure of a few things because i love making deals first of all as perhaps a token of friendship do you have any idea what this is i am still apologetically naked and wet thank you second question is when we do return in an hour where are we going to reappear this is great another strange question have you ever had access to our world before have i read about this cat nope nope no idea none nope i have no idea how long does he have to be dead in your hands before you decide that it's worked this is the problem with fey they don't tend to lie they tend to tell just most of the truth no i'm all right with that i whap scanlan on the head this is what's happening absolutely do you still have advantage on death saving throws because of that thing that we did a while back or is that long gone never mind carry on well this may be the weirdest thing this is not the worst thing everyone's backing off yeah no underwater i grab her and drag her right back to the pond this is quality internet they're in the woods we're in the pond might be a dawn thing we moved and he appeared dawn doesn't really exist out here it's just a rest is there somewhere else that we could go to recuperate that will be the last thing we do before we go to sleep we have a little time one day there's currently a giant city walking its way towards another giant city a skeletonized dragon a gold dragon cannibal undead dwarves no we've had an enormous amount of trouble with doors in our time (laughter) i'm watching to see if anyone eats the food it's been a long time could be disintegrated though there are not going to be ten days we don't need a ten-day death ward we need a one-day death ward well you with haste would be horrifying none of us have it no they're monstrous i'm so excited no it was great
