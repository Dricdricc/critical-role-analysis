you could build a bear in the beard dropping mad jams-- i'm not i'm going to show you some music it's cancer it's been a weird weeknight i had a strange day i've infected friends with spotify now what if due to some strange third-arm syndrome i can't wear t-shirts is there any way i can show my support to the show with my third arm i need necklaces and keychains you're so stealthy another 826 in san francisco yeah because there's one there-- they might be opening-- that would make sense i'm retweeting you right now i do tara platt who is a wonderful friend of the show and amazing voice actress and extremely fabulous in many different ways she's a sky pirate she does all sorts of crazy stuff she's got an indiegogo for an interactive book called and i'm hoping i pronounce this right zartana you should check it out it's really cool it's really pretty and beautiful it's got a very stardust-y vibe i've already picked up my copy so you should go there's just a couple days left just hop in and grab a copy for yourself it's going to be really exciting and-- for the cool child in your life this christmas this would be for the kid who needs something that's not quite outdoors but not quite a video game zartana also i will be in onicon in galveston texas over halloween so if you're in galveston texas and it's halloween and you want to go to an anime con i'll be there and i'll be in costume and it will be pretty hilarious you should wear it like bling get a chain for it that'd be great no no never mind god damn it it keeps happening samurai well there are options was that an issue in the meantime there are options i can show you where there's water i lived here my whole life yeah hit point bonus advantage on wisdom throws-- i have my advantages still so i'm going to lead them to the closest well well here's the question there's three lordly houses that we have to avoid at all costs for now there's a few shops that if we feel might be in our best interest to scout out i know where an old weapons depot used to be we could check the temples to maybe see if we could maybe find some support to begin with there might be people i trust there's a temple it's not a pub town and it's a place where you don't necessarily chat up new people but maybe find some old ones (sighs) if we have just enough time i'd like to try to go to the temple and the cemetery leave maybe grog and vex to guard keyleth yes the zenith is the one i wanted to go to the other one is called the lady's chamber it's a temple of erathis i don't know anybody there that's what i'm afraid-- they might know you so no awesome possum i was trying to be stealthy as well although i'm fine either way 23 how about a wheel and stick (whispers) yes yes we go up to the doors and give it a tug this is my neighborhood i feel comfortable suddenly a lock appears utterly pickable (laughter) i would like to find out what happened i've never used this i've had it since i created the character and i've never used this blade once this is the most use it's ever gotten i pull out this pristine piece of shit (laughs) i don't even remember i think i found it in a dungeon it's terrible it's a boarding sword it was one of those little curved swords a scimitar but short it was nothing it was terrible yeah so get it in there are any of them concentration spells let's keep going one two three 16 let's use a sword i want to see how this plays out we are going to the window we are going to the window no we are going to the window please do not destroy the temple of pelor how do you want to do this was it overkill because really it took that it's not overkill if you used what it took we took damage from an inanimate object oh god get it out of our system now oh god all right i'm looking around taking in the damage anything that i notice is particularly out of whack from the last time i was here other than they're upgrading the locks apparently 15 reynal father reynal (louder) father reynal let's check one of the doors we'll start on the door on the right can i dip and smell 13 20 someone has been working on something in here i want to smell the ash does it smell like some sort of-- is it perfumed without sufficient magical essence the distillation is proven to consistently fail a shame really i shall seek an influx of materials elsewhere before i can continue this project regarding the weapon after a year of taking notes from eyewitness accounts my original designs were faulty and recently cost me my hand the wind of fortune has seen a shift it seems as sylas just returned from emon having encountered the still-living subject and had the pleasure of seeing his work first-hand his unnatural eyes took in much detail i believe his observations have brought me to the brink of finishing my design i intend to journey from whitestone within a couple of months to gather the components needed but if delilah's hunch is correct the subject is heading here i may find myself needing to leave sooner than anticipated why i want to take another look at everything that was on the altar and i want to see if it looks-- 18 well we know we're looking for someone without a hand to find out who's trying to copy my work yes let's check the rest of the temple what's in the pouches checking the door on the right i'm going to search the room for anything else search the body i want to check the other room the room to the left so much perception 19 he means well that's a terrible costume you were so prepared for me to go to the temple that you built it i'm not looking i'm not looking i got an 11 together we can get a slurpee i'm weird tonight i don't know what's up i rolled a one and then a natural 20 thank you for the advantage you can't be frightened after a heroes' feast we should do this every time we fly so truthful you learned 11 11 we haven't been there very long (whispering) god damn it really it's the door's fault need more d6 or are you cool 28 29 30 34 okay so you know i didn't do anything just get me up it's okay i don't get my turn until next round 18 i'm back to zero yeah i'm back to zero i just woke up and went (groans) passed back out again yes 19 4d4 plus four four five six seven nine ten 14 yep i'm awake hurt but-- ugh ah we should head back apparently any help i thought we'd find here is obviously gone did we not check the other room sam and let's check the other room and-- we'll check the other room quickly i was really hoping you missed that part has it been used recently is it-- 12 all right i have theories on who's been using this space is there anything that would clue me in to who's been using this space now here's the question do we leave them a sign that we're here or do we hope that they don't notice no wait i want that this is not pelor it's part of the crest of de rolo i would also like to drag father reynal out of his room and put him at the pedestal like to head back now i believe 13 yes a bit yes i suppose it's our good luck then (sighs) reggie fuck my life i know 21 i'm actually supposed to be going back for a-- yes sir i'm keeping an eye from the second floor i want to see how much movement in the city there is and whether or not there's any guards by the tree whether or not the tree seems to be left to its own devices definitely trying to memorize that is there a lot of light in the town or not very much light we've already blacked out-- you're going to shove it where the sun don't shine that thing you hate doing the ground is tainted let's sleep i'm going to tinker for a moment on my glove with that thing i talked about an intelligence check 14 i just wanted to think about it it's fine i think we get it we learned a lot we know it's not dead dead that it's just tainted it's okay i think i figured out what we have to do first i think we have to kill kerrion stonefell it's the one that everyone-- he's the one managing all of the goods and all of the farming kerrion stonefell he's in one of the three-- i would assume that he's been given one of the three mansions in town i think it would be the beginning he's who everybody's afraid of we could hang him in the tree i think we ask around to see if there's a way to ask around to find out who's in what house let's-- eventually yes 12 yay there's more than batman (grunts) no i'm fine a little ticklish i'm fine i'll take some goodberries there's three i don't i also think perhaps we should find a new place to sleep tonight i think it might be best to mix it up keep moving scanlan cast the spell there's a shop that i used to frequent we can see if that's perhaps been abandoned so we're going to go to beyond the horizon yes do old ladies lick the air can we use this as a base of operations in the moment then let's head to the closest mansion kerrion i will say chances that anybody in any of these buildings is somebody we're going to want to take care of is very high i am a little pale i just had a bad night's sleep that's all my nice jacket we can ask around see if we can manage to ask somebody without arousing-- how far are we from the temple the alcove we could take a walk to the lady's chamber and see if we run into anybody there or on the way and it's only ten minutes out of the way not as exciting as it sounds (sighs) it's not looking like it we'll get to it he doesn't know what he looks like anyway i think they would actually they already have genuine proof that they are perfectly fine killing a small peasant boy we're going to take a little walk and let it pass by let's go to the lady's chamber you'll see it's not really that complicated tmi he is oliver twist i was ready i was ready do i have an opinion on yennen we found him a bit obnoxious to our means and ends on occasion he's also not a lapdog i'm going to walk up to the little meeting is it wrapping up right now i'm going to just walk up and start a conversation do you think there's any hope for whitestone do you think there'll be a day the people can find happiness again do you think there will come a day that these people can seize freedom for themselves against their oppressors yes i have a prayer to give i pray for a day to come when outside forces can rally the people of whitestone again that strangers may come and bring with them salvation and that the people will seize it look for signs keeper yennen look for signs i'm going to hand him a piece of parchment salvation good day to you sir we walk south and you know what i've left him that (sighs) what appears dead may not necessarily be death and that with the shadow of death over the city perhaps there is life deep underground perhaps things that appeared ended and gone are perhaps continuing to this day and may rise again 16 he's definitely not going to-- let's head south kerrion stonefell's stately manor countess anna ripley that's the northeastern one i'm assuming if it is who i suspect it is it's countess anna ripley she is a terrible person she's the doctor i hope so but let's-- one at a time if we're lucky maybe one a day (coughs) i'm fine i'm fine i'm fine i look like like a dirty peasant right now should only take 20 minutes to get to the house shouldn't it we're not passing anything interesting on the way are we i was thinking mostly of the barracks or the alcove got some thoughts the lady's chamber there's quarters they'll be able to hide us hunch actually my thought was if we take care of stonefell why don't we hide in his house if it would make you feel better you can do whatever you like but i think it's just a tickle this has been what i've been working for for years i'm not going to lose-- i was surprised last time i've had time to think about it i'm going to be all right and i'm keeping it together i'm not going to pretend that i'm great but i've got a hold on it i've got a hold and i respect that if you think that i'm slipping you'll let me know if that isn't a sign that i must be crazy i don't know what is are you actually the oldest among us this is not a happy place look wet the old shawshank prison walk we're going straight there let's walk around the back i think you can mispronounce his name it's fine sir starbucks yes 50-50 let's take a long walk around the house to see if there's a way in through the back and i can't imagine that many people attempt to infiltrate this house 21 until two let's try to sneak in and leave the guards there unless they notice us and then we'll just (thwip thwip) you want to try to pull one of the wrought irons off maybe yes it's raining we can make a little noise it'll be okay lou ferrigno-ing now we can get trinket in you can check to see if there's a lock on the cellar door we have advantage 26 (whispers) quietly that's crazy yes let's just go one room at a time no 28 matt that's a lot of maps you have down there 23 i'm going to pull into that empty-- oh i've got a button don't i i'm going to pull into that corner right there and i'm going to take two shots at that soldier in the corner that guard 22 that's just a d10 where are my d10s that's nine points of damage another shot to him that's a misfire i'm going to do a quick repair and that's fine no it takes a-- if you're lucky you die last there are three guards hunter's mark oh yeah kerrion stonefell that sounds like a great song he's also aged he's a bit peppered what that's like a normal wolf but dire i'm going to take one step forward i'm going to shoot that guard once one more time yep fuck it i'm going to try sharpshooter and that's 14 15 21 to hit that'll do 19 points of damage actually that's more than 19 points because it's a fire shot so 19 plus two so 21 points with two points of fire damage in there i'm shooting him again (laughter) that's 21 points of damage fall damn it shooting him again that's 20 to hit eight points of damage i finish walking almost into the corner over there right next to him about there spend an action surge taking three more shots at kerrion this is a sharpshooter round that's 19 26 to hit i don't crit on a 19 oh that'll do 24 points of damage plus a point of ice damage so 25 points of damage yay because he's an asshole that's six more points of damage so you don't see shit shut up i'm going to take a quick reload and i'm going to fire again with sharpshooter and i'm going to do a head shot so i'm going to attempt to make him have issues doing things natural 20 (cheering) i swear it's-- yeah what does the d6 double or does it not double this is going to be angry so 42 points of damage of fire damage 42 points and that's with 5 points of fire damage 42 points just as an action as a bonus action i'm going to remove my hat and i'm just going to say drop it on your turn yeah that's healing it's not much healing no it's a fighter action yeah it was with a head shot so that means he has disadvantage on attacks for one round and deals damage i'm a good boy mr rogaine from harry potter yeah i know me too filch filch on steroids don't you get an attack of opportunity that soldier hasn't attacked yet either you can hold that action until she comes into the room i like it when he has to go to the book makes me feel like there's perhaps things he doesn't know but he's-- ain't it the truth man that faerie fire it's your ac nice sharpshooter against kerrion do i have advantage on that because of faerie fire 16 yeah taking another shot yeah 20 15 points of damage third shot with ice no sharpshooter natural 20 it's making up for my gun failing four times i know six 16 25 31 points of damage 31 points of damage with four points of that being ice damage oh stop it don't cheapen this i'm going to put on the mask since he still doesn't know who i am i'm going to walk up to him yeah there's no way to drop the illusion that's such a damn shame i did that's fine the mask will do i'm going to take one last shot i'm going to look right at him i'm going to catch his eye this is for the de rolos and let me say you were the one i was least looking forward to i'm going to drop the gun remove my mask run to find something metal something sharp anywhere on the table and just start scratching off the name on the gun i'm just going to go to a corner and just start scratching the name off that's my turn you-- oh go ahead i was going to say tell him to go tell anybody else in the house everything's fine tell him that everything's fine can i run over to kerrion's body i'm running over to kerrion and just going to rage loot him i can't talk yet i'm taking his swords and i'm going to use his sword to get that deep gouge into the gun and anything he has on his body i'm taking it and once there's a good gash in the name i'm going to sit down and breathe kerrion's dead there'll be time for that i'm not available right now sam and is it the one in the forest how long have you worked with sir stonefell were you here when he took the castle good you're very lucky because you're going to live if you show us-- and i bring out a map i know drop the blindness drop the blindness look at me look at me you're going to show me where on the castle is the secret entrance do you know who i am you will mark it on the map i know where that is can i propose something to you mark his face take his tongue let him loose no just his tongue mark his face that was a bit more than i was-- natural 20 really i'm feeling like such a bastard right now i take my gun i'm going to shoot it very gently-- i'm going to shoot into the ground to muffle the sound i'm going to take the heat of it and i'm going to cauterize it his tongue so he doesn't bleed out i'm going to mark his head with the still-hot gun i'm going to do it and then i say we let him run out the front door and we set fire to the house they don't know we're here he's going to be missing by morning they're going to know we're trying to start a rebellion (giggles) don't make me laugh this is dark shit fair i don't even know what i've been through to a certain extent but yes there's no pretty way to do this i've marked him i'm willing to walk away i know a barracks it's not too far away i think they'll get out when the house catches on fire (sighs heavily) things are more complicated now no but if it was would i tell you thank you that was unexpected (sighs) that's a longer conversation yes let's take him too i give her one of the parchments we're all going to start going out the way we came let's head back to the inn let's try the barracks we'll try the barracks shit okay back to the tavern for now 20 we're going to go into
