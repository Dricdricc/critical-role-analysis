yeah wednesday club next week i don't actually know what we're doing because i haven't looked at the 30-plus messages in that text thread because i've been working on a thing that i can't talk about yet that's going to be really really great that's true what are we going to-- yeah we need a go-to what was going to be our blanket go-to i'm not sure great lakes avengers is actually pretty spectacular it's hard to say it great lakes avengers i haven't read those do they have those do you want to be a guest on the show the doty 6 is going to have a much better camera it's going to have better voice recognition you're really going to be happy with it i kind of want to collapse this cave no not with us in it i don't think we can destroy the ziggurat but i think we can at least make it extremely difficult to find and get to and make it very uncomfortable for anything that tries to come through we saw the spire in both images correct i'm imagining a circle of spheres i think we'll have an easier time keeping track of what is coming in and out if we just have one to deal with as opposed to two i don't know if we have the option i know it's just what if it happens in both places at once it's directly under the castle we would have to maybe fill it with i don't know submerge it or some such there's acid pits let's at least make sure this cave is collapsed we'll leave the chamber standing but every entrance to this cave should be collapsed we know there's three of them we'll be able to get back in if we need to we just want to make sure that no one can wander in and out of here without making a bit of a ruckus one's already blocked we did because we had the mansion how many of those necklaces have we found six necklaces actually i think that's a pretty good idea but you have to remove it from the bag before you walk over to the marble you have to remove the body from the bag before you walk over remove them both all right i kind of want to experiment would you mind losing one of the necklaces or no let's put a necklace on the other cadaver and then throw it through you need the cardio let's not pretend you don't we're going to put one of the necklaces on the body and throw it through it'll still be fun to watch i can only mock you on graph paper i take what i can fucking get man one two three four five six seven eight yes somebody will have to stay behind but we'll figure that out if we go that direction there's other options you we can get him back to whitestone he'll be perfectly fine we have everything we need there of course i say we head back to whitestone we gather resources we figure out how we're getting where we're going to get let's find out we now know they work it's anti-pike armor yes let's not yes i would like to put somebody in this armor in whitestone so that whoever comes through the portal the first thing they see is something that they feel comfortable and familiar with yes well what kind of boots are they we can get you something else nice i have a plan for this armor sense of dignity perhaps we would turn on you so fast let's get back to whitestone well we have thankfully a professional tunnel collapser so let's find the upstairs entrance and get rid of that-- well it's worth noting just in case we cannot find the opening all right let's double-reinforce just pile-drive the one that's already a little collapsed and make it really collapsed and then we'll collapse the others while we're leaving that is more than permission that is permission and an audience we're very excited yes no we're going to be pointing at the things that need to collapse well they can find theirs while we get our tunnels collapsed and we're helping them figure out where to punch to make everything-- all right thank you oh yes that's excellent it's a 19 (laughter) hit this and stand on this side of it and that should do some intense damage and run in this direction (laughter) all right run well done well done not if she's busy dying from both ends how's it going down there have you found it yet yes she jumped in didn't she it never occurred to you to speak common why would i do that i pick up a piece of the local fruit and smell it no i don't think i will i don't think it does naturally awful did it alter grog's stats on any level then it's not that healthy is it it's like agave you could try to bake with it maybe it's bakeable is there a tree that this fruit was coming off of i point at the tree you're really going through with this i still like the idea of perhaps the two of you working together you could talk to scanlan about it and see if he'd be all right-- (laughter) that's everything i wanted i'm good make thy way to the castle we're going to take him to the castle we'll keep you informed we're going to need everybody it's worse than we could have imagined this has to be taken care of immediately we're going to send word out i'm going to take out my flask and put it on the table sit down for a moment we have to get her here immediately let's double-check that armor for any weird influences it may have to make sure it is what it seems to be which is ornamental with a bit of magic let's make sure that the captain of whatever guard is on shift down by the ziggurat is wearing it and is aware that he's there to befuddle the enemy i'm in cassandra's room still just ten seconds of it we'll see how this goes have a bit of that flask we've found a second ziggurat we found a cult that is moving things through it the cult was being led by delilah briarwood she escaped into the ziggurat so she's no longer on this plane of existence but some form of her whether it's undead or otherwise we're going to need to put it down again i wanted you to hear it from me there will be no running this time not from me this is the end of her i will be there to see it we will discover what she did if we can't kill her we will entrap her forever i know i shall i wanted you to hear it from me so you could compose yourself when other people begin to tell you they're going to need us to be the strongest i have faith in you i'll leave you to it i'm so sorry yes i'm going to leave her to her room and shut the door hi honestly better than i expected more sick and less things breaking i'd rather her be sick than angry it does not drive de rolos towards anything good no not at all i'm so glad you thought of me when this came up i think we're going to be walking a very fine line of paranoia for the next however long when they get here we're going to look at everything i think we're going to be fine but you did give me some ideas that i'm going to think about i'm going to take one to the library and inspect it i'm going to also see what any of our other arcanists think of it if it's from a cult that anybody has heard of before really i'm rubbing off on you i have no idea what just happened yeah i'm going to double-check the orb room just for a moment for my own paranoia just to look and then i'm going to start researching that symbol i'm going to go to the library and i'm showing the council everything 22 is it a physical omission from the books or is it even that the books that would cover it are not here books that should cover it that don't and there's no-- i don't know what's happening over here there's nothing that's simple like the more i'm looking i'm looking for mention of the symbols-- keyleth you know damn well where i am right now i'm sitting in the library reading books so if you have something to say oh wow you're going way back is that hercules mulligan four set of corsets i'll let everyone know where i am too i'm in the library reading if anybody needs me if they figure out how bring some up to the library deposit it up a malad previously on hannibal as i was saying 'grand poobah' i knew it was going to bite me in the ass i don't know how it actually sounds really good cured goat meat we're literally reading through old notes right now yes of course well we don't-- the sun tree was here before the castle was here but-- and things have always happened here the city has a history of strange occurrences i'm inclined to believe there was something-- well there was obviously something beneath the castle before she got here or else she wouldn't have come here to begin with and i mean i think it's safe to assume that that's what's down there and that's what they were looking for when they came here in the first place yes she was also i mean-- i'm pulling out my notes well or she wants to become the next vecna we got some of it but they burned a lot it could be we know that she's not ancient because we have a bit of a paper trail we do know that she was ruling in wildmount for a while we do know that she studied at the alabaster lyceum briefly and there's some paperwork for that yeah from what we understand and again there's not much that survived that they tend to cover their tracks they wanted to move well-- and probably collect assets as well which i have been which i've done which i do anywhere that they serve some sort of meat salad i imagine (laughter) you're thinking maybe they have another portal in wildmount yes could be several of them let's not get overly speculative here we were barely there though no because it shut one potential vein of a dozen be nice to the sun tree oh my god they would've come alive if there had been a giant blast of necrotic energy she was preparing to create an army i don't think they had gotten that far yet offerings because they would've become magical once they got to the other side of the portal i mean they would've been great gifts logic is a fickle god it's like watching your game in fast-forward there was nothing we could have done seven of us could go through there's eight one of us would have to stay behind tary's the eighth are we going to go through with tary i'm being such an asshole right now i say we speak with allura and if this looks-- i think the plan is we take the fight to them laura and i think that it's not time to check the doors it's time to go out and chase the monsters if we take care of them it doesn't matter how many ziggurats there are hope we don't miss one travel the world let's have an evening and then tomorrow we'll-- collect what we've learned and if we're prepared jump into a sphere of death if you can figure out a way to use one of these to create a plane shift that you'll feel comfortable with then i'm all right with that let's all get some sleep and in the morning we're going to take care of this one way or the other we'll take this fight to them he likes you well he doesn't dislike you any more than he dislikes anybody else he's terrible isn't he we have a chalice room hey do you want to buy a chalice sipping cups what do you need what am i going to do with all these chalices this is the equivalent of the head shot on the wall for the chalice on the go i'm going to make sure i have enough powder and shot for a bit of a jaunt so i'm going into the stores of what we make here and reloading i'm also going to try and make some silver shot i've never tried it before not a ton i want to try and make 12 i want to see if i can make 12 it's intelligence intelligence check plus my proficiency that's 19 which is why i was going to then take those to pike i don't entirely understand how this works but i had an idea and i show her the 12 silver bearings basically would you know how to bless something like this i think this might come in handy it's a wild idea i don't know i'm trying to think of surprising her with something they're a bit hard to make and they may just not be useful at all but i thought i don't know how any of this works thank you she's going to keep trying to listen to one word technically speaking you've been on salary that's just been sitting on your bedside hasn't it slowly making the sound of crying anything else he'll have to come back anyway because he doesn't know how to make the ammo for his gun they're musket balls technically they're not bullets we also have to modify one of the necklaces but we have enough necklaces that we could just jump through i can think of many reasons why that's probably not a good idea the bag of holding is a negative space it's not designed to sustain life very specifically not because things die in there what if the things inside take the damage even if they are in the bag of holding no this is not a magic you want to be messing around with no this is the fantasy equivalent of locking yourself in a refrigerator i feel comfortable with the level of risk-taking of jumping into a giant sphere that crushes anything it touches careful where you aim that you might break a camera let's grab a bit of funds do we have the group funds as well we have access to the group funds not yet what if nothing's waiting for us on the other side because now we're down one heroes' feast then we dive into the mansion and we have a heroes' feast i think we're going to be okay i think over-cautious even when jumping into the depths of the undead there's such a thing as over-cautious i'm putting the-- as i hit the microphone do not touch your microphone when you put on your necklace i'm putting on my necklace i want them to see me coming who first well that happened 23 no i have other qualities history was not my forefront i know whitestone nine can we consult the rand mcnally i imagine it'll take a few days when it's done i don't expect us to be in and out of here i think this is going to take some time 22 towards the city the building on the left i'd say i'm going to crawl up the wall to the second floor to see what's up there it's been cleaned out there's no sign of anybody who used to be here nothing of value nothing of interest i think we're going to have to move deeper in straight hole right through the head no jaw slowly make our way to the town left right left step step step (laughter) you make it sound so tawdry carry on let's make our way into town quietly yes we're not doing-- i mean the chained-- the chained oblivion there was a fight between that mark couldn't have ended up-- i don't know are there any buildings that have enough structure to them where it feels like there might be things inside that have been relatively unmolested at this point 12 but they're cultists kill two keep one to question god can we even kill people here will they die let's cut them off when they walk by the house push them incapacitating at the very least the head is cleaved from the body oh yes this will be fun i take out a small three-inch steel ball i look him right in the eye and go manners and i toss the steel ball at our friend the iron bands i actually make a ranged attack roll makes me feel better thank god that's still fine 23 excellent this thing will allow him to talk i believe this thing has a i give him a second to sit and i wait until we're all inside with advantage he has advantage this may be how they move freely i'm going to let you speak and we're going to have a conversation given where you are the circumstances that we find you in i'm going to let you know that there is a curse upon my weapon and the souls that are killed with this weapon are claimed by a demon named orthax now i haven't experimented as to what happens when somebody's soul is claimed by more than one creature but i'm excited to find out so wouldn't it be interesting if everything you've been promised here is suddenly null and void so yes we may threaten your life but i want you to know that what's really at stake here is just precisely what's left of your soul so answer with caution and i unlock fucking dice no love on that one terrible eight this sort of thing isn't going to get us anywhere pike think you can give him back his eye where are you from the ziggurats there's three of them you've come through the wildemount one i close the mouth we don't need a distraction we need quiet at this point i'll release him and you do your business all right manners thank you it's programmable grab the necklaces and the cloaks and the censer all three of them we can't keep everything is there anything of interest in this building since we have a moment 15 i say we make our way towards the spire all it needs is honey and brie pj's mimosas and very old puppies charlie can run trinket
