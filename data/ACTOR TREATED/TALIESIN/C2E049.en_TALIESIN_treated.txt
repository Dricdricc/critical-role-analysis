i've been enjoying the crossover of a whole bunch of critical role fans going who's logic and then a whole bunch of logic fans going what's critical role i was like this is going to be a train wreck of happiness i'm so excited ah there's dragons put it back ah too much let me see that we are a target i think we need somewhere safe to talk i think there's a lot of things we need to cement up no obviously not we need privacy not me no secrets open book does your husband know does he not know so he knows you're alive he'll know you nott you ran and got help and here we are it's the right thing to do we're here to help we're here now we just have to take some time think carefully and slowly we can do something about this but you're going to have to trust us and you're going to have to be careful because if we move too quickly we're just going to go running the wrong direction and alone and you need help would it help if we cleared your head well if you need a minute to be here we maybe sift some of the contents of that flask out of you for a little while just for a minute you can get back to it when you need it but for now maybe impulse may not be your friend right now i'm going to try and do that we had a brief conversation about that last week yeah i have to know what it is i have to be going for it i am so sorry sometimes the truth takes a little while to get there yeah maybe somewhere where we can sleep too we know that there are tunnels well maybe we should find somewhere in town to hold up and we'll keep you out of sight what's your husband's name i think perhaps if we're going to we should come together with a game plan i think it would be respectable if people thought that someone was looking for yeza in his interests people will be less suspicious if we're asking questions about someone who disappeared if we were perhaps hired by a trust fund of your son or otherwise and this is something that is owed to him it's just business we don't have to let them know it's personal that's a lot you can take your time as you're ready i'll also say we can start the wagon up and i can drive and keep an eye out if you're all inside the wagon no one's going to see any of you it may be in the end safer staying in town people staying in the woods seem like they're trying to avoid something and there's a lot of soldiers if you're on business you go to town even if the town's a little rough we'll keep going around when it's time to go i think maybe we go into town and get a room maybe make a little bubble in the room if we have to we're going to take a scenic route i'll take a long time and if i see people i'm not going to drive towards them it was very brave anywhere west really not a bad idea i don't know if necessarily crossing the border is the way to go but at least going further inland safe as anything that's not a bad idea send a letter ask bryce if they can take care of this i imagine if we pack a few gold in it's not much to find some room and board for a couple people or send word stop stop i mean that's what you would do if you're doing the telegram stop laura right okay i'm going to cast sending signed oh water in the ear it's nothing i also want to get a sense of things so we're going to take a lazy meander around the area i want to get a sense of where things are get a map in my head and i'm going to be paying very close attention no on the outskirts i'm going to keep going around until they that's okay it's all right eight wait no i'm so sorry that's wrong 13 all right does it look like they've discovered the tunnels or no that'll be for civilization that's cool i'm on the lookout and i will let anybody know if anyone's within 60 yards i think i'm listening but i'm not doing a very good job of it because i'm-- (whispering) shut up travis uh yeah i'll have some if someone's making something (laughter) very off-camera hey if you all don't stop arguing i'm going to turn this cart right around i don't know if you were arguing i've just always wanted to say that man i'm going to start heading back to town regardless it's getting cold it's like you two have been reading tumblr this is so-- sorry carry on wait what you trying to find out if someone's alive i can do that moms gone wild what hmm i would just-- i have a little ritual in the morning meditate on it see if i can feel anything tugging in some direction and i couldn't know much but i could know something it's a divine force but i don't think that it would-- well i mean i'd have to sleep i couldn't know much but i could maybe at the very least give you a yes/no maybe well i'm happy we're coming to town to talk to this famous alchemist and this has really thrown something into our plans i don't know what-- do people throw monkeys into plans what do people throw a wrench yeah this has wrenched our monkey hmm not a bad idea i'm already heading that way i think i've still got a little bit of time on my shaggy redhead wait no am i out now crownsguard is probably our best bet if some of the people we're looking for happen to be still missing in the aftermath then all right this is going to sound weird but is there a florist around or anybody who deals with exotics exotic herbs plants or otherwise something exciting i'm looking forward to a little quiet i need something it's nice to have something complicated to use to focus myself mm not quite but yeah anything preferably some sort of flower or living plant but if it's-- the notion is i'm looking for something that is a testament to the abilities of the wildmother so anything that is a gift from her to us something impressive something beautiful something tasty i've never tried honey i don't know if it would work but that's interesting i usually tend to stick a little closer to the source i also don't really necessarily know how i would perform the ritual with honey i honestly don't know the difference between molasses and honey tree poop and bee poop that might be interesting but i think i should probably see if there's anything around possibly i'm not sure how that relates but that is a very beautiful feather do you want to roll okay no i'll roll it because my investigation is amazing here we go come on ah that's a natural 20 that brings me to a-- that's a 19 then i'm hoping to find an orchid or something something interesting it's as if you knew what i was doing thank you (laughs) thank you and here goes 25 gold that's all i needed to do really that was my pre-game that soldier was totally hitting on you he wasn't even here when the fighting happened he was lying sorry so brave sorry oh oh is there a furniture maker in town because i really would like to ask them questions about that chair i'm done i'm done i'm good this is my attempt to rally everybody it worked i swear don't look at me like that jesus oh god there's just dicks over there i don't know what to do just potential dicks now that's better kryn still we should at least investigate this lead now and tomorrow if we don't know what's going on i can-- and i warn you i will do this but i'm going to get a little exhausted doing it-- i can at least give us some sense of what's ahead it could hurt let's take a look at these tunnels i'm actually very curious about this we'll get a little food and then we'll check it out by night it wasn't our intention but things being what they are this seems to be the new reality of the world doesn't it i can walk through stone i mean i'd want to know where i was going and i can only go alone i would imagine so as well just honey all the way back travis and we should have this conversation in here because i want to take a look around in this thing yeah they offered us light it's all in the stone i mean yeah unless anybody's got an objection no i'm just walking oh is that true oh i didn't know that well i don't have that as an option right now anyway there's no marking on it this is an obviously organically-carved tunnel the footprints going in and out there's nothing-- wow never really done one of those 19 in both directions all right interesting very interesting they were definitely in here and they definitely left this way my radar what do you mean detect magic nothing really just for fun because we can eyes of the grave too just for fun no i figured nothing we could message in the morning and i can't guarantee this but we'll at least know if he's alive and maybe a sense of whether or not he's above ground or below ground and that'll certainly inform our decision maybe i'll glean what i can but it's a soft process i'm going to try something really quickly just for fun i'm going to use thaumaturgy really quickly and i'm going to broadcast a low bass chant and i'm going to throw it as far forward down that tunnel as i possibly can to see if i can get some sort of vibration coming back that they can hear i'm going to start throwing this (low bass humming) if there's air to vibrate or i'm making sound in solid rock as a boosting of your-- it may not work trying to use some sort of nature theory here you can get really loud that's the question is can i get loud enough to hear myself like if i was trapped in there or am i-- yeah straight wisdom check 13 (low rumbling noises) honestly i'm going to try and see and cut it off to see if there's an echo coming through the rocks basically in that split second into it 18 how deep are we underground right now okay cool i'm just going to do that i'm not going to inform anybody of anything that just happened and be like okay i'm good thank you for that wow that was good i tried to get a sense if there was something beyond that i don't know i got a hint of something i think maybe there's something past that wall i can't know that until dawn if we do decide to go that direction i think that there is definitely a chance that we could dig far enough and deep enough to make passage we'll know tomorrow does make one wonder why they haven't done that yet this is all very confusing do we want to poke this thing tonight or do we not not the tunnel i mean-- we have an object we have another object maybe we haven't really-- i mean i doubt that we really understand what we have but-- i mean we have these things right now i kind of do i suppose i'll follow the group but-- -- i'm here because where i was i was out of options we've definitely found some options i don't know what they mean yet but i went looking for them and here we are that's right has been for a while the forest that surrounds it the corrupted forest is overtaking it as if the magic that held it in place is being supplanted i'm of the opinion that that shouldn't be happening there are several other-- we're not the only site like our own we haven't had much communication with the other sites so i don't know if it's happening anywhere else i wouldn't even know who to send it to we're supposed to protect that place and i was running out of ideas my family oh lots i mean depending on when and where members of my family and others have been protecting that place for as long as it has existed we built the temple we founded it no they all left yeah and none of them have come back not really i feel like she would let me know if i needed to know that's not an answer i really want the-- that's not an answer i'm looking for right now i'm sure you understand best to have faith and not second guess how she's decided to move forward if i recall corin talked about trying to find some of the other temples but i don't know no one's come back when you came around i had an inkling that it was supposed to be my job to do this from the beginning and that i had been shirking my duties you all seemed like a very good sign that it was time to take some responsibility those who knew me called me geoff (laughter) it's a good name spelled it with a g i've got nothing to hide g what's wrong with you don't even-- now i have anxiety i may not sleep tonight now it's a lot of pressure to put on a person oh this is caffeinated i'm going to be up all night yeah i just want home back i want to know that it's safe again you're always welcome where i live until you're ready for something else what is their real name you've been lying you don't even have a leg to stand on (groaning) here to bring the awkward i'm going to find an appropriate spot somewhere quiet somewhere with a view somewhere where the wildmother's work is well at hand mm-hmm you've entirely thrown me yeah i was going to basically go for the same thing i did last time if that still suits unless you would like me to shift a little bit for your own-- a goal hmm yessa i want to make sure i'm getting the name right right yeza i sit make my circle what is yeza's destination pushing a few days forward ghor dranas that's all i have probably seems silly to move someone who isn't we may get lucky if we go into the tunnel they may still be preparing at some point to head in that direction they're not there yet they haven't made it that far yet though it's where they will be not where they are the north is looking interesting i think trouble's going to close up on us no matter what i feel like it might be a sign we've got a cart i'm not even kidding a bit i'll also say it's not the worst of the war right now is ghor dranas that's past it it's the war room also in tunnels built for war that's the thing there's no fighting the war we don't have to that's the thing it's really not about that though is it i'm also i will admit not feeling very positive about the tunnels but we should take a look because the other option is the cart i believe you gave them quite a bit of money there's probably people coming and going on most of these roads who are used to moving people across scarred for life you're good with kids i imagine yep total do you want advantage on that or do you want me to join you all right trying to be good about this that's 17 no elves all right not with intense gravitas i assume that we live in a liefeld universe where as you're born you accumulate pockets slowly all over you all the way down the ankle yeah i'm so sorry i'm all out let's head to the tunnel and if that doesn't pan out we'll start heading north we honestly first have to even see if it's possible to get in there i have a funny feeling that this is less of a we can walk all the way to albuquerque as more as a there's possibly something down there or they're still in there that's just a little bit of a-- i don't think they've been moving the whole time we pinged something in the center cave and we just needed to reconvene before we came back to take a look at it actually he'll keep talking like this if we don't get him to work i don't know how that-- i don't really-- i'm on you fjord and i-- we don't really know what this is going to look like yet we're all going in are you going to be all right what's big a tiny gopher wait a minute can you make people bigger can you make a honey badger bigger wait don't be an elk you rolled really well though hit the view-- yeah there you go i get lost in here so i feel it i'm going to cast bless on the honey badger just to see if that will help i'm going to bless the honey badger i'm going to start tapping on the walls of that tunnel-- well no that tunnel's really thin if we can-- and bless add your plus four your d4 minecraft no i'm not-- i don't know where we are you'd have to flip around and come back i suppose do not send the cleric into the pit of the unknown we have all the dumb shit we shouldn't have at the last second i'm going to be the last one who's the last one going through the tunnel before we head over yeah we've just gotten access to a small pocket that we're just going to check out make sure everything's safe and appropriate we'll have a full report once we've finished taking a look inside and we'll be delivering it but in the meantime let's not cause any undue panic we'll let you know or we'll make some noise if anything dangerous is down there it still could not be safe you're welcome to come but i'm not sure if it's going to be-- i can't guarantee any safety beyond this point okay thank you okay that's a 20 thank you sir i appreciate everything that you do and-- if things go real wrong you'll definitely hear us i'll make sure that he's quiet because we don't mind losing him i appreciate that crazy like a badger (badger noises) i'm into it mm-hmm out of curiosity those crystals feel utterly natural right it just feels like those were not-- all right seven all right i'm thinking about detect-- nah just before we move on is anyone bothered by these crystals is this-- i'm a little out of my element which is surprising to say it's difficult because we don't really understand how they work all right let's all prepare to be a little confused by whatever we find we're going to be way out of our element matt and if we start to hear something aww tourist trap let's go we're going to take a long rest at some point i mean we're moving but we're going to obviously have to sleep we might find a portal down here you don't know what's here a tiny subterranean boat filled with gummy bears three constitution modifier auto-adds i'm already going for it i'm doubling the range of my spellcasting yep i want to be able to heal from a great distance when you cast a spell that requires you to make an attack roll the spell's range is doubled your ranged spell attacks ignore half cover and three-quarter cover you learn one cantrip that requires an attack roll choose the cantrip from the cleric or druid spell list your spellcasting ability for this cantrip is wisdom oh really oh that may change my decision then or like bane or bless it doesn't help okay that changes things i may play with that i've literally taken it twice already i mean i had options but i don't remember what they are off the top of my head it's the thief of one-shots or the vending machine is running against him
