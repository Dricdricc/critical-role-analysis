important things okay this is what's important i think this seems like the sort of job we'd want to take laura as i think you are all aware and since we are about to risk our lives yes happily 14 inspiration dice are d8 the ale is that good to a contract to risking our lives for money we're as surprised as anybody which is why we're gonna take a proper nap i think we should go buy some potions

the fact that you just checked your inventory for that worries me we have time we might as well i figure we do that after can i assist on that it's a 10 if you rolled a one there's nothing i can do anyway did you actually try to walk up perhaps you should before you do anything just try and walk up we've been middling of course sir we completely understand if you're not up to such a challenge it makes perfect sense and we'll be more than happy to go and buy some wares somewhere else if this is too much for you yes let's go buy some potions classy healing potions you're tearing the party apart

guys we're on an elevator i'm on an elevator with a bear thank you it's a mine canary yeah i'm having a serious tom sawyer island vibe percy was the third child of seven children born to a noble family who lived far to the north in the ancient castle of whitestone with so many siblings to share the burdens of lordship percy turned his attention to the sciences engineering and naturalism one day a mysterious couple named lord and lady briarwood came to court during a feast held in their honor the briarwoods violently took control of the castle killing or imprisoning everyone who would stand in their way percy awoke chained in the dungeon only to be freed by his younger sister together they fled chased by the briarwoods' men as they ran percy's sister took several arrows to the chest and fell percy kept running eventually jumping into a freezing river and floating unconscious to freedom he did not remember waking up on a fishing boat he barely remembered the next two years as he slowly made his way as far south as possible then one night percy had a dream a roaring cloud of smoke offered him vengeance against those who destroyed his family when he awoke percy began to design his first gun (gun cocking) (gun firing) a cave bear how did you do that damn it ah 17 that hits i'm going to use a gunslinger's dodge wait let's see if i can do this it's not enough nevermind
