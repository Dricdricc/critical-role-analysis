we do i would probably be about there i had my boots on so i was up by his face so all of their faces are indented 16 what do you do hot shot oh yeah thank you for reminding me we're pretty metal i'm going to cry out to everyone we need their heads don't hit them in the face please i am engaged i know there's nothing i can do i am engaged with that thing aren't i i don't know i'm going to try and take a run in the other direction i know it's going to take a swing at me yep i'm running down the wall yep as far as i can go i'll start coming that way too not a full-- it's six spaces so-- 19 just hits ac's 18 34 points okay so hold on let me do the math on that (counting) okay yeah i'm at 151 because i had a whole bunch of temporary points i pull up i'm going to take my first shot i'm going to take a straight shot and i'm going to blow a point of grit we'll get to that and i'm going to try to get him to drop his sword first thing is i'm going to try and get him to drop the sword that's a 34 to hit strength save against a 20 drop your sword okay so that was shot number one oh boy here we go i've also got to do damage on that which is-- i'm so sorry where are all my dice there we are oh i didn't do that so none of that where are we going i'm going to drop three points of cabal into this as well oh there we are six points of psychic damage four points of lightning damage and 16 points of standard piercing damage animus next thing i'm going to do i'm going to cast hex on him give him disadvantage on strength saving throws strength ability checks and i'm going to take a sharpshooter shot that's 20 okay good to know making that note so i'm going to drop three more points of cabal into that so that's 20 points of piercing damage four points of psychic damage 13 points of lightning damage and three points of necrotic damage and last shot i'm going to try and push him ten feet back natural 20 (cheering) but he got pushed ten feet back and hey i get a grit point back so he's got to move ten feet before he can pick up his sword and that's everything oh it's going to hurt remember you have the temporary hit points how very santa monica (groaning) fire good the one closest to us or the one on the other side oh it's on the ground okay i think it's lost in space welcome to my world man i'm going to spend a point of dead-eye to that last one that's on the ground and i think that cancels out the disadvantage yeah let's just shoot him yeah that's a 27 that's ten points of damage two points of necrotic two points of psychic and do the same that's 32 what a senseless waste of human life laura and tarot cards are fine all of them ten points of coffee damage that's nine points of normal damage two points of psychic damage six points of necrotic and for my third shot that's 30 points that's 17 points of normal damage four points of necrotic one point of psychic i want to pour a cup of coffee-- (laughter) i'm going to sit i've already got him second time i'm going to find very carefully every little crack and i'm going to get him in there i'm going to listen to them bang around on the interior i'm going to rattle them around it's going to be fine holy cow i have a coffee problem you would think and i've been drinking it all night i don't know ignore me we can always put it underneath the smelter and pour in we've got to do all three heads we have the platinum let's see what happens let's smelt the platinum into the heads i think we're going to put all three into the one that'll do let's try this okay so if we fit these together-- does this now make another concave piece so i've still got some spider climb so i'm going to grab one and lift up all the fliers are the coals hot or are the coals cold i want to see if there's anything in the holes that were left by the soldiers who left the three suits of armor came out of the wall so there's now a wall that we haven't seen behind them i'm going to do all three but i'll start on the one on the left that's investigation check what did you do six yeah it's also a three so when three pieces go together the part that goes towards the wall-- all right it is a pyramid so the whole pyramid goes in the wall why would it be gold that's true i have one other thought what's the red armor made out of i can take a look what would that be so that's intelligence plus my normal tinker check so that's not bad let's see oh wow that's 32 only in a glass volcano no i think it will melt we can give it a shot can't we that's a terrible idea let's try gold i would have felt very foolish we'll try the gold i'm pulling it out it's going to be another door no no i never saw national treasure okay well we'll make an evening of it i know it's a lot of sound we don't even notice him leave be bold we're going to have to get his attention somehow it's a crazy plan but it just might work gef√ºlten yes i speak celestial (laughs) you can bury that as deep as you want well you know it's like a whole thing yeah it's would be dex or strength in celestial i'm going to say hello i'm going to say it out hello we come seeking the allhammer we need help vecna walks the earth again we come seeking a way to defeat him once again we come with the blessings of pelor and i'm going to start entering very gingerly grog i keep walking we ask permission to use the anvil that's fair man i could really use spider climb right now goddamn it what kind of runes 11 okay do we have our bits of god we might want to have them available for the moment i kept track of which one was the hammer is he another golem i'm going to try and sneak around the side of it what's behind it 19 are those bellows or is it more complicated what would happen if we put that machine out i think that it feels like a guardian what if we put the water elemental in the-- i want to put the engineering behind it out i want to put those pistons out and i was wearing it yesterday a more masculine cut of this exact shirt not that exact shirt but another one very similar to it you can get a pin you can get a hoodie you can get any form you want 24 what you're not okay oh six i'm going to bake a pie and deliver it-- okay i'm going to run back towards that red crystal yep i run that direction and then i'm going to use my bonus action to do that i'm going to hold my attack until his attack this is really intimidating the crystals are glowing and it makes me unhappy is your crystal red too (gasping) okay so if he's going to do this i was holding my attack i'm taking my attack now right before this happens he has no face does he there's no face so if i were to make a head attack that would probably be really goddamn useless one way to find out maybe it's a mask fire a grit to hide his shame do i add the d4 to this if i so am inclined and i can do it every time oh wow this is so nuts so first attack out of curiosity does it keep my misfire does it knock me out of misfire technically goddamn it okay let's put that away then and let's take some psychic damage because that's funny oh that's great okay yeah so 142 that's cool ow i'm going to put that down and get a bigger gun and try that again and that blows that grit as well much better no it's not oh my god oh my fucking god it's just doing it never mind i'm going to blow the rest of it and spend the end of my turn trying to fix one of my guns really quickly and do a quick clear-out which is 12 versus misfire on the psychic and i do i cleared animus bad news is still out of commission and that's my turn never mind and you took 28 points what okay good to know there's a lot of fires to put out i guess not like he was really-- i was going to say can you dissipate it oh that's okay you could kind of do that you don't get to save against this does he so first thing i'm going to do is get a quick little heal bonus going because why not let's do a heal so that's 14 points up so i'm 156 a little bit better and that's my heal i'm noticing that this thing's only taking magic damage the hammer it dropped is underneath the planetar right now right i'm going to run in that direction molten metal and rock i can't jump that can i not an acrobatics check i take it but there are chains that i can reach there well i'm going to attempt to grab the hammer if it's available for a swing i'll try for a swing roll with advantage athletics natural 20 (cheering) this is the hammer chain so am i touching the hammer right now but it's not a magic hammer it's just a really nice hammer yeah i'm going to take a moment to look at it i've got an action still yeah i'll use my action to admire the hammer no i have an arcana of seven god fucking damn it okay i'm hopping off then yeah all right i'm over there hiding fuck technically it'll lower slightly lower than where it's supposed to be because it doesn't just halve the doubling of the dice you got an arrow which didn't probably do any physical-- we can still do that oh shit is that including your dex save oh wow oh man this is so bad here's the question i should know this how quickly can these things be made you could grab the hammer i don't know maybe it's a control hammer i don't know i'm grasping at fucking straws here you've got actions grabbing that hammer is definitely an option i let go plus a d4 god fucking damn it the rest are other tools with a d4 i feel like we're missing at something really hard i'm going to run all the way back to the back of the room i'm going to put as much distance-- well actually i'll take my shots first i've got animus up so i'm going to spend a point on it i'm running out of grit and i'm going to try and take a shot on this guy 36 that hits i assume so that's 1d10 plus 1d6 and then i'm also going to blow the last of my lightning into that as well that's 18 points of standard damage two points of psychic damage and 15 points of lightning damage that's one shot this is my last advantage shot i'm going to take another advantage shot on him here we go that's 24 on the advantage shot here we go 15 points of damage plus three points of psychic damage i should start taking track of this shooting again no advantage 20 i'm going to burn an action surge and take three more shots and i'll roll 3d20 actually hold on no it wouldn't matter 22 yeah it doesn't actually hit so here we go taking three shots oh my god so this is great i take three more shots first one is 29 so that hits no they did not so this is going to be fine i did roll the other two 19 and 19 which are both criticals i got two criticals that we're going to get into first shot is not a critical that's 12 points of damage and one point of psychic damage and then let me get an extra d10 and an extra d6 this is weird new critical new type of critical critical damage that's 11 points of psychic damage yeah and 20 points of normal damage 20 normal and 11 points of psychic and now the next critical hit oh my god that's a terrible roll that's okay 12 points of normal damage and six points of psychic damage and so the two of those combined cut in half is what he takes next round's bleed damage i'm running in the opposite direction oh and that's two crits which means i get two grits back i'm like (grunts) that way this is just what you're going to be doing you can move you have a bonus action oh that also means he takes his bleed damage this turn i'm so excited by how you're doing this here this is some crazy shit it's a blind elemental yeah and the minute you take your turn you can make a reckless attack don't say let's see i was going to say you are the heavy damage dealer so far oh but you're not blind anymore oh that's right you avoided it that's okay let's not test that reroll ones taking three shots and that's a 34 to hit anything that didn't hit i'm going to run bless so that's 15 points of damage five points psychic that's 24 that misses and then the other one misses burning an action surge for three more shots burning a grit for advantage so advantage number one is a 17 to hit 26 that hits let's put that away that's not helpful anymore that's 13 points of damage two points psychic next advantage shot that's a natural 20 that's seven points of psychic damage oh shit that's 28 points of piercing damage plus seven points psychic half that damage next round total (counting) that's 34 next round on its turn i'm burning another grit for my final shot yeah i can do a lot of things with it but he's so big this is my best shot because his ac is so fucking high that's 31 to hit and that's 16 points of damage and one point of psychic damage and i'm running towards that fire pit straight back i can't whirl around it that'll do is he blind is he still blind gnome-kicking is a time-honored tradition knock it off god fucking damn it do you re-roll those sam your inspiration is a long rest recharge not a short rest right oh if we take a short rest he can inspire us when we do this i want to sit down we do need to discuss this 18 and now i'm up to top again and it only took two hit dice and then i get my heal back i get my action surges back grit comes back on a short rest i'm going to really quickly fix bad news all right i fixed bad news wow and so many things don't work anymore okay yeah oh my hex is burned my spider climb's burned diplomacy is a long rest before that goes again no i know how to do it we're going to have to smelt them we're going to have to start with smelting them well i don't know you know the process i don't why am i in character talking to the dungeon master what's happening ah the meta put that one away bigby isn't though we hurry to the other room if we can get any inspiration too before we start this process let's just smelt for now at which you have advantage yeah figure out what dex plus proficiency whatever your dex plus prof is how long does inspiration last for let's wait until the final-- there's probably everything we need in here if we take a look around we're going to need water one at a time with advantage no let's just do it advantage can i help with this oh god okay advantage and inspiration he already rolled well let's see what do i have to do make an investigation check glad i got that roll out of the way i'm going to try picking the hammer up i'm going to try and attune to it i'm going to examine it make another arcana check let's see what happens oh that's better 21 i'll drop animus for now well technically that's a dex check so if you have cat's grace i'll take it if you have any inspiration i'll also take it that's without inspiration that's 31 i might be able to inspiration this because that was a really bad roll both of them are the same both of them are two and this is not one of those things where i can fix it's either good or it's bad i'm going to try and add a little bit of inspiration maybe that's not very good that's 17 can i get one more inspiration if you got any are you out let's take another one just in case because jesus fucking christ okay please i will happily take that inspiration please it's a skill check it's not a save oh wait i don't get to add anything from the hammer for this i think it has to be soft right i think we have to do it now right give me one more inspiration if you can and we'll see where we go i don't feel good that'll do 18 28 30 that's not bad yeah so that's 34 (cheering) and i faint (laughter) well i think we'll assume that we're going to take a mansion rest and we'll come out of a mansion rest can we assume that's going to be it so we can plane shift mansion wherever we need are we going straight to him all right mansion so let's plane shift somewhere and mansion we need to rest let's rest yeah ignore it
