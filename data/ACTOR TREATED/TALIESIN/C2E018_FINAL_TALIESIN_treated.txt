wow (laughter continues) i haven't gotten there yet i think if the dice know that they could go to a kinder gentler home that's mildly adequate 14 i should take it because for now make your life a little easier because i can keep disadvantage for your turn i was going to say what was the number because that thing's got to have a low ac what's the actual number i'm up how dumb do i feel like being if it's turned towards fjord then i'm going to run around to the opposite side of it for flanking bonus i'm going to take two slices into his leg see i didn't do it and then you just went ahead and did it i'm working so hard not to do it what's the flanking bonus by the way all right so this is advantage on the attack no not very often i was trying to remember i'm not feeling good about that one here we are that's a 25 to hit i assume i don't get the extra bonus for radiant (counting) eight points of damage then the next one is a natural 20 that's 14 points of damage all right yeah i'm holding is he going to attack me i'm definitely using blood maledict then at full use that was not good that was bad all right that's all right yeah and the next one yeah that hits i'm out he has disadvantage on his next attack as well way too happy about that ten damage also does that mean that his reaction has been burned by the legendary action is the legendary action a separate thing from-- all right so he's still got a reaction just checking i don't (humming) that was not the critical which you do not do so you're just unconscious yeah you're out yeah but not that almost-- yeah oh i don't have to i get shocked from my-- the chest the heart locket sparks and-- what ready for this it's really cool no when you wear this pendant you stabilize whenever you are dying at the start of your turn in addition whenever you roll hit dice to regain hit points the number of hit points-- i'm unconscious but i'm breathing i'm just (deep breath) was that with the hex you have to hit the confirm button that's why i was like get it closer does she roll the healing potion if i take it or do i roll it okay because i was curious if my locket gives me-- does it count as my hit dice or no okay thank you i'm going to crawl behind there and at the very least i can-- to the west behind that rock right there i can at the very least keep trying to give him disadvantage on at least one attack or also because he'll get the one legendary but other than that it's whatever we can get the fullest round technically he hasn't had a-- oh no he did because it's a whole round back never mind i'm working every bloody angle i can think of i'm going to go ahead and say (demonic voice) you got hit in the face with a piece of lollipop i'm going to attempt to do four psychic damage and give him-- (sigh) will you roll under 15 eventually okay i know (whisper) shh go to sleep is there a heal spell in the house (groan) that helps i need a drink molly charmed that'll do frequently not always sometimes we're out and about i can't believe i find myself agreeing with nott here we should get out of town while it's still possible you leave the table when you've got the pot you don't wait for everything to go back to the dealer at some point they're going to start looking for people to fight this war and i'm not sure i want to be around for it because boy they know who we are now i still have a giant tapestry over my shoulder i put it down before the fight yes i actually think maybe it should be her and beau because they won't recognize her and human faces tend to blend into the crowd whereas we do not i'm not remember how we talked about getting you out in the world more and then you said you didn't want to but then we said you're going to have to do it anyway this is those times she'll take care of you let's not even start making vague promises just be yourself and you'll be fine just be anybody but yourself and you'll be fine it's going to be great wow that was cocked that looked like it went well how bad was it you said both of those things it didn't devolve into a punching fest that's pretty good oh my god you've discovered why she's been with my circus all this time working as a bouncer if they try and kill you to get answers then this way you don't know anything then you're really not worth anything sea anemone sea anemone what side are you on exactly finish the evening off right i'll honestly say i'd like to get out of here as soon as possible so they don't think we're running from the news we get out of here before the news hits i don't care i'm just happier moving than staying still if it were just the two of us i'd say leave tonight but-- see if we can make it faster but 24 hours is not terrifying no later than dusk i would like to get out before news starts to spread before they decide to start locking down the holes that's a fair point are you drinking every random cup or are you pouring them all into one cup you're a trash person i walk over and i take your last drink and drink it and salute i know up early in the morning yes gluten almonds we're all going to be here to see this open right very fair massage so long as there's a cobalt soul scholastic fair really hmm it's more than we used to make in a year easily how deep of a sleeper are you cool we'll find out i'm going to go downstairs i'm going to at least need the best masseuse they have who's also willing to do other interesting things and someone to feed me and talk to me as the entire thing is going on i would imagine so fruit don't be crass that's just weird best hands best conversationalist surprise me i pay it and you can sleep through it or not if you like welcome back to college man oh yes had you not put that together yet we got two rooms oh excellent are you on the bed okay i'm going to take the bed and i'm going to take my full massage and otherwise if you would also like some food i'm sure they'd be willing to-- oh i'm sure at the very least i knock on the door and say i'm having fruit if anyone wants anything it's mostly ridiculous conversation through this whole thing yeah (loud giggling) oh is the food arriving okay in that case i am going to enter-- oh no i've thought about this i had time to think while watching things outside not you guys i've got the remnants of the fruit i'm coming in with the food into their room and i am wearing nothing but my tapestry (laughter) it's good i got through a lot of this if anybody had any questions they want to ask laura's in the bathroom-- just looking forward to wearing a giant platinum dragon that's all i wanted we have a cart i'm going to get the map i'm happy to move in whatever direction anybody likes what's the good side of this then what's your best-case scenario if they lock the gates or start conscripting-- i don't know what they'd do all i know is i don't want to hang out and obviously we've made a bit of a reputation for ourselves he's an ally now have you literally never left a town without telling everybody because you know there's a possibility you're going to get conscripted to go fight a war see that sounds like our speed not conscripting into fighting on the front lines don't think they don't know our names now i think we should be careful because the longer we're in town the more people we talk to the more people might decide that they're invested in us staying to dolan's we'll meet up at pumat's we can pull matt's soul we're going to do our best we're going to see how it's going to be just a thought to check the board also get our stuff from the leaky tap possible private escorts private escort either north or-- sure you have our deepest sympathies at your position this is obviously going to be a very difficult time that's a lot i think it's the gentleman i feel like 10000 gold is buying an awful lot of cooperation more cooperation than i think i'm capable of then we'll meet them at the shop you wrote all this we did our taxes yeah i would imagine right now especially do you feellucky travis and let's go to pumat's and let's get the rest of them together i'm sure by now-- no i think we should get out of town while the getting's good you're conscripted once you start earning that 10000 or you sign it and then the next time you come across some soldiers of the empire they have you executed for treason for running off on it oh i don't know sounds like an expensive enemy to make i'm legitimately happy to go in any direction far away from the front line personally i think it's a slippery slope it's conscription i agree they say there's kids disappearing up north i like it do we make a polite exit at the least or do we just bugger out i'm fair for that just in case the dm's guide i couldn't make potions with alchemist supplies could i all right quick huddle i'm happy just to leave the city do you have a lozenge shouldn't be offering things that you don't have if we happen to bring him in even if we weren't under contract-- i'm too tired to make proper decisions should have left in the middle of the goddamn night knew it was coming d10 for me six i add six to the rolled hp all right oh wait i get a bunch of weird shit we're going to have to have a talk i get a new blood curse i want to have a conversation about that before we go into that i'm excited to see what insane shit i can do my proficiency bonus did it automatically go up that is the best birthday meal
