roaches i can be active in the chatroom i'll be so active in the chatroom i hope it gets the recognition it so should get rises above a cult hit comic went up on wednesday two comics what are you going to do our first winter's crest festival together running around causing havoc being adorable just in time for christmas eight weeks of cute we need photography of the 19th century over here i'm just saying we need daguerreotypes i think it might be time to do it oh voxanukkah i'll keep them coming i don't think so briorities briorities we've literally not had a conversation can i take two of the low ones possibly actually if i could steal two commons just to be on the safe side i offer the satisfaction of vax knowing that i got them for free currently everybody looks-- i throw her one of my commons as well let's start making our way down there and i can't believe i'm going to say this but we'll have vax scout ahead vax we've discussed our new password do you remember the new password it's now jenga one one-thousand two one-thousand three one-thousand four one-thousand five one-thousand six one-thousand seven one-thousand eight one-thousand nine one-thousand ten we know yes i consider the matter settled yes but mostly because i fear her we don't actually believe that he will listen to sense we just can't waste our breath really this is going to be a very complicated evening we just did cassandra in your opinion who's the more dangerous target if we can i think they would see through that i want to see what they're building down there and i worry that it would be dangerous i can't leave again until this is taken care of i think we're going to take the lay of the land first see what we're up against vax magic sparkles it does look like mithril doesn't it i will be right behind the-- bear-percy is especially disturbing cassandra de rolo now that we're together copy we'll just have to remember i'll also say if this was a gas trap i would probably throw my mask on before passing it as well we live in an age of miracles and wonders i'm moving up to the door did you make it to the acid pits i don't know i would like to get a better look are there markings on the walls is there any scripting get that out of the way nine the roof see what happens i'm going to try something first of all does the construct of this at all remind me of anything i'm going to take my sword and i'm going to go into the room and i'm going to lay my sword on the ground copper is a conductor i'm having that thought i'm going to try and slide my sword towards the center of the room and see if i can cause a short with the piece of metal and get a positive and negative charge to hit and see if i can get a reaction i had a torch and it's not translucent it's like an opal-like stone i say we remove it at the very least see what happens does anybody have a good idea in the absence of good ideas bad ideas i think are always reasonable i was going to look to see if there was one matching the one on the floor yeah that's good that's a 27 i'm going to go get my sword we're not thinking about this clearly good i walk over to the wall and touch one of the other gems i stop i pull out the gun and the second those hit-- i've seen this coming because fucking copper room fucking acid ice shot to the one tube do my best to reload as quickly as i can and ice shot to the other i'm going to try and clog them with ice at least temporarily that's 15 27 to hit and that's ten plus three points of ice damage it was a good thought i want to get my second reload second shot 15 and all the gems are in our room correct yeah i walk up i look at her and i smile it's all right see you soon and going to go right into pulling out the gun and preparing we're going to take out these gems we're going to be fine but we have to do it now i'm going to be fine go whitestone's pretty strong you could stone you could get out of this i'm taking three shots at one of the gems on the wall we have two down no glass is specifically how you contain acid i'm taking my three shots at the next gem the first one was 21 and then the second shot-- dear god it hits 18 20 30 third shot is 26 that's 14 11 for the second shot and 14 for the third shot well it's fake though four but it could be that that's the only gem that's necessary i'm running over to a gem i'm going to hands-on and see if anything happens and if nothing does i'm going to pull out my sword and start whacking it we need a fourth hand i pull out my sword and start whacking it break your gem the outside gem break the outside gem (shouting) break the outside gem (muffled) just fucking break the gem (muffled) kiss no i just want you to break the goddamn thing (muffled) fuck the power of love (laughter) (laughs) i'm hitting my gem too i rolled a 30 to hit these things are really easy to kill they get killed by hitting them with your fist did i finish killing my gem okay i'm going to take a shot if i have anything else to do can i take a shot at the gem that she just cracked 18 that's 16 points of damage wait i'm so sorry how far out is the acid room from where we are right now no the room that the acid is stored in yeah oh damn it okay we can see you now can't we we have a rope very uncomfortable for everyone involved no no i'm not we'll see what this means let's go take care of this we'll see 24 24 what's the roof look like above it except what happens when they get up there i'm all right let's start making our way we're going to have to ghostbusters this flank them there's no inside it's just on top feast i'm starting to make my way up and you can join me so i'm just walking up the center with me trinket's with me i'm heading up i'm walking up the steps i'm putting the mask on i make my way to the top of the stairs sylas a moment of your time my hands are on a device which i have made that's on my hip that i'm ready to begin using at a moment's notice it's the most ticklish french tickler you've ever seen baby we have debts to settle sylas they were kind enough to make sure that i made my way here to face you the darkness demands your soul sylas i'm going to cast hex on lady briarwood and pull my smoke bomb at the exact same second and throw it at them i was shooting it right in front of them i'm going to start running i'm booking to the right and i don't have any more actions do i ugh oh my god that's stupid getting it all out of my system now (laughs) that's how you get it all out of your system ten worst initiative i've ever rolled ten (laughing nervously) we're going to be fine can she see me okay because i moved bomb then ran there's smoke between us i turned into a bear it's willow it's fat percy that's a bear wearing a percy costume this spoon were you there for that fight that's a great idea spectacularly great idea he can see me he can find me in the smoke okay 34 hits the other two do not 24 still hits that's 26 points 23 points of damage sorry just updating my sad little hit points two constitution saving throws 11 a critical fail my strength is a negative one oh so my strength is at zero then 12 it's now ten which means my modifier is zero i just got blasted what's that thing i can do i'm going to use a bonus action to do my little healing surge that i can do my fighter ability thing which is 1d10 plus 12 so that's 18 points of damage back i brought myself up a little bit just a little bit and i'm going to shove the diplomacy glove right into sylas's face and try and do a straight shove to get him off of me i have never used this before i don't actually know how it works dex check plus ten to a d20 thank you that's much better 22 23 points of damage i'm going to jesus christ okay i can't really use my gun because i'm too close i'm going to pull out my sword and take two more slashes and i'm going to run like a mother first slash is a 28 and that's lame that's 14 points of damage second slash is 23 and that's 11 points of damage now i'm going to book it towards grog that hits i know no 15 16 17 22 make the right decision girl (blows raspberry) nine oh goddamn it that could have been worse (sings) deo gratias you're our cannon yeah just keep on him yeah yeah that hits i'm so excited about this new character i'm working on jesus okay 14 oh boy i'll tally up the damage in a minute ignore the last attack so that would have been-- my first save is 13 and that's 22 yeah i'm going to figure out how much damage i just took no it's 27 37-- oh 41 you're right i'm alive i'm at the other side of the world but you could probably get close enough to do something if you ran and not get in anybody's way we can inform her of the map though since she doesn't have a very-- she's 20 feet from sylas god-fucking-damn it 30 all right and make another constitution saving throw 13 points of damage saving throw that's 18 still he keeps getting in my shit there's just no getting the fuck away from him is there that's fine well he's in the 30-foot radius of light right now so do my attacks have an advantage against him okay there's just no backing away from him right now i'm going to have to wait for him to try and break off from me through grog yeah i get it so everyone wants my bod i'm going to take three slashes with the sword again since i'm too close to use the guns 25 14 i know but i don't want to waste it on this and 13 i want you to inspire other people 12 save it for a shot goddamn it yeah really you're going to kill him with hugs this is the most keyleth thing i've ever heard jaunty goddamn it yeah damn it's like looking at the technicolor logo okay first thing i'm going to do is i'm going to pull out the pepperbox and i'm going to take a shot at sylas and i'm going to get him to drop his sword so let's see nope not yet just in case things go bad-- and i also just want to make sure-- that's a 26 but he drops his weapon now i'm going to take a shot at him that's a 29 that does ten points of damage she's going to take care of this how close am i to lady briarwood ten feet that's close enough i guess i'm going to take a couple of steps back and i'm going to do a fire shot and an ice shot with my last two shots oh yeah i'll fire shot with my next shot does she currently have advantage or no okay so i'm going to also put sharpshooter on that yay (counting) 26 to hit so that's-- plus-- oh and plus the hex so that's (counting) 24 points of damage plus two points of fire damage let's spend an action surge and keep enjoying this why don't we take a-- yeah let's take a violent shot on top of that i use the violent shot action with the ice damage let's see what that does natural 20 this is going to be ugly as fuck oh my god this is so fucking bad is what this is about to be oh my god this is going to be so-- let me get these additional dice okay so let's start doing this do all of the dice rolls get doubled all of the dice for this roll oh boy okay (counts quietly) 42 points of damage plus eight points of ice damage no i've still got two more shots actually i get my grit point back from that because that was a natural 20 so that was a free shot i have two more shots and then i have to reload i'm keeping track i'm being good let's hit her in the legs that's 20 to hit yeah 20 to hit no 20 total to hit i rolled a 13 because she has her disadvantage she needs to make a constitution saving throw dc equals eight plus my proficiency mod plus my dexterity mod she made it she didn't fall but she still takes some damage so let's see what she does ten 12 22 28 points of damage and because this is really annoying me i'm going to give her a gut shot torso shot same thing sharpshooter 27 points of damage and she has a disadvantage on strength and dexterity checks for the rest of the round for one full round i'm going to back up a little bit for the rest of my-- yeah that way (laughs) yeah damn it girl do it do it girl that lasts a while i'm going to start looking at that door no no no no let's not let's not she's been here a very long time let's just knock her unconscious and let her be thank you we can save it for later i'm going to start working with that door what does a common healing potion do by the way you picked up his sword good that's why i had him drop it yeah and so one of us possibly me could use it do i get my strength back by the way i'm just down let's go in i took a minor healing potion is that 2d8 what's the greater do i pull out bad news i'm climbing up i'm heading straight up there i head up as well i'm going to take 80 feet-- 25 i rolled a 19 can i fire now it's 80 feet it's within the pepperbox range i'm going to shoot for the scroll with fire that rolled really low i can use that bonus die i rolled within my-- can i use the-- i'm going to try and fix it no pepperbox is completely broken we have two more guns do i still have-- are we still-- bad news don't look jesus christ 16 it was the arrow question mark keyleth's got shit how good do you feel about a natural 20 i did that was cruel and then it bounced i'm going to take a shot with bad news because this is getting really ridiculous i'm going to try and get her attention and get her to pay attention let's have a normal roll oh for the love of god so bad news-- just barely and i can try and get one more bullet to come out of it at this point so i'm going to make one last attempt to make it shoot after clearing the chamber better jesus h christ 24 this is at least going to get her attention yeah that's 21 27 points of damage she's still connected to her rope though isn't she parkour i'll take a shot at lady briarwood since i'm up here i was i forgot it on the last one i remembered that i forgot it that's 24 to hit 13 14 15 16-- 22 points of damage it's a little late i'm going to take-- oh my god i'm going to take a shoulder shot on her right arm and i'm going to try to cleave her right arm right off with the shot and see if i can leave her unconscious right arm she has the rope i grab it i am going to grab the rope and i am literally just going to jump off the side and i'm going to fling her up done good call i've got hold of the rope and just trying to yell toss her off because that way we can see if we can counterweight her back down i'll ride the rope up oh that's right never mind i believe in you she succeeded three times i'm going to try and open the doors from that side to see if there's any way to open them 11 let's get her out of there whoa we're not leaving this thing marisha and i'm afraid of what blood will do to that thing i'm taking cassandra why don't we just open up the acid and let it pour down in there we have to go that way anyway once we get there let's open the spigot point it towards the doors and let it do its work do some damage to the temple and then once we're all the way out we'll open the acid it could just swallow the entire city and everybody could die this is my problem at the moment she can earth shape she'll be fine 70 percent of her at the very least i'm going to do it once we're out we're just going to go well one and a half of them hey that comic is-- was free after this weekend it's one healing potion goddamn it
