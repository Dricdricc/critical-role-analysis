i'm using the head shot to try and blind him for a round so that's no sharpshooter because that sucked that's better 28 to hit he needs to roll a constitution saving throw and that's against - i just rolled so terribly 20 it's a 19 dc so unless that changes with my new intelligence he just takes 7 points of damage what no that wasn't sharpshooter i just did the middle one sharpshooter i'm going to use my movement and bonus to grab at least some of the stuff that's under my bed some of my things and start to put myself together and steady myself and i’ll start yelling bloody murder intruders intruders oh it's a nice neighborhood there's no bars on the windows it's a small room full on wilhelm scream (imitates wilhelm scream) thank you matt i’m going to run out of my -

i’m going to grapple that dick (radio announcer voice) that’s called the rakshasa blues i’m going to finish running up to the west tower he could have joined me i am alerting the guards and i am yelling through the hallways to lock down the city we don’t know we got everybody - lock down keep looking everyone get - i've got a plan no no no no no no i’m grabbing vex vax vex with me everyone start searching tell them that we’re going to need a healer downstairs and i’m going to take him we’re going to head towards - i’m taking both of you - i have a strength of 12 there’s not a lot i can do i’m going to try and drag him down towards the pit with the orb of death yes let them know what’s going on just make sure if you start to feel strange as we go down there let us know and we slowly inch towards the effects of it that’s so true yes but your smell is i cast - no no never mind i’ll hold off keep walking okay very gently if this doesn’t work we can try something else don’t throw it in the orb put it on the ground we’ll deal with it we’re not leaving it here three things three things no yeah there’s no bag of holding in here so why don’t we go upstairs now that it’s off and we’ll leave it here and i’ll be the last to leave with it because i'm not sure destroying it in here is the best idea and i'm not sure if destroying it is going to damage him it's not a terrible idea but we should - let's just very gently - we don't know what that is yet so let's very gently get you out of the orb's influence and then we'll remove it out of the orb's influence and we'll see if there's a problem i pick up the cloak and move it outside the orb's influence to see if it has any effect i just gingerly start to put it forward watching him all right seems all right i think we should have someone look at it first or we could destroy it properly one or the other i am carrying the robe on bad news like a stank rag at this point through the hallway (cracks up) anime bathhouses let's all meet in the sitting room in ten minutes so let's have anybody on the council meet there in ten minutes i'll send word to the guards to get everybody where they need to be if anything's out of sort it will instantly reported to us i'm also getting my shit oh who did get attacked out of curiosity what happened to yours did you kill him i'm going to turn to a guard and say search underneath the window of that bedroom anything you find - look carefully find a body if you don't find a body find a trail good work windows are good a rakshasa we're looking but none of ours yes because it came here it may not know its value but it does - if we can put some manpower towards discovering where he is and where he lies while we continue our search for the vestiges and then once we have a solid lead we can follow it through that's a way to go how many of them were there where were they all supposed to meet when everything was finished so i think we have 4 dead bodies we're missing 2 then kashaw's oh mine yours - laura and and we're waiting for news on whether that one - oh yeah i still actually have it it occurs to me i haven't put it down yet i've actually been using bad news like a - like spindle like a bindle hobo this was given to vax it was mystical it was attached to your skin yes i honestly don't know i haven't been here but we hunt we are everybody here hunts that's a great idea that's a brilliant idea yes please we also i might add in theory have a wolf patrolling the area and i'm sure he's aware that there's a commotion i'm slowly - i'm going to walk in and have a moment and look vax over there's one last thing and i walk up and i look you over and i pull out the raven head cloak clasp and i pin it to hold the cloak together and it's very deep pitted silver with a slight ruby tinge to it and it smells fabulous and it smells better the more you sweat and it smells of the raven queen's temple now talk to keyleth i'm counting on you good luck and i walk away i know you guys are going to drink for a bit i'm going to go out past the wall and see if i can yell for the wolf galdrick i’m bringing a swath from one of the - galdrick i show the blood-soaked chunk there were six now there’s one if you find him we would be forever grateful now i’m going to go up and have a drink i ate them and i was fine i can tell you what is in there it's nothing fancy well it's a cast of - the skull you gave me is still in my bag i did thank you oh god did he just throw up everywhere let it out let it out is there some vomit in the corner i'm going to go poke at it just to see if there's anything in there that looks funny i'm well-aware i have siblings i've seen this before there's no signs of poisoning in any of the remains is there that's fine it will take - if i don't see anything in 3 minutes - awful people that's a 14 nothing nothing no poison (annoyed) no i can actually have everybody killed in their sleep this is actually one of the perks of sleeping here i don't even have to do it myself i come out and i'm - (shudders) mimosas we hardly can make cocktails no this breakfast beer is perfectly reasonable his face touched that i'm just dipping in oh god i take one more big sip and toss it at him oh it's all his check the body for bits and then the rest is his it might be a gazing sphere be careful keep it under cover keep it wrapped in something good boy good boy we'll stop by gilmore's on our way back up to the front hall and what can it see precisely that's disquieting excellent (quietly) she's staying in whitestone while we do our work (louder) thank you for keeping my home safe thank you (sighs) we won't be gone long i'd say one more proper night's sleep then into the feywild we've seen what the vestiges can be i think they're terribly important and we can return from the feywild immediately and in theory be right back here when we're finished and perhaps by then we'll have an avenue of attack to this rakshasa i figure we would take one full night's sleep - we leave at dawn we plan at dawn we plan to leave at dawn right on thirty is fine if you say 900 930 barring traffic i feel that this is a skill check no i spent too long in high school learning how to juggle skill check no that's not how it works (laughs) sorry sorry i have -
