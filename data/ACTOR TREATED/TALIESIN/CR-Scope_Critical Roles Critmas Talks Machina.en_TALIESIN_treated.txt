wow you're going to have to show us that letter to make sure that's true does that mean he gets to cut us open when one of us finally dies she's probably watching though not right now because it's not live i feel like those are actually good for ashley the corduroy patches that's true i've been waiting for a and then i fly away we haven't had a and then i fly away wow i think my mom may have worked on one of those too of course she did yeah it sounds like something my mom would do i'll double-check i've got one from joe white at rpgenius which is a 3d-printing company he and his team apparently listen to us to pass the time as they're working on all their cool miniatures that they make he said apparently we increase their productivity and then he sent me-- which is good work work harder they sent percy an in-game letter which is really spectacular from a citizen of whitestone who was a tinkerer of his own i'll put some quotes up later he said that he sent-- this is a prototype of something they've been working on and this is the only one they'll making of this scale but they sent a prototype of something and it has a scope probably not because it's 3d-printed but i don't know actually i'm going to find out i need to reassemble the scope at some point let's find out if it-- no it's designed to look like it spins but actually-- oh my god yeah in fact that would work really well-- no tsa they won't be like last time this will not be like last time oh it needs a little leather strap too i want to do some stuff to it what piece of music is this no there's sheet music on the back of the card i'm so excited by it i can hear the sound of one subscription being lost in the twitch channel going (ping) i followed some of that yeah thank you that's so cool i like the notion that a bunch of norse got to germany and said yeah we're done it's cold enough now we're done this is nuts yeah that could have gone really poorly there's another one man i would say look at the letter first we apologize that it was not porn it was the only link on the internet that wasn't oh my god this is definitely going to be a con bag i really like anime version of us they're really cute

brilliant it's a superior healing potion so what's in a superior healing potion 8d4 eight red d4s that's clever that's really clever you can actually have a superior healing potion ready to go in a bag it's because you've never been healed in your life blue poop take a shot everybody at home it's time to take a shot that's a really solid poop too easy yeah appropriate for this time of year oh
