i would like to know which one of you is hitting the rotating knives first is what he is-- i just figured that out okay not even kidding i'm very perceptive but i can't see in the dark no we should probably keep a little bit of distance i'll stick with you all right also we should probably have yasha up front as well probably not it would still be in a big metal case until they really went through no harm in focusing on the positive nothing we can do about it we can't make a plan until we know what we're up against and if they're too much then we'll just get what information we can maybe sneak in while they're sleeping and scurry out with what we need with no harm no problem i really like it we did find some earlier like a goat maybe is that true stop laughing dm that's not funny that's an eight my nature sucks okay thank you i didn't need to roll to know that at some point we do need to rest mr caleb what time is it nope so glad it's one i can answer i'm going to cast light behind the crystal i couldn't help myself i'm listening very carefully to see if anything any noise is coming from the next room with advantage-- no just perception that is a 19 kill the light again we'll turn it back on but i-- is there any part of the wall that is still stone and not crystal i can carve out a chunk of wall if we want to put your little dome inside oh so in that case that's pretty cool then i'll-- once you build it i'll use stone shape to cover it then so you can give it a little bit of a shell once he puts up the dome the shack i'm going to use stone shape to cover it really quickly with a thin layer of rock to make it look earthen it's not like five feet thick of rock but a couple inches to blanket it it's going to have a faux front oh yeah it's going to be an opening probably put it against so we can see what's behind i don't know what do you think i'm going to pull the rock that i used for that front from the wall and i'm going to give us a couple feet in if that's possible just to push something i've been looking at stone shape and what it'll do no watch needed that's what the thread-- the thread will wake us if it-- lighting it up again because it's nice yeah we already did it 21 i did not prepare for that there was a river well that's a good sign that means that this is at least a natural cavern which means it's been here for a long time and whatever's above hasn't disturbed it that's good that's a good sign yeah i'm going to have a little light and see if i can find any tracks or anything for this thing or any other footprints i got a 21 does it smell clean is it clear can i see the bottom i'll keep an eye on the back 24 12 for me as well this is going to be and a bite the damage seems to take thank god is it close enough that hits okay good to know no this is good so we're not going to waste time trying to be safe from these things again what does grappled mean it means i can't move-- okay and i can't move that'll do he's within 30 feet of me isn't he all right i'm canceling the natural 20 but the critical does not take oh it's not a damage-- oh never mind so it doesn't get anything special okay no if it's not doing anything then there's no point i am panicking just a little is it time to start having the flashbacks are we at flashback point okay that's going to be interesting cancelled it's actually not a channel divinity it's called sentinel at death's door no it's five times per long rest laura and as long as i'm within 30 feet of somebody who suffers a critical hit you can turn that hit into a normal hit any effect triggered by the critical hit is canceled five times per long rest wait should i-- okay it's about to get worse for them i'll take it slow down cowboy i'm casting bane on these two the save is a 16 charisma yep i didn't think they would be that means that you have to take a negative d4 to attack rolls and saving throws on both of them i'm going to then spend my bonus action and i'm going to call a swarm of insects i'm going to drop it on the-- let's get one of these out of the way first let's get the one that's far away from me i'm going to drop it right on him that swarm of insects is going to take a bite hard to hit let's see if i can actually hit because my to-hit is-- oh well that's exciting 18 is the highest hit this is a bite attack which is 4d4 hit ten 4d4 piercing damage it's ten plus 4d4 i believe why does it say ten i don't know oh (counting) that's ten that finishes my turn the d4 wait and also is there anything else he gets from slow for saving throws how long does that thing stay-- why don't we all prepare i haven't put my insects away and we can just kill this thing off really i still have a swarm of insects i'm for the moment going to keep my insects down there just in case is it back to exactly where it was before it's immediately attacked by an insect swarm 22 ten points of damage i'm also going to throw sacred flame at it oh yeah it is 60 feet when do the insects get another attack thank you spare the dying oh wait sorry sacred flame nope 16 15 points of damage with vague interest drop it now that that's done i'm going to start doing a ten minute heal for whoever who needs a heal i'm going to start a ten minute while you guys dig who needs healing by the way okay so just you two 12 points of healing we could command it to carry us we could ask it politely to carry us we never used the magic words to be fair please thank you it gets you so far if you want i can stone shape i can push us in a-- i'm going to carve a hole about the size of what we need so we can be pressed into the wall it might be too big for me to carve oof i can't eat this i can't floss there's all sorts of things people can't do oh yeah i can't do all sorts of things when i'm eating yeah i had that spell set up sure that was going right into it how big are they wouldn't maybe if you were traveling these caves you would've capped them because of things that kept popping out of the wall what i've got a light does it look like these were-- i'm going to go up to one and examine it do i hear anything do i see any scrapings that would give a sign it's 15 these markings on the interior-- something burrowed i'm going to clean it off a bit i'm worried about the things around us i'm going to clear away a little bit more is there a body underneath this pile just a hammer i'll take a look at the hammer i think someone got grabbed i've got a crazy idea well no-- that's great that's way better i think that this was some sort of pathway and maybe this closed-off pathway here is possibly the way to go i don't know i feel like we might have found a way of sneaking into where we're going if anyone doesn't mind i'm going to pull out my shovel and start working on this this blocked off path that this got bisected-- or we could go down this way because i don't think there's that much dirt in this-- i'm going to start prodding to see how deep this cap on this bottom one goes i'm going to take a look in there do i feel any wind anything-- it's just stagnant air a horse on the top of the mountain why would he leave horses on top of a mountain what would you like me to ask the hammer who was your owner the hammer is very obstinate but i would imagine that's expected of a hammer i'm not going to say it wasn't worth a try i would have been surprised but i would have been delighted as well yeah there's no way to know actually that's a good idea can we send frumpkin down one of these tiny tunnels cool i can cast light on the ribbon too so you don't have to burn a spell i cast light on something tied to frumpkin maybe roll back and try one of these smaller tunnels also just to see what's a few feet down maybe i mean it seems like the thing to do what yeah really i just wish we knew what these things were i would have loved to explore some of these my thought was we could send the cat up and down really quick and just take a look we have a cat we can just send down the smaller tunnel really quick i don't know why we don't just take a peek we sent the cat down the big tunnel i had a funny feeling i'd say the downward one just a quick look not too far down top one quick look not too far up i'd rather them see us now than-- yeah we're going to fan out 20 we've got to get both out of them it's pretty great let's head to the tunnel then head to the main room i'm going to augment that they can all hear you that's pretty funny i heard that right oh yeah we can't understand them but we can understand you well i mean we can make some food i suppose or we can let the cat have his way is there any way i can just add a thaumaturgy effect to the cat really quickly i want the ground around the cat to shake gently and start having a minor earthquake effect we have food though oh lord laura and we'll need containers do you have a couple of pots big containers do you have one more i can do two if you've got two i can do water also do you care about water i can do water that's fair i'm going to take a little piece of fungus off the stick and i'm going to put it in there and i'm going to start casting create food and water and it's going to suddenly become 45 pounds of food a little more thunder maybe i don't think they'd be interested it's way too nice for them i don't think that they really-- that's so expensive and difficult to come by in this part of the world you don't want-- i mean we certainly don't want to give it up well mister fjord are you sure yeah because there was the two and then the other two and then the king and the leader i think that's half of the next person that comes through at that point wow i'm just making sure nobody's tried to-- i've been trying to keep an eye on things nobody's tried to gank anything right that is fair is the cage locked or is it just shut are we going to be walking within 30 feet of that cage okay cool once the cage is within 30 feet i'm just going to pop it open with thaumaturgy bye buddy it's going to be like one of those youtube videos where they let the mouse go in the forest and just the hawk-- like ten feet marisha and it didn't last one day what do i hear that's interesting can your cat hear what they're talking about no i'm going to walk by you and be like they're talking about something i don't know if we want to keep an ear out for what they're up to cool as long as they're keeping some distance not yet i think at some point-- when's the point where it's time to bed down are we getting to that point i think at some point we're going to bed down i think that's a great idea and then we'll go to sleep i'm just going to-- i think we should-- oh am i moving over okay (pandemonium) holy shit i'm going to make some room here oh my god no peeking this is chemical warfare man that i believe is in fact a-- i think that's a natural 20 (laughter) i'm going to get up aww come on i mean i just feel bad really at this point no i feel like we should hear this out um well mommy i like it that's really neat aw man hey hi how's it going great if it gets us to where we need to be i'd be willing to drop another spell another 45 pounds whatever we don't need of that 45 pounds which is an awful lot of food is that a bag of bees you've got over there oh my god way to bring the whole room down yeah wow yeah this is going to be great if there's any way to scoop up a couple of pieces oh no that happened (singing) natural 20 natural 20 i just heard dani break in the other room the delay is the best oh yeah is it on its way down into the tunnel how big is this tunnel again lights are dimmed yeah i was once a giant there we go carry on they think there are more kobolds coming in a map should we mark this on the map then with a pin oh yeah i like those how much can the bubble take i can throw my voice if we have to i can also make my voice i believe come from wherever i like within 30 feet just to have a conversation with these guys see if they're willing to make a deal i can get across if i hit it with bane beforehand it would also have a slightly harder time doing that i have a sneaking suspicion that there's probably-- these giants are fast faster than we are probably with some range i can briefly go invisible but not for this whole run mister caleb is the one to go i can be invisible for one run-- for one action i can get 60 feet oh i mean i'll be invisible until i'm visible should i be invisible at the beginning or at the end i can be invisible for 60 feet i'll polymorph then i guess i'm also going to add resistance to you so you can add a d4 to any saving throw for the next 60 seconds you can add a d4 to any saving throw oh boy this is going to go great it's a great plan who i don't know man there are so many options what would be fun i don't know i mean dragonflies are pretty cool laura and well i don't know but to be fair i'm not sure if i remember what i'm supposed to do anyway who would be like um actually-- you get the limited edition from the local store you know it's on you i'm going to hide probably in your pocket i'm going to hide on you as the dragonfly a dragonfly i'm going to hitch a ride on you she's faster you are the mighty menagerie that's epic my god man 18 i'm also un-polymorphed over there as well just squeeze that's all you've got to-- hi i'm going to poke my head out and cast blindness on the giant yeah 16 constitution oh yeah it was a good thought that's all right no it was worth the thought i've got a bonus action i suppose still where have i got my bonus actions just for fun let's give him some more bees (knocking) wake up again guys i'm going to cast the swarm right in his face we took a long rest since the last time i used that it's been a while i think it's been a long rest so yeah that's a swarm of insects and i think they're going to attack that's-- oh god that is terrible it's eight nine ten 11 that's 11 to hit i was going to try to get them on the face but-- yeah and i'm going to pop back in all the way as far as i can against the wall oh okay yeah the cow is going to probably turn back into a giant when they move no oh wow that's a lot of rolling i am definitely not 30 feet away from that big mo with the-- i would have to get way out there to be 30 feet i am 60 feet away from nott however correct but getting 60 feet from nott is not-- and then hop back in all right i'm going to hop out and-- oh that's right i don't know where nott is do i then i would have just i'm going to be on the nope train yeah in fact if anything-- yeah i'm going to hold a healing spell for-- oh just cure wounds just the bonus action one you get to keep moving though right man you had to regrow a leg it's going to be fine monster i got a plan i got a plan everything's going to be fine i got a plan yeah no here's the thing though i am holding a healing spell for the second i see him no healing word i'm so sorry-- i meant the 60 foot because-- i was trying for the 60 foot range i am so sorry i said the wrong thing because i was not running out there i was going for the 60 foot range so the second i see-- the second nott is visible i cast cure wounds i cast healing word i'm so sorry i don't have to roll it you are 17 points up this is not a bad idea i mean you could grab caleb i don't know i'm holding stone shape the second caleb is through the hole the stone is sealing the entire door is gone it's just rock again dude come here yay
