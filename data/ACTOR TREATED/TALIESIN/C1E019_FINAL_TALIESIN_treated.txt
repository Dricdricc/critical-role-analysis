ogre's nest nothing fun right now 28 i rolled another natural 20 i sacrificed a small child to these dice what is that strange orange thing right here that's a tree okay good so that's cover okay so is there any way i can maybe get some partial cover right over here yeah so i've got cover from the tree from this one until he moves but i can see this guy it is bad news time i'm going to bust out bad news and take a shot all right they're pretty big so i'm going to take the negative five to my attack bonus and see what that does that's a 21 that's a good shot oh yeah that's 17 27 plus-- 33 points of damage that is the end of my turn yeah i am now going maybe i shouldn't have done that (laughter) (grog voice) i would like to negotiate yeah you're going to hit yourself in the head if he's going to hit you he might not i'm going to hold my turn bless you let's take a breather for a moment collect ourselves i want to borrow grog for just a second and ask these two if they've encountered the dragon before and what its disposition is anything we should know i was feeling weak ten it was a one wasn't it this is my fault this is all my fault 17 i am i lawyer quite well but the hope is that we wouldn't actually break the contract in the first place because that's complicated we're not here based on other people's expectations we're here because we thought we could handle this and nothing has changed this changes nothing thank you would you like to use mine i can make an attempt at this i'm going to walk over and study the shattering position and see if i can find the weak point in the wall seven getting it all out of my system now i'm going to take a musket ball go over to the very center of the crack let's save the fire bolt i'm backing up she said fire bolt i backed away i can't use acrobatics nine i'm going to heal really quickly that's unpleasant i'll take one but if he does have stoneskin will you let him charge ew oh all right i think we've found one there's a trap right there perhaps if we're quiet and stealthy can we be quiet and stealthy i have to set it off personally i actually have to shoot it to set it off that's hoping for an awful lot of things to go our way more things than normally go our way to be fair do we have a little bag we can put the jewels in we have a second i'm going to hand you my holy hand grenade of antioch why not we'll get it back it's okay you can't explode a diamond diamonds are forever i would like to go around here that's not me and everything else in the bag as well i don't know if you have that spell oh my god i rolled another 20 i don't know i don't know what happened 28 the little gingers come back out if i take one shot can i hold my second shot until an event can i time my second shot darn it what initiative did you roll again in that case i'm going to take a few steps behind that frozen creature right there i'm going to pull out bad news mary sam and i'm going to aim for the face i'm going to take a head shot on him i'm just using him as partial cover more or less i'm using him as a steady and as partial cover as i take a head shot on the dragon i'm not taking a bonus for damage no oh 15 i'm going to burn a bonus action and spend another grit point and do another shot i'm taking my action surge come on yeah oh 19 that's much better plus 12 that's 32 to hit and that's 15 points of damage and head shot means he's got disadvantage on all attacks for the next round i feel a little guilty about that i feel very guilty about that okay i feel a little better and he was the most useful he's ever been i was in the 30s 12 still no hand-grenade what do i do to shake the fear okay i'm going to try and take a shot at it with a standard shot for right now 17 wait and with disadvantage i would like to really quickly then go into that little corner there for some cover oh i didn't roll to shake off the fear five well i don't know what do i know does she not have sharpshooter do i not have some cover 20 okay i'm going to-- that grenade is sitting on top of people right now isn't it it's going to hit you even if my attack is not against the dragon okay in that case i'm going to take a shot at the dragon for the moment forget about that 19 oh that's nice 26 points of damage i have moments no i'm going to hold my position i was about to say before i do that i'm going to use a bonus action to do a quick heal i'm going to use second wind that's 11 points of damage you're in trouble can i take this moment of engineering success to try and pull a wisdom saving throw against my fear that i missed on my turn natural 20 (cheering) i built a thing and it blew up kind of on purpose i'm sorry i'm a genius i'm sorry sorry oh god i'm clever good you drained it that's over with all right i'm going to take one last really good shot i'm going to shoot him right in the face again i'm going to spend my grit point and hit him in the face let's make this work yay that hits that's 31 to hit i'm going to roll damage that's 15 points of damage but he's got disadvantage on all attacks until my turn i'm going to move in this direction hug the wall yeah i think right there with disadvantage with disadvantage oh so there's no disadvantage roll for him to make here is there 15 54 i'm out i like my face do i actually roll i did not roll a ten or higher grog's got it let's not have another pike please kill it out of spite make it good oh what happened oh look it's dead can we cut that bastard up for scrap now ugh that would be two white dragon eyes one white dragon tongue one white dragon heart six white dragon claws and 20 white dragon teeth very low nature start with the eyes the tongue would be next a heart claws and teeth claws still we have to get claws still we still need claws six do we have an extra we have one 16 whoa i'm curious about the gloves myself that might be good for you though i have a two-handed ranged weapon though which you do not no scanlan i do ozwyn grud may i as well 25 yes of course this is most likely going to good use at the very least i was just working that out lots of gold it's 1800 for the dragon eyes 1200 for the dragon tongue 3500 for the heart 1500 for the claws and then how much for the dragon teeth for all 20 dragon teeth 9000 total thank you what were you thinking really yes you're moving tomorrow
