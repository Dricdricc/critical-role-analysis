this is my stuff it's dangerous to go alone-- liam and just going to get my stuff from this small stone temple emerges a tall not necessarily healthily thin firbolg who is pale and a grayish color and has a big shock of weirdly pink mohawk hair-- i'm going way off the reservation here he's a little gaunt he's got a little fuzz he's wearing this bizarre-- he's wearing this very gentle silk shirt that's got one long flowy sleeve he's got a cup of tea he's just staring huh i think i've only got three more cups hold on i go back in i'm going to come out i'm going to have a little kettle set up on a little tripod i'm putting it down i'm putting a big rod with a big purple chunk of amethyst on it underneath the kettle tapping it a couple times to get the kettle to start heating up i'm going to wander into the graveyard and find some flowers for tea mr clay and nah i'm fine one second i come back with a pile of red-purple flowers and i'm grinding up this is from casala textile family generations ago but they make very good tea now (sighs) mm caduceus clay sit i'm going to put out the three cups and wait for the pot to boil pour out the three cups you have to share i apologize please let me know what you think only grows here oh please come i haven't had one of these in a long time that's nice no i'm sure they're wonderful though that sounds just great that sounds wonderful friends (sigh) you have come (sigh) please let me know what i can do for you usually when people come here it is because of some great tragedy how can i alleve your pain i would assume people who come here usually have avenge him what happened do i know the iron shepherds no i'm sorry i really don't get to leave very often especially these days (contemplative sigh) been 20 seasons now 18 seasons try not to count it just gets in the way of more important things it's been about two seasons i suppose little bit of business but it's been very slow it's the only time that seems to matter i'm so excited most people who come here know what this place is this is going to be delightful i've never had to explain it to someone before well boneyard is a bit crass but yeah this is a place where we take the dearly departed who have done well and the people who have lived good lives and we put them into earth that has been touched by the wildmother in turn she grants them with beauty and splendor and sometimes tea more like a garden we have been tending this garden for generations aren't we all aren't we all well i mean sometimes we can help people who are on the edge of death we certainly understand that most people would rather spend their time alive than not and that makes sense i certainly have no interest in shortening my life any time soon i mean that's very tricky once you're dead there's a natural order to things there's a movement that things have to go but in certain cases i'm sure oh i can sometimes help people you never know you know honestly i don't think i've had enough experience to have an opinion on that i'm a good gardener i grow lilies i grow bramble mushrooms moss not with an actual snap but yeah i can do that i don't have to snap though i can be really quiet when i do it-- pretty quiet i actually have to say something now that i think about it i've left a few times i suppose it's been a while i've been on my own for a while it makes you get a little rambly that's a bit of a story my family have run this temple for generations and i'm sort of the last one left holding the fort down no cousins a couple sisters a brother my parents but everyone's either wandered off to help try and fix what's been going wrong or has been put into the earth well as i'm sure you've possibly noticed and i apologize if i'm breaking some terrible news to anyone who didn't the forest beyond my little patch of earth is a little unsavory it's dark it can be a bit dangerous don't recommend going out alone it has been overtaking our temple for the last hundred years and recently has breached the walls again the last one to leave was my sister she went east now it's just me it's not much to hold down at this point honestly because it's a little dangerous for a lone person to leave i figured i'd sit here with a kettle and wait for someone to come along and maybe see if i can make my way out of here and figure out what's been happening in this place i could leave whenever i want sure that's a really good idea i don't i mean if you guys in a serious rush if you could help i'm sure we could figure out-- mmm are you inviting me to come with you that's excellent you're lucky i came along then this is going to work out really well well you're lucky that i stayed right here so that you intercepted me because if i had wandered off ten 15 feet this may have never happened well i don't know if i think that anyone deserves anything but i don't like cages and i'm really-- that seems a little specific i'm mostly interested in trying to take care of the natural order of the world and nature itself have you ever been in nature yes violence is extremely natural well i don't know about deserve but i think there's always somewhere there's a plant that needs some compost and i'm happy to make some more if it'll make people happy you got a lot of aggression you got a lot of anger there's only-- okay is that a time of plant i've actually already packed i'll go get my things i do i may ask for it later i like this one i'll go get my green beetle armor thank you my sister made it i'm very proud of her i get a big knotted wet-looking stick that is covered in lichen the armor is also covered in lichen it's a big growing living wet thing it has a big purple amethyst rock at the top of the staff i get a little shield also made out of beetle (sighs) give me a minute just going to walk around once take it in all right i'm ready to leave this is going to be a little much but i think i can do it i'm ready casala what did you think you were drinking yeah that's very close it's good it's always worth trying casala family i think we have eight in their generation i was only here for the last two caduceus caduceus clay you can call me clay i have been trying not to show you this art for two weeks now sure okay that doesn't seem like a very good idea you make me figure out how to do this is she always like this this seems kind of extreme come here all right and i get in there and i'm going to do cure wounds and there's going to be a little bit of lichen that grows on the wound really quickly it's fine do i roll for that six points of damage-- six points of healing it felt very-- honestly it's been so long since i've been around anybody i genuinely wouldn't have been able to tell that would be the hope i imagine you'd leave the woods once you went into the woods i mean you don't just want to sit there i mean that's what i do but i'm not sure that was really a great decision so yeah huh i'm just thinking out loud i've had a few years to just think out loud been about 100 give or take that'll do no i had to think a little bit about it but no a what that seems like a really good idea actually i should start doing that what a good way to make a decision i don't know what any of that means all right tonight can i just politely ask the forest to just give us a round this time just in case i want to talk to a couple of trees see if they'd be all right just giving us a little passage all right wisdom save or wisdom check all right 21 first stealth check where's my stealth seven that's very specific are you just going for that or is that going to mean something in a minute it's going to be 1035 how about now but it's closer to 1035 not quietly this phil must be a really bad person if you're-- i know i'm new here and you've obviously all got some kind of hierarchy going here of how you work this out that makes sense i suppose my question would be what are you really here for because normally if i'm looking at a complicated problem i just think about what it is that i really want and then i go and i do that well i was going to say that if you had to put one above the other if you get one thing you get to do it so you've got to get in and out of the basement that seems to be the conversation then is getting in and out of the basement i'm sure inevitably you're going to kill a whole bunch of people in the process of that but as long as you're focused on where you're going and what you're doing that may help with this wanton violence against phil who i'm sure is a terrible person he shot an owl no that ain't funny i'm already regretting the name no what i don't really know how to answer that question no thank you i bet it was a really good hour (singing) how tall is my firbolg seven feet i'm not that strong i can do some magic i've got a guiding bolt but it's very bright and it's made of light i have some insects but they make a lot of noise actually i have something i can do while that's happening you could stand on top of me yeah i guess i can do that it's literally one syllable i feel like that's not a lot to ask yep this deuce thing's weird i don't-- do you think maybe we're going to want some of these clothes at some point oh i'm really tall but all right i'm also going to take a look at this guy they just killed and commit his face and what he's wearing to memory just to put it in there how tall is the-- i'm going to rope down really quick quietly keeping an eye out you said that out of game and i can't say anything about it i get a free disguise self that doesn't actually count against any of my slots i'm going to be a guard i'm going to be the guy we just snuffed that's cool i haven't done this from my vantage point i'm going to see if there's anybody in the courtyard or if there's anything-- since i'm up there now clay if you have to caduceus clay 16 they're nice i'm looking in the windows or you could meet me at the corner since i'm walking around the-- oh i'm on the outer i'm not in the center area yet i think it's as long as they're within 30 feet it's like a field and you can say yea or nay that's my view plus ten sorry natural 20 nah who do i see on the front door by the way really what did he look like i don't know who he was but-- aww damn it sandwiches here have a laser pointer the most realistic thing i've ever-- did we hear it 12 ah man i guess i'm going to take 60 feet of running to find out what that commotion is on the other-- actually would i have gone for the front door or-- no i would have gone for the back that's what i got another 60 feet i'll jump off the wall ooh that's 14 hey big guy how could you be angry at a horse man it's not like this is an evil horse it's not that far off roll again in case you crit is it an auto-- i mean is it advantage do you have a little bit more-- sure is it anybody who steps into that field now or is it just whoever's in the field when it drops okay so you're still fucked goddamn it i can roll another one i'm going to run in the door okay that's what i see there's an open door i'm going to the open door hey guys i don't see anything i'm going to keep running hey can i see the barbarian through the door so i only have a bonus hold on i'm learning how this works i can cast healing word on you yeah no on you of course i see that this is going down and i'm going to cast a quick healing word that's-- 1d4 plus my wisdom modifier six points immediately to you all right yep that's everything i've got i'm going to walk over to you and give you some healing 12 points to you anything else worth checking i'm going to start walking to any of the dead bodies and-- or the unconscious people who are not technically dead yet oh they bled out all right i'm going to start using thaumaturgy to start cooking them away in a big pile of mold and mushrooms aw it's nice to have someone who really understands it's the process pretty good yeah thank you it's great to be back it's a little squishy i've got to say it's been a little nerve wracking coming in as someone new it's very interesting i like this guy too i like it all so i'm a fan i was very happy with the pink mohawk it was a very good mohawk it was black-light reactive what do they do those two what do those two do well i mean could just ask him to open the door the ruckus has stopped and obviously somebody won this fight yeah i can do that if you like i can just go down and ask i was going to mention i do look like a guard right now i'm grabbing a little muck putting it on my face getting all-- i could just go down if you like yeah it's okay yeah i'm going to go down yeah i'm just tapping on the doors all clear we got one it's keg we'll handle it i'm going to head back upstairs all right that's cocked 18 i'm going to start heading back up we could use your help up here if you got a second i'm going to head upstairs i'm heading up as i head up through the trapdoor i'm like get ready everyone just when he comes up and just walking a little way past never done this before 17 plus something is it just a straight 1d6 plus nothing i was using the staff oh it's 1d8 eight seven because i have my strength modifier-- no eight just because i have no strength modifier oh no just going to turn him into mulch that's okay (laughter) i'm going to drag him back we got another suit if anyone wants one i'll come down with you that's fine yeah i'm going to come in the corridor as well since i still look like a soldier i'm going to be willing to be a little visible on the corner just for my own giggles i'm going to cast detect magic really quickly because this place is giving me the creeps i have an auto-thing i can do apparently which is nuts i'm going to cast detect magic as a racial trait which apparently is a thing you can do firbolgs are amazing yeah all right how about within 30 feet am i getting a ping yeah yeah i like what's happening here here come on give me a hug some tea for the road i've got a bit of it left (laughing) no it's just loose leaf it's not a bag it's just loose leaf see you soon this was the best (as the twelve days of christmas) five gold coins i love this color
