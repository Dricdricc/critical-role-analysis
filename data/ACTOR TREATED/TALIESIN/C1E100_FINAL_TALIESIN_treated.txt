yoga position marvel character later yoga position there will be another shameless plug later you can find it on itunes you can find it on google oh cupcake down matt matt heder's got one he's jacking in i just want to make a point that i've alerted everybody in the government-- everybody reasonable-- where we're going why we're going and that there should be people watching the ziggurat underneath whitestone 24/7 while we're on this mission anything happens be prepared for anything we've been throwing it it's not here i help shove probably not together no no i would have brought you into it your voice got really high during that profit suits you well it's also very hard to put an earnest relationship in a coin purse hooded ones cleared out so it's a name for when he's ribbing you ribbing i'm just so excited by all the puns that are available it turns spirits into potions that's pretty solid i'm out well as long as i've gone one in there i'll take two you can actually use it though it might be that thing that i got rid of misty step chill and casual we do this to everybody it's all right but yes we are making fun of you would it work on doty it'll take more than a day to get there anyway so this way we'll just save some time and we'll take a day to take a look around add that to your survival i was gonna argue that since he has the duck totem that technically he would have a natural migration sense of what direction he was gonna go yeah just thought i'd put that out there i feel like his duck sense would be tingling always knows where south is unnecessary but worth noting i think we'll get a little closer happy little tpk yes i'm not gonna roll that 'cause you've been-- i feel like that's yours it landed on other dice i'm gonna let it be there though actually yeah it's 20 i honestly think they might have trapped it she talks to non-ducks it certainly is do they obey you or is it a partnership let's not question this they knew about the others in a way yes has anybody been through that upper passageway well last time who's here now had to poke it there's a door you cannot see and a bad face sucks your life away we've got another entrance let's see if there's a second entrance well they're going to think we're coming in through here because they know about this entrance maybe they don't know about the other one so we could maybe be super tricky and take an entrance they don't know about at all if i were expecting people i'd expect them through the entrance i take or the cave-in not a third entrance i don't know about though assuming they don't know about it higher should we take a group look for the top of the spire we could just make a tiny hole in the cave-in and become smoke and go inside is that not possible he asked so that they wouldn't even know that we had cleared it it would just be relatively untouched it's either that or camp right in front of the front door after just triggering a spell that may not be necessary i'm so proud of you that was amazing 65 is like 400 feet or the closest wall did it hit a wall 400 feet i'm going to point out i've already been looking for a way into the cave-in while you've all been being ridiculous the minute he suggested that he get it i didn't want to be a part of that so i just immediately went in to start testing to see if there was ways we could just meld through the cave-in or if we actually had to make a hole i misty-ed out of that the minute that he started working on it seeing if i can find ways through i'm going to start back to normal at the very top of the pile looking to see if i can start scraping through using my sword to make a crevice i get the distinct impression perhaps that you used it up and probably alerted them that somebody was at that entrance yes i just got back no i don't think so 21 who's got the best night vision i'm all right with the notion of getting a little deeper in what color is the rock i can't see anything can i never mind i'll activate my boots left 13 be quiet i'll stay with the two of you because i can't see shit and i'll slow you down if things happen they're going to light up it'll be all right we may need a place to disappear to so yes you re-roll how loud was this fireball i'll take two shots at the two that came through i'm going to curl up to the top and upside-down take two shots yeah with my big rifle that's not bad a 20 and a 27 to hit actually even more than that there will be more can we leave something here is there some sort of alarm that we can set like a glyph of warding let's take a long rest and see if we can get two more let's start backing up ashley and let's leave it at the shift so if they go up our tunnel we'll know everything fun takes a minute oh never mind watch an episode of house of cards and by then glyph of warding will be done let's hop in the mansion oh do tell is it more tasteful in here now is it more tasteful in the mansion he can have my room that will be fine do they serve meat for guests or is it just scanlan that's barred tell her you didn't have any do we lose hit points from this meal i feel like that can wait till morning we have options let's have a nightcap that may be breakfast a shallow ghost of a dinner served by shallow ghosts of people i'm ready for a nightcap and an end of the evening to a death in the morning i come running up no now we're going good night good night now now no more good night good night i know i kind of want to break a few things you've earned it fucker it's only the things that make granola good that make it not vegan oh shit yeah and you add the attack bonus of your great sword which is right in the center oh natural 20 another what what oh my god he doesn't even understand what just happened travis just aged a year roll 4d6 roll four of these and i think you get to reroll yeah roll those and add two more or roll them twice yeah there you go four of those oh my god that's a six all four i'm just going to sit next to vex and i think we're just going to stand and let this happen yes that's a nine just two no plus seven also you get another shot don't you yeah attack again 16 it was beautiful terrible i'm not entirely sure well really he cleaned up after you two finished it all off he swept up you and grog were most of the skeletons easily (quietly) i wouldn't worry about it yes (whispering) yes i'm a little bit behind them 28 i'm behind you guys yeah we're letting them go first that's the end of both of them it's going to be a cadaver and a fern i'm working on a quilt yeah they're monsters i'm going to take their cloaks i fully support it whatever you need to do to feel better man i'm curious about a couple things here we're going to strip the cult members of their culty pants angry happy face with a goatee i'm excited yes you do scimitar of speed this could go-- (interested noises) yes yes i think i could do something with this i've even got a codeword for it you have to speak a word to make it work can i program the word i've programmed it perfect everybody roll who's walking 23 oh i can reroll a saving throw out of curiosity is this a magic saving throw then i don't even have to use a resolve 19 we don't have the bonus hit points either do we okay i'm going to burn my quick heal might as well will the magic fade if we get too close to the ziggurat though well let's go they would all be dead right now we would have taken them all out in one clean kill towards and away from the ziggurat and the ziggurat's 1200 and we're 600 you get to go first 20 percy and scanlan are tied it's dark scanlan you first my plan just went up the rainbow i have sticky feet right now so i ain't going nowhere fuck their shit up we'll hear a thunk won't we i'm going to pull out bad news actually let's pull out animus this will be funnier if i'm walking around that way which is always a fun thing to say there's that one guy holding on right there's one guy holding on i'm going to use my gun to make him drop an object of my choosing and that object is going to be the pyramid so just remembering how to do this roll for an attack that's 29 strength saving throw against 20 okay is he still alive i don't suppose i have advantage to hit anything that's pinned to the ceiling so weird i'll take it i hit the wrong thing there we are i'll burn another point for advantage and shoot him again just with a straight roll that's 19 same guy that's nine points of damage plus three points of psychic damage and i'll hit him again same thing hit him again this time i'm going to take a bonus for a hex on him too for extra fun that's 27 so that's not bad that's 17 points of damage plus three points of psychic damage and five points of necrotic damage yeah and he's got disadvantage on dexterity checks for now because that's funny i'm slowly going to make my way towards the ziggurat so i'm going to be actually walking up on the wall so you can put me up on the little creases yeah i'm walking sideways as gravity's reversed right now i'll make my way as far as i can get towards the sphere you take less damage d20 natural 20 now roll 4d6 he's so plush though it's really nice whoa does he get to reroll ones does he get to reroll a one reroll it better the walls are tall enough that you can put that above people and it won't be a problem you're close though you can throw something at it dungeons and dragons yeah no it's the big motherfucker the minotaur it's so nice that this is not a problem i have advantage because of cabal natural 20 weren't they on the ceiling they were my least favorite 26 is he on fire too god fucking damn it i'm going to continue further down the wall towards the evil orb of death is that as far as i can get okay and the cultist closest to me on the ceiling that one right there let's do some damage with animus and let's add a sharpshooter for it just for fun that's 16 to hit hold on i may have done that wrong 17 to hit that's irritating all right forget sharpshooter one more that's better 24 to hit this is not the one i have the hex on right okay that's fine i should have done that differently 12 points of damage and one point of psychic damage he's still fine isn't he that's fine i'm going to hit him again that's like 35 to hit jesus christ i rolled a 19 and that's 17 points of damage and one point of psychic damage i'm going to use my bonus to heal myself a little bit because goddamn it oh jesus i'm attacking one of the cultists i'm up to 120 hit points now goddamn it i wanted to throw some electricity on it and i blanked because my brain is made of swiss cheese is it too late i'm going to add-- on that last shot i'm going to add 5d6 worth of electricity damage (counting) 16 points of lightning damage that's five cabal's (blast) five cabal's yeah really you always say that that doesn't mean anything it's possible we can run straight into the ball it might be concentration-based and if he can knock it out oh god there's a lot of d6 i hear rolling oh no oh god can he bounce off at some point and stop pulling through this fucking rainbow of death you know i would watch jeffrey dahmer's prismatic sphere we still have two cultists full of magic they're above you on the roof it's your everyday prismatic spray it sprays in a cone it's a sugar cone not a waffle cone is it magical i rolled 27 i can't help i can't help i'm not allowed to help no i am going to unload a couple shots into the orb and see what happens animus freezes up i throw it pull bad news bad news freezes up i pull retort that hits yeah i'll burn an action surge for this i'm going to sit and fix my guns we're going to drag this cadaver outside yeah resurrected no let's take this outside just take it outside nothing good happens here you're just going to waste your attempt in here can't we i don't know can't we what is it did he not have one more tune in next week for a shopping episode critical role goes to the beach doty
