it's perfect they'll enter 'tary' and be disappointed (laughs) the gilmore shirt is back-- you should work in radio for anybody who reads comic books normally you know that wednesdays is when comic books get released at comic book stores all across the country and if you're a big comic book nerd-- and you had a really fun comic book store-- you would go on a wednesday night and hang out with all the other comic book nerds and have six-week-long conversations on who would win in a fight superman or thor actually funny enough you don't go to a wednesday club so you-- well now you have a show to watch so now that i don't really have time to do that any more we thought it would be fun to just do it here with all of our comic book nerds so amy dallen and matt key and i are going to be talking comics every wednesday from noon to two on the twitch stream and we're going to-- yay new show the wednesday club and we're going to try and make it fun to watch and easy if you've not picked up a book in ages and you've maybe thought about getting into comics or you had some kids and now the comic books have just turned into giant shreds of paper we're not talking news we're just talking fun cool comic book facts and our first episode is going to be origin stories were we talk about why we got into comic books and then starting the week after we're going to be talking about cool characters team-ups classic runs of books anything and everything it's going to be great no crossovers never mention crossovers special guests we will have special guests and not-so-special guests-- you can come too so yes wednesday club we'll be talking about comic books it's going to be great check us out on wednesday it's good chili to be fair i went to underworld and met some critters it was good pushing you slowly off the edge i'm okay with that i'm getting drinks for everybody i assume we've got the table at this point we're trying to stick to our word at the very least vax who has-- grog no it was not it was a vax i will definitely i will stand behind that  it was vax it was not a vex i don't think that-- no he just sort of found us outside and he had honestly-- we're not entirely sure what happened here grog we have the human hand as well we have the mechanical hand and the human hand  we took both we figured we'd have options if i recall we took both we took the robot hand and the-- to be fair i was dead at the time so i don't-- huge collection it's pretty gruesome you have to ask then-- i put the retort pistol on the table she used one of these devices the pistol was just for show it wasn't a gift i won't pretend that we didn't have our own reasons for it but we are grateful that you recognize that we respect your authority we haven't checked his to be fair we'll probably only be another day or two in town before we head home thank you thank you for your time we got someone to remove a debt upon our heads it was metaphorical magic sure yes yes please heineken's coming basically not for a long time one would hope so tary i have to admit i'm curious where did you get your friend there did you really what's his power how's he powered what runs him i'm just sort of curious that's a very interesting thought you have there but still i would be just delighted to hear your attempt to simplify it for me yes  i think i've read about such things before yes you didn't build it did you did you did you build it so one would assume there's an access panel somewhere on him where one can make adjustments or otherwise fix him if he breaks down thank you where would the access panel be well just in case you're knocked unconscious by let's say someone sneaking up behind you and hitting you with a weapon doty did he build you can you that would be excellent i look forward to giving the lesson yes gloves of missile snaring are currently equipped motherfucker doty's got email wildmount fine he doesn't look like a briarwood yes yes it is yes it was code for masturbating (all laugh) (yells) we've lost liam it is quite lovely yeah oh yes how many dragons now several of them don't hold back oh please another round i've got it i've got it that's a huge die you just rolled we talked about it briefly that's pretty good i feel like that's been done seen it that was a nice little jerry maguire there especially considering the date very appropriate i am watching this-- yellow and black yes no yes that was quite a while ago it's not the most ridiculous thing i've ever heard i know it's quite good let's finish up our business here well i think we should-- we were also going to go to the cerulean tower and have a quick conversation we need to do that but we did just finish a mission yes we have to talk to-- like we did back at greyskull our business concluded we actually have some business at the cerulean tower so we should all perhaps head there at this point too late but yes oh we're heading-- there will be adventure inevitably critical craft fair laundry magazines so yes we would love to head in that direction that sounds weird i would also like to quietly on the headphone i would really like to know where this machine comes from because i'm finding it just a bit creepy and i would love to get that information out of him before he disappears yes i dabbled no i talked about it it always just seemed so impractical and now i'm looking at one and i'm irritated vexed he didn't build this thing and i'm worried about who did he didn't build this thing what no yes what i think we've already done that i think that was an oyster we've already supped upon ah yes that got weird i'm gonna flip on the cloak by the way now that we are well out of that area i think it actually is i also want to take a good long look at robot and see if i can-- this automaton come on (sighs) okay 13 how old it is how it was built where it was built just to get a sense of it like looking over a classic car oh thank god okay i feel better fassbender all right i feel better already thank you ego restoredi think he still has the symbol doesn't he we do bring news though so we wanted to make sure that they were aware that all of the dragons had been dealt with and that the conclave had been completely vanquished excellent and we thank you for your time she writes everything down it's on the move the flu perhaps so i think that concludes this little jaunt it might be back home now oh yes it's only been two hours no we're going to hell we're taking this one to hell then yes whitestone i shove him through how about now hey okay we do quite well in the on season i was going to say yes no you should trust him with your life he's very trustworthy wait is it travis or is it me oh shit 12 it's not a lie to be perfectly honest i'm not entirely sure what's happening either that just went right up my nose it burns that is not pleasant boulder paper shears-- boulder parchment shears no no vax where'd you get that amazing armor what i'm already excited by this what so fucked up (laughs) when you put it like that in no i want to be in initiative just to make sure that i can actually make sure that-- oh i'm in 25 come on man pick it up pick it up i just draw my sword and stand on the sidelines preparing for whatever is about to happen give him a boost give him a boost nah yeah yep i get advantage on that it's a-- what saving throw i'm so sorry 20 i'm going to use my reaction to swallow part of the spell so i'm going to take half damage of his half damage mm-hm but i'm fully charged i can use this as long as i have a reaction i'm so excited halved to ten yeah yeah mm that was very impressive yes i don't know i think i'm just gonna enjoy watching this for a minute i'm gonna hold my attack until he pulls out another object of any kind yep i think we should see him dodge you should have vax work that out later no you should get someone to work on that you're still  you're still alive several of us have already died the armor yes the armor it's very nice armor we do we thought we would just give him a little taste of where he's going to make sure that he was up to it we couldn't have this happen in the nine hells there's no crying in the nine hells all right all right oh son oh son daddy issues that's all we had to hear we would've just taken you right on they're so awful it's like looking into a dark mirror i don't know how i feel about this very dark mirror right now no no no your cowering honesty has won us over let's get you a beer would you like a beer would you like a glass of wine we have wine we have a lot of wine some of it is quite good really no we know it was gross yes sometimes we must sacrifice for the adventure we have wine well that's fair you are the worst person i love you well friends friends we're getting into shame and we're sober i think something must be done about this why don't we do it with wine we have a magnificent library oh yes it's time we had another nerd let's have a good drink and in the morning we'll set off on the next leg of idiocy i still feel a little ill to be fair we've killed dragons so the fact that you actually managed to hold it together is actually quite impressive yes no no no no no i love it we've decided to go a little softer with him she'll be back that's fair that's fair aw (sighs) how's your sister at least is your sister reasonable oh no mary-anne marian darrington marion darrington he is the worst person younger she's a maid marion no maid marion darrington then she'll be a made maid marion (all laugh) i may be drunk (all laugh) this is such a dark mirror this is a very dark mirror that was a long walk to-- howard show him your tattoo i'm just sort of curious i just had a thought --the clasp you did you're gonna make me draw it that's fine i'm doing the clasp logo if i-- does this look at all familiar i have the clasp logo hashtag clasp most of us yes we even have a library we have quite a nice library horrifyingly yes yeah i was a bit of a reader growing up yes fiction and non-fiction a bit of everything i was a-- i will happily show you my library stop stop smiling at that he seems to be well-built for it i do yeah yes yes i've built a few things yeah i didn't make that but i did make this one and i pull down the folded ridiculous-- bad news it takes these-- and i pull out a musket ball-- and it fires them at great speed in whatever direction i like very dangerous-- thank you it's very dangerous thank you i think so i did this took about six months seven months i mean i'd been thinking about it for quite a while i'm working on a few others too-- this is kind of the definitive-- yes this is when we were all-- -- on the last time we took a break ah neither it's in this-- no it's not magical at all everything in this is purely physical no magic involved whatsoever yes showing the mechanism off technically she is tax-exempt she is tax-exempt she's a baroness

very impressed i'm not leaving i'm gonna send him to the library at the very least i kind of like him it's a terrible sign isn't it just really really disturbing no that's weird it does it makes me want to take risks it's nice no i feel like we've been playing it very safe it's just been that the world has been taking risks that's so nice i wanna say let's give him some privacy but at the same time i do kind of want to see him paper shears or parchment shears sam and i think i'm done for the evening he might know if you're scrying on him let's give him a little bit of time thank you grog that's a very fair point little elf girl is it a danger zone because you know it occurs to me i've never given you a full tour of the treasury room have i i'm grabbing the wine and i'm leaving right now who has never wanted to have the full scrooge mcduck for fuck's sake (all laugh) i owe you for that shit thank you we do deposit the check at the treasury by the way while we're there all healed up airship or sea ship this is your call we should bring a pike to hell we have twenty six hundred men in the back no there is actually technically there's the sea to the north but that would be useless mm-hm there's a reason we're not a poor city oh i was about to say who has the map you have the map okay do you have a map this is a conversation that is happening right now i'm so amused we're trying to remember the fake geography-- of our fantasy world all right yeah yeah we're up here whitestone's here and we need to be the south-west so-- emon's here emon is the biggest port city on the ozmit sea isn't it yeah that's-- we might as well leave out of emon where's the airship by the way as well when was the last time we saw them well-put it's easier to teleport if you're already been there i'm gonna join in on this history check as well wow (singing) no one knows what it's like to be a bad man okay hey now that got real weird (all laugh) yeah i've only got what i read at home well who else can we talk to she really wants to go to the docks in emon magic let's go to the earth ashari let's collect our things what's the temperature like there the witch let's also say as we're getting ready i'm gonna take tary down and let him pick through the tinkering room see if he needs any tools and upgrade anything that he might need give him a quick tour showing him the equipment don't touch that i am so consistently proud of you other things what else is in the room he has three original print issues of cherry comics number one through four rustic matt and thank you no i'm feeling it and my workshop obviously is your workshop for as long as you stay here anything you need to work on of course it's fully available this is so amazing percival fredrickstein von musel klossowski de rolo the third at your service percy to my friends tary it's a pleasure this is the castle i live in this is my sister's castle except of course she's lovely cassandra de rolo you are in whitestone as our guest a pleasure i recommend eventually not necessarily today 'cause i am actually enjoying it learning everyone else's name as well no it's-- i'm okay with it i'm rolling with it

on the back so that y'know if anyone tries to-- we decorated them at the last winter festival and it looked quite nice uh thank you for turning us into an episode of california yes to get to critical role take the 101 with the 5 to get up to burbank to get to critical role from beautiful downtown burbank yeah they're sending us to the things we're going to kill it's from the walking company of course kaitiaki (all laugh) just thinking it's like diatomaceous earth just hateful yes let's we treestride we get a ship and then-- -- we spend a night on the ship isn't that gonna be fun i haven't been on a ship si-- oh my yeah well we-- technically we-- we left it in emon i'm kind of feeling the boat i haven't been on a boat in a long time and i'm feeling a little weird about an airship i know we did-- we could-- i mean i wouldn't object to it i just-- i'm not getting the proper shoes i knew you would they are no no they're boating shoes they're actually boating shoes i am embarrassed that i know exactly what you're talking about i'm so excited that is-- that is my favorite phrase in the english language is i have a kit for that you have just come upon it pine he's just gotten a little scar yes is this the harrison ford or is it the scar right below the cheek so that when he cries it hits the scar and goes down it's like a little pachinko machine of pain ooh she wouldn't maybe not know necessarily they're not dead they just left her one-handed ter the dercks looks good abban we're looking to-- i'm cutting in for a second-- -- charter dear charter you're looking to charter i-- well this was just-- no please she's much better at this than you okay i just-- i don't feel the dice were necessary at that point no i think we just-- that's a long-ship-- we need a big-- we need a bigger ship yes yes you are do you want a galleon grog there is this thing for seasickness with seaweed-- that's not-- that's we could or we could just-- what are we going to do when we're done with it i know really it's not even frugal this is just what you do once you have money-- -- you only buy things you need and just lease everything else it's very very common it's all good this is very true leasing she meant it as a compliment by about ten feet we would be excited to make it worth your while what is your while worth i imagine there's six of us and a bear the bear sleeps in jewelry oh and a robot an automaton can i say automaton okay 150 gold a day i'm so pleased we're quite fierce actually that's a good question how many of us have actually been on a ship before am i really-- come on even better than i could have possibly imagined the drensala vis mother lucker aye captain i think as long as the ship is prepared and has-- --everything stocked everything it needs i think we're just reasonable and i have the remnants of several bottles of liquor i'm quite pleased why you're gonna get to sleep on a hammock grog there'll be a hammock no i'm not even dignifying that with a groan-- that would not even-- i expect better of you he could just write that we set out at dawn little elf girl leb little elf boy no no it's quite common no it's quite common i think it's perfectly fine and so-- as our ship sinks slowly in the west we bid farewell i love ships ships are great i think i'm the only character who's spent some time on a boat at this point who's been on a ship and pike--
