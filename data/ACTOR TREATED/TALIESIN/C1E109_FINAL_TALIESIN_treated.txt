we've only told them about the pictures so far 260 something pages 256 pages i'll say regardless of what version when you actually get the book it's going to be treated as an artifact from the cobalt reserve so there's going to be historical texts and writings from various librarians in the cobalt reserve chronicling the adventures of vox machina including a lot of fun easter eggs and there will be some fun easter eggs in there there may even be some background meta data that doesn't really exist anywhere else it should be available for ordering sometime in the late fall that sounds like the wine talking would this be an insight check at this point oh no how long have you felt this way this is a bit-- i don't know what's happening right now i'm not going to pretend that i'm not extremely flattered by this and i am but i don't know is it that hard to believe that maybe someone finds me attractive (cheering) we should maybe go to vasselheim in the morning start to rally well we've sent some word out to the world we activated the beacons we're not any good to anybody at the moment so i imagine so it'll be fine that's the plan i do set a bucket trap at the door just in case i set a bucket trap oh shit no i reach underneath my pillow i grab a small copper ball manners (cheering) that's a strength check i believe where is it it's a check not a saving throw no i undo the lock so he can talk i rolled a one i don't know anything's wrong i rolled a one or we could go to his room and defile his room god only knows what's happened there that's all i needed to hear go on all right in case this is magical i just want to leave you with something (laughter) manners (click) no too much information thank you good evening do you walk out the main door okay so you do in fact trigger a bucket (laughter) i'm going to block the secret passage i'm going to shift some furniture this was good well done you hi yep we should at least prepare vasselheim then if a wrath of a dark god is on its way they should probably prepare themselves we would assume with one eye each that would be likely wow no i feel it trial forge i agree with this plan what is the symbol i'll make a perception check let's see if you'll roll a one again no that's much better 28 yes if we did it at a temple perhaps if we're going to make a sun appear-- well technically we've already been observable so there's very little that we can say that he doesn't already know he hears everything or at least an open ear i think he sees this city as a ripe audience what's a fair amount okay 21 cannibal zombie dwarves what didn't we say it's a little cold up here that's okay audience there they are (laughter) yeah that's not over yet audience larkin is in the hearts and minds of children are we going i think we proceed by taking a 15-minute nap really at this point it looks quite nice i'm personally thinking that an undead army of cannibalistic dwarves would be very appealing if i were starting an assault on a city like this and i would be heading my city in that direction to raise a bunch of undead cannibalistic dwarves that's my vibe i feel like that's where we're going to find them and where we'll find them preoccupied you're assuming that he's going to do what he would expect us to think he would do in the first place we have a bit of a roving blind spot here that we could use yeah that got weird safe bet they're the distraction we think that's where they're headed that'd be my thought that's where i would go i think that the surprise that he's expecting to bring to the city possibly especially with the information you brought is that he would try and raise this creature and use it against the city somehow you make that less threatening i'm not sure how you do that turducken of the damned (laughter) if we can all three in one swift movement once we've weakened-- so much sass we didn't make them to be aerodynamic did we we'll wait until we're a little closer okay this is going to be weird it's that and who's made of the most glass who's going to get hit the most let's do this did we guess wrong we should scry on the dwarven city if we can really quickly do we know enough to scry or she's not we know where vecna is we just need to see where lady briarwood is oh shit we should stop that from happening 18 temporary hit points natural 20 for 25 it's where it came out how big are these footprints approximately keyleth how big would a creature be if it had footprints approximately 150 to 200 feet across that's the most exciting dwarven forge thing i'd ever want to see the godzilla interior it may be all it takes neverending storying our way to a terrible death okay will that work on the back of a big shiny dragon i think it's also in theory necrotic which means it can be turned we're going to have to do something it's a good question at least we're a smaller target at that point i shoot the other one with a gun it's okay we're going at a speed that it doesn't matter did that just happen (counting) 25 i should have said this i was going to burn a grit to drop animus wait if our eyelids are invisible does that mean we can't even close our eyes no it's too much too much not cool okay that's my worst nightmare yeah no i was just having a clockwork orange moment that's not true 24 let's see if we can land on that burst pimple then natural 20 (cheering) (groaning) we did see this happen right roll really high twice this is what's happening this is who we are now that helps what time is the signing that's actually a real question no don't touch that
