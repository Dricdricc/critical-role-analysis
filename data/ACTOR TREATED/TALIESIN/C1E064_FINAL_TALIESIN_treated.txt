why did you have those notes with you (groans) okay (laughter) is that true we all deserve it we know we do that was terrible i have a thing called resolve and i have one usage of it left may i use it okay that's double eight i'm so excited so do we have a straight piece of missing time are we still waiting to go to the feywild how long does this spell take i did but i feel fine now you're a terrible liar (laughs) what are you talking about i did what can someone who can't successfully lie to me please explain to me what's going on how do you know about the grey hunt is it written on a piece of paper this is how i know you're lying because if i had written that down you wouldn't have thrown it away that's ridiculous i feel funny i don't know-- for the sake of actual sanity does she actually have the piece of paper that he wrote down i did i wrote it down for her and handed to her it's got like fur and some like-- i don't know what's so funny about that either i don't remember any of that it's fine i'm happy to commit to this why what hap-- what this is so exciting i've never seen him laugh like that before i don't want to well that's getting giffed okay yeah oh and i'm out of resolve wow eight the best crystal meth the finest crystal meth in christendom ten minutes and grand mistress of the grey hunt it's not remembering he's going to be making it up i'm not actually going to remember it he's going to lie you don't have time to have this conversation this is happening right now this isn't happening fuck with me i'm so excited and by remember meaning whatever you explain very uncomfortable all right but no that was tension okay yes oh my wait that was-- we were-- but there was-- you shouldn't no yes i did do this yes i do and we will never discuss why again but yes i did do this and i'm so glad i wrote it down correctly because that was very embarrassing i'll have this approved yes well i'm going to make sure i have to-- of course inform-- yes i apparently am missing an awful lot of time but this did happen yes okay oh that kind of bow really you promise oh god did we get alcohol did someone give us alcohol damn yeah but it won't be fairy alcohol but i know how long have we been gone for i'm going to go file this and i'll meet you in a moment here i'm going to make sure that that's finalized with the correct spelling strange suddenly i am hungry are you suddenly hungry we should eat something i could use a carafe of wine holy jesus i'm going to check my pockets for anything interesting my sketchbook yes what about it oh my god i did this is so weird this'll do no no this and liquor will do honest statue of a hog it's an honest statue of a hog six hours don't teach him how to say it in elvish he understands common that's fair let's hold off on the dog it tastes like saturday certainly excellent she will let's clean up and head in that direction i'd imagine yes i hadn't even noticed actually we were successful i will let the others fill you in with some details although i do-- and i'm going to double check and i'm going to find the brief letter explaining what i've set up with vex although it will not have any of the reason why but it will have at least the nature of what's been done and we have acquired well vex vex'ahlia if you would i appreciate your kind generosity we'll see yes that might be complicated but yes what is eastward we don't know where they've been sent we don't know why we need to find out where they're going no of course just making a list that's a card we no longer have we must be careful we cannot let whitestone be discovered we can't fit everybody hold 23 hold pick them up keep running until the moment they can't wait this is my home wait keep moving spread out keep moving find a position if i'm towards the front i'm moving everyone towards the house where we made the tunnel that goes underneath the sun tree what are you going to write what are you going to write alert everyone you see tell them to get underground tell them to be silent thank you find everyone tell them silence we still have the cavern we built underground start making it larger under the tree more people there's the inn that was broken it's got an entrance they either go there or they go underneath the castle she's making it bigger other way other way it's funnier that way i was about to say you have an ashley app that's so adorable of course it's not but yes definitely let them out we'll have to make it more secure and safer i'm not losing it no because it doesn't matter it's there anyway seven days ten minutes oh but do i remember having the fake memory or do i not remember having a fake memory yes i give her a big hug i'm so tired i'm sorry i'm going to sit down they'll give you a headache thank you shut up thank you i know where you sleep people work for me what direction were the wyverns travelling were they travelling back or were they travelling along-- but they originated in the west and they are currently travelling southeast which is to the east no it's-- draconia is to the southeast why do i know that yeah it is it's over here are they going back that we know of that's right the werewolves could be called upon you would think it's not as ridiculous as you think whatever remnants of draconia perhaps they would not answer our call but if someone has relations with the clasp they are always an option for manpower this is very true don't mention that vex flies there are options but we need to discuss what happened today this changes some things you're mad we need defense this is not a site of a victory this is a site of our end we need bunkers i'll discuss a warning system to get people underground we hope putting the word out that we're other places than we are putting the sound-- they know we did it maybe the army's going to head to-- no we could be so lucky if it was on its way to attack it i feel like there should be trading cards we were hoping to distract them we did sign the card i don't think they know where we are i think they know when we travel i just don't think they know where we are he did not know our name but he has seen us here we probably do we should assume we have a leak is he shaun now i would assume that there's nothing we say that they don't know at this point perhaps we should not have assumed ironically when we played the game at home this is exactly what we'd do i think we talk and drink i'm involved in this this is exciting pour one for the landlord as well he's letting us drink our wine in his room terrible dangerous places you should never go are practically our middle name she's got a very fair point yes are any of the vestiges in wildemount ironically is somewhere else entirely before we even think of this we should see what we're-- i don't think we're going to collect all of the vestiges we should see what other vestiges we think are going to be helpful i think that we've been thinking about this the wrong way i think that we've been treating this as a battle and we have to start treating this like a war which is a very different creature we are absolutely not we need to reinforce this city not as a final stand but as a place where there might be survivors because if they come here there's no battle to be fought it's just a loss i would like to talk to some of the magic users about installing some sort of-- or perhaps helping me install a non-magical dragon raid signal so that the population knows to be quiet and knows to quietly go underground in the event of the next fly-by would triggering it possibly alert them to our existence does it make holding up the shield-- i would like to put it to use we're at war we're not going to move it i want to put the private council table in the room with it so no glamor will survive no magic will survive no trick can be allowed that's probably a bad sign but thank you we should move quickly we should pick a couple of vestiges and move quickly collect them start finding more allies move quickly but we should not dally too long could cabal's ruin-- it's cabal's ruin correct we're going to search for cabal's ruin we don't have time i will feel better with one or two more vestiges in our pocket we got lucky i think it's a great idea worth exploring we're drunk we will talk about you in third person as much as we want we figured you would speak up if you had issue i think if there's a dragon sitting on top of them removing people from him is-- grog i think you're thinking of a battle we can win as opposed to a war we're losing we can help them by killing the dragon vax is agreeing with me what is the white dragon going to do-- i think an opportunity's being tabled briefly i don't think this is nearly as time sensitive well we could start it it's also something other people can do while we do other things well there are other ways to do it in traditional warfare you can do things like cause damage to the property of one dragon and leave scant evidence that the other dragon or one of the dragon's people was somehow responsible have a raiding somehow get wyverns to raid near-- yes it's the easiest level if the white dragon is a hunter the easiest way to incite damage is to sneak into the city and start mauling and killing draconians that are left over and just leaving bodies everywhere that he wasn't responsible for that is the sort of decisions we're going to start having to make i think this is a conversation that can continue through marquet i don't think we're going to come up with the best idea tonight a reasonable and astute observation yes let's pick a dragon there is a thought this is a very good idea you've got a very good idea we need to know what pushes the reset button why am i speaking in video game metaphor nothing drink not statues idols small images of the white dragon for worship start hiding them in places if we start seeding them especially in emon as if he is trying to get people to worship him in other cities as well silently quietly underneath-- we just have to make sure that we don't use the stone from here and this will piss him off and if he says what are you doing i don't know anything about this i like it little shrines hidden in ruins i still will admit that cabal's ruin is one of the vestiges i feel would be-- and not just because i would like to use it so we could do a triple and that's very important because we need them on our side ozmit sea so it's over here actually this world is shaped like a d20 so we're on the flat part at the five let other people do that i don't know why everyone's so excited about the notion of pissing off the dragons to the point at which they all come here but it is a way to go they know we're here we have to make sure that we can get out immediately and we also have to agree that if things start looking too iffy we run we could look like lizard people and it would trick anybody who wasn't a dragon and if the dragon came we would be fucked that would be the end that would be game over i'm going to go on record as saying i do not think this is the right move will help us getting three more vestiges two more vestiges just a little bit more power before starting to play chess again there's an ancient dwarven saying and i'm trying to remember where i heard it but it goes somewhere along the lines of it's never a three-hour tour that's my fear your mind is a grandfather clock you know that it's correct twice a day easily thank you this is not going to be a fight of 13 people they're going to be wondering who we are first off we're not going to be able to disrupt communication no tightening up we're going to go what are we going for but it means this is not a one-day this is a three-day mission we teleport to the black dragon's lair we sleep overnight teleport in teleport out and then sleep overnight teleport either to whitestone or to marquet and risk a very reasonable reason that they would know where we are we need to sleep anyway because we're exhausted that is so astute it's 1200 my god he had a thought i disagree i think the next time they come to attack and kill us it will be vacated i agree i legitimately agree we do have to sleep regardless there's no getting around sleep we can't actually get there right now they were heading southeast so they're probably heading back home they thought that we might be here and they took a quick look around which is why i don't want to make any more noise around here i'm going to go to the barkeep is there a civilian waitress there's no barmaid at all they're shooting mittens and you're so uncouth never mind this is what i get for trying to be nice to anybody i've learned my lesson we'll sleep for now we'll wake up in the morning and we'll either go in one direction or the other that's so not true we came up with a lot we just have to sleep and then make a decision based on what the world looks like in the morning that cloak sounds useful as a side i want to grab vex for a quick walk on the way to the castle i want to go by the cemetery has it been worked on by the way i suppose i'll find out vax vax i've been drinking i've not even been drinking i've been pretend drinking i have something to show you you'll like it well i don't know if you'll like it i don't know what you like i'm going to take him to the cemetery to the crypt the title i gave your sister doesn't come with much but it does come with one at the moment tiny plot of land on which a crypt sits this was the resting place of the father and grandfather and assorted family members of the man you killed the first night we came here no i want something else to live in a mausoleum this is actually for you open it i go and i light the two little torches on the side this is very traditional and it should open do you trust me good answer i'll go in first i figured it would be a good idea i've had my fill of gods but i'm not so foolish to think that we do not need them still this is here when you need it me too i do not want to die who i am i would like to live long enough to be someone else i think you understand that i've been encouraging it good i certainly do not deserve it yet i don't know if i ever will but i can't think of anything else to do with my time on earth right now other than this i am finished with gods they will not help me maybe you will yes i've always liked you too thank you it's the open spaces where i suffer the tight spots i feel very good about it's the open spaces this is a very tight spot yes i know do you know why i titled your sister she thought she was missing something that-- and i use this term loosely-- ordinary people we have a magic we use to convince people that we deserve the things we get those of us who were born this way it was treating her unfairly and limiting her ability to see her world for what it was worth and it was a simple and easy fix she is going to wake up one morning-- not yet but soon-- and realize that money will not make her happy and that trying to please that awful father will not make her happy the first step in that is realizing that he's weak and there's no better way to do that than being better titled than your parents i know but you are not her and i'm not saying it's the truth but it is what i believe is in her heart i think perhaps that might lift i will never hurt her i will never hurt anybody intentionally especially not you any more than i already have in return i ask never take your eyes off me never trust me and that is the best friend that you can be you can like me i would love that and in fact i hope that i can earn your like i just never want to earn your trust a gentle title will suit your sister well i'm leaving not chicken the thick single-slab bacon the rain is good it will mean that they'll have an easier time figuring out the water level while they're digging out beneath the sun tree and making sure that it's secure i love this weather an attempt at an object of power or an attempt at friends in power draconia has friends in power (long sigh) that is true we haven't heard anything but that is true i personally would assume that tiberius would either be on his way to one of the two cities if he were so inclined and if he had survived and if he wasn't working in the city itself to keep it functioning and again we're at war this is not a battle we do not win by going to draconia we do not win by going to marquet we win months from now no i'm making perfect sense breakfast needs things to live (laughter) i'm all right with a vote hold on let's see if ashley texts in the next ten minutes i have it i have it right here yeah one or 20 ready yes it's flipped there's only two it's a coin and any other number we stay home we're going to draconia and we're going to see if we could find tiberius i think we should go as draconians i think that's a better plan we don't have to teleport to the middle of nowhere well we do need to get farther away from here is there any way to get farther away from where we are right now before we-- well as long as we commit to 24 hours in draconia no matter what i think 72 hours is a perfectly reasonable amount of time to dedicate to this prospect i have a compromise let's scry from the giant's cave outside the city couple of hours to get there it's fine it's nine it's seven-- it's 3am why are we awake we get far enough outside of the city so at the very least-- we may end up somewhere random i think that's underestimating or overestimating-- i don't know it's a coin flip really he's small go for it then see what happens a person or a creature not a place can it be a magic object start with the stone i think we should call it rock the rock start with tiberius we'll work our way down no you did wonderfully that can mean a lot of things or lockheed not necessarily how many times have we found stray cats that would be who i would kill if i were taking over the city i do grog first we don't want to be around any civilization and also that's one more spell gone it's true there's only risk at this point is this the risk we make or is this not the risk we make grog only so that we can ignore it with the new data how do you feel no why would you do that no that's a good idea we're going to rappel yes six seconds we're all going to hold on to the rope and we all go this is a terrible plan i want to go on record for saying i was against this plan-- he could have they weren't that far off but to be fair this is what a plan is is everything going wrong so i'm all right with doing this if we're doing this vex we're going to have the greatest i-told-you-so if we survive this no we're going to need every spell we need in there no you're the weight that's going to hold the rope down you're going first i'm holding on the rope because i'm an idiot i hate you all 20 i'm going to let that happen hit your head in the fall i'm going to look around and see if there's a direction in which it seems there's civilization or any signs of battle or otherwise 16 clever we could just keep our eyes open let's not be fleshy if we're lizard people draconians will not trust us shaky dance (laughter) is there anything you're not good at don't think that hard never mind draconians they won't actually be tails that might actually get us in trouble we're moving towards the epicenter i would like to join that insight check nine they look like they're in use i'm cowering wow i think he assumed i think this is actually going far better than i had hoped oh that's lovely that was our hope that we would be able to come here when it was at its weakest and get a sense of it do you know what i like as much as whispers loot crate loot crate doesn't decide to just tell one person about what's going on they let everyone know not just vex there's more than one dragon and they are supporting each other we want to make the means to make sure that when the time comes we can destroy them all in one fell swoop he is not the strongest everywhere we can answer the continent set up a situation where we can monitor you and possibly contact you when it's time and even let you know if we think the dragon's about to leave so that you can prepare yes it was natural 20 no i put the golden snitch away for the evening if all goes well we will have one more conversation i do have one other question the bodies on the spikes how did that happen what was that thank you i'm going to join you on that natural 20 you both saw that right that just fucking happened this is not my normal die this is something i bought at comic con sumerian you asshole i'm bringing a shrine to burning man by the way bless you for knowing a sumerian deity are there other perches does this seem like the only thing or would there be other sentry points as well so we have a really good vantage right now do we see the orb do we see an orb there we go see that wasn't great 11 we don't actually know his voice and draw it to a certain spot with our i get a distinct impression that it is not impressed by ice do they speak common let's make a plan okay and then we go home and the dragons are at war then what yes and now is not that point what we are going to need is we need to sneak you in there and we need you to take a movement we're not near the orb we're near the draconians aren't we travis and we know a lot already scanlan why would you bother to pretend to be a beast if he just finds you he'll hunt you and kill you we've made allies we've got a look at everything we know the terrain and we know the political terrain i will also add that we can leave them with something how about a small grove of trees it's all right no i've got a better idea once we've gathered some resources when we return we prepare to attack post-hunt once it has exhausted itself on something large and angry that is when we strike the dragon when we come back we stay until it's time when we come back it is to end this with the trees we will know how to return quickly with a force with a little bit of information we could even keep them informed of things for it to kill that they may find around here with the slayer's take's help we can keep you in supply of things to amuse it we are sorry that this cannot end as quickly as would be agreeable we can do our best to help make you comfortable and if you need some proof of the power that we wield we can offer a token i have a thought but if you wish a token of our power we can send a beast before perhaps but our travel is long we may need more time we have two more continents two weeks continents further than you have walked in your life we move quickly but there is only so much that can be done no we plant one tree no we have to plant some trees find a place that is secret let's find a place this will be where we leave anyway no we're about to run i do have a request on our way out would the dragon notice if any of these bodies were disturbed pull that one down then thank you (sighs) it is exactly what i expect i would assume i look it over i check let's bring him inside at least i don't know the remnants of the library perhaps the ground's too hard to bury no we absolutely cannot he was no i checked unless he's very clever and very keen and i don't think they are i think that if they knew he would be in a more exalted position of defacement i think this is just slaughter things vanish i'm all right with making this vanish that's as much of a calling card as i feel we need to leave i have a thought we're not bringing him to us we're leaving him here but we're putting him somewhere appropriate put him with the books this will do can you seal it i'm going to find tooma is she behind us hopefully this war will go on schedule but there's our promise that's the best you're going to get i head out yes let's there's much to do we let them know where the grove would be found before we left them at the top a little grove of trees we'll report what we've seen we'll try to gain our bearings again get sleep tonight we'll report what we've seen in the new room no one else and we will never utter this city's name outside these walls again glad we decided to take a light-hearted game
