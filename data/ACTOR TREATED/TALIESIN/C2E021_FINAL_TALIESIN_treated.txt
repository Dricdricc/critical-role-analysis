thank you sam so crazy oh shit definitely a long time since i've dealt with anyone in a dragon mask a bird that's a weird thing to put in the middle of a swamp of people in dragon masks thank you i've picked everything out myself this is all put together i'm literally covered in them everybody literally the coat is made up of seven different options yes but there's also-- yeah yeah i'm wearing a platinum dragon necklace sure that's what everybody says remind me to show you my tapestries no it's literally my tapestries she's high on sugar don't listen to her anyway molly that's somehow even creepier and right back in the pit anyway very gently and politely but yeah let's go we ordered coffee we're still waiting on coffee is there going to be a desert was there a desert menu can i get a container eggs never keep anyway does it always do that well done that's a good joke i'll also go in the back just feathers in your face wait just to be clear your job-- your only job was to walk to a building and back for god knows how many years and you think we're going the right way do you need to be drunk now is not the time to start making judgments sir does that clear your memory did you both roll do we not get advantage i think the mr was pretty respectable all things considered feel free to dive through the bag for anything you need just for fun (infernal) stay down some days you can't get rid of a bomb anything on the right right is there somebody on the left whoa (gong) well done does this sound like some sort of ward against the undead i've got that i'm going to pull out my sword and i'm going to carve into the side of the tree a big sign that says here lies salty pete with an arrow down straight below i don't know but it sounds like something awful happened to him doesn't it do you have a way of magically marking this as well so we can have a bit of a compass yeah like a point-- can you do a thing where you can put a pin in this tree that's true never mind no that's not fair as long as we can make our way back here again one way or the other and i suppose that's true yeah i think we've already had our fun with the one no there's a lot happening over there the loneliest plant with that life delivers a pleasant surprise fighters move forward magic peoples hang back theater whisper yeah let's just pay attention and if it starts getting close then we'll deal with it we're just not going to let it escape we're just going to keep an eye out for it did you have your own mask or do they just wear masks out of curiosity i tend to find things that live in trees filled with bones tend to not have necessarily many friends i'm just putting it out there i have nothing else to base that off of but it didn't look like a very social creature can i see him from here seven do i technically have advantage because it's trying to perceive an undead creature i'll join you in the non-stealthing you'll be going in front of us because you're going to talk to him for now nott why don't we check for traps too this should be good where did it happen inside or where did they come from but did they come from the house or from outside the safe house or inside what if there isn't that's fair oh no wait come back we're going to loot the corpse anyway we know where that money's going we're going to go find it in the tree later it'll be fine it's practically going to be in a safety deposit box 16 it's magic i'm going to try and cast enthrall i don't know yes i believe it's a wisdom-- yeah it is racial (groaning mumbles) yep i'll move up to that tree as a bonus i'll-- no i'll hold off it was a good plan the acid will do full damage you can dash and burn your action no without the strength modifier it's like in willow with the stick woo does the radiant damage seem to have a particular effect all right yeah where is the little bird there's really not much i can do here so i'm going to-- i got nothing i can do well i can do that i'm going to do one more attempt to do a devil's tongue (demonic) scoot scoot scoot oh wow holy cow i'm not used to it working 5th-level so hey look at that it actually has gone up 2d4 psychic damage that's four points of damage and it has disadvantage on its next attack roll brain freeze that's all i got glug glug are there actual knives stuck in-- shortswords or daggers yeah we're looting these bodies right now that's nice (hiccups)taliesin  (singing) bird bird bird bird is the word b-b-b-bird bird bird ashley ashley roll a d4 why don't we all head in that direction maybe in a large well knit group (singing) one thing we've got it coming would have been used as a safe house for awhile i imagine though nott do you want to walk on top of the water for a bit and keep an eye for anything underneath the surface well what if something grabs you from the shore like a troll yes we were drunk at the time it just sort of happened why don't you try pulling on the branch that it was tied to the water is now crystal clear by the way pull on the branch that it was tied to what where did that even go oh traps do you want to throw some light in here yeah we're in there as well i'll help with this one smelling the air for fishy oh doesn't matter anyway do you go back and forth do we hear the slip and the whoosh i'm going to point out we can't retreat no she's upstairs 15 i've already activated a sword 16 where am i let's see i'm over there i'm going to run as far as i can go towards fjord and then i'm going to spend the rest of my action running across and get into that little alcove no the other side of it i'm so sorry so positioning and ready for things to come i've got nothing for my bonus one is activated the other is not have anything good on a bonus does that get advantage aren't they in combo-- wouldn't that be sneak attack hi after there ain't nothing for me to hit so i'm going to slightly peek out around the corner so that i can keep an eye on things and i'm going to hold my attack for anything that comes within range yeah the circle should be a little further forward so yeah they're just-- since he's going to end his turn there i'm going to go ahead and cast some bullshit on that this is a reaction i'm doing a blood maledict the next two attacks are disadvantage yeah one point of damage wait didn't he burn his whole turn just getting to where he was what did you roll are you close enough to the bonus action-- can someone grab fjord or is that not happening i did step out hey we're all friends here i cast friends i know that was intense there's a lot in that are you going to be all right you're right you're going to feel a little weird in a few minutes i apologize for that it's a thing let's clear this water and let's take a breather let's sit down thought you needed a minute of clarity this one less so i am keeping an eye on these pools looking for any movement by the way have you not played with your gil die yet the official currency of it nice manacles are they humanoid sized how deep is that pool i'm going to search the bottom of it can she give me advantage on that i know we didn't want to interrupt the thing it doesn't matter anyway it's eight check that other one too in a moment the other one then i think we're going to have to don't we have a cat that can become a fish yes we don't know if there's going to be air on the other side of that though so we need people that can-- as long as you don't mind dying sure we're going to do this we'll have a rope tied we are the worst people i'm not okay with this we could even cast the thread and sleep upstairs sure yeah sure i don't think it can be actually here's an insane thing that occurred to me technically speaking charm person lasts a really long time i cast friends that's fair i'm into that mr caleb there's only so many burdens we're expected to bear before we're asking for failure oh no i'm with you (yelling) you were right caleb you're just a shitty communicator (yelling) yep i've never played with a magical item before i owe you the biggest drink oh my god oh the dragon one
