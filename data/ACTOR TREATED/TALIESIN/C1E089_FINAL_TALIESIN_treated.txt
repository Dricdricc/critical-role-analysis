little bit about the game just roll it up and burn it you gonna finish that coke why are we not talking about this my how time flies breaded men oh i saw breaded men i was very excited this is how he criticizes us now is he makes a little web video and sends it to all of us instead of talking to us i'm feeling it yes it turns out i have to record voice over on occasion so wednesday club is not going to be me this week and i'll be talking to comic books to the engineer who will be mildly irritated with me but instead you guys matt key is going to be hosting and he is going to talk about his favorite thing in the world -- his wife and doctor strange but that's cool too because him and his wife and doctor strange his work wife it's great and fun i'm still underwater aren't i i am dragging taryon-- and you if i can drag you as well-- we're walking away did we all hear it the kraken okay that's good they-- they-- they went away can we breathe some air please we're on our way barely yes for the moment we're on our way keyleth what-- are there other options are there other options is anybody else startled by it i'm going to run to my room and get my things have we had-- we have not had anything vaguely resembling a short rest at this point you in all right i'd been hoping to run a perception check through pretty much this entire conversation to make sure she's being completely honest about everything yeah an insight check meh 13 okay well he did well yeah yeah no i know the feeling man whoa how you feeling buddy where is everybody yes i'm going to be crafting little seashell necklaces or hair bits for everybody-- i've been working on a hair bit mm little-- yeah and like the-- -- with the little yeah you know what it-- yeah-- it's like we've had this conversation making little bits for everybody i say-- i make sure tary gets a little seashell crown so we do have to get him an earpiece long may he reign (all laugh) is there anyone else around by the way i wanna check are we being listened to is there anyone within earshot is there anything-- 16 okay oh it has not come ooh i wonder-- oh dear uh keyleth i've been thinking what do you think the aramente is supposed to teach i'm regretting that i hadn't been thinking about it until today well they tell you to go out and gather a group of friends and then thrust yourself into a death-defying situation that is likely to get people killed i'm-- and i don't mean to worry you-- just be cautious i don't-- i have that nagging feeling and i'm hoping it's wrong but i think it is possible that they feel you did not lose-- you did not learn the lesson of the aramente what if the lesson is loss what if you're supposed to go down there and watch people that you love die the thing that defines the worst leader a people could have is a lack of empathy i think that they make sure their leaders might-- i think it's possible i don't-- i'm nervous i think it's possible that they make sure their leaders are empathetic by making sure they know pain i do i just hope that it was enough-- i just-- you know me this is beautiful here and i-- i look forward to leaving and i'm very proud of you but i will be on my guard just in case every farm boy in whitestone once he's old enough to talk and work names an animal raises it and butchers it i think i'm too cruel to lead (sighs) regardless speaking of which oh boy grog i have something to say in a moment of panic i may have influenced your decision to save taryon from the kraken i instantly regretted it-- not because of you taryon i do apologise for that-- i instantly regretted it it was a poor decision i fully apologize and if you wish to keep my glasses i totally understand and at the very least if i have a swift punch in the face coming i completely understand i'm so sorry and i wish i could say i would never do it again but i honestly don't trust myself that much but i am really really sorry and if anything had happened i would have run in to save you as best i could i think you're gonna punch me (all laugh) it's-- i don't know sometimes i can just be unnaturally convincing in the wrong hands which are my hands on occasion i felt bad i feel bad i feel like i did-- i was not a good-- i feel like i made a poor decision and put you in peril and subverted your free will does that make-- uh no small words because i'm a jerk that's why you saved taryon 'cause i'm-- because i can be a bad friend i just am trying to be honest with you because i respect you and i would hate for you to think that-- i-- (sighs) terrible at this no i'm not all right i've made some bad decisions today and i've terrible thoughts and-- ugh i'm so tired how about we just say i owe you one i owe you one no well you can say that too but just know that-- that i owe you one i owe you-- what-- it's-- that would work-- i just-- have some seashells and a skipping rock i feel better that's all i needed that's all i needed i feel better (slow claps)

tour i've been thinking about redecorating well summer home really no but if you have any input on decor or otherwise we would be interested oh i would assume we'll vary it up a bit in my old room (all laugh) it's good coffee today and i'll definitely show him the downstairs and anytime you want to use the workshop downstairs-- it's a bit thin at the moment yes invisibility teleportation death has changed you oh feel free to restock whatever's missing keyleth and i i think at the very least and maybe anybody else who wants to go upstairs and start poring through the wonderful private nooks and crannies of the library please nooks and crannies i've got-- well they're not very good are they do i have any spare-- i don't have any spare glasses do i i think i need the glasses hm let me think about that for a moment carry on i'm very quickly going to craft something super simple i want to make a little foil pinwheel out of tin it's proficiency plus dex i can never remember well you know that's probably good enough let's see 18 yeah i have made a tiny pinwheel it spins and it's made of metal and i put it on your lapel or your little strap that counts as a-- i just put it in a belt loop now you know if there's wind blowing this is what i had i'm really like-- i'll give the glasses back when i'm done with them this is a rental charge shit oh dear i'm just going to help with

language are we going there it's a locked book of unspeakable evil oh god if that's all-- what's doty's willpower i can't read it anyway that didn't work out this'll be like the end of the second act-- -- the second act of ghostbusters do you act-- (burps) i run over i give you a quick kiss i say if you turn evil it's still cool just so you know (all laugh) whoa bless you yep it's a knockout wow now i can feel the fingers in the back of my head (all laugh) damn it pike can we destroy this thing the knowledge exists now it's outside the book and if the book was-- there's something in there oh oh transcription of the story it would be invaluable that was-- no that was a sea captain's journal it's okay it doesn't matter it's not-- no no no no no i think so even if there is a vault all the vault is is a-- it's the one place in any city where everyone knows something valuable's kept you know i feel like there's someone collecting terrible things i would feel all right with that let's re-lock it i concur you concur i feel that the cobalt reserve will probably have some sort of situation for books like this that seems reasonable south yes it's just a spinning black orb of death sitting underneath my family home no there's nothing-- i'm well aware that it's terrible i don't know why you're staring at me like that yes i think about it a lot i'm-- i just don't know what to do
