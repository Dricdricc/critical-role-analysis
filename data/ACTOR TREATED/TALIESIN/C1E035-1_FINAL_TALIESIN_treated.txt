can try a-- i can try i can't do that there's nothing he can do with it anyway i have all the ammunition i really don't think they are no thank you are you checking on lady briarwood keep her unconscious i'm going to try and wake cassandra up i'm a little shaky as well i want to quickly check my gun is lord briarwood's name still on it let's hold off just a bit before we kill her double-check perhaps gag her as well we don't want her speaking and she only has one arm so magic's going to be tricky she can't see us why are we holding our hands up actually you can see us on the screen never mind i can tell i'm going to try and wake up cassandra we will have a discussion later in the meantime do you know what that thing in there is and how do we stop it i'm going to slap her in the face not with my strength 16 well actually my strength is still thin because i still have a-- so 15 i need my sister back are you awake are you a terrible person do i want to strangle you right now good then we can work with this they were building something down here the briarwoods are no longer a problem they were building something-- what do you know about it it maybe started it seems to be affecting magic i think none of us have rolled this well in so long (starts singing in the hall of the mountain king) i walk up to lady briarwood i put my gun to lady briarwood's head you changed the deal take her name off the gun i pull the gun away things have changed we need to talk (sighs) did i even want revenge before i talked to you did i i don't remember anymore what does she die for what do i even need i want my country i want my sister i've killed two of those who have wronged me and nothing is better nothing feels better nothing is avenged what is this worth to you and i put the gun back at her head pull it back put it to her put it back maybe i will and back to hers i put the gun to the side-- no i'm holding the gun on briarwood that deal was a soft deal it was a dream it was a vision i need more from you if you want anything from me i don't trust you anymore besides i put the gun to the hand of lady briarwood and pull the trigger the gun's broken anyway i drop it i'm not satisfied i want my money back it's actually also still around her it occurs to me yep i have advantage thank you yay 20 which does work delilah you are going to die tonight whether or not it is a merciful quick death or a slow and agonizing one controlled by something darker than i know is entirely up to you how do we stop that thing i know the pain you're feeling right now i know the rage i know every moment of it and i guarantee i can make it worse i can make it so much worse fix this and join your beloved delilah don't make me hurt you grog be ready to restrain me i really haven't you still have your sanity and your life i will take your life tonight but i can leave you your sanity okay i'm going to be an asshole fine fine casting minor illusion i'm changing my form into the screaming writhing slowly-melting visage of lord briarwood and i'm just going to scream in holy high hell and pain suck it girl i'm in smoke i'm just taking-- that pain you're feeling i've felt for years don't think i've imagined every way to hurt you i could spend years hurting you before you die in ways you cannot imagine now how do we stop it why why was it too soon what were you waiting for no i really won't knock her out again collect them check her person for anything i think we're just going to throw her into the acid pits no i don't feel they're different bullets the three in theory is actually low enough to break it further fine nope that's a 16 scanlan give me the other gun the other gun i need another gun maybe i don't know things have gotten a bit weird did they not hear any of the voice oh shit i came off like a crazy person just then things are complex and i don't trust myself to take her life i'm in over my head i don't know if that will help this thing wants her dead and the only thing i can think to do is to say no this thing in my head-- i don't know i had a dream and that was all it was a dream where i was offered a means to revenge it was a dream well i know that now this is as new to me as anyone please why do you all keep rolling so poorly against me persuasion six deception two i think we've already had an episode called whispers
