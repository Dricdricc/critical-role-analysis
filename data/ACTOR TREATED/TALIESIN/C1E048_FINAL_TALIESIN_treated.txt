but if you're not ashley you'd better get yourself a shirt do you have a college sweater that just says college you could really use one that sounds like a performing arts joke i haven't seen it yet don't set expectations you can't match it's imaginary how could it be you just flow with it right i'm instagramming my wyrmwood box right now too that's not funny (buzzing fart sound) maybe if we could talk which we can't right now i follow they may have information oh it's worth talking to them at the very least i think at some point we're going to have to have that conversation but for now i think we'll probably be all right for now i'm keeping an eye also to see if anything-- from a great distance i'm just keeping an eye out white manna not green manna oh yeah yes hello what your brother ooh oh at the winter's crest festival i remember i don't see what the harm is how long have you been nomadic for possibly find you someplace to work we lost a lot during the attack with the briarwoods there's room but there's only-- we can maybe make room for a few more a shortcut one would say we'd also like to talk to you perhaps to see if you've seen some shit we're actually looking for something out here we are well you've been travelling we're looking for a creature who may have what we need to help defeat these dragons yes that's useful well that works out well then we can go up that direction perhaps take care of this problem possibly it's on the way i could use some breathing hear hear i say we take the evening to rest and first thing in the morning head out yes i'm sleeping tonight i don't know what's wrong with him i'll write a letter i'll write a letter that will travel with them to whitestone and-- mm-hm take about a minute no in the morning i write a letter to my sister letting her know that i do apologize that we're sending more people but it's necessary and i write her a letter insisting that pike be sent here by stone immediately (singing) everybody else is too you are a nerd yeah you are a theatre nerd secret garden the musical it's magical and suddenly the youtube hits just go through the roof (laughter) it's going to be whoever's organizing it

god damn it that's very interesting did you know that i'm a collector as well actually of specifics specifics i see that you have not really handed any over he's talking about transmutation of some kind it's the veganism of necromancy it's just kind of dull nothing see you start arguing and you just make a gnome this is what happens master quall let's lay the cards on the table if we find this thing of yours in your basement and if we go to your home we are certainly going to go into the basement and find it now regardless we're going to figure out what it is before we give it to you anyway the world is dangerous right now and it is not appropriate to just be handing mystical artifacts of great strength willy-nilly to anybody who asks the world is dangerous and we need to make sure that power is flowing in the correct direction now you can either be forthright with that and get your property or we can find it in your basement and experiment on it until we know what it is i have very good luck attempting these endeavors well he's got a collection i personally feel this is reasonable this is a deposit of information what does he know perhaps of the-- no in darkness if they don't wander in open daylight it's a long walk lending is perfectly agreeable you can trust her we are not flying a half-elf into the city on a broom that she has already fallen off of in the last 24 hours didn't we had a conversation about letting him name things i feel like we had this conversation do you know what 19 means oh wow yes look at that my other horse is walking just point arrows in the opposite direction we're not in a rush everything we do now is measured in weeks and months and not days actually yeah do you have a concussion is that something that we can-- how many fingers am i holding up do we want to do it now or do we want to do it tomorrow night is the question also known as uncle touchy uncle no-no they keep clucking it up before scanlan disappears i grab him as he's leaving have you perhaps installed some sort of workspace in this wonderful home of yours for me i've got a few little projects i want to poke at i'm a little worried by what all-purpose necessarily means it's not really a work table is it nothing complicated just some very basic blacksmithing and a little bit of leatherwork i can think of some very sexy things that can be done with an anvil think about it that's comical yes scanlan's helping me find a room that apparently is so sound-proof we don't actually have to hear anyone else's drama i know grab a book it'll be fun no cows in my room either please i can work with materials that are in the bag of holding that are real materials as long as i put them back in the bag of holding and take them with me i can't leave anything obviously oh it'll just be spat out that's lovely for the moment because i don't have everything i need for the broom yet i want to work on a piece of jewelry if that's okay i want to work on the thing i want to construct a little piece of jewelry if that's okay not magical do i have a jeweler's kit i can't tinker something no well this is a piece that has purpose it actually is going to be a functional object i know this is something that i-- i'm so sorry i want to make a-- i'm so sorry i'm losing the word something that's too complicated to explain to you i'm blanking on it i may have to just give you the name at the break a little herb pouch like one of those cages that close up to put herbs in them all right i'll make it pretty later dexterity thank god because that's a terrible roll 14 i'm not going to run the whole night at some point i'm going to be like i don't have the design yet this is something i want to get right so this is going to be working towards it i can't think of the name of what it is i'm so embarrassed (chicken clucking) easiest number to count to does this mean when the night's over there's going to be a little pool of blood where the door was this is going to make the archery booth at renn faire hilarious sorry okay carry on it's only eight hours save your strength i want to see if the blood comes out save it for something special 15 vex you and i should hang back but we'll let everyone else i've had bad luck touching things lately i'm letting other people touch things i'm getting another angle so that we have two different vantage points of what may happen we're keeping an eye on that thing in the-- i know it's a thing we're going to let grog touch it and see what happens keyleth that was very clever are there orcs present i knew someone would laugh at that are you describing what you're seeing at all i can't have a reaction to this unless i'm actually hearing anything can i see the statues at this point i want to get a little closer just so i can make out the statues are they classical statues or are they people in weird poses are the poses weird back up everybody back up now those aren't sculptures oh no oh no i think that there are basilisks nearby i think these statues are victims i have a terrible initiative roll 13 i rolled really badly that's barely an arrow and a chicken in the neck okay no that's a (counts) 21 points constitution save i rolled a 14 plus seven i look at it in the eye (barks) bark it down i know i cast hex on it i'm looking at the one she's hunter's marked i cast hex yeah and i'm taking i'm giving it a disadvantage on willpower ability checks and i'm going to take three shots with sharpshooter 12 misses oh my god goodbye going to the good die 12 better 24 oh my god i'm sucking 22 points of damage so while shooting i ran from that one tree all the way to the other one that was a running shot so yeah behind the tree over there about there slap fight hair pull scorpions are fascinating that's really upsetting how did we not walk into that how have we been sitting here and that didn't happen actually matt how blindsight works i'm shutting the fuck up now there is coffee everywhere no you did because you did half the dice she did 4d10 one in 20 chance my brain is not doing numbers for some reason yeah you did wait do you let go of the broom to roar like a reverse pyramid pine sap gets in your eye did you cut yourself on your cup oh i hate that 11 no we're good we're good it is a really weird pot of coffee it's not just you you should lick it too after you piss on it it says it was forged by dwarves that's all i can understand you're a terrible person why don't you two just write a sequel to batman/superman while you're at it just destroy everything i don't care anymore not our finest hour pretty reasonable hour but it's definitely not the finest we brought most of a mapmaker back technically saved seven-eighths of a mapmaker no it's like a one-legged duck walking around a lot's happened and a period of adjustment we should send him back to the encampment that actually could be useful well we'll run into him when we get back not cool you worry me get the orcs really quick and then we can send him back with the refugees from there when it's time he can hide with the bear then a bear will be hiding with a mapmaker or most of a mapmaker yeah temple temple of the raven queen nothing wrong with sidetrack
