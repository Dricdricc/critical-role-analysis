i don't even know how to interpret this kind of input god first of all i want to see how many people are in these boats coming in are they-- it's terrible but i'm pretty perceptive so that's where is that 12 looks like a jacket oh before they even come up i'm going to look like the ship's cook i am not looking aggressive for this i am putting on a chef's outfit and getting small and human with awful red hair so yeah i'm out i think better together than not cornelius and i apologize for the way i'm dressed right now i was in the middle of-- well it's obvious i was making a stew this really nice vegetable stew and everything went topsy-turvy so quick i don't even-- it's very good stew cornelius sometimes they call me stew because i-- oh i'm very excited i don't know i've got some very specific burial needs if we're actually going to go that way [laughter and cheering] do i know what a rifle is ah that's cold (laughs) oh that's really cold oh ooh does the yogurt come before or after really looking forward to that usually jumped right in how long are we going to hold these disguises all right they need to crew that ship a what no that's okay i wasn't that worried well they're also fixing the ship at some point there's two ships that's pretty cool paring knife actually if we're going to be getting ready for some trouble i better change into my trouble gear if we're going there i'm going to drop disguise self i try not to frighten people but i figure if we're getting messy-- thank you so much i really like this whole room i think you've done a really good job with it this is great uk'otoa slow but there what are we supposed to be doing sorry sorry sorry strange to others (impressed whistling) yeah like what i don't really-- i was really just listening for that word because i wanted to play the speak along game i wasn't really paying that much attention i'm so sorry i got a little distracted in there that was really fun though (whispering) uk'otoa actually if we both do that maybe it's like going to be white noise all my whispers are just saying that in different pitches krakotoa krakotoa krakotoa how many how many how many travis and it's technically fourth ball at this point i think isn't it actually sorry that's the face i wanted [laughter] no that's-- this is not an intimidatable person i mean you can just look-- i think from what little i gleaned i imagine vanity is the way to play this one yeah i mean some people just want to talk and i think she just wants somebody to talk to that's the vibe i get [cheering] i think hamilton does win on that one the exercise we used to do when i was taking some theory classes was to describe a car (clanking) (lasers whirring) well if it's just the four wheels is it a car no (upbeat music) he looked pretty good and you get to lord it over everybody roll well she'd know this one yes [cheering] don't be a bad roommate he was a bad roommate don't be a bad roommate [laughter] ashley and i mean what would you even do with that what's the point of it really what would you do with it see and that just a point of a higher motivation for something i mean there's got to be a step two you can't know what to do until you understand it i mean that's step one and once you understand it we'll try and help you make a reasonable decision about what to do with it i'm into it i just woke up i don't actually know what's going on right now did i miss something i don't-- what kind of dreams of a similar nature hopefully we can fix our mistake at some point that'd be nice thank you sorry carry on we did they have feet or-- i don't remember any of this i thought it was like metaphorical that we were still in the temple and just having some elaborate like a dream of life and we've all been in this temple all along and i mean that would have been really cool although really convoluted the more i'm thinking about it doesn't make any sense some treasure island shit [applause]
