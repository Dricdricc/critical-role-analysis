it's got some crazy back matter too let's get up and moving snozzberry i tried the other kind before and really it's not much you've already used it at this point really no is it just seeing someone throw up or is it also hearing the sound that makes it worse if i just went (retching) does that-- okay ambush we've been traveling for years we've been ambushed dozens of times no that was new and exciting we get there in the day i don't mind camping out one more time that was very impressive thank you i'll drive if you want to switch out later on all right i got it nott i assume you want to be in back i'm into this i also do have a large tapestry that's relatively clean if anyone's feeling cold i can drive let's not do that seven i can desperately try and right the stuff i suppose i'm going to pull hard on the reins see if i can get it out of the-- oh are we stop stopped okay i'm stopping the whole thing really quickly i've got a hammer i've got some rope i don't know you don't know any mending magic do you you're welcome i'm sitting here thinking if only we had a mending cantrip of some kind i just had to say it out loud i'm just going to sit on the wagon looking bored that's my thought we have a broken wheel anyway we're not moving at a particular speed at the moment we are headed north captain goddamn it this can't possibly end poorly the kiss army basically that's the most insane roll i've ever seen there's nothing that's being said here that can't be said at full momentum we gave him saline this will do just perfectly let's do this i'll join natural 20 one-one thousand two-one thousand three-one thousand is it getting closer we're going to get rained on do we have anything-- we don't have actual tents do we we don't have proper tents i'm getting underneath the cart at least i'll definitely notice the smell like fucking roses pistachio or rocky road this is not my first time yeah i miss having a proper tent and the wagons were nice i miss that something at least they're good luck yeah tree struck by lightning very good luck it's bad luck for normal people everybody else absolutely dig it up (laughter) i go over to take a look at it or just out of waxed cloth well if you come up with an ingredients list we'll be happy to drum stuff up talking about making shelter that sounds great yeah it does like some sort of phantom manor is what you're speaking of it would appear-- doesn't have to be real to be interesting i like this plan i'm into it no i'm going to before we take off take a look at that tree that got hit i want to examine how it was struck by lightning all right nature three is this practically like a little bowl now or did it split i'm going to drop a piece of silver in the center so the next person who comes around and examines this thing finds a piece of silver i'd rather be cold than have bugs yeah it's a very fair point who's on a horse am i on the cart or am i on a horse i'll be in the cart then i'm going to take one of the swords and start using the flat of the blade to scrape the wheel and give it an edge to start removing the mud off of it and hop between wheels i think that sounded like a bird talking what should we call back i don't see how that's any better i'm going to gently light up one of my swords that's clever what that'll do i have a thought i have a coin and whoever's holding the coin has that for the day then we pass it around so you have this as a chip obviously we didn't do it this morning but from now on who wants it for tomorrow or for next for after the fight it's not close enough to really do anything yet uh-huh yeah sure she probably did a little (whooshes) these happen to be made of metal is it yeah sorry i'm at least going to get up to-- what's a basic movement am i within 60 feet of either of these are we doing this well we're doing this i'm going to try and cast enthrall on the closest gator wisdom save i haven't attacked that one yet oh you're right yes of course i don't think so is eight my save on wisdom it says wisdom but i don't know no yeah it's a racial ability yep it ain't going to eat it means it's going to pay attention to me and only me i know i'm sitting i'm spinning my sword and talking in-- (infernal voice) yep oh boy don't fall just a minute of pain you want to go first thank you with my running speed how close can i get and still have an action that's as far as i can get without an action at the very least then i'm going to-- yep since i still have some distance i'm going to try some vicious mockery to see if that does anything the one-- i'm curious what that's going to sound like i'll hit the vicious mockery on the one that currently has nott just because-- yeah no (infernal coughing) (infernal voice) crocodile dundee good man god damn it blood curse of the eyeless amplified disadvantage if you were just prone he would still have it so if the spell is still active yeah this is low level there wouldn't really be much bringing you back that'd be the end of it not three where's your book i've got a theory what were you doing here what is this place i'm going to peruse these ruins a little bit see what they are and what they look like do you know where they are heading a word bird where we're going is a bit dangerous we should warn you hey caleb you got a second take a look at this do these mean anything to you just looking at the stone structures that are here i rolled an eight they are stone that's disappointing i kick it let's see if we can cut them and keep some of this leather i bet it's worth a little bit of money yeah we'll check the guts choose your weapon is there anything fun in the guts hey you can get the note let's haul this all back onto the cart and get on our way and see where we get what do you propose we do will she be welcomed anywhere all of this are great points but i'm waiting for another idea it's also possibly someone to watch the cart while we do our businesses to see if we can find somewhere safe yeah well this is never going to get irritating let's get on our way that's going to make it even better that can't happen we will not have that cling to our irony seriously cheeky cheekingly serious let's head out technically did we get a short rest on the way in or did that not happen i love this place this is great we have a beautiful piece of leather we also have some fine tapestries we have a safe we have many things that was me at 16 with every cop ever that was great this is the tiniest hill and i will die on it never ended that well no stunning that sounds exciting i think we need a round i didn't know i needed this you are a shithole magnet really when you think about it that's fair can we go shopping in town maybe we've got some leather to trade may have some armor we're also going to be looking for a place to sleep i don't know if you'd recommend anywhere that-- you have rooms that's exciting yes yeah i'm very excited by this how many rooms do you have how much are they apiece i figure we should stay in all four for a couple of days per person i am perfectly okay with this eight silver let's put a couple-- yeah eight that's fine i've got that were we given anything special to say to him or should we go wake him up yeah i'm going to walk over and sit down at his table wave my drink underneath his nose hey hey hey i pop it off i'll flick him in the forehead you seem like such a charming gentleman you just seem like such a charming gentleman we were sent for a certain gentleman i hand him the drink one more time it's sterile by its very nature it's sterile don't fix him he's perfect we're here to help you with your troubles we're here to deal with the safe house well if you want another drink then you're going to show us how to get there and how to deal with it and what you know (laughs) i take my drink back i want to point out this is entirely your doing i'll give you 12 you said it oh you know this one matt and we've got some shopping to do we've got to run around a bit i sleep naked thank you mm-hmm we're putting our stuff down and we're also-- how late is it at this point that's a terrible idea are you going to rethread the silver that is-- that's fair yep some leather some armor there's a few things like you've just kissed spider-man it's not that i don't trust this place or like it but i'm thinking about locking the door a little more heavily than normal i'm going to wedge my sword underneath the door to make sure that it can't open without moving the sword it's a lot of new people today i don't like new people i'm all right with this as well this is fine i'll take the bed though if you're offering it's going to become that story that everyone hates who wants the coin in the morning by the way i think this is a clever system yeah but in the morning somebody gets it i love a fake american accent
