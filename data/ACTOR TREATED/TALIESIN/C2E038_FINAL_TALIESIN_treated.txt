ready which of these is-- the naughty pig i know my west hollywood bars man i'm especially impressed you found the list of west hollywood bars on d&d beyond that's an obscure crowd never an accident i'll be toward the back i guess yeah might be a good idea i'm also going to-- i'm going to politely ask the local greenery and let them know that we're going to be coming through and that we're going to try not to disturb them so long as nothing disturbs us yeah have to well i mean i got to talk to a couple of trees and let them know that we're coming through thank god for that plus ten because that was terrible 15 shh if you want to hear it you have to listen for it you hear that what're you hearing then exactly yeah it's good all right i'm keeping an eye out oh and frumpkin i'm keeping an eye around as well it might have been the loss of your samson-like powers sure that is a really good idea all right well we have a choice here you're harder to see i suppose so there's that i'll come up with you though i'm going to poke up and put my head in as well there's no trap doors nowhere where anybody could be hiding i was just curious immediately if there was anything i notice i wasn't going to-- i was going to look around actually if you're doing that i'll look around the outside to see if anybody's watching us 27 nothing's really watching all right i don't know has the bed been slept in does it seem like someone's been here recently or is this abandoned do you think what oh well i'll put my head in 16 12 sorry huh does look dangerous to you yeah sure i'm going to take a step back be my guest cherry cherry cherry well that's just sad that's yeah i mean that'd be nice wouldn't it yeah i'll see if i can start the muck going in here and maybe get a nice little indoor terrarium i don't know what will happen that's already better there are some maps in with the compass-- just some tools all right all right i-- you know okay sure we can do that telling who what it'd look even better with the golden snake thing i mean the whole thing comes together nicely magic feather maybe it makes you fly maybe it makes you molt there's all sorts of things feathers could do she was really nice we didn't look anything alike but yeah she was very nice i'm much taller 17 are the insects really not bothering him at all just out of idle curiosity-- i'm going to very quickly cast eyes of the grave anything undead within 60 feet is going to glow and i'm going to get a little glow off anything that registers as undead at some point when i can get to fjord quietly at some point natural 20 i'm going to crawl up to fjord in the line at some point been keeping my eye out getting the lay of the land and jamedi is not quite alive it's not quite alive i don't think it's an appropriate moment to bring something like that up but it's worth-- yeah it's not quite alive if anything i feel like i'm exercising an enormous amount of willpower just not to-- i mean just doesn't seem like we're in-- there's a good advantage to dealing with this now but yeah there's something weird there oh i'm keeping an eye on it yeah that was sort of my fault i apologize bugs how do they work yeah wait i'm going to stop you because i see what you're doing you're probably not going to get anything off him but he's got an undead vibe that i've been picking up i feel you it's been making me pretty creeped out to be honest but i'm trying to hold together and keep chill chill lots of chill it's hot but-- you're really going-- let me know what you see and we'll compare notes later i've got both but it's best applied when needed really there's only so much to go around (normal volume) this is my whisper voice that's fair we'll be in the middle just in case things go wrong i'm pretty heal-y if we get into an altercation i'll pop both of you as quickly as possible yeah-- this is great i'll take one 21 i'll pop in the occasional low-level light cantrip as far away from us as possible just popping every now and then if i think i see something they didn't bring any tents for us mr caleb want to take a walk maybe really quickly around this thing get a gander at it oh then i'll just report back in a minute no that's okay better safe than sorry i'll let you know when i see oh i'd love company actually just in case we'll take a look around this thing and i also want to cast another detect undead while we're walking i'm going to take a walk around this little ruin i'm going to have the little light spell up see if there's any writing on anything any carvings i'm going to have eyes of the grave up again i'm going to be looking for any undead you roll too maybe 12 couldn't figure what it's a temple to or any-- and nothing from the detect undead other than what i already expect to see what i expect to see is still giving off a little glow right 60 feet although i will say divination magic would also blind me to that and if it was full cover i would possibly not see it as well 17 the funny thing is-- ten i mean come on and i need to make a constitution saving throw 15 17 i'm going to yell for help and then i'm going to-- help then i'm going to tap my staff to wake up my beetles as my bonus action my beetles are going to make a bite attack on that i actually have that information now thanks to the update on d&d beyond so that's a swarm attack they have a bite that's plus three to hit i believe that's a 13 okay that's okay well they're in the space right now i'm panicking so this is going to be fun i'm going to start making a weird awful sound and i'm going to start getting even paler and a little gaunter and i'm going to grab it and i'm going to cast-- i'm so panicked-- vampiric touch so since i'm in contact with it-- melee spell attack what is a melee attack here okay plus eight 20 oh man this is mean that's 3d6 that's (counting) ten points of necrotic damage and i regain five hit points help that is unless i can try and move away i'm going to try and half my movement to get up i'm going to back up against you will he get an attack of opportunity okay perfect that way if you get poisoned i can un-poison you cool both clerics why did both clerics go on a hunting mission yeah we're so dumb 20 why is it advantage oh goddamn it yeah that hits that also hits 12 how do you have that spray and the snakes in the same-- that's just so much help i'm standing i'm kind of still standing it was my own fault i was suspicious so there's a stunned one behind me a stunned one on one side of me and a not-stunned one on the other i'm going to hit the stunned one with the vampiric touch i'm at four it lasts that's 17 that was close seven points of damage so i get three back so now i am at seven hit points now i'm going to vanish i'm going to disappear i'm going to turn invisible yeah i'm going to circle around and back off yeah then take a couple steps back see if anything happens that misses i'm going to get a little further out i'm not going to go off the board or anything that's fine 13 i'm going to gather in and keep an eye out before i come back into visual-- i'm about to become visible again are we what uh thank you i'm going to cure wounds yeah i'll start them going too so that wont be a thing for very long travis and what no need to yell that's all right we were just looking at the temple trying to get an idea of what it was yeah that may have been a poor call i definitely feel like i've learned-- i think i need to pass out one ounce owl it's the best band all right yeah wolfstar is a total space cowboy thank you wolfstar please tell me you've got pass without a trace up thank you are you even here 15 who's got the mote this morning who moted who dodeca-ed i will not say no to it i don't know-- oh (laughter) oh yeah i'm feeling fine why you seem a little-- you sure i can do a-- does she look okay 22 you don't look okay are you sure-- you really don't look okay well i'm just offering something medicinal no you're clammy and-- hold on you should take this take a look at this just want to take a look smell it does it smell bad it's a clever distraction i'm touching her and casting lesser restoration don't think i've never done this before i apologize that's weird though you really don't look okay just for fun really quickly-- just out of curiosity one check for undead really quickly no does eyes of the grave show anything here okay all right i did what i can does it seem contagious you joke but like a third of our people are down it's very empty out there too much for me yeah just be careful what you touch for a little while we need-- but without you they're not going to be as sneaky we have to stay together if we're going to want to be super stealthy together probably is better or for that matter if we can't speak to them stealth with a couple emergency back-up snake looking people we all have to move together that's if they see us if they don't see us it doesn't matter what they look like specifically he was not telling you because i knew you were going to panic i just know things i don't know what it means i was trying to find a moment to figure out if you knew or if we should tell you or if this was part of some sort of plan i hadn't figured it out and for some reason i had not realized that i was walking around with a bunch of gossips well it's what i get i suppose for trying to be sneaky about things i've been doing my best not to be thrown by it it seems like he's been standing up all right this is why i was trying to keep it on the down-low i knew that certain members of the party may get a little excited i myself had a moment of panic had a moment of panic myself i've been keeping it contained no there's a dead guy walking around with us that's unsettling that's unsettling to my very core i've got to admit but you know it's an improvement at the very least how many fingers am i holding up oh i forgot to-- i'm really distracted right now i don't know why i bother mm-hmm 26 a most expeditious movement towards the temple i suppose would be the-- i'm going to walk forwards first to peek in because i look like a snake all right that's terrible 11 (sigh) sacred flame back door i'm going to quickly grab two arrows from one of the dead lizards and stick them in his chest and i'm going to walk out i want to go-- yeah hey it makes a grab for her blindness i'm going to blind him before he grabs her constitution 16 ah god 17 i mean (singing and whistling) something's out there yes everybody 17 oak mahogany rosewood taliesin and does it look like a trap door to me all right i got a 12 okay and it doesn't look like it moves let's get in we're all going to get in come on i'll join this one as well 25 so i keel over mysteriously dead just kidding sorry no all right cool i'm closing slowly who's rubbing my elbow it's weird oh yeah that's so true tomorrow's a long day
