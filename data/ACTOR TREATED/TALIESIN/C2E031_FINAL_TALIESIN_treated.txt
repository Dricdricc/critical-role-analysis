happy birthday what wow that's been a while liam there is a flash pan where there's a preload powder basically a powder capsule attaches to a flash pan the hammer contains a sparking mechanism that hits a plate causes a spark to hit the powder in the flash pan goes into the gunpowder that's within that's actually packed inside of the barrel and sends the shot out it actually is a specific kind it's a flint although people have probably gotten creative with that at that time but the percy tech was just a flint he was trying to do other stuff and always failed it would be a bag at the front with a flint that would spark on pressure so as long as you fired it hard it would cause the spark when it hit and detonate welcome to tinkering man oh she was let me come along if you're going
