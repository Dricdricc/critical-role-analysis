they're pronounced centennials actually i think our audience gets the joke the camera's laughing they're really comfy but then i took them off and my cats found them and now they will not give them back no this is really true they've taken them and they're not giving them back and it was fun it was nuts no it's good fun i'm back in tomorrow morning actually you can see me tomorrow morning at 9am pacific time it's hot it's pretty hot it's great i want to collect all the things and basically use it as a play on the little renaissance-era barbie doll and just paint him and put things on and change armors ages ago eight with a natural one she doesn't know you're here and that's how bilbo's insurance company started just going home we can start again with a real job i'm done i'm going to peel off a little bit to the left-- i just got yelled at in my earpiece so i will not-- sorry sorry is she really there or is that an illusion yeah try to sense okay we're peeling off to the left and i'm going to wall-walk i'm going to keep going until i'm on line-of-sight with the red eggs against the back wall not that far not even that far like there yeah ooh that's really clever that's what i was waiting for thank you the dog in theory sees invisible things by the way (laughs) i'm sorry (singing) it's like rain taliesin and we'll be doomed to die if we sing that song any further 22 22 you don't add proficiency bonus i'm weird okay that's a weird thing yeah this'll be over easy i'm so proud so proud (all laugh) florentine poached okay first things first i'm going to take a shot with bad news at the remaining egg so let's just do that why are you doing that okay good that's a 22 to hit so that's ooh that's nice 25 points of damage okay never mind then i'm going to take another-- okay i'm going to take another sharpshooter shot at it i'm going to try to hit it and kill it dead yeah i'm having a weird premonition that's making me really uncomfortable 16 yeah no sharpshooter i lose five to hit which is why i didn't hit it but i get ten extra points of damage i'm feeling like now is the time to take this out of play so i'm going to burn an action surge right now i'm going to burn an action surge and i'm going to take another shot with bad news (nerdy voice) action surge same thing sharpshooter shot that misses oh man regular shot because fuck it that hits that's 32 to hit i should've just taken it but that's okay we'll see what we do damage-wise that's not bad 22 points of damage i don't suppose i have time to run a weird perception check do i really quickly do i have a moment for a perception check i haven't burned any movement though is that center wall real yeah i'm calling that 23 okay just wanted to have my moment i had a moment of horror like oh god that's dragon-sized okay cool yeah good boy congratulations we can play laser tag now no you're good oh don't eat that don't eat that no no that's only-- well that may be something else that's beacon of hope that's a different thing it depends on what she dispelled there's advantages to both taliesin and landscaper jesus i am so pleased that got so awful i might get my socks back i'm very excited just somebody somewhere is dropping the bass we're probably going to want to destroy those cages by the way i think that we're going to get more wraiths quick point of order-- is there like corpse soup in those cages or is it one corpse per cage well fair i'm heading that way anyway so yeah i was just trying to see if i could actually get it was giving me a problem oh god it's everywhere the next three bathtubs glitter this is why you never upload anything to the cloud you ain't my friend it was valiant did i see this go down all right i'm making my way along the wall anyway in that direction so while i'm walking i'm going to see if anything looks worth shooting at over there perception check hey let's call that a 25 i'm going to cast hex and she now has disadvantage on strength saving throws yeah i'm being a dick so i'm going to burn a grit to cancel out the disadvantage better mark that like a clever person and i'm just going to try and take a shot and see what happens so this is with bad news that's a 21 one more shot oh yeah 29 yeah no that's with a grit to cancel out the disadvantage so okay i'm going to use that since it hit i'm also going to shove all six of my charges through that shot as well for fun i'll get that back later okay so thank you thank you that's going to make life better later so that's-- so that's-- oh god i got to get more dice i didn't even think this through sure i just need three more so 6d6 plus d12s plus one more 1d6 because there's some necro there thank you okay that'll do here we go oh wow okay i'm going to make that the necro because that's fun yeah that's pretty good i wish i had your power to do that crazy all right let's see how we did that's hahaha (all laugh) 23 points of normal damage 23 points of normal damage six points of necrotic damage and 25 points of lightning damage oh yeah that felt good wow all right i'm going to keep moving my maximum move in that direction along the wall if i can move any further i will but that's-- that's fine i just call over the headpiece she's down and vulnerable oh shit did she-- even with disadvantage on her strength check on that one four four no 18 19 i'm sorry 19 okay that's fine 118 really we do that's genuinely a thing i'm alive nice the world's cruel wait a minute is this magical damage does cabal's absorb it you keep going i'll let you know i'm going to read i'll wait until you guys are done i'll wait until they're done and then i'll pop in with my reaction literally in a hail of bullets i'm going to activate-- i'm going to use my reaction to activate cabal's ruin i'm going to absorb the spell and the damage i take is halved and the cloak gains the number of charges equal to the spell's level the level of the triggering shot yeah i don't get all nine do i because-- does the spell hold nine charges oh shit what okay so so i'm at nine the damage is still halved 59 points of damage okay so i'm going to add 59 hitpoints to that i'm back at 81 points so that's nice and i have nine charges in the cloak okay that's awesome it's never come up that's 16 is my concentration save my hex-- i was busy oh shit okay kind of a snooty dog the wraiths didn't take any damage did they silver lining fresh paint no burn 'em baby too many no he somehow rolled a 46 and they're trying to figure out what to do about it laser pointer okay fine i have the shot will the armor retort that or no words are mean man that's the sword oh shit you're up nothing i have is useful god damn it the dallas i don't have a dallas left travis i've been wondering this whole time it was very lifelike burn 'em up i do there are no ones here that's much better no that's half clapping from the void yeah everything pops back only one way to find out does it taste like anything you've had recently whoa do i still have any theory of where she is or do i have to roll another perception check so yeah again as i'm scootching further and further back along the wall i'm going to pull out the animus box and take a few shots in there to see what happens because she is invisible yeah i'm going to burn a grit for the first one to neutralize that so shot number one natural 20 i used the grit point to cancel out the disadvantage and that will not affect the cabal's ruin damage i was going to add to it because that's a different thing right because that seems unfair because i can add that later okay i'm just going to add the standard damage i'm not going to crit the cabal's ruin damage but i'm adding-- that's a thing after the hit totally worth it no so that's let's see that's six points of psychic damage and 18 points of normal damage and then i'm going to add three points of cabal's ruin which is-- 14 points of lightning damage yep no no that is doubled and i also get my grit point back because i critted yes that's fine now for my second shot i'm going to spend a second point to-- oh she's not visible she's-- so i still have disadvantage so i still need to-- okay that's fine yep not quite as good but still good 27 so that's ooh that's nice that's 17 points of normal damage two points of psychic damage and ten points of lightning damage for my next shot-- i'm doing the same thing again so i'm at two grit points i'm trying not going to hit that's going to be 19 to hit that doesn't hit so that one misses i still have three cabal's ruin though so that's nice i'm going to use my bonus action for a heal surge for my little healing my little pick-me-up so that's going to give me back 16 points of healing points so that's 16 to me so that's 105 i'm at 105 and i'm going to keep just scooting back along the wall i want to keep where i'm shooting in my line of sight but i just want to get there yeah and still on the wall yeah thank you thank you thank you look every time i have a reaction i can do something that's crazy this is mean do you have any reactions you can do let's just call it we're going to have to deal with that very very quickly it was a kinder gentler world i'd give money for a popcorn grenade right now do i get an attack of opportunity do i get an attack of opportunity she has not moved past me yeah (nervous exclamation) i get the idea do you also have inspiration still no pike oh-- okay okay okay it's the last-ditch i'm going to get stupid so well things have gotten simpler holy fuck that looks painful we've still got problems do i get a reaction against that i can't react to her attack okay she's just going to do a legendary attack against me okay oh that hits into her neck it's called a hickey does she still have an attack of opportunity against disengagement or did that legendary action-- well i'm just curious because i'm going to have a problem in a moment technically wasn't she flanked too okay oh yeah i'm the only thing within reach okay i'm fine 23 points 61 right now i'm at 61 not wonderful but you know do i get an attack of opportunity on this one weird question am i still-- if i try to disengage right now would i get attacked i'm in melee okay that's fine i'm going to run around i'm going to hit her with my sword i'm pulling-- putting the gun away pulling out the sword and just taking some shots yep okay let's see the first one definitely missed which is a 19 did not hit 22 okay 22 and the other one is a 28 so i got two shots so let's do the first one which is 22 points of damage plus 10 points of lightning damage total of 32 and the second slash is 21 points of damage the whole time so i'm i'm now going to disengage i'm going to let him take that shot and i'm going to run towards-- we'll see i'm heading towards the eggs full speed okay that hits that's okay i regret nothing stop making noises it's not polite stop counting okay i'm running six spaces towards the eggs and turning around and pulling the gun back out and sitting on the wall like spiderman like an angry spiderman anything i can do with my bonus action no i no she may vaguely remember that i was not cool no this is the rest of the day for him there's nowhere to go for-- yeah think about what you've done okay yeah all right oh jesus how is this happening oh i'm out yep i know oh is that lose a death save i was only a few feet up it wasn't like a-- it wasn't-- okay all right i mean i was-- yeah yeah it's pretty bad i'm taking it ow ow (all laugh) oh it's so cute that you think either of us are going to heaven i'm out the blood is in fact blue we've got time in a minute that's a long time ten rounds yeah i know matt does get weird about the minute rule that is also funny she's just awful does the necklace count or does the necklace not count once as far as i can remember quick question okay just checking okay good to know oh that's nice (panicked laughter) oh is this mine okay i'm going to pass out we have to take him home we need to take him somewhere to the temple and we need to find his daughter i'm going to drop the gate stone that we have right in this room i'm just going to leave it here i'm coming back here to dissect that monster once we're done i am lying down to do this but yes what hit points am i at right now what am i at right now okay that'll do thank you i'm going to say something awful put him in the bag of colding it's not like he's breathing it will keep him safe let's gather what we can we have to walk out of here there's no other way i'm also just going to grab grog really quickly and just scrape as much stuff off the shelves into the bags because we need to know what this shit is i'm going to grog help me pile all of the dragon remains into a pile the eggs everything i need a pile we're going to try and remove anything useful especially of the eggs anything to know what they were but i don't want to take the whole thing i don't want to leave anything we're going to burn it we're going to burn it all thank you i still want to burn it but yeah jesus it's math-lite and hit a glyph someone shove him off let's get out of here i'm going to quickly search scanlan's body for his wand yeah i'm going to shoot some fireballs in here when we're on our way out i'm going to burn it to the fucking ground thank you but the gravity is off i'll actually say the second that we see them i'm just going to empty the wand oh will they just be fine can i just unload on them i suppose oh well i've got disgusting range what do you need that's a lot of whiskey i'm going to try doing a sharpshooter piercing shot on another round of them with the pepperbox sharpshooter piercing shot that's not bad so that's-- the first shot is-- 16 oh then they all hit that's good so that's 1d10 plus 1d6 so 1d10 plus 1d6 and this is piercing shot so it's the enemy line so wow that's nice that's-- i have no brain 27 points of damage with five points of psychic damage for the first shot okay but it's hitting both of them in a row next shot is-- ha is 28 points of damage with four points of psychic mm-hm i still have one last shot so let's do slightly less that time 20 points of damage with one point of psychic and that's my contribution to the world 4d8 radiant i hit both of them two are down the other two are damaged classic i'd love to make an arcana check 22 yep we don't six seconds no we go to the beach and we find a tree we get as far away from this cave one crisis at a time we start walking to the beach the ball on the carpet i'm going to take a rest on the carpet and i'm going to fly the carpet while you do your thing she might want to save-- well we'll see seems like we know where-- we would've been in trouble that can't hold all of us this is fine we're going to go to whitestone now we're not going to go to greyskull and we're going to get gilmore's help we're going to get gilmore's help i'll join no wait keyleth-- i'm taking the carpet that direction i'll be back in a moment i'm taking the carpet towards the speck i see on the-- and probably ten minutes in is where i would have given it ten minutes i'm on the way with the carpet (yelps) i'm so tired that doesn't mean a lot but yeah we're as far as we can get oh thank god i'm running for it no time scry-- find his daughter scry on his daughter no kymal no we have the one gate stone she has the other one i will go get the other gate stone it's fine we can make this work and in the meantime take him to the raven queen temple trying to put together the resurrection ritual outwardly i'm fine i'm in get-shit-done mode i'm probably coming back down now from the castle with the stone his daughter because it's the only thing i can think of that could really drag him back from wherever he is that's my thought i've been there i've experienced this i've died and you need to it's not easy and you need to-- not everything cuts through you need to find the right thing to cut through and i think this might be it so it's where i'm putting my bets guards you're with gilmore you will get him into any room in the castle immediately without question now i'm at the temple i've sent them off to deal with this terrible band name ironically of course also i don't think we have sam next week dick we can totally like zod in the mirror way to david that goliath man we were like i wonder if he's going to totally coulson i wonder if he's just going to coulson on us somebody conquered some personal demons this week you're still an awkward mess but you know there will always be a pit of fire
