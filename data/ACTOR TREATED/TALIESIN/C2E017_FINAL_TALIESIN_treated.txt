there are holes in all of my business pants did you do your chores gail yes gail gag us all with a spoon (laughter) what kind of advice did nancy reagan give you no one really knows it sounds like there's very expensive things to drink and eat i'm going to get my pocketbook i think we're all up and moving at this point i think you've had enough it's making you weird i definitely want to see this i'm very much about this we'll get that to-go i sort of agree with nott on this i think there comes a point where it's a skeleton and not an actual dead person at this point i mean i know it is a dead person i think there's a point where it's like a piece of fruit but it's been out so long that even conceiving of it as a piece of fruit is not useful that is also a very fair point fjord don't you dare have fun without us i'm rolling out the door i think we're immediately heading to trebuchet do you fire it do you sit in it i don't know there's only one way to find out you shouldn't have hit that woman with a sandbag no he paid already it's a dexterity with disadvantage 19 i think i may have to-- i've spent my luck i think it may be off to you and then one for you three throws one each it's still not terrible that's a six wait right let's just-- it's out i hardly know but i've thrown a baby before odd mmm mm-hmm (muffled) tastes better with the victory i won a strawberry this about when i run up what'd you get what are the options i'll take whatever's most expensive mm-hmm can you rage at this thing when you-- you get another swing yeah oh yeah no i'll do that when i see you going in one silver four copper a barrel of books i'm going to run up behind caleb have you run detect magic on any of this just there's so much i figure something's got to be interesting i can absolutely do that i'm going to run towards the tapestry booth i'm seeing if there's anything deeply gaudy that's beautiful how much is that then how big is this piece out of curiosity it's purchased ten gold my god bless you master craftsmen my god it is such a rendition of the platinum dragon that i've never seen before i clutch at my platinum dragon brooch it's beautiful oh i have fucking plans people swing it over my shoulder and i'll be walking around like a pike is it just simple weapons or is it simple ranged weapons simple weapons okay is it still disadvantage to the middle target and the sword we're not eating the rats i also follow that was worth following around for travis and kingsman mm-hmm you should take a shot at that at the very least you have a lot to prove oh i wouldn't-- oh you get to roll again i think i've literally made 200 gold since we've met minimum at this point it's been like a week i think that if i saw lots of random nines around the city i don't think i'd know what that was connected to oh i think we are i'd be all right with that mollymauk what makes you think they're not going to start conscripting people tomorrow maybe we should win the fight then maybe think about getting out of town made it at kinko's that was good that was very good ixnay 17 six probably not i'll back up into mine that i think is the door where it opens 23 i'm going to use vicious mockery and just you know (demonic voice) you've got no arms it's awful it's a psychic attack it says wisdom but is it charisma okay yeah that saves that's okay i'm going to also use my bonus action to light my other sword i have both blades going now so i'm knocking that down with not the ice the-- i'm going to run let's see i've got 30 feet i'm going to cross and run for cover behind that yeah it's going to swallow people how many feet away am i from this thing i'm going to start dashing to that next-- yeah that direction i'm going to do one more attempt at vicious mockery (infernal noises) he still saves that's what i got there's no short rest between here and-- plus seven not before the next fight i don't think what's your medicine check like heal no don't do that i don't know focus on one target at a time i'll back up into that far corner yeah 21 i'm going to take a run towards the fake jester yeah it's where i can get there i'm going to try and see if i can make vicious mockery work on this thing i do have line of sight (sinister voice) bad doggy (laughter) yep butt turkey you heard me that's one point of psychic damage and it has disadvantage next attack eight i am not resistant to cold ow no i'm fine i'm not fine but ow ah should have had disadvantage it's a cone yeah okay all right that's a yes i'm going to take a slashing attack at the guy right in front of me that's-- oh goddamn it-- that's 12 to hit i'm going to hit it again oh my god it's a natural fucking one (mix of cheers and groans) i'm going to try and circle around a little bit to space everybody out a bit it still has disadvantage from the-- for its attack though barely yasha could use some healing i'm going to breathe deep and take a run at this damn thing straight into it and i'm going to come swinging out at it that's a hit that's a 23 to hit this thing doesn't take extra damage from this does it no that's fine seven points of damage for the first hit is that right no wait yeah that's right then 23 to hit-- 21 to hit that's seven points of damage again i want to go in and i want to see if i can carve through the mouth as deep in-- i'm going to try and get right in there-- i'm going to do a dental jawbreaker then they would be alone out there for like two rounds that seems like a terrible plan we're all one hit away from-- i don't think we would get-- i think it's a terrible plan this is such a bad idea this is such a bad idea this is going to be like two rounds to get to whoever-- you're going to be alone for two full rounds with whatever this thing is yeah what if you're there-- what if it comes out of that door this is a terrible plan no there's one two-- yeah no i'm going to go to the opposite point from caleb yeah yeah this is so bad we're going to drop so fast i'm going to go against the wall against the back of that wall there you're going to be at disadvantage because it's going to be right next to you aren't you glad you weren't standing there by yourself for that you get one it would have been three rounds before i could do any damage before it killed him (shouting) it's my door oh my god (laughter) overestimating the value of surprise
