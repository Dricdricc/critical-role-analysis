sitting at nine on the current bestseller list it's a good book it's got so much oh they found out about that you're how i found cute emergency i'll help with that that sounds like a great use of time and not watching this don't think too hard about it grog i have an idea why don't you ask the sword if it has any idea of vecna's weaknesses i'm so glad i had it i'll take it it's my turn all right just on the count of three i said yes it's just so i can swim faster that was not for you to advertise you're actually going to pull that sword out and it will have committed suicide it's feeling much better thank you that won't be necessary for me but for the rest of you no i don't know what boots you have right now would you rather just run like spider-man up to you yes there is there's coffee on everything there i think it actually has a little bit of nice character look at that the plans are easy the magic users are going to be attacking vecna with all they're worth i'll have enough bullets that i may not be able to hurt him but i can make him drop up to you that is an option that is up to you but let me know because either way i'm going to either keep my boots or not keep my boots and we don't know who's casting that we don't know where that's coming from okay no but a 21 will do it we could break through we could break the wall like a flying rhino he would have to burn a dispel at 9th-level oh there's nothing special about these symbols that they wear around their necks are they just since it is in your interest to keep us alive long enough to build you a portal yes the world is ready for two scanlans if we give him the hat of disguise then there's just a magical field being about a magical-- and he will have to burn some stuff depending on whether or not you have the mount let me know if you want to trade boots or not since these are non-attunable and vecna will win well that's everything i needed some items for other scanlan yeah and then here i don't know if excited is the word i'm going to remember that you said that everything since i met you all has felt like a dream even the worst of it would it be wrong to shave his beard just one more time one of them yes in the morning i've already planned them out goodnight brother here we go 19 i'm going to burn a resolve i rolled really low i want to do that a little better oh fine i don't know-- which is why i am no i'm going to kill a resolve one more that's way better natural 20 that'll do it's just a resolve i got three no it was fair i'm not in the mood for that and resolves i got plenty of i like that it's kitty-corner right now oh wow what are you doing i don't know oh shit 12 no really yes i know what he is i'm not going to tell you though at least two years she got a haircut vox machina may we introduce you to arkhan we did some work ages ago what are you doing here he's our kind of evil it's fine i think we have a surprising amount already in common we know lay on hands and some such it was a metaphor grog it was a metaphor if just do a hit and run we can cause so much chaos that all of these gloomstalkers are going to be busy dealing with everything in the air and as long as we're close to that one they don't know that we're here they can't see us they're all around the outer wall if we break these crystals this could help-- and if they've been watching he just vanished we should run now we'll get grog to smash it to smithereens you're so good at punching walls 34 they're going to go attack the city sh grog let's start drilling up one more and we run and take cover it's a very loud-- the wall has my armor class that's really horrifying we're going to run 27 we are not going to scatter and spread we're going to stay together no matter what there is no scattering 30 (shouting) what no there's that other window yeah that's going to be fun yeah that's lord briarwood that's solid 18 cricket's initiative is sadly 30 no technically radius-wise-- no delilah do i not have cover 18 so i can gather my wits there's an angry delilah with a wand clutching a weird thing around her neck there's a sylas with what i assume would be a brand new sword and they're sitting about how many feet up on a dragon right now let's have a little fun all right oh good and i have an escape route that'll do really nicely this is going to be fun i'm going to bugs bunny this lady first thing i'm going to do is i'm going to take a shot-- why oh no that was good it took me a second i'm going to take a shot with animus boy i'm nervous i'm going to burn a point of grit and i'm going to make her drop her wand that's a 31 to hit let's make her drop stuff it's a strength saving throw i missed you too darling i still do damage on that one i believe that's nine points of damage plus five points of psychic so 14 for my next trick i'm going to burn another point of grit let's push sylas ten feet another 31 to hit so let's take a little damage and do a little psychic i do not like this die i'm getting rid of it it's only nine points of damage plus two points of psychic so now sylas has to move ten feet back no save (woody woodpecker laugh) woody woodpecker certainly has more shade we don't know for my next one let's push delilah ten feet for my final trick that's a 28 to hit sorry man it's my best trick and i burned a lot of it 15 points of damage plus four points of psychic plus ten feet take some fall damage so for the rest of it i'm going to use a bonus action to run a heal i'm going to give myself 19 points back i'm going to run downstairs i'm heading towards that back door next campaign he's prone sylas is up and moving how much movement does he have left all right no that's a good use of a legendary action do they count as undead can scanlan two heal himself you can move with advantage she's prone and grappled oh no yeah third time's the charm did you do your plus ten for the sharpshooter i was going to feel really guilty about killing that thing i want to try and come around here if possible just here first thing i'm doing is i'm taking a grit shot at sylas with animus and i'm doing a headshot just to make his life a little more complicated i do i'm taking very nice head shots actually i go to prints charming that's a real place it's on ventura sorry the most la moment in our game ever just now yeah no maybe not yep that'll do that's a 26 to hit and he has to make a constitution saving throw that's fine he still takes 16 points of damage and two points of psychic damage and i'm going to take another headshot because that's funny and that's 31 to hit that's 12 points of damage and one psychic damage and does he make his constitution saving throw the dc is 20 fine i'm going to take another headshot burning my grit i should have gone for a sharpshooter that's 34 to hit jesus christ another constitution saving throw god motherfucker that's 15 points of damage plus four psychic so 19 total no i don't like the way he's doing that i'm burning an action surge i'm going to use some sharpshooter i'm going to burn a bonus and reload my gun let's just take three sharpshooter shots see what happens i should not have rolled all three at once the way they landed it would have been the third one anyway two shots that's 15 to hit no 20 to hit and the third shots jams at a two actually i have a resistance now to psychic damage so i take 1d6 psychic damage for my gun not two correct i take my four points and i am happy for them that ends my turn high-five keyleth on the way in which means if you hit him enough he drops back to human it's our fidget spinner i will let you know if it snaps while it's in your teeth it hurts a lot i know that from experience this is the face matt's not making right now we're going to show up to the next game all wearing them like a terrible council of evil i feel like i would be able to get an attack somewhere in here considering my range if i pulled out my big gun how could you not be prepared for-- that looks solid from here do you have something because of your hit the last time you hit him does that mean-- no because he's going to keep running we don't have to hold our turns we'll just get back to you oh yeah no we're fine i mean that'll happen eventually if it's going to get there wait is it sylas' turn or my turn my turn first i'm going to take my advantage shot because i have advantage because of-- with bad news no no no no ring but if you're sharpshooter the outer range is the inner range oh yeah so you just walk up and take a shot with advantage much better i rolled huge 28 perception how far away is he you've got what it takes what's the distance on that thing what if you got on a mount we can all move together and he will not be able to move at high speed as a mist and we have to stay together wait i have a weird thing i'm going to try and do-- no the thing i need to do i need to get within 30 feet i'm going to move to the edge of where i'm capable of moving right now at my speed i'm going to signal everybody and say move as a group so we're going to try to sync our movements you're doing what i grab her wand it was the controller so we have it so many things nope take the wrapper off that's weird [break] and it quickened but that didn't help nearly as much as we thought it would i've got an idea can i borrow some of that infinite rope all right i'm taking the infinite rope and i'm tying it around my little gem that i have my little glowing gem more or less are we all agreed well i'm going to make it move away and then once we're in i'm going to yank-- i tie it around in a monkey fist knot i toss it about 20 feet away i'm going to give it a throw i'm going to throw it about 20 feet away from the-- we're all in agreement of this plan well technically wait hold on i'm actually going to throw the gem then past the stone giant into the room just a little bit so that anything in the room-- okay nine 30 feet okay i have to roll though i have to do a roll to see if it survived the throw yeah it's fine dc 15 let's all go in shall we and i'm going to walk around it and stealth in natural 20 also double checking-- grit is a reset after combat not a reset after a short rest short rest okay just checking once they're within range of us i'm going to wait okay i'm going to tug on the rope and pull it up and toss the gem right smack-dab in the center of us unless somebody else wants to throw it eh it doesn't matter i just yanked it nope it's good dc 15 he was not still within range dc is 15 which is why we're going to keep the rope we're going to go all the way up the stairs and when we're ready we're going to tug like a motherfucker all right one at a time let's kill one at a time yeah but we're going to get him i'm really excited about the notion of a delilah potted plant let's do this i would not say no to it but i can live without it we honestly all do i will admit it would do a lot for me i'll try a religion check i mean fuck it if we heal ourselves-- he does turn people how much heal do you get out of a potion but it's also healing that could be done in combat that's what we're meaning how many people have taken it so far i have it automatically let's get halfway up the tower no i'm good the stairs are a metaphor this one definitely he has to do it without scanlan everything goes to shit it means that your clone's going to get very lucky you on the other hand no we went right from where i am can i recognize any of the book titles any of it yes if vecna moves we will know they're little 24 you got very high we still have the pot you could get some oil and really make this work that's a lot of powerful-- i would like to do one thing before we leave the room i would like to take something set it on fire and toss it on those books over there there's nothing else to catch fire in here it'll be nice it'll be noxious but brief i take a torch i actually have one last whitestone seal that's flash-powdered wrap it light it and toss it on the counter that'll do walk away do we recognize any of the corpses i had to do it natural 20 i get to know the rest of you don't get to know i charge diplomacy up are they humans or undead once i use it i've got ten minutes of silence i was curious that if i get close enough to vecna he can't talk i was hoping to save that because that might be a thing where we can keep him from casting vocal spells plus ten let's have you two take some out and send the big guys in it's better against weaker opponents i'll have ten minutes of silence that looked bad from this angle yeah i see it now holy cow maybe we shouldn't kill all of-- what is the band before we do anything this may kill him take them i hate to even ask but is there anything you can do and still-- i've been looking forward to this everything's downhill from here it'll be super easy i was feeling weird about it you are a monster i'm so proud
