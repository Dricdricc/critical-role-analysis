people can actually in real time call us when we're wrong on our own stuff this is a level of pain i've only dreamed of i'm very excited wednesday club we're talking about comic con because comic con is coming up and we're going to try and give you a first-timer's guide to comic con if you've never been to one what to expect what to do for fun and all sorts of things that you could see or do in san diego other than us thank you i was very proud of last night prizes it's not quite heaven what's closest to the pools it's weird how he's so nice and yet it still feels like you are in so much trouble seems prudent i'm very ready to go this is lovely and everything but i've had my fill what gap to the pools i like that people just feed us we show up and there's food not at home have you ever tried not singing for dinner you might it's a big vague but yes i was on a boat for quite a while charmingly provincial and the pools are naturally poisonous that's our kind of people he was so officious if it were easy it really wouldn't be us would it i cannot believe i'm about to say this i'm inclined to believe the god they're in the position where trying to trick us out of leaving is not necessary they could've just told us to leave and be done with it that information just wouldn't suit them i don't think well on that chipper little side note i think we should turn in for the evening wow way to hang onto that one matt it was with you the whole time for the forest near the pools of-- i was really excited to see your face when you handed it to them and they're like what are we supposed to do with this thank you for the ashley johnson simulator that was weirdly comforting let's save that falafel pool is actually really tasty you did actually legitimately point east too which makes that even better yeah that is weird 12 you're worried about giants streaking that was very specific i might i don't know let's keep this structure standing for now if you think long and hard about it it's not like manners have failed us very often we fail at manners more often we'll see how this goes we'll try being nice i'll be hanging back a bit as well this is probably a giant-infested forest double-check to make sure the door isn't a problem either i'd imagine if the welcome mat is i feel like there's a complicated story that goes along with all of this i'm really excited by it we have found the cabin of macaulay culkin i was really excited by this thing it's a shame to dismantle it it's more or less whatever strikes your fancy to be fair you should try it if you haven't it's quite delightful no for once no i'm not i have never actually been quite so honest in my entire life i think you'll find it very therapeutic how does it feel crawl forward back a bit stretch downward dog stretch i am going to try and map this in my head the crazy stuff i'm seeing right now maculkins i think we can just call them maculkins now is there mercury in those pools (laughter) i sometimes will talk to the fourth wall it's a thing ignore it i'm going to peruse some of these titles quietly i find it's the easiest way to learn quite a bit about a person well i reach into my bag and start cleaning a small green shard of residuum polishing it you are a madman we're not going to say ioun are you saying you know more than ioun can you prove that you know more than ioun so if i ask you a question that is almost impossible to answer you could answer it before ioun could answer it oh please i'm far too clever to ask such a simple question that's easy i would have to ask something that was very difficult to answer a bit dangerous to be fair whoever has devised these contraptions and created this safety for you is a genius i'm not saying you're necessarily-- i somehow don't think so i've had my own demons to contend with in my life to make me doubt my own intelligence i get the sense that your compatriot-- i hate to call it friend here-- what are you doing here we don't have much many of the things that we carry are very dangerous obviously you have a great deal of genius here i'm going to show him the elemental shard i don't know if this would interest you but i consider it to be of great value the last piece of residuum i have impressive but not as impressive as the giant log i may be secrets and that is of me but i believe there is power in its secret people died for that many people but we might wouldn't we i really want to look at these i want to look at these books really quickly i'm having a moment i just want to start looking at these titles what are these books oh my god he's been in the troll dick all along that was fast oh no 23 you've got a very low initiative bonus peace out that's our next shirt wow this is a lot that happened i'm going to click my boots and i'm going to run up the wall and run upstairs is he right there manners action surge it's a dc 20 strength oh i'm sorry no never mind it's an attack roll 18 just making sure that i can do this that was my action surge i can only do one round just seeing if i have anything at a bonus that i can do my action i activated my boots my action surge activating that do i have anything i can do with a bonus action i'm going to turn to the other guy and pull the ripcord on the glove angrily (revving) smash him please turn him into paste dc 20 yeah he's stuck i love that we have floors he's going for scanlan oh that's fair not cool i feel like a natural 20 should auto-fail this he's technically now engaged with the bear so if he walks away the bear gets an attack of opportunity smoky d10 and spiky d10 and you get rerolls it's hard to stealth when you're on fire things you own end up owning you then we're going to be okay on the side of the house i think at that point i think we put it in the bag of holding oh god grog what did keyleth do i'm well aware it was totally worth it okay this all happened that's awkward that's okay i know where i am i'm going to run out onto the balcony really quick yeah i figure you're going to handle him grog take care of these two what do i see outside on the balcony i just rolled a natural 20 weird question really quickly where is that giant log trap how much swing does it have is it locked all the way over here or is it hung back there oh so it's a drop on the door good to know in the meantime i'm going to run on the exterior of the wall like right over here if that makes sense that's going to be my movement i'm going to take some fun happy pot shots at these bastards at the necromancer let's start with that bound necromancer he's fun with the vecna eye he's bound so i have advantage to hit him all right i'm going to use my animus gun so i still have a hand open and i'm also going to burn a point of grit so that i can get him to drop his staff here we go with advantage oh darn it was so close 28 that's-- ooh fancy 18 points of damage four points of psychic damage and he has to make a strength saving throw or drops his items that'll do three-quarters cover what does that mean in this crazy world i'm going to burn a grit for advantage and shoot one of them yeah i'll start there let's give it a shot i love advantage it's so wonderful 32 i really should have done extra damage so that's 1d10 plus six that hits obviously 32 to hit 17 points of damage plus two points of psychic damage 17 points of damage plus two points of psychic damage i'm going to take another shot at him i'm going to make this a sharpshooter shot and again with advantage because that's fun here we go damn almost a crit that's 29 that hits 14 points of damage-- i'm sorry 24 points of damage plus two points of psychic damage i use my bonus action to reload and stare at the nice person below me yay under a log you got to get better cultists man i love that spell be careful you might catch the building on fire this is a good plan sparkle fire yeah it's fire bonus action brilliant i'm ignoring him i'm not even gonna deal i'm just hopping in the window i'm going to grab my little guy there i'm going to bring him out to the balcony and i'm going to unceremoniously toss him out of the house and then i'm going to jump and i'm going to crawl down the rest of my way and join him outside the house and try and jump around the fire dragging him away from the fire acrobatics bless you for an acrobatics check i'm rerolling that it's not a saving throw oh well that's fine that's a 16 i had the spider climb boots just sit on him no that's not an obvious question i have no idea must have maybe he can feel you the way you can feel him yeah i don't know i'm going to prop our idiot up in the window so i can go in and keep an eye on him even while i'm inside yeah i kept one he automatically fails until 24 hours has elapsed any further attempts by the creature automatically fail until 24 hours have elapsed he ain't going nowhere it's mean man i'm watching through the book oh shit i'm going to pick up the book that he was holding when he was praying i'm going to just try and read it i'm going to hand him the book again and see if maybe there's focus to be found maybe this is-- oh lord ooh let's call that a 28 if it's all-- with your permission i'm going to take his hands yes he's the tuning fork i've dreamed of this place this is immortality this is everything (sighs chuckles) i may never leave i glide over to vex and hold her close this is stunning my god i think they may have actually forgotten all the idiot things i said yesterday i think they've completely forgotten i'm sorry may have panicked i'll be right back i'm going to run towards one of those stacks like a child i'm doing a title run i want to figure out the organizational system before i touch a book i pick one all right i pick it up i look around to see if anybody has a problem and i turn to the title page i read celestial i skip to the end last page i've got it i put it down i pick up another one first page last page 115 pages in i put it back and i turn they're made of people it's people and i'm going to find the most interesting spine and i'm going to turn to the first birth death birth death sex birth death some disappointment i am just gone i'm running back and forth finding whatever interesting spine i can are they all in celestial oh my god okay this is great all right i'm eventually probably going to pass out from mild hyperventilation and have to sit down if we must yes just as an experiment i'm going to think about vesper and try and touch a book i don't expect this to work but i'm going to close my eyes and think about and pick it up and flip through it nope there's a system i will discover the system i'm going to keep running around like a kid i've stopped i'm good is there a card catalog he seems to have purpose i'm giddily following behind oh he may have heard i thought you were going to die i may have panicked we were asked to plead for your life and i may have panicked i panicked i panicked there was a giant glowing sun and i may have panicked well i was a bit vague but i was-- oh no i may have hinted that we might have eloped may have hinted i may have hinted silence cone of silence he's back ladies and gentlemen he's back and taking no prisoners i love that i just turned it off i got everyone to agree where did you get the sunglasses from i felt that honesty was important at that moment we had to tell them eventually well we may have gotten married it was going to be-- we didn't want to make it a thing we wanted it to just be-- very specifically no this place do you not know what this place means am i the only one who understands what this place means it all matters no i mean really it all matters so much and it's not going to go away nothing goes away one and two people are all that it takes to experience something
