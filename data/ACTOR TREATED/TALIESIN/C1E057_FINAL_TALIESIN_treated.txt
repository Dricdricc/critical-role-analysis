actually yes i would love some help with my errands that shouldn't be a problem you're getting smarter we have rooms why don't we go claim our rooms and i'm sure they can lead us to everywhere we need to go and we can meet back there when everything is done to the slayer's take they may have a buyer laura and keep a few of the scales obviously we'll talk about the cold bag for now and see if there's anything else they want to talk about i really thought you'd be better at this no it was before that one we do have some white scales left over don't we i have a thing i'm thinking about certainly not anymore this is no reason to get rid of something for wholesale i'm just going to point out since-- liam laura and we should drink those first of all that is the only thing that makes sense and i feel-- and i apologize if it seems like i say this a lot but i do have a castle that we can drop things at and we can leave them there perhaps get back to them at a later date yes yes drop everything off create a little nest of what we need you found the troll dick didn't you oh i bet those have gone really bad do they just turn to stone ooh is it in the direction where i have to go i need to resupply everything okay yes you will this is out of-- i don't know if this is going to be any help or anything by the way vax but just in case i'm going to reach in and pull out the mask and hand it to vax just in case yes i do we'll talk about that but i've found in moments when i was feeling less than brave that pretending to be somebody else on occasion even afterwards can be helpful just some spit and something that smells nice in the front that will help it helps cleanse the air i don't know why i'm feeling what would be the word superstitious you know i kind of like it of all the options of the world that you've given me this is really your fault as much as it's mine (sighs heavily) i know let's just all be ginger (louder) hello victor are you home it's percy hold on (louder) hello you up there hello where is the owner of this domicile how long has he been gone for do you have any idea where he's been off to well i'm going to pop in and check really quickly just letting you know i gingerly open the door can i check for traps oh yay that's not that bad investigation i never use that 11 no 12 12 all right oh dear no i don't see anybody in here he's not necessarily always a believer in coin sometimes he just wants some trade also i need to talk to him about some personal issues oh sweet gods of pelor okay i'm going to go try and lift it (laughs) no hello victor i was just to give you money you were stuck-- you had gotten stuck down-- what is down there his mayan building can you not understand simple english are you all right are you sure grog scanlan (stutters) come on in he's fine i know grog can you lift the poor-- i need him mostly intact treat him slightly better than you would treat a member of your own family more than slightly better much better well i was hoping to buy a little bit more black powder from you if possible and i'm curious if you had anything else for sale and i wanted to ask you a couple of questions just about other customers again i know you do one question first question has a one-armed lady a one-handed lady a doctor come by to purchase-- i know victor i think you know how i feel about that but you're a very attractive man and-- are you dating right now okay (laughs) i can't i'm sorry i'm good well i was going to offer i was originally going to offer some gold if you like but if you'd like i could make you a tool you could use with your current predicament some sort of simple clawing mechanism for grasping lifting not getting caught in your mine i love trade trade is brilliant i would ask one other thing if i am to do this for you you have a question that was everything i could have hoped for and more really don't has dr ripley-- has a woman come by to buy black powder one hand one mechanical hand one normal hand mechanical hand i'm going to make you something nice and useful claw piece yes no i can make a better hand you're going to need to give me quite a bit of black powder for that and more questions is that recent it doesn't look that recent oh that's recent that's wet that's very wet i can work with that i can work with that i'm going to go construct you something that will be perfect for your needs i have a great idea i will need another hogshead and a half of black powder and a little information about another customer and then i will leave you to your work is that fair he eats a lot of pork thank you (grunts) i will put this in something reasonable i'll be back in just a little bit with-- actually do you have a glove that you used to wear or anything like that do you have something i can take measurements from that i'm going to be busy can you cast the-- she's not here to i don't think she can just fix his hand while i'm tempted-- would you just-- i feel like i made a deal i'm just going to have to see to it would you prefer a real hand or a claw hand that's what i thought this is projects for us and believe me i would like-- keeping him happy is pertinent i can make this myself it's just very difficult yes that's very easy to do she has no aesthetics whatsoever don't worry about it it'll be fine and if you can't do the mansion i know where i can go get some work done if not i know where i can work on something i will be back i will not leave town before i've delivered to you something-- oh absolutely fair yes of course no that's fine we'll be back it'll be good are we going to go find a hat shop then all right we will be back stay safe yes no just we'll be back bye and i'm just right it's a thing you're not alone i'm going to go see if the slayer's take has-- i cannot handle any more of that that was brutal so i'm going to go see if there's-- if there's not a blacksmithing if there's not somewhere i can do a bit of basic smithing work and technical work then i'm going to go find that blacksmith from last time well i'm going to go find that young chap from before 50 gold for the day can i use all of his tools and just my own materials i'm going to run and find vax get my stuff and go to work i've sent him with a shopping list i'm going to need a cheap gauntlet some saddling straps three tankards a pick-axe and two clocks that's right i've got (snorts) i give-- i do i give him-- this is what happens that was riegel don't read that that's not necessary and i need that man's dick to finish the arm despite the dick on my page i'm going to give scanlan 100 gold to take with grog to find some junk items that they can put together if you're down i love you i don't even need an articulated gauntlet it just needs to be a clamp we'll be cleaning that off the floor for ages how have we lived with this idiot what is the world coming to (groans) everyone i don't know what you people did but okay i'm sitting with my tea and my tools trying to ignore these people please don't explode oh jesus h fucking christ please (muffled) please inspire do it do it you bloody gnome better thank you proficiency tinkering plus the-- okay so proficiency dex okay thank you god 23 2 made it 12 it's not complicated but i've got a good design and it has two nifty things it doesn't actually have fingers it's a mitt piece strap-on it can lock the thumb and lock the hand so you can open it lock close it lock it's got little flip-locks you can detach the hand and put a pick spike on for mining like a mining punch it's more dustin hoffman hook but you know because it's got the click pull click i can do it with all these things i can graph it so reasonable it's not pretty i also carved a little message inside that will not matter unless it actually becomes pertinent you don't get to know until you ask offscreen i do go and deliver it (knocks) victor i've got your hand do you want your hand i don't see why they're mutually exclusive yes that's quite good i love your hat it looks it i did i grabbed your hand and i will show you it is very special i have a special set of pajamas myself so i understand (alarmed stuttering) let me show you it attaches like this here are the two switches (clicking) and for your mine i grab hit the button twist pull and i get the spike and attach it remove it put the hand back on tea sure why not always say yes to new hands (hoarsely) victor (laughter) ohhh probably has a woman been by to buy black powder (coughs) has a woman been by weeks i did not do you know where she goes did she what did she pay how much black powder did she buy victor only counts to two i'm so sorry (laughter) really and how often does she come by okay (sighs) thank you i'm so pleased i may stop by one last time before i leave town just to say goodbye thank you it certainly scalded something thank you that was very lovely and that was very charming and i unfortunately have business in the-- one more and then i must go thank you yes of course (uncertain laughter) remember that it's attached to bone you can still break your arm so be gentle thank you good night have a lovely evening good night aah pleasure as always thank you i leave in a little bit of a panic yeah yeah okay we're sticking around for a day i'm going to take a long walk before i come back and i'm going to walk by the raven queen temple and just peek inside i'm just going to gently open the door and peek inside and see if anybody's inside i walk in just for a moment and take a look around i'm going to gently look around and slowly back up and see if i can see anyone what do i have to pay to fix this i leave i walk briskly towards it i'm going to charge after them i knock three times hello please (sighs) something terrible has happened i don't understand how these games work i need help to fix something something terrible has happened you obviously care little for this world i start to back out i don't think i can be fixed there is something broken in the world i don't understand how these things work i'm so sorry where do you wish me to go (disbelieving laugh) (sighs) i strip and put it aside put my clothes in the corner you're filthy and i go into the pool we're cold people (sighs) we're doing this and i swim down until it's uncomfortable i'm going to head to the surface i don't know what's (sighs) i do not do well with this yes i do (takes deep breaths) do you know what i've done i have questions first is can we stop it can we stop what's been released is there something i can do did it choose me because i was broken or did it break me can it be fixed but the first deed is so there's so much and i don't think any of them see it i want it to die before anybody sees it can you help i know there is nowhere i can look for healing other than deeds i like to fix things i'm going to take my sword and i'm going to very carefully scrape my body clean of the blood as much as i can and i'm going to take the back of my shirt and clean my hair off as much as i can i'm going to take a vial of the blood in the pool one tiny bit i'm going to put my clothes back on and i'm going to cast hex on myself for my walk home and banish it before i come in the door i'm going to walk quiet and late and go tinker on a little thing for a minute until i pass out (groan) 32 oh my god what the-- i couldn't have rolled that like that would've been a natural 20 would have been the only way around that no very specifically they don't let's drop off our-- oh i already picked it up oh you have a hat i say we drop everything-- we take a pit stop in whitestone and head towards the feywild yes it does actually ah do i know anything about the feywild roll the credits scroll let's empty our bags let's prepare ourselves there are certainly stories in the woods of whitestone of strange happenings so i'm sure there's probably some connection to the feywild and we'll see what happens well we have something which to be fair is probably going to keep a dragon away yes let's go to whitestone really i would have a theory as to what it was should i roll to figure out that this is probably an active volcano i'm down no wow natural 1 i'm distracted taming of the shrew fits yeah you do have a point that is true we could go steal an airship then we wouldn't have to go to whitestone it would hold all of our things laura and we could hold all of our things on the airship and i could have cannonades we won't need the airship if the dragons are dead no you'll make a fine sailor quite yeah shaun tattooed at the small of his back sure good patron you do nothing but brighten these halls an excellent argument yes i genuinely have no idea what you're talking about 40 minutes same plane as the break room 5 minutes is 15 (laughs) i assume there's clean clothes for everybody in their quarters and i'm going to arrange for our stuff to be stowed in the vault oh i am dressed sit down have a beer watch our game yes of course so it's fair to assume that at the other end of this is something old something trapped something hungry let's not this is disappointing yes that's right i was hoping that perhaps we could talk about some engineering possibilities of finding ways that science can measure what it is where magic cannot something safe in this sense as it stands i'll sketch something with my copious free time any fortifications would be helpful i have another request in that direction that might help if there was a way to spread the word in this city and amongst those who travel to not speak of us we should probably not be hailed in this city at all our names should be stricken from any record of it best to be nameless at this point it's for everybody's (cracks up) you're a terrible person oh oh no or just the letter c if they came there they would've been provoked i figured do we know where these-- where these dragons have been all this time where they were banished to wait then thordak was banished to the fire plane i've had a terrible thought and it is sort of my business to have terrible thoughts what else has been banished to the fire plane well i say this because if i were to slowly open the portal to the fire plane and power it and make it bigger and bigger and bigger eventually it would be a hole into that dimension that's big enough for a dragon to fit through but still not big enough for me so i need to keep eating to make it bigger and maybe they might be looking for what's down there so they can feed it and make a bigger hole just a thought it may be nothing i have terrible thoughts it's a terrible thought that may not have been the portal that may just be where he escaped that power may still be flowing it's the best wine look how clever food makes all of us (whispering) fuck he might be looking for something or might be making-- we can only be so hopeful that they tear each other apart our best hope at this point is just to amass power we are not strong enough but we will get stronger unless they know what's underneath the castle there's nothing of value here i love game meat it lives it lives we will be returning i feel like the feywild calls to us ocean next born and raised (cracks up) stupid to settle i was about to walk out the door but if you're walking-- do you want to take a walk with me we take a very quiet walk around whitestone i want to pass all of the temples that are either still standing or destroyed i just want to take a temple tour not stopping not talking i just want to see what they look like pelor looks good the one in the cemetery while in the cemetery-- i assume that it's still a mess there were a couple of lords' crypts in there was there an anders family crypt at one point cool all right i'm going to walk back to the castle with you in tow and i'm going to find zahra yes come i have a task for you if you have the time and energy for something a bit quiet but necessary i'm going to have the deeds to the anders family crypt transferred to your name i want you to clean it out throw the bodies wherever he has disgraced himself clean them and if you can if you can find people who can do it i want to very quietly in that crypt create a small shrine to the raven queen this will help and i bring out the vial of blood from the pit perhaps they will know what to do with that but i would like her to have a quiet mark in this city it's for your brother so that he can help us we're apparently all in this together oh thank you we need all the help we can get tell anyone you'd like where i went it's not a secret i just wasn't ready to i don't think your brother-- i would hate for him to think i'm competing i just had some questions thank you thank you for noticing and i'm trying hard not to make it my business it's hard to remember sometimes that's awful isn't it (sighs) i'm going to go to my room-- yes i'll talk to my sister on the way out i'll write her a letter and see if they can-- they may have to delve into our materials for it but i think we're good we'll talk about using our materials for such a thing and i will talk to her about that i'm going to do my little thing and if it works great and if not we'll speak not of it for a while better 30 i craft a brooch it's not even a brooch it's a clasp i had built these pieces of it earlier on in the game for the last three weeks i've been working on this i've taken the raven skull that you gave me and made a mold and poured melted silver into a bird skull a silver bird skull taken a ruby and set it behind it built it into a clasp that does not reflect and in it put a sachet of-- satchel marisha and thank you my brain coffee of myrrh and-- (snorts and laughs) myrrh sandalwood opium and dragon's blood not real dragon's blood but dragon's blood-- sap it's a sap it's a tree sap put the whole thing together it's not it's just poppy you will find out when i present it that's two two winks ah hah hah oh he can read that preschoolers run amok in my gentle abode (whispering) we don't know what the hell this is wow wow because he runs into all the rooms first and he makes out with everybody that's why it happens i'm not yelling at you man i'm envious it's about to drop there's a fine line between psycho and practical it's not psycho if you drive a very small car with not a lot of trunk space is there going to be one more giveaway it's so cool
