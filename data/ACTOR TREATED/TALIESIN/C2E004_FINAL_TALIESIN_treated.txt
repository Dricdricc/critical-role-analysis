i think we need to bring it i think we're going to need a trophy that'll do i'm going to give the body a quick search to see if there's anything do i recognize any of these rings all right that's disturbing suppose i should i'm going to try and carve off the head this is as far as i go one this one that's way too heavy for me i'm going to grab toya laura and i think that's a very good idea i did share meals with this person for two straight years never mind i'm walking away i'm already walking away i took the kid and am walking to the boat laura marisha and you're the worst you're all the worst i know dear you've been through a bit there's been some bad business (sighs) a friend turned on us but it's going to be all right i'm going to get you home all right i'll explain it later oh yeah you're a monster no it's not that bad i've got some new stuff coming in coming in from the feywild oh can i reroll then that's nine i know it's going to be a bit rough but it was for the best i'm so sorry some people just turn i'm so sorry he got sick there was something inside him there was something that made him do some bad things but it had to be taken care of you're going to be all right biggest frog you've ever seen i was trying to keep her away from that the barney that been raising her yes really take that in off to a great start i'm trying to keep her quiet you should i'm going to take her to the front of the boat and keep her far away from all that i've been listening i pull out a gold coin give him this and now there's a little girl it's all coming full circle i'll let that go took a lot out of us if you see us we won't make eye contact it's a shame we didn't just get rid of a wagon not more than one night ago someone else may get to it or something might happen what could people do with the head of a creature like this would i know for the moment we need to get this one back to the circus too you might be helpful for that i'm hoping toya will-- she knows what to say when guards are asking questions she's had a bad night we'll have a talk we'll get her to some people who can calm her down and make sure she remembers how we take care of each other sorry dear i was hoping that we didn't have to have this conversation in front of strangers it turns out that that was-- kylre did that i don't know why something snapped he's hurt and killed a lot of people we think that maybe he's been making you sick too gustav is having trouble with the authorities we're going to need to all work together to save him the twins are being the twins ornna's being ornna but i think we can save everybody we just need to take care of each other i felt it no i want to hear this too somehow that was better than what i was hoping for you know how people outside can be the mean girl was just afraid of you and we're going to let her go on this one yeah i know let's get you home okay choked you with my stick that was certainly memorable this is so weird are you it's like a napkin on a buffalo take her right back no one can know that she's been anywhere we'll explain to her what needs to be done we still have people in the lockup i'll be back and i have to show back up with you people anyway i'm going to get her as quickly as possible i wouldn't say no to it before i take off that's canon what is my stealth bonus now level two we're going to die from bad paperwork literally we're going to die from bad paperwork 13 oh shite not even a good push to get her underneath just back into one of the tents or no yeah i don't know they're caught do i i'm going to try and wait for an advantageous moment ooh 22 you remember nothing happened find ornna you didn't see me you just hid and waited and you didn't know that anything was wrong if people ask unless you hear from me you don't know anything i'm going to start heading back to the inn nice hmm (sighs) i'm going to get a little closer just to take a look at what is actually going on not too close 19 oh what's the play what's the play ah i'm going to-- yeah fuck it i'm going to walk up with briskly there i find you i've been looking everywhere you're not supposed to leave the bloody inn you-- oh (sighs) they're already in trouble apparently all right less questions to answer dance number xhorhas i just whisper xhorhas lot of help you were you're right we do protect our own that's absolutely true it's a common tactic it's a good way to make your way through this world normally it works we assumed the circus anyway that we were being framed we were protecting our own is the head in here this one showed his true colors and then we took care of it i'm going to throw one of my swords down on the ground that is filthy with its blood oh shit 12 we needed someone on the outside we knew we were innocent we knew you didn't think so we just assumed you were going to have us all executed and we didn't do anything what would you have done in his defense it's a wonderful vintage her defense not a natural one shame i don't know that is a question gold comes gold goes i don't know how much the circus has and honestly i think ornna would lie about it if we asked well the twins buggered ornna god only knows toya is back at the circus but shaken very shaken how hard can it be to make 2000 gold how hard can it be to steal 2000 gold maybe be best to find that gold elsewhere suppose we should take a look at what's left of the circus i will definitely drink i think we should probably drink at our camp then i'm fine inviting them is this a human thing to-- never mind i know kylre went bad maybe he'd already always been bad i don't know let's not be throwing words around he did summon-- he was fine for years something set him off liam  ah he said it himself you people in the circus are weird right so every once in a while a glitch he was fine for so long there was nothing for so long why things don't just maybe everything gives me the heebie jeebies shite she is not good she is taking it as you would expect that's true with her stick always she's the charm she has to come see charm drink he is very funny arm wrestle so you've got to be putting something on the table though well if you want to surrender the sword or not surrender the sword (laughs) never that's a stupid game get no blame from me ah cheers to that not our best show you have plans i don't know i'm thinking about it i don't know where i'm going to end up now the biggest one's a bit-- you could make a lot of dresses out of that tent that's fair thank you i don't-- i want to spy the rings on her hand by the way really quickly i want to look at the other rings she picked up not that she's wearing right now they are obviously rings from random dead people aren't they okay i'm just putting that together i think i will hmm i'm not quite done with this one we'll see it's true oh no she's had a thing the entire time there was a little while i thought she was in on it completely i've known her for years i just assumed that she was in on it yeah that would be great you know no matter what you pick you're always welcome right wherever you end up northeast i've always wanted to go there traditionally you have to go to a map maker we might have a bit of something at the circus i don't know insight check five or six months ago 14 all right thank you it's true northwest i'd be happy keeping a bit of a low-key existence some of us are a bit sketchy with the law well i figured if you're going to live your life you're going to live your life does do that there's nothing wrong with living your life you only get one of them or mostly and your days are going to be the days that you're going to have and i'd like to keep living my life the way i'd like to and keep off of certain radars stupid phrase really stupid that's just ridiculous (laughter) clam space you smell fine laura and you should probably get that patched up actually though that is fair i'm all right with that collect our things from-- my things anyway from the circus there should be some spares take me a while to pack note note note we don't care we're not that attached yet more mine more mine everybody at home grab your ticket you got in the mail scratch off number three (laughter) quiet dignity and grace it was string and mime i'd like to see the other guy you know if the monks beat you up to make them join your gang they're not really your friends is that why they did that to your face there oh no they didn't apparently they were pretty-- insight check fuck all 11 meet us at the circus she really did i'm going to pack up and head back to the circus start getting things together i'll meet you there actually you know what i want to see you see that map it's gorgeous it's fabulous no i'm going map hunting or if she can draw us a map of how to get there this is beautiful we're going to goonies this really quickly here ready take a look it's amazing you live in a serpent if you pull out a real medi-kit now i'm going to be really excited 50 bandages come flying in medi-kit i like the idea of you just standing there going [bell dangling noises] well that's the question are we going to be able to grab a cart or two from the circus like one of the little vardos can we snag a vardo i'm very wary of this but fine sword jugglers level two healing potions aside you are doing something really interesting and exciting here you're not a healing potion dealer what are you doing here like this is fascinating i don't know i feel like you can excite me i feel like there's something that you have to show that's really exciting i'm not entirely sure it's all about stamina i think you've got something-- you did that on purpose talk to me like i'm a child show me something i've never seen before not with advantage because i don't have it but i was so excited persuasion check 19 i'm fishing for drugs i'm not going to lie i've been on the road a long time i don't remember how to do this i skip over to the door and gingerly close it yes i do and we're leaving town today i don't actually know what that is i thought it was very clever i've got to be honest i'm not made of money but i'm always curious for a new experience well this might be complicated i think that just-- what would-- a few experiences' worth what would that run me i'm so sorry i'm so sorry for dragging the entire audience into this hopefully your children are already asleep i do apologize thank you for really bringing that to earth for me you started this all right yeah put me in for one i'll try anything once what's it called skein no this is not how this works this is not how this works we bank our moments for those moments when life is disappointing oh my god this can come in handy in all sorts of ways the fact that you had this ready means that there is no shame here you were ready for this i know i can tell a big purple pierced demon walked into the room and was like hello somewhere around level eight this is going to be hilarious somewhere around level eight somebody's going to go shopping and the rest of us are going to be like this is now this is happening now years in the making she's fine she's just awful you're a gentleman i hope to see you again i'm looking forward to this of course we never met you you never met us i am already out the door with a flourish that is an extreme over-exaggeration we got a health potion it worked north to the horses i was going to say robbing shady people is usually a bad idea no i don't think it's the name of the town what about yogurt it usually is no we've got a cart i came though alfield didn't i that's right we have a horse we have a horse we have a wagon why be fast what are we in a rush for i find careful is always best i don't get along with anybody you know where we're headed it is such a different world wow mail fraud that is actually the worst crime we've committed today wagon's ready i've even attempted to hide some of the contraband and otherwise i packed well quite a few got into a bar fight bunch of assholes
