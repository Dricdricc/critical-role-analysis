it makes your eyes pop i like that you two match actually we can't talk about anything we're in a boat bam 25 (garbled) no (garbled) these cookies are really good i'm going to tug on the rope three times in succession to let our shark friend know that it's time to boogie i'm going to take the rope i'm going to jump out of the boat is there anything to tie the rope to is there something that if i had an adhesive that i could-- i'm going to attempt to take the piece of rope place it against the wall and take an ice shot slightly above the rope and freeze it to the wall i'm running in for the rest of my movement hey laura 28 days later zombies all right that was fine i'll go back to the boat then it's fine i don't care 22 22 i'm on the boat i started heading back to the boat so i just heard someone yell run so i'm going to start unhooking the boat i'm getting the boat ready to go and i'm bringing the boat around so that people can get on really quick if there was some book that had all this information available some ancient tome which suddenly answers everything got to make it weird man up up up we're fine we have lots of ways to hurt it before it gets there we have arrows and guns we're fine i take a shot you've been waiting to use this all right i'm going to take a dead-eye sharpshooter shot i'm going hardcore with this so with bad news i'm sitting down i'm at advantage for this shot regular shot 13 yeah damn it by the way if anyone wants to make us a little six-square carpet that would be awesome and i reload one we are killing it you know exactly where that's been can we fashion it into a sail grog will make wind i've got a great idea i want to sit and i want to skin this thing you can have the teeth i'm going to skin it or we could go to those strange buildings that are off in the northwest corner keep going there you go let's start heading that direction and i want to skin this creature not going for craftsmanship i'm making a camo canopy for the boat 17 i didn't i'm keeping it for later oh does it only last ten minutes oh in that case 26 (singing) nobody knows what it's like-- taliesin and for you i'm going to build a relative canopy specifically for the left side of the boat so that we're protected and visibly obscured from anybody in the city what's the bonus on that again dex thank you (raspberry noise) that's 11 i rolled really badly okay once we're at the beach and we have all evening i'll make another attempt i had a two submersive party cruise let's dry-dock the boat a shark stealth stealth shark let's light it up see what happens we rest here we take shifts we should be fine that always works yeah let's go for it this is a terrible plan i think it's a great idea rah that's what rocks say taliesin and you've got a number there they're not wearing sombreros or anything i have not the slightest clue how to do that we are not making a holy hand grenade i was very proud of that scanlan is there any way you could absorb this sound 14 points of damage 4d6 oh god it was a very good bomb your life at this point and a song you owe me a song it's more just an energy shield could this veil exist in sunlight that's exactly what i was thinking at least wall it off on our way out just wall it off earth-meld it i was just having this conversation we did take about 8 hours or so the description of her dream crackers all around i'm going to work on the boat that's two zeros he said pay attention druid oh my god this aberration is a cake whoa percy was the third of seven children born to a noble family who lived far to the north in the ancient castle of whitestone with so many siblings to share the burdens of lordship percy turned his attentions to the sciences engineering and naturalism one day a mysterious couple named lord and lady briarwood came to court during a feast held in their honor the briarwoods violently took control of the castle killing or imprisoning everyone who would stand in their way percy awoke chained in the dungeon only to be freed by his younger sister together they fled chased by the briarwoods' men as they ran percy's sister took several arrows to the chest and fell percy kept running eventually jumping into a freezing river and floating unconscious to freedom he did not remember waking up on a fishing boat he barely remembered the next two years as he slowly made his way as far south as possible then one night percy had a dream a roaring cloud of smoke offered him vengeance against those who destroyed his family when he awoke percy began to design his first gun (gunshot) i'm going to work on the camouflage let's head to those little buildings off the corner there it is actually very good i think this is a reasonable risk let's go for it singing this will be the day that i scry it's on the cover of dungeons & dragons monthly right now it is the cover model you're thinking about this wrong though you're thinking about this in the wrong direction beholder is not-- that's not the goal even more than that it's the hundreds of allies we could have prison is the target not the beholder if we can free the elder brain-- then we're not alone now what was creating this green light where was it emanating from can you describe the top of the pyramid we have something very important we have a vial of yellow liquid it seems to be very acidic i could melt the metal and we could actually bring that entire structure crashing down we have that yellow goop and that would definitely help we suspect it we're going to break the temple if you have something to say we would appreciate it they're terrible monsters i think it's that beehive structure i think we destroy the beehive structure at the top we have several vials of acid actually i thought about making an acid arrow i really did it took me months to figure out how to build i could make an exploding arrow i've made one i can make another yeah at this point though if i had a workshop i could-- i would assume not there's going to come a point where chaos is just going to descend on us no sadly i was thinking about that we could camp there that could be where we stage our attack from if something goes wrong though it's going to be-- i would rather something go wrong with all of us than something go wrong with half of us baby steps we'll get in the boat and we'll start heading there well we can't all fit on the carpet perfect yeah i'm in the boat i'm going to attempt to attach the skin to the bottom of the carpet well before you guys take off just going to try and sew it on the corners that's better 16 you've got pass without a trace also we can wait that's fine general perception check on the beach as well i don't know why i'm bothering 11 it's a beach might want to wait let the scouts scout there's no twinkies there's just cake i have not the slightest clue where my phone would be it's probably out in the hallway you guys are doing it yay happy birthday holy cow on your mother's side or your father's side marisha and hell elf oh my god yeah those was awesome that's a really good idea who would voice our characters is my question hey yeah

shits no i was with you i have a family name no i've been the shits (all laugh) (laugh) quite a few we accept fanfic as our personal savior just became ten i believe neutral good there's so many i'm trying to pick one this is like trying to catch snowflakes acting with a desire for a bad haircut no i was a working actor oh god this is how everything goes wrong this is what happens she might actually cry high school i had played other games before you but had never really experienced the sensation of playing d&d this was a whole-- there were levels that were reached that had never been reached before not me i would like to age rage (all laugh) wait how old are you i'm 38 january 19th i'm the oldest january january 19th is an awesome birthday yes thank you probably in a bag i can't

drama just drama that's dark people that's really dark bear love someone mentioned we should bring jennifer hale on the show as a guest that would be hot yeah that's a good question ashly burch laura and i don't know if we can get ashly burch that's tough george takei steve blum troy baker vin diesel claudia black garfunkel and oates would be amazing i'd play with them that'd be awesome peter dinklage sir ian mckellen wow this is an amazing-- you've had a little-- we've had a run-in with the family once-- yeah that was the only time you actually-- deflated a conflict so would i be grog then it would just be me as grog we could have some kind of freaky friday that makes the t-shirt extra special i'm down for that not in this game what about all the other stuff you probably did will you tell us about that you rage-looted the rage-looting was pretty much the most disgraceful thing i've ever seen he felt guilty for weeks after he felt genuinely bad about it (laughs) erika ishii yuri lowenthal tieflings are like horned pseudo-demonic-- they're playables that would be awesome someone asked about percy percy doesn't know if his sister died and percy doesn't have a plan for his family because right now percy is scared shitless of everything going on in the north so no no someone did actually do that that was really weird there's just so much to read i have been specifically not tweeting my full name yet i've been really enjoying watching people attempt to figure out what it is right now percy's in a hole underground so it's not his favorite place to be once i'm actually in a place to try and impress people i'll be saying my name more yeah i like the way you treat it scanlan at sunset coming soon through the stained-glass window it was amazing have we not done a drunk episode a beholder i would imagine is the worst you guys found me in a basement yeah i had been arrested we've never really discussed what i was doing down there that's a story for another time how long ago was that i think laura's actually my favorite character you have these very interesting emotional reactions to things that i find really entertaining from my side of the table aw aw burt reynolds with the badge you're really the heart of the group we don't pretend that losing you wouldn't have broken us into tiny little pieces you haven't met gilmore we get to do a christmas special online this year it is so amazing i still have the bag of leftover ikea crap they're worth more money because they're cursed there is only one god and it is-- taliesin and he is cruel and painful you got a cool custom die she's got a custom die and it's awesome tiberius minxie (laughs) hogwarts houses slytherin slytherin actually when the final book came out we went to one of those borders parties and i had my little slytherin robes i have slytherin robes and all the slytherin kids were hanging outside of borders smoking clove cigarettes and hustling little gryffindor kids for their book money (all laugh) i don't want to know how it's done that was amazing greyjoy well this got uncomfortable really quickly no i wasn't playing until the '90s oh my god this is going so fast where do you get your awesome shirts they want to know where your shirts come from the internet my first crit with my new gun which was also my first kill with my new gun that felt really good that felt good that felt nice that was not during the show oh that's right i'd forgotten about that you're not spider-man yeah mansions of madness yeah bad news was built during the changeover to 5th edition took about-- yeah it was about four or five months in-game sitting at a table just tinkering and tinkering it's much more kinetic i make a standard roll plus-- what is it is it dexterity and a modifier on top of that i built keyleth a special staff ages ago man i've been doing a lot lately and i get a bonus if i'm actually back at the keep and then matt and i emptied out our ren faire closets we don't want to tell anybody what not to do i don't want to see that is it overwhelming having 8000 people watching no the world would be a better place with more d&d i think we're just both really snooty which is why we kind of hang out someone asked if it's weird not being a fantasy character in a fantasy setting for percy as a gunslinger i really like it i will actually admit that i've always been fascinated by that moment in history where suddenly we went from bows and arrows to guns so i really like the idea of being the guy who made that terrible mistake and had this really bad idea and i'm really enjoying rping that guy and trying to figure out what would drive a human being to do something so stupid as to invent a gun he's really screwing the entire future at this point flying squirrel bam sam text me the change in schedule if you get a second is it my imagination that gilmore is blond by the way does everybody else see gilmore as very blond i saw big curly blond hair i can see that too everyone's so nice i barely believe it's the internet aww yes yeah i did but my dm was not very good so the game got so boring we quit because our dm was weak this is the speed our personal text messages or group text messages go at you find all the good stuff he's the winner for finding stuff i love watching people take risks that's my favorite thing about d& no i'm done go ahead dutch tieflings are cool i like being token human token human has been a lot of fun my previous character was dragonborn that was a dwarf chef (imitates the swedish chef) (cheers) it's a game that you can play with your friends that will create the kinds of bonded shared experiences that created the friends you had in high school the friends you just don't get anymore but you can get them by doing this this is to make that high school friend again this is a group of people i see more often than any other group that's a whole other group of friends i see them about once a month really it's funny because-- matt and
