what am i doing thursday night (laughter) (laughs) yeah yeah it's puzzle quest's ten-year anniversary yeah and gosh golly puzzle quest marvel marvel puzzle quest marvel and puzzle quest i'm not sam riegel i'm doing my best i was just given this i thought he was going to be here we brought his things out i thought he was going to be here and now i have this and i have to somehow-- i'm not touching that i know where it's been that's so true i can say that i do love comic books i love three-jewel replacement games that i can play on airplanes-- -- and when i wanna pretend to listen to my family over christmas it's great i know and i suddenly realised a couple of them watch the show and now they know that i'm not really texting you guys but marvel puzzle quest is great because it's all the fun of the three-gem bejeweled-style games but you would also collect characters if you're a big nerd like i am and they've got basics like thor and iron man and new fun ones like ms marvel and-- they have black widow black widow is actually one of the first ones i ever got but they've also got crazy ones-- they've got devil dinosaur that's nuts i'm even more embarrassed that i know you now it was already bad this is why you're never going to be on my show matt ooh you're never going to be on my show because you don't have time i know (laughter) but yeah marvel puzzle quest thank you guys you can get it on steam amazon app store google play apple store-- it's all over the place comfy seats while drunk i'm ready i want a bruise right here critical brawl we just barefist it oh god that's right we had a great time this week talking about swamp thing and horror comics next week we're going to be talking vaguely about dc comics everything from superman batman wonder woman flash green lantern aquaman the whole set of them and all the weirdness and talking about 52 what it is why people seemed weird about it and why people are coming back to read it now like a brief overlook on everything dc comics it's going to be fun yeah it was a weird time it's getting cooler now we're gonna try and see how many euphemisms we can-- we're going to talk about it like i know you think this is a new dog but it's really the same dog he's just better now yeah we're working on it did you take your shots i was not you were i was not no it's a mantle it only goes to here i like to think there's a piece of paper like pinned to his wall right now sorry we're good carry on don't feed them very easily actually that's the easy part no sadly we can't well it is complicated and as hells go there could be worse hells i've been reading thank you i've been looking into this and it seems that where we're going has a very very structured hierarchy it's very ordered the society makes sense and wherever we find this creature that we have to slay there will probably already be forces working against him that will be happy to ally with us to help that happen they're vicious psychopathic creatures that only function because they maintain these rules with each other about how they're supposed to act i think it would be possible to find people who would be delighted for outsiders to come in and do their dirty work for them yes no they can see through things it's going to be complicated as well because we have value as well his name is asmodeus and no we are not kidnapping asmodeus of hell i've seen sketches yes well i mean i don't know how correct these are-- oh my we're going to be offered things there there's going to be deals made it's going to be negotiating probably with someone who'll give us cover if we do some dirty work they have a lot in common yes it's even more structured though there's quite a complex-- i alone have identified 13 different caste systems within their function there's imps spine devils barbed devils chain devils bone devils there's all these different kinds of devil and each devil has to answer to a different devil they answer specifically to the devils that have fealty over them who in turn are at constant war with the devils who are in fealty to other devils and archdevils and greater devils who in turn all owe their fealty to asmodeus we are not devils we are not even slaves we are consumables yes and then turning that into a lemure yes i was very proud of that no accepting of gifts you are might have to make you special gloves that don't have any fingers even specialer gloves your current contract with us actually stipulates that you can't have another contract enacted until you confer with all of us yes i'm very thorough i don't think you were there this might have been just him and me getting drunk at one point it doesn't actually say where rakshasas would fall in the caste does it in dis yes whole page (laughter) if they're under contract this is where they go no we're absolutely listening that changed the game forever speaking of just our buddy-- -- pike is another concern i would feel far more comfortable making sure that she is definitely on board for this i don't know i've been thinking about that the best way to-- i know i do bring it up though that it is one those things that we should talk about this is one of those things where i thought i would just bring it up now before we go running in there i am okay with that too i thought i would bring it up i just thought i would bring it up-- -- 'cause it is one of those things that is pretty clutch down there the feeling i get reading-- the more i read about this place is no one likes anybody down there and so if we can figure out a way to be convenient about it you can disappear anybody he's probably not well-respected we don't have to do that here honestly the more we act like us the more people are going to try to tempt us into things they'll probably see through it i don't know would i know it's not on the page you gave me one page sure thank you already have us under contract do you feel up to this level of deception i say with all seriousness oh god i'm a tiefling what happened why has this happened to me it's uncanny i'm of the opinion that a bunch of mortals show up in the city of dis looking for a rakshasa i think they're going to be able to put two and two together i think that's very fair they were gift-wrapped and everything yes that's perfectly fine (laughs) i'm so sad sam couldn't be here for that i'll take two regular if you've got them infernal they speak infernal technically it would be a middle name i do not speak infernal i am struggling to find a reason why not which is somewhat irritating percy is just perfectly reasonable my god you've found the line and i've drawn it d-roll is actually pretty slick you're just going to end up wings someday that's all i'm saying so infernal is going to be a problem does doty speak infernal can he write in infernal no that's my stuff i'm spreading because he's not here i speak disco but not infernal so sorry i'm not really that sorry that was for the aladdin earlier i had to do something in retaliation we're looking to see if anything-- it depends on what kind of spell like elemental spells-- i do too this picture they have in the book is quite exciting yes she does well we may have to actually hire a guide once we're in there then we could go ask no thank you it is called common for a reason sleep talk to the gardener for a bit there were words in there he's got a point all the time you do have a small house if you're feeling-- it needs to be there's land yeah 'twill be it's going to be lovely it was very nice before it caught fire this is and the grey hunt itself is eventually going to be popping up what's your plans kiki it's not terrible no no no i mean there's some boring bits of it obviously (sighs) where does she learn this stuff i've never-- oh my god (laughter) part of the grey hunt-- and this happens not every season but often on winter's crest festivals and again it is an official title and does actually carry with it some responsibilities beyond that but they're very very you they'll be fine-- is and i can't give too much of it away because part of the ritual is also-- you are going to have to go into the woods and meet something no i'm really not you go into the woods there are creatures that live in the woods that have been affected by the land that have gained some-- whitestone there are things within the earth of whitestone that have certain power and certain energies and they have been seeped into the plants and the stones and the animals themselves and your job will be-- more or less the punchline is you're going to go and you're going to have to actually bring back a kill and it will be a very specific kill that is asked for but part of that then gives you a practically divine right to manage and look after the creatures of the woods and our hunting and what is reasonable to be killed and otherwise i think i'm covering most of it-- divine more in the sense of what reasonable people do to tell commoners that we're allowed to talk to them less exciting you do go alone no you do not get help i think you're going to do very well it's a sign it'll be a lovely winter's crest we haven't had a master or mistress of the grey hunt in many many many years i don't know i mean i think i'm going home i say i think i'm going home there will be work to do there and i have plans for my city i have plans for the people i want to make it great again i want to make it shining beautiful comfortable for everyone i think that that would be an excellent thing for our two people to communicate very regularly i think they must that sounds very expensive i'm not sure that that's possible yes of course i can help you with something like that it will be a string on a bell you're learning so well are we all sleeping in this hut or do we have separate huts we're all sleeping in this hut aren't we that's probably not kept well goodnight lovely people kuthok we're all going to say that over and over again now kuthok this is so wonderfully doctor dolittle no no damn it liam ermahgerd i hate you it's going in the book you and she of the so-called tempest can both-- ah voice of the tempest mm open your portal to the nine hells i think it's-- are we going to just do this (whispers) hate you so how do you say 'do you speak common' oh well that's fair (laughter) it's remarkable she kills at night no no i'm calling that one yet i will say 'yes' 'no' 'please' and 'thank you' can get you through an enormous amount of transactions with reasonable people so 'yes' and 'no' get you through an awful lot we are stalling easily a city of krakens it is now this is assuming that we're going to survive to be fair so-- it's a lot of assumption oh any of us any nothing it's going to be great how do you even know that-- i-- no never mind nope nope thank you thank you i'm behind this plan it's a good plan wait are you above me or below me all right it's okay we're going to find an inn thaign (cheering) while we can do that-- there's an omnipresent iron tower that's watching it's more the 'omnipresent' part that was really the point of that but yes that's copyrighted i'm well aware pizza the hutt dis would be-- if we find the market we'll find an inn find an inn we'll find a place to drink and get a room oh no i can already see that going poorly all right let's all make the changing circle i'll take one why not i would agree if we go into a fight it doesn't matter i'll take grey we have lillith right let's find ourselves a marketplace and an inn let's go i am going to step out into the street with pomp and circumstance and purpose please don't write things down while i do that that's not nice i act like me i think i'm going to be fine he's also going to be fine i wouldn't know from reading anything i wouldn't have a vague idea of where to go i have a theory at the moment but it's pretty light hitchhiker's guide to the city of dis i say we head to the tower so whichever direction it is that's the way we'll head i feel like if i were going to build a giant tower that couldn't be ignored i would have that be the center of anything and every place it may not even matter why try to be complicated let's own it no fear i strut no let's not make a scene i'm going to look for signs to look for the sorts of people who are walking around if there seems to be a flow of traffic if people seem to be going in a direction coming from a direction getting a sense of the city while heading towards the tower to make sure that i am trying to get a lay of the land so maybe i can see if we should veer off in a direction i'm also looking for humans someone who might speak common it's been a while yes of course -- a problem i may have to-- i'm aware that there's a lifespan on this die that i may eventually need to put it away heads i'm well aware in that case i'm going to find a lemure and inquire sternly of directions kuthok marketplace point well that's depressing all right what building are they currently chained to i wouldn't recommend walking on in which way did the creature go keep walking in that direction-- (indecisive noise) from a gentle long distance and not with great intent that was a chain devil that was a bone devil all right that won't go poorly (minnesotan accent) hello we're from outta town y'know laura marisha and and we all die too much fargo lately well that's-- 15 i'm not-- (indecisive noise) keeping my distance if they go to an alley then i'm not going to go down an alley i'm going to walk by and maybe look down the alley from across the street but i'm not-- i'm trying to stay on main roads no-- that feels like a trap to me that feels like the sort of thing i would do if i wanted to shank someone in an alley i knew you had we'll take a left at the next main thoroughfare is it there is no walking away from the tower venice in august beach not-- are there any other people around i'm going to give a roll tieflings no obviously-- just us let's try this proper i'm going to start walking and see if i can make eye contact with anything well i am walking in their direction anyway-- just trying to-- well they did yeah i'm going to head toward the tieflings as well which i think is the same direction anyway so stove cat i'm just going to ask somebody where to find a pub or an inn not trying to be coy not trying to be interesting yes we are interesting i push everybody to the side and down i kind of like it here i was having a hellraiser moment into the tavern i go stepping inside the tavern i'm going to stay downstairs to see if they try and come in common certainly not ermahgod we're here on a few days' business and we were hoping to find a friendly place to rest our heads on occasion maybe take in a meal of something not necessarily-- too conscious will coin suffice if we get anything more exciting we'll be sure to let you know we just got here oh god stop it matt ugh i'm totally okay with that you sir is that 250 a night or 250 total for our stay for that 350 i think i feel that i want you to know just how grateful we are i'll put the extra 100 out of my personal bin we're good we're good i think we're cool just let it play out that had a name that had a life that had a mortgage he made some bad decisions and now you're eating it-- i'm so proud of you three rooms this is everything i wanted yeah let's go to the rooms don't fall in don't lick it either bugs or bugs i cast black light that's actually true i'm going to gently pop her in the ankle to see if i can get her to just fall onto the bed and stop hopping so does the identification spell actually tell you the name of the person that you were consuming sustained (laughs) it's literally soylent scry you're going to be fine after you scry i'm going to give her a shot of something just to calm down going to give her a shot of something got to go back for more soon (laughs) certainly spirits at the very least soul and spirits i shouldn't be finding this as funny as i am show me what you got suspended by octopi this is going to go great what if that means it's just as hot underground so all we have to do is teleport through that tree that's underground we can send him a small bonsai tree as a gift we have to find the prison find out what it is who runs it-- infiltrate perhaps call a favor the trouble is once it becomes a problem it continues to be a problem until you cut it off at the root or like pike i may-- well i'm tempted to head downstairs to have a drink start scoping out and see who might know what's what about that prison no or we could just not talk about it and see if anyone actually notices just see if anyone's going to be rude about it shiny fingernails that's 12 i'm so excited to hell what voice is this this is your leader voice on the plus side we're all very tired now it took us quite a while to find this place i follow him no he already went down all right we grab him drag him back in maybe flip flip sides just keep flipping the sides we might have to (inhales nervously) it's you know what's-- no i don't want to say what's the worst that could happen what's the best could happen what's the best outcome here yes probably the two of us possibly yes grog i'm perfectly content to just go down there and if anyone asks we've just changed into something more comfortable let's go i'm going to be totally okay i don't think i-- do you think with the capsule or without i don't want to-- fine with i grab a soul shard i suck it down (sniffs) oh let's do this and we head down (inhales) let's do this sucked it down like an oyster huh too much little much yes little bit i'm going to be meditating upon that a little bit later let's head downstairs i walk over (clears throat) could i possibly entertain you with some company that sounds lovely what is actually available at this hour at this establishment i would be curious i would hate to be indebted to you at this point but i would be very curious to try whatever it is that you consider to be your personal stash what may i call you ah freddie will do for now broke the dm ten points boom (laughter) honestly cards on the table we're in town because a friend of ours got in badly with a rakshasa we figured not and we're definitely out of place a bit out of sorts and definitely out of our depths but thank you for the rooms i assume this is your establishment is it not i think i understand take another sip ah well regardless of betters or otherwise i'm grateful for the sanctuary all of us are so we i assume are not the first people you've met coming into town looking for a rakshasa well i will admit we have some questions we've heard of a-- would you call it a prison an underground series of cells beneath the tower beneath the tower beneath the city that's where we think we might find our boy you know it well i would hope not from personal experience i understand a very very great one there is a prison underground people go there perhaps this is an easy question to ask that will flow freewy-- freely what is this why do people get sent to that prison what are you in the market for i have dull things but i get the distinct impression you're not necessarily somebody who's going to be interested in coin i understand how do i know that what you have to offer is worthwhile i have a proposal obviously we're interested in the prison we're interested in somehow getting into the prison or possibly getting our problem out of the prison i'm not saying that we're looking for some sort of grand mastermind or otherwise but if you feel that you're the sort of person that would have enough information in this direction of how one might get access to the prison or otherwise and get out with their skin intact-- at least most of it-- or the sorts of people who would be interested in helping such an adventure go forward that would be worth our while and interesting i don't think i've had enough and i hope-- if you're willing that if we decline your offer i hope you will take no offense that's fair is he a pit fiend of course this is a fair offer i will quietly without naming names of any kind confer with my compatriots and we will give you a yes or no without naming names of any kind before we leave and just as a personal favor i've been touched by a demon before by a creature does it show here can you see i'm going to pull hex up on myself i'm thankful my last question this taskmaster of yours the name you gave me is it his true name one would hope would have made our job much easier fair we will meditate upon it i will not speak your name in public i will not speak your name in private to be honest you'll just be our friend downstairs for now we finish our drinks keep an eye on the door see if that strange dwarf-like creature shows up all right well the rest have to do the-- no we're going up that's fair let's head upstairs (laughter) we head up well our friend downstairs says be careful of what you talk about out loud it's pretty standard probably in here well it's pretty typical i definitely would recommend everybody not use their real names that's something i should've pointed out earlier nothing here is using its real name i didn't but i asked him some other things i don't think it matters either well there's a prison underneath the city our friend says he can probably very likely get us in there and get us close enough to deal with our problem i believe him it's the typical catch we have to do him a favor or he'll arrange for us to be arrested no someone else whose name i will not say out loud for now yes well-- how do we ever do anything (laughs) sure yeah it's really actually quite convenient that there's no such thing as the right thing to do it just sort of takes so many things off the table here no the rock is probably the most innocent person that you're going to throw it would be a contract we would be-- everything here is a contract he would not be signing the contract barry barrington chin up barry (laughs) (chuckles) it's better than-- -- perry paddington barry paddington is actually-- has got a nice ring to it and greg it's not really it's a bit of it it's off d-roll's fine just don't use any real first or last names nothing you would sign to a piece of parchment i feel good about it i feel like it's a terrible idea i would just confirm with someone of reason that we're to do this and get arrested for it or we're to do this and otherwise-- well we can't can we i didn't agree to that well look at where we are to be fair i sort of knew we would have to do we just want to get arrested or do we want to actually end up where we need to be i get the distinct impression that most people here are painstakingly honest which is the horrifying thing about a place like this i think that they-- that there's a lot of lying by omission well imps imps you can't think they won't notice that you're an imp that doesn't belong to anybody crappy and then back into something awesome so do we say yes to this well what else are we going to do i say yes no once we kill this thing we plane shift out of here faster than you can say-- oh oh we're-- that we'll confirm with our friend that we'll confirm with our person and seem like i don't want to use that term too loosely we'll see what would be most advantageous for getting what we want out of this situation pit fiend-ish no all of us all of us we're going to kill this thing-- it will quite possibly be a magic contract we're going to ask him this downstairs i just want to take it to you and see if everyone thinks that we're going this direction we'll make the most comfortable deal we can but honestly i'm very curious if anybody has any better ideas full-frontal assault on a demon prison in the basement of-- lava i figure-- well if we're going to do this i think we should do it quickly it might what level are you casting locate creature at will that work on him okay i was curious if he has a blind spot or not it's all right turn into an imp fair one day fucking hell is right stretching yeah i love hells man oh no or that okay we can leave them here now my vibe is it didn't burn you've got to do something about that that's becoming a problem i think they're going great
