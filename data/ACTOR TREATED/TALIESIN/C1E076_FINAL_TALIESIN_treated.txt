i can confirm that that is indeed-- it's my favorite shirt 18 it's not good for me okay i'm going to look out the door what do i see when i look out the door i'm going to take some shots from inside the mansion at the pit fiend and then i'm going to duck away from the door again i'm not going to step out of the doorway i'm going to step in i'm in the doorway still very specific about that here we go first shot oh before i do anything i'm going to cast hex on the pit demon giving him a strength disadvantage and here we go first shot oh god don't do anything stupid okay that's fine 22 to hit i am so not together that's not bad that's 15 points of damage plus six points of psychic plus four points of necrotic damage 15 plus six plus four next shot let's go sharpshooter see what happens yay 26 to hit i'm shaking more than normal oh that's good oh shit that's really good holy fuck that's a percy roll 26 points of damage four points of psychic damage and six points of necrotic damage that's stacking i'm not breaking it up all of these are stacked because i don't know if the necrotic and the psychic are doing full damage to him so i'm trying to break them up for you i'm going to do that again (laughs) and here we go for the final roll for this attack pew pew and that's again that's really good that's 29 to hit i do not do that crit thing now not yet this is also good that's 28 points of normal damage five points of psychic and three points of necrotic 28 points of normal damage five points of psychic damage three points of necrotic damage and now i'm going to hide behind i'm going to like spin around and get inside the doorway and back the fuck off oh throw it at me okay pick carefully they are pick carefully the only thing i knew you'd love don't you dare pin that on me don't you fucking dare that was definitely a nice one that you found they get way worse that's actually really good and technically me don't make that face check or saving throw he's high enough up in theory he can't reach he can't see it against the south wall of that little building oh boy okay okay fine first thing i'm going to do is tell the servants get these children out of their chains you either hide or help don't care turning around out of the room you're just doing this to touch my hair lord so i'm going to come out of the door take a look around see him and i'm taking a shot at-- no i'm curling around the door yeah i see him i'm going to take a shot to try and drop him i'm going to do a wing shot burning grit normal shot natural 20 that was the wing shot it doesn't matter it doesn't affect the wing shot well no the shot still does damage but he still has to do a strength saving check no that's a strength check i can't find the dc where did the dc go 50 no it's not 50 i think the difficulty i can't find it but i think it's 18 okay i'm sorry i'm so confused here they are so double damage so that's 18 22 points of normal damage of piercing damage three points of necrotic damage two points of psychic damage i'm going to try another shot to bring him down same thing oh actually that's a natural so i don't even burn any grit i'm going to try and bring him down again that's 25 and that's not the right dice to roll hold on wow i'm really out of it here we go that's 14 piercing four psychic six necrotic 14 four and six altogether then one more attempt to bring him down to earth here we go that's 21 to hit can you switch dice that would be cool oh that's awful nine points of normal damage three points of necrotic three points of psychic and bonus round i reload and i'm going to finish running to the other side of the-- yeah and just hiding against the wall there not even-- just by the fruit by the fruit cart next to the barrel of ugh there's not much i can do so i'm going to run towards that next set of buildings and recover next to the fountain that you can't see nope the other way yep i'm going to burn the whole thing and then see that fountain right there full movement okay not that far the other side of the fountain i'm hiding in that corner that actually-- did that burn my action actually how far could i have gone without burning my action i'm so sorry no that's fair i'm just trying to get somewhere wait wait (mumbling) she's not fine but she's not down that's a great idea he's that close already you know there are actually chapters by-- oh boy okay oh this is so bad all right this is such a phenomenally interesting disaster no okay i've got some plans i'm going to-- okay i'm going to try and get him to drop his ah fuck yeah fuck it i'm going to get him to drop his mace so i'm taking that shot with sharpshooter actually no you know what no just straight clean yeah that'll do 24 that's a strength save against i believe 18 oh yeah no i don't even know why i bothered but at the very least that is ten regular points of damage two psychic damage and six necrotic damage i'm going to yeah i'm going to hold off on that for a little bit i'm so horrified by this entire-- i'm going to take another shot at him straight with sharpshooter nope that goes really really poorly that misfires and i take ooh yeah no this may work okay i take six points of psychic damage so i take six points of psychic damage and i scream they're mad i'm mad we're all mad it's driving us mad help us help us all and i scream holding my head and running into the door seeing if i can fake out the djinn to thinking that maybe things are a little complicated do i get advantage on that it was actually rather pleasant i have to admit it you have very soft hands fix right now no he's already burned his attack of opportunity oh yes they would something missed it's so nice as far as i know its reaction its single reaction-- we've probably i imagine been narrating an awful lot of what's going on through the headpiece well maybe not i was going to say she was yelling-- well fuck i've lost my list of healing potions but i think i had a minor potion left i am inside i'm going to grab a potion from-- i was about to say i know i have one but everything got fucked we restocked right before we went i'm going to feed her a potion for my move feeding her a basic all right do i still have movement okay that's five no weird question how far away is vex from the door okay i'm going to use half my movement to get to vex if this can be done i'm going to burn my action surge and grab her the rest of my movement to drag her into the hole 15 more feet 15 and 15 that'll do no she's in striking distance of the asshole i'm getting her out of striking distance of the asshole okay that's my move even though she was conscious when she got bitten at least we all see that so we now know what to do oh fuck all right the only thing i could think of mythcarver is a 1d8 and a 1d6 plus three yeah this doesn't feel fair please make a deception check i'm going to finish dragging her in so that we can fix this so no i'm so sorry i'm going out of turn then i'll wait i'm going to hold my turn to wait for the efreet to encounter scanlan that's why i'm holding my turn if you can make this go away i will be very happy yeah have you looked at the table of contents yet you should look at the table of contents it'll make you really happy that's my favorite chapter i just want to double check i still have my attack though so i can actually hit him and-- i'm going to saunter over to the pile of ash and see if there's any proof that i can grab that we took care of this was he wearing a leather thong kind of thing with a flap because i feel like i could really-- okay go look to see if there's anything left and let's all take a short rest and then go back fully healed oh and short rest which means i get all that back and i get that back do ranged attacks also have advantage oh so you grab something and we start whaling on it from a distance yes no this is definitely for me how do you feel about snow well that will do then he's going to drink all of the beer if you don't stop you're welcome and yes that was weird for me too just weird right now yes thank you but it's weird we have the necklace died in disgrace as well plot to overthrow the sultan faster than a speeding loot crate what it gets better it gets better unconsciousness one time a day that's nuts that we know of may i also recommend that we leave the children out of that room we're about to head home and we want to make sure that you know that we have not forgotten that we're indebted to you and that we plan quite possibly if it's amenable about contracting you for services in the future as well in your more common field it's not like it's going to help i like him let us be off then you'll most likely be hearing from us as well yes he does quite good work i may have a thing i'm giving it some time i'm working on a commission it's going to be lovely it's going to be a surprise all right fine if we survive this we're going to have killed five dragons so what a lovely thing it would be to have something built from the scales of five dragons we would be the only people on the plane to be adorned with the scales of five dragons yes that's exactly-- and ray-bans i think if we survive this i think we all should be given something beautiful also perhaps adorn the castle with a few of them as well i love his work we'll be in touch consequences and cows playlist on friday
