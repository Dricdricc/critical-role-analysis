oh no it's called malibu sunset that would work on me your other friends tell me that they miss you too so yeah yeah we had the very first episode of the wednesday club this week i have now had eight hours of sleep which is pretty magical it was fun and we're gonna be back this week with our next episode we're actually gonna be talking about a lot of things including characters with mental health issues in comic books both superhero and otherwise including legion from the x-men who has currently got a show on fx which is magical it's so good so tune in it's noon 'til two on wednesdays on the twitch stream where you probably are right now and i think we bumped it to alpha but i don't remember maybe not and then it'll be on the rebroadcast if you wanna see it but it's gonna be a lot of fun matt key and amy dallen will be there it's gonna be great it's a rainstick i've got a little bit of sketching and working on something simple that i might even try and build while i'm here stephen king novel oh yeah no i wanna see what he has too like there's gonna be some trading i'll show stuff oh yeah are you really i'm gonna grab bad news and run up to the crow's nest and see if i can see anything make some room in here what is my perception that's 20 i'm gonna keep an eye out for a moment for a little bit she doesn't have to know what sailors actually do keyleth ask the captain if she wants to have extra speed from your wind the captain yes this got weird quick yeah sitting and sketching looking out every now and then quite nice wow no to be fair i'm not really looking very much 11 i'm distracted you're less distracted wait what just having a chill it's just to chill up there it's nice you're just sitting and drawing in a basket yes it's basically a hamper oh my god that got dark i'm used to this enough i know how to make room from last time i was on a boat it's moving not a bad idea everybody keep checking in oh you sound like kim carnes everybody this is great (all laugh) are you with me i'm going to very quietly say that i'm going to grab onto your broom and head towards that end i'm also going to activate the spider climbing boots fog machine oh ow yeah no that's right it's the little prongs oh please oh please i'm gonna be in the middle of this for months i'm gonna be right in the middle of this for months okay did it leave a little stain whoa i don't feel good about that this is like the finest arcade that i've ever been by or actually we had sort of headed towards the other boat i was gonna ask you to drop me at the other crow's nest on the other ship if you're down oh please tor books tor books (all laugh) oh boy 15 burn drop off as long as you roll by i'll just let go you can drop me off the minute i see a rope i'll just let go and drop so she can just keep moving you know you could've spent your time making two very complex lego pirate ships all week i'm just saying (exhales) got it not sure what to do hey that die okay i'm gonna take a quick look around to see if i can figure out what's causing this fog because it's annoying me that's a 19 starboard port all right somebody take a look at anything there's a glow coming from the starboard side of the enemy ship it's the one closest to our ship we need to find out what's causing this fog in the meantime i'm gonna slowly make my way down a couple of the ropes is that an enemy right there that guy yeah i know i'm asking if that's an enemy on our ship right there okay so we have two enemies that are currently on their ship okay i'm gonna slowly start making my way just maybe a few feet down and i'm going to shoot those two people who are on the very edge both of them in the back no there is on the other hand fine comedy about to happen i'm gonna very very carefully and i'm at disadvantage with this oh that's annoying okay i'm gonna use the pepperbox the animus and i'm also going to burn a grit for a push what about one on each both of them i'll start with the first one and work my way down all right so let's see what happens that will do that's a 28 and that's-- i'm sorry you know why i'm a little confused i just had to switch again that's wow-- -- that's good that's 17 points of damage and five points of psychic damage and he goes ten feet away from me (laughs) next i love boats yep here we go that's oh that's good 29 i'm rolling really well not as well as yesterday but really well and that's five six that's 11 points of damage and five points of psychic damage and a ten-foot push i was just gonna say he's happy to grab and i'll deal with that too i can make him drop things i have that power i've been wanting to watch somebody holding on and make them drop it i've been wanting to do that for like probably a year and a half now god is there anybody fun on our side you've got him grappled technically i would that would cancel out wouldn't it it would cancel it out automatically oh in that case i'm gonna take a shot on him okay good point so i'm gonna take a sharpshooter shot i'm also going to-- is he holding anything that's good and he's a magic yeah that will do i'll just take a good old-fashioned sharpshooter shot so that's-- that's not as good that's 18 to hit oh thank god okay well they were a little-- that's kind of heavy that's gonna be 24 points of damage and three points of psychic damage yeah and i'm just gonna crawl a couple feet into the ropes in that direction i'm just gonna keep rope-swinging there we are it might have stuff we're gonna want to break the chains that's the correct response oh man they're really fun yeah i like it i know that's good (gurgling) knees not back god robot good i've been waiting for this so for pretty much a few months all right we're fine i've been waiting for this for so long super soakers oh yeah oh yeah all right that guy's still in the vines right he's becoming a problem though okay i'm going to if i can pull this off is it possible that i can break the rope that i'm currently holding onto and do a little errol flynn like fly down to the bottom of the boat is it possible that the rope i have to shoot is in between me and him i'm going to use a piercing shot and i'm going to try to do both with one shot and errol flynn this shit acrobatics that's a 23 still at disadvantage nope so this is gonna be funny because i was using the animus so depending on how mean you wanna be here i'm gonna take my 2d6 yeah so this is gonna be funny i'm gonna take my 2d6 and that's six points of psychic damage to me that's cool that's cool yes so does the psychic damage mean i let go of the rope i'm holding on to or does it not also my feet are sticky and my hand has-- but my hands are not okay i'm down for this so that's an eight here's the next question do i have any chance of grabbing anything with my hands and feet on the way down so i'm just gonna wake up on the deck of the floor of the boat 12 points of bludgeoning damage and can i burn a bonus action am i okay or-- i can use the rest of my actions just because it hurts and i'm irritated i'm just gonna pull out retort and fire in the general direction yeah oh that's not bad 28 16 okay so the 28 one does though that's seven points of damage oh yeah what a turn what a terrible way to go kind of like fantasia how many do you need and that was the last anyone saw of taryon darrington (all laugh) it was worth it good it's a d6 there is actually a d3 that has two ones two twos and two threes the water elemental's still a problem i take it i'm going to stand up dust myself off pull out bad news take careful aim-- slightly irritated aim at that water elemental and see what happens disadvantage on the shot not yet i'm actually going to spend a grit to gain my advantage back come on thank god i didn't do that too weird that's 20 i'm also gonna blow through most of cabal's ruin 'cause that's funny i know i say that a lot so that's standard damage is 15 points of damage plus where is-- okay 1d6 per charge you know let's end this should we just end this i figured it would be i'm just gonna blow eight of the charges so do you have five more-- so plus (counting) 23 points of lightning damage on top of that i'm going to stop i'm going to wave and i'm going to go walk over and start looking to see if i can see what that glow is i'm going to deactivate this because i want to loot this ship ooh that's better that's 25 does there seem to be any mechanism for turning it off or otherwise i'm going to at least try and pick it up and-- okay that's adorable three that's so mean (all laugh) there's no way to-- there's gotta be a way to turn this off oh god like a spigot (sings) it's rainin' men let's get the orb at the very least doing it now-- yes we want to it now while there's an order of operations based on a die roll (sings) and i would do anything for love oh that's me see if we can grab the orb i'm gonna run downstairs and see if i can see paperwork in the captain's quarters or anything-- or run in the captain's quarters and just do a massive loot really just as quick as i can well there might be something magic okay my investigation check is 19 yeah any papers i'm just gonna grab i'm looking more for magic i don't care about gold-- magic or weird catch the eye are the keys like-- oh no okay yeah i'm gonna grab them anyway i hope you pull something in your knee god damn it no let's keep it let's bring it to the other ship i'm gonna run out there's-- oh man i don't hear anything coming from down below do i yeah i don't know hold on i'm gonna listen for it perception check you're terrible 17 i show the keys i'm worried there's a cage down there i still have the spider boots so i'm holding on you've got an elven perception check i'm gonna hand her a bunch of stuff including some of my things and be back-- i'm gonna try and see if i can just-- spider-boot and see if i can hold my breath and look i'm gonna grab and try and use the lenses on my mask to even get a clear shot of what's under there get out of here you two i'm fine vex is here you two leave yeah that's what i'm hoping for that's 26 i'm going for it i've already got the keys in my hand and i'm just going to start going for it i'm going to choose to use a resolve that's a save isn't it god damn it i rolled a one okay i'm rolling there's someone in there but i can't get it and i'm going to spider-climb on the upside on the wrong side of the wood and stay out of the water and crawl out i don't know what to do and i'm running out i don't know what else to do there's someone in a cage i don't know what to do i have the keys but none of them were working i grab can i make a jump to grab my dexterity-- save or check they're both the same it doesn't matter 22 yeah i fell off a boat different boat ship insight 19 tell me friend why did they keep you alive it is what did they ask you i think that's a great idea that's going to be a while any tattoos on him any i'd recognize i was on a boat for quite a while as well it was a long time ago all right let's say 18 huh okay what was your captain's name i was just curious how quickly you'd answer it it's fine carry on you will be getting food don't worry this is not us being threatening we're just it's odd finding a man in a cage in the bottom of a terrible ship filled with awful people that alone makes us like you but you are a bit weird it is true we don't mind if you're disreputable we just would like to know if you're our kind of disreputable oh boy okay i feel like that's deeply premature immature indeed god that's also true oh yes what sort of business contacts no not really oh we're not-- we don't need that yet where's he going to go one of ours oh okay i-- bangarang bangarang congratulations peter joy sorry cluster no-- well sort of-- not really-- sort of it's complicated we don't pour acid on people-- well that's not true no that's a lie we don't just pour acid on people i feel like that's reasonable to say we don't just pour acid-- -- there's usually context involved things are complicated when it is time to pour the acid we will undoubtedly make sure that you are on the front-- not yet-- -- but you're good we can make the brig comfortable is it a pirating vessel and the tension is relieved the companies themselves have more than one ship if i recall i may have some charts that i stole from the other ship as well sure is this basically like the thing in superman 2 where lex luthor's playing chess-- okay you should identify it i imagine you're sitting here going-- at the very least it could be installed in the ship they could have it as a possible-- i don't know it's not like he's hollow things how big is the orb out of curiosity all right interesting all right does it have smoke inside when you turn it like those weird balls filled with weird sand-- we've been tinkering on the ship so science-bro stuff do we have to tell you what it is so he's got this really cool-- you were very cagey about knowing what it is while we were on break so i didn't know if this was a thing so i've built a couple housings for these opals so you pop the opal in and it will allow it to create either a concentrated beam-- spotlight basically like a little flashlight a radiant beam like a torch-- like a floodlight or while it's on spotlight it's got a little railroad thing it's got a little slot that will go in and give me a little bit of a red vibe so we can have a low-light red light and i'm also going to make a little clip so i can stick it on my gun so i can have a little spotlight on my gun when we're going through a-- hey i'm doing okay just saying percy doing okay and then we have to pop a new opal in but you crack the opal you put it in it's like one hour of either flashlight and then a little blinder to turn it on and off-- it's basically like a little train lantern doing this together that was pretty good i got a 19 and mine's proficiency bonus and dex bonus on top of that 19 so that's 30 so they can-- we may even make a little headband so they can pop it on well there goes our sponsor by hallmark i'll see if i get my charges back we're not hanging out all the time we're being social i'm sorry i'm sorry you guys aren't there i got distracted (snorts) (exaggerated laugh) (all laugh) i get that well i don't know when you were-- we obviously did it i love that so much it's so-- yeah we put the whole thing together the whole thing put together yes come in it's relatively safe (sighs) can i crack one all right we're using one it's his father's money wait (laughs) we put it in the box contain it all right sorry get out it's okay out out out out out and i boot him out oh hi thank god and-- yes dear yes oh yes me too yes okay i'm gonna sit down and open up a bottle the courage i think is long gone at this point i'm going for the tear whiskey fuck it take a swing and i pass i was not in a good place i was-- what i am choosing to describe as great motivation to live a long life there was pain and sound and i've tried hard not to think about creating words to articulate it but it was the feeling of being-- it was not pain without end it felt like pain that would have an end because eventually there would be nothing left of me i felt consumed and yes i heard it was the only thing i heard yes i know you well enough to know-- trying not to embarrass you but-- -- yes well i would've honestly-- i would've never hoped otherwise you're far too wonderful for an idiot so (sighs) but i'm more hopeful i'm not quite as fearful of whether-- i'm worrying less about what may happen when i die again and if i'm going to go back there i hope not either and-- that was quick it was fine but it was quick so i'm not sure if that means anything yet i've overthought this quite a bit and i don't know if you care to hear too many of my fears in this direction but i do think about it where do the people i kill go i know you don't have an answer i don't have an answer either but-- does it or does it depend on me or does it now depend on this thing maybe i don't know maybe i keep feeding it every time-- i don't quite know how to find out other than i had a moment where i thought about shooting someone bringing them back and asking them there was a moment i thought about shooting someone well if it comes to it it's something i've had in my back pocket as killing two birds with one stone that's my thought and i worry about what all of this is doing to us but at the same time i have such faith in-- i have such faith in you and keyleth and occasionally grog and occasionally your brother (laughs) but i'm starting to wonder if this is what all those heroes i read about when i was young if this is what they felt is just a lot of getting very comfortable with not knowing and being nervous and wondering if you're really just the villain of someone else's story but i did hear you sorry to-- i did hear you and sorry that i didn't say i treasure every minute and you remind me to not be so serious i'm not saying that you're not serious but-- (sighs) i'm done with tary for the evening and crossing the whiskey off the inventory (laughs) there is now carpet i'm gonna get on the carpet and offer it to anybody who likes what about the boat with a robot robot in the-- dottie is coming with you doty cannot come on the carpet yeah well have fun more or less nah he's workable and he does know how to use them how did that happen just now how did you just go there we are going to irritate a kraken we are going to make it-- we're gonna bring a bottle of kraken you know what else we're gonna do we're not gonna finish it we're gonna drink most of it but we're not gonna kill the kraken don't kill the kraken good game good game long john silver she's gonna go pirate she's gonna have a patch and a beard-- -- and a peg leg and like a little cuttlefish instead of a instead of a parrot (joins singing) no is that where you have to roll backwards you roll backwards there
