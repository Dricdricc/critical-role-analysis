high-five that was so awkward there's street fighter street fighter gym bag i got my street fighter gym bag i do i got my street fighter bag it was also-- we had a friend who did jack kirby and we got a fight sequence going excelsior it's my last episode of signal boost it's really hard to make those episodes and i have to get on with my life especially when you took four of them on your run i was really angry about that it might be me it's very embarrassed pizza it was a lot of teeth what's a dragon kidney stone worth it might do you know a diamond i said i was going to help with the sword with that process since i've got it-- we'll get some we should get some we'll work on the scales i'm going to need a little bit of that money to fix my gun too which is very broken i don't know how broken it is we need some platinum they're very dirty they smell terrible and-- i think if we ask them they're just going to argue amongst themselves beyond homeless they're going to probably have to run so any money we give them will be money they will use to get out of town to go somewhere else i'm going to take the jug i'm going to put some of the dragon blood that's drying out in the jug and swirl it around a little bit and pour it out it's just blood no a baby comes out now this is your responsibility let's take it to an expert we'll find out later honestly i think just putting it in the biological-- --the bag of colding might be wise i was thinking perhaps keyleth might actually-- yeah keyleth perhaps might want to take this book i am not leading anyone i'm perfectly content with 40 i'm going to sit and try and get my gun working again-- i don't know how i even feel about that i was going to use the workshop that's in the house that's tinkering is plus four plus proficiency bonus plus a d20 if i recall okay that's even better that'll do 20 okay so i'm just down two hit dice lord almighty i thought it was a more expensive gun than that i feel a little better oh that's right it's the cheap gun of the two that was bad news the other gun was working i broke it but it was just jammed bad news was like (creaking) there's a third basement yeah we can all hear you you can't just pick people you are aware of that i'm taking off my glasses and going to go soak in a corner quietly you are the worst of us no i do not cannonball i do not cannonball i can't wear my glasses i'm going to hit something and i'm just going to bleed everywhere fine if there's a dare involved that's completely different did they run out of paint is that what happened i'm going upstairs to get a bottle of raw sodium (laughter) actually i send a servant i tell them what it is i'm not done i'm still working on something i'm working on something you go next i've got a pot and some cloth and a whole thing-- i'm ready i've got a kettle-- (laughter) okay cool i grab the kettle i put it to my chest i take a run and i leap into-- not acrobatics athletics 23 should have mostly directed down but i'm aware that some-- now if you'll excuse me i need to sleep off this spa (laughter) got plans for one of them-- leaving a little trail of blood all the way down the corridor (laughter) don't you mean that's fowl (groaning) there's chicken wow a grecian urn of mayonnaise you'd need to use a stepping stool to do it but you could actually i might take it high ground is occasionally very useful for me and i'm not that strong to be fair it takes days it's once a century it works i have a similar book that i used-- that's actually a very fair point i was about to say would you like a manual of quickness here for you-- (laughter) so 99 years from now-- i was holding onto it in the hopes of finding somebody long-lived to sell it to i was thinking perhaps you're not necessarily the person to magically augment your path i had meditated upon the idea for a minute (laughs) at the very least it'll keep him busy for four or five days because you have to read for 48 hours-- and i think there's enough of us that we could all keep each other in check from-- we're going to make sure we walk around the trap that is still active in the front-- ooh can you stone shape something for me i would like to have keyleth stone shape and use one dragon scale if you would be so kind or actually one tooth if that would be all right i would like to leave the vm seal on the side of the cavern and just written in-- what would a dragon understand draconic one down and let's embed the tooth into the rock we might as well i'll take it if no one else does it's sprung we have to pick it up i'm attuning fassbender and working on getting the chain removed from him well i make things they're not-- smithing and gadgetry while i can see how to the layman they look very similar are in fact quite different is this everybody you could round up to get out of the city maybe here's an interesting thing to contemplate about this whole problem is that we have three dragons still at large three dragons who have probably found cities of their own so the chances that they're going to come back and take time away from their own city to go look at one that's in theory already taken over is very thin and if they are traveling then they're going to travel to cities that haven't been plundered yet this is no less or more there's a risk either way it's just the risk of running or the risk of staying which i imagine we're leaving soon anyway if you whisper to grog it's going to make me really happy yes mightily scanlan just found out that kerr has a daughter is what he found out there's the traveling band by the river whitestone is rapidly becoming a very large target someone honest is going to have to come and help divvy it up amongst the survivors how do you get glitter in there it has already been burned down that won't be hard at all i don't think this is a terrible-- i think this is a pretty reasonable idea well this is an unwelcome world at the moment do we need him is he we are under contract technically including a little walk around it's appropriate on occasion to leave people to a modicum of risk life is risky it's perfectly reasonable to send people on themselves they're locals they should know well there's also that group of people wandering around there's that group he was real brave we can build a dragon shelter at the very least that is something we can do they'll do what they're going to do but we can give them an option if things get hairy it's medieval times everybody drinks you sent the last of the decent bards out of town it's all on you i was about to say i was going to join you i've had my fill of party i'm going to join-- what is it about your feelings about vax is that the whole problem right now i really don't-- yes we pretty much are actually i hate to tell you this panic attack i stumble outside for a bit as well at this point no you should try that though see if you like it what did you have to drink last night (snickers) and it will explode your scry pie squatters unpaid now so now they're squatters what are we going to say and if they ask what we think i think something i would like to build-- the death of a city is such a blasphemy it is the murder of the dead and i'm horrified it is not yet which is why-- (sighs) there is no safe harbor right now there is because this is civilization this is-- they might no they might we don't know they will i would hit the city where all the refugees are going because it would hurt more i would not hit the city that's going to take 200 years to be a shadow of its former self i may not have lost an ally but i am a vain dragon building will give them something to do and if the dragon comes back they will be safe underground and if the dragon doesn't we have saved thousands of years of inspiration and life it's-- you can't just abandon something like this there's too much here otherwise it becomes our friend pike from nowhere i'm going to get up on stage the terrible woman may have a point (laughter) (sighs) many of you are going to leave and that's fair and that's right you're free to do so i wish any of us could promise you safety once you leave this city but there is no safety anywhere the dragons fly freely they may come back and wreak their vengeance upon the rest of westruun once again they may not they may find new fresh targets we don't know (long sigh) we will build an underground haven in case of attack free of charge we will make a place that is open to all since there seems to be some dispute about the finances we will create a trust that will be used to help those who stay and help rebuild it will be managed and it will be fair and it will not go to titles if you're properly titled you'll have money elsewhere and you'll figure it out (laughter) new money (laughter) old magic new money from ivory towers i would urge you to stay i would urge you to leave collect your people and return i would urge for one city not to be wiped from the map and anything we can do to make this at least livable while it is rebuilt we will do our best to help (sighs) it is such a victory for them if westruun falls and i sit back down 22 (whispers) i'm that bad the awkward woman makes a fine point pike do you remember that spell you cast on greyskull keep when it got hit by the dragon the thing you did-- was that divine-- that was expensive wasn't it no no no yes we're going to use a previously existing sewer system and we're just going to reinforce it with pillars and then block off any of the sewage and re-route it since it doesn't have to handle the load that it used to we're going to build a vault you're a monster i would like to do a couple things just to the room before we do anything other than this to our houses i would like on one wall to carve the names of every survivor who stayed in the city and on the other wall start-- in draconian (laughter) what we've done to save the city and where the story and where the city came from and what has happened and make a place where other people they can start carving in also the history and everything they need to say about the city just one of the giant walls i just want to start filling in with stories of the city you disagree with my opinions it's not about us how long do you live how long do you think i live no (sighs) i am percival fredrickstein von musel klossowski de rolo iii my ancestry dates back thousands of years and will continue for thousands more unless whitestone falls i live as long as whitestone lives this place is the human soul this is what we have built with our tiny moments to lose a place like this we don't feel it immediately but it would ruin everyone in small ways not all of us are lucky enough to have a lineage in a lifespan which is why we save everyone we can this is good we're doing here this is great good and it's not about idolizing ourselves it's about a very long story which we are even you a tiny part of he'll outlive you right there i give keyleth a little hug at some point we should put a teleport circle in this down here somebody else is going to do this we've got shit to do teleport teleport them there and then they can get back on their own they just killed a dragon they'll be fine what's a bandit going to do you should name the sword number two (laughter) fresh blueberry sherbet to be fair the town you're currently in could be gone next week either way i have a small package and letter that i want to deliver to kerr before we leave but other than that yes i was hoping i was really hoping someone would say that we've made you something if you will accept it we pull out a small wooden box that we put together you sick fuck you're amazing talk westruun to me too soon inside is a scrolled parchment a wooden bracelet and a metal circlet (water bottle falls off the table loudly) trying to have a moment thank you the parchment will explain everything and how to use them but this circlet and this bracelet will help make you a champion that can help protect this city now and should the need arise this circlet will give you control of the body of a creature that will help the circlet will if anything if the need ever arises it will be something that will help protect the city the scroll will explain the particulars i've already moved him it's in the scroll i watch awkwardly oh dear i can be right every now and then yes please oh that's why if emo elf is going to vasselheim we're going to vasselheim i have things i can do in vasselheim no there's actually things that can be done in vasselheim i walk away to outside a building in vasselheim it's rude we're a real twitch stream what's that web address again
