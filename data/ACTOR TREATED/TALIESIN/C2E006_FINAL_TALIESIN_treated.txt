aw damn it i did it callous 25 hit points already done right there a level three blood hunter earth elemental oh no wait wait wait no leave it put it back i want to do this properly lift lift lift (laughter) i'm actually really impressed with this fucking character callous it's good for your back it's really true pillow (laughter) no everything's fine they just do what they need to do i just have to keep them clean i have to take care of them or else they'll stop working of course they do actually yeah i've got to feed them some well-- it's complicated i don't like to go too deep into it but i've got to use my bloodline on occasion actually since we're already on the road i should be honest i wasn't entirely telling the truth when i talked to you that night oh you're just a bundle of truth too aren't you i suppose it's only fair i did tell you that these swords are special and that they use the blood of my family to activate themselves i know i might have said i was from a long line of priests and-- i didn't kill my whole family our family were less the priests and more the sacrifices we may have stolen the swords and run that's why i've been trying to keep a bit of a low profile when it comes to some of the authorities it's been a long time but i'd rather not run into them oh i couldn't tell you it was my parents i was just wee by the time that happened oh i hope not i mean it's been a long time my parents never spoke of it somewhere out east well it was a bit of a mess but i just ended up there eventually just looking for a place where i could rest i suppose well i don't know you that well that requires a drink it's a good place to be if you want to run but not run not that i've ever met you know i don't know i never thought to ask apparently they needed us alive for it so there was that so i was told it's not that bad though it doesn't leave a mark really oh yes of course it can come in handy oh yes of our bloodline apparently well i've cut a lot of people with them would you like to take a run at it you could be lucky i had a funny feeling could've been worth five copper on the open road at one point always could use a circus geek that is a question how do we get paid there was talk of pay i've got to say there's worse ways to make a living nott the gnoll killer i don't recall making that arrangement you're so good at this oh yeah more donut for us it's a very long barn he seemed nice last night i'll follow for this yes please i'll go in for this if it means a faster breakfast wow that's an in-joke i want to see if i see this i don't do i oh yeah i definitely don't see this the frittatas are going to taste real weird i'm going to walk over need a hand we were part of this commotion last night we were wondering if you need a hand with anything right now i'm taking off my jacket you going to rebuild give him a fine plaque or as another thought since you were basically robbed who were they what happened has this happened before we're all going to die now you had a lot of meat didn't you would you say that you offer a larger selection of meat than some of the other establishments in town i feel like i've been robbed of the experience of your fine fine meat products and i for one would like you to rebuild so that i might try some of your meats i'm going to take a look-- is the friend who's dead skeletonized oh burnt okay where is this butcher that you mentioned as well i think you were in the barbecue shack it's like half a question because you're wondering why it's called that at this point at least wide that's an idea don't pack up shop just yet we're going to see if we can do something about these terrible creatures that have been roaming around we are perhaps persons of action she really will it is a gesture like prince when did we hire tom stoppard to write this i couldn't deal i feel like that was worth pointing out tiefling thing it's new then it seems from what we've seen that they were hungry i can understand that i always love a ruin do i know anything about yeenoghu a religion check 18 thank you one last quick question though what do the gnolls normally eat those buffalo creatures that we see roaming around good to know i'm filing i'm putting a wall between that you're just made of secrets aren't you just made of secrets do you need more copper are you all right okay because i'll give you two copper if i get one of those pickles i pass him the two copper i know this may be a stretch but do you have maybe any healing potions or anything like that or maybe-- this might be weird-- some kind of poisons maybe for dealing with pests on a farm that sort of thing think that will work on a gnoll stuff is stuff it's bad for anybody i guess how much is it what would that really-- if i were to drink that right now what do you think that would do to me wow really do you know about these sorts of things that's very impressive it was i ate mine it was quite good now we're just sharing the juice at this point juice is great i asked that yeah i did ask that wait the crownsguard really we should ask bryce for some healing potions take the cart and get some meat from the butcher it'll take a while to make the signage alone that's fair we could also see what they still have at the butcher's or we could see what else they still have at the butcher's there's a butcher well we just heard that he might-- extremely tactile we're going to go get a horse you don't need to be here for that let me tell you reggie it would be the best deal you could possibly make i'm going to use charm person thank you ignore her she's very difficult you're a hero thank you i hand him a silver also you said silver and we're being fair if we come back it comes back would my hunter's bane be useful for that for tracking these creatures since they technically have some undead around them just a standard one standard survival check all right 17 in theory am i actively tracking these creatures the undead at least i'm curious how much of this hunter's bane i can actually be using right now he's sorry that was nausea should we what does blessing of the trickster do i have advantage on smealth that's great on smealth he who smealth it we wouldn't have to kill the horse we could just send the horse-- sure recon answered my question i was curious what flanking was that helps 16 i'm quietish i'm going to draw one of my swords and just out of experiment try and get it to do that weird thing it did yesterday with my hand i'm going to stab the third one i'll take my run first that's a-- wow 17 my brain that's seven points plus three radiant am i close enough to hit the third one that's still left with my second attack nein good shot i'm also going to point out they hadn't been eating the hyenas anyway so maybe leaving bodies of their pets is not the greatest idea that might be a smarter way to go oh dear i'm going to keep a hold of my sword but i'm going to wrap it in the coat so it's not glowing ridiculously mm-hmm with advantage survival check marisha and yours was hand-crafted i miss being low enough level that we just take everything we find no matter how useful we're going to be cracking open clay pots should i give it a little light or no that was so painful there's limits no oh wow punch him in the balls i think we might have lost the element of surprise i also uncover my sword at this point which gives off a little bit of light i've also got a distance attack i'm going to use devil's tongue on the one that just survived your hit i'm going to use vicious mockery in infernal you will feed the dogs in hell it takes 1d4 psychic which is three points of psychic damage and has disadvantage on its next attack put them in the jar laura and --is now an ear jar we look at the rope connected to the log i was helping can i make a knowledge test to see if i would know what this is well is this intelligence or what would this be i'm trying to think-- i might have come across this just an intelligence check i'm trying to remember 11 we can put them aside we will be bringing them out of here (whispering) human want a lantern i haven't lit it yet you can light it i'll help i'm one-handed so i can't really help you light it anyone watching at home the physics was really demanding on that one well before we do that we should remember to check for traps maybe i certainly can't no i can't i can't do any of that i won't be able to find them so true were there any traps hear hear unless they knew that you would think that trap trap do i still have advantage that's okay nine this is getting ridiculous we know they go down very quickly we can see now or try the other way the longer we wait the more things are coming be helpful i'm going to creep out against the wall closest to me and try and hide in one of these coves over in the corner as far as i can get into the-- since i'm too far away for anything too crazy i don't have a good bonus action i will use my devil's tongue i'll use vicious mockery on the gnoll that's currently in between-- not the one that's-- actually the one that's furthest from us because he's going to be the archer and in infernal i'm going to say i'm too disgusted to think of anything clever so yeah that's three psychic damage and he has disadvantage on his next attack natural 20 23 i was 23 god that's awful i'm going to get a little-- oh can i do this no i can't do that fuck i know i'm so sorry i should have my shit together how far (counting) oh god that's too far to walk i'm going to try and get one little crevice actually i'm going to hold my position i'm so sorry hold my position and use one more tongue on one of the other guys oh so no (coughs) and i'm holding does it hit the ball bearings oh okay i like to think that your lollipop makes candy crush sounds when it hits people you lost a gnoll there no you've got a gnoll you should have that looked at it's so hardcore i support no advantage for engagement i'm going to run up to these two and join the fray up here first i'm going to take a swing at the big guy that's 16 to hit and that's-- just using my normal one for this one that's eight points of damage bonus action with the glowing sword goes down into the hyena that's an 11 to hit all right and that's eight points of damage no this one was the glowing one oh it was my main hand oh okay i didn't know how that that would have been four i would have flipped them if i'd known i was going to say i would have flipped them if i had known i was going to hit the one that didn't have much left sure i'll do it reverse next time blood maledict on that fucker yeah that don't hit i'll also say i think we-- oh no that's right you're double i can see this is going to end up with an office parkour gif in your future you just slap him in the face he can't run anymore that's so cool that spell is so cool does fjord get an attack of opportunity on it that hits i'm definitely going to take an attack of opportunity on that one 14 is this main hand eight points of damage at disadvantage i'm going to run down the stairs the opposite direction from the ball bearings i'll see where i can get if i can get 30 feet i'm going to also use vicious mockery again and yell shut up already dc on that it just says wisdom saving where is my spell dc well it's weird i'm not a spell-- my charisma modifier is zero this is amazing no you'll still get disadvantage now you've got advantage cheers i also like the idea of maybe giving the healing potion to the healer can you heal yourself without the potion oh well all right then that didn't really occur to me well they make a lot of noise they may not have noticed i'd also like to join in on that with a religion check the cult of yeenogru mr magoo well you know fake confidence how are you feeling fjord i'm not convinced that they don't still have people alive down there let's make a pile of these bodies too just in case maybe they think that they took each other apart on the way out i agree all right yoplait it's hard to remember it's a lot of aggression anger do i remember anything about either gender or that this would be-- other than i just saw a lot of aggression and a feral aspect of this shall we go find out filled with pickled ears have you ever had pickled pigs' feet they're in their own juices
