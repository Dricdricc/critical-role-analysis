we're cool i don't know somehow no new information yet still tmi it might be one last quick glance around the room to see if there's anything helpful i hand it to her without even thinking about it (gasps) you're a genius i'd be very impressed if there was you can scry i'm going to take a quick look around quickly quickly investigation or it doesn't matter that was a terrible roll clues objects i'm basically doing the standard police tumble i'm tossing the place i rolled a nine yes yes yes better to do that in here than outside secret passage can you find her without her knowing talk to her employer so they know it wasn't us it's the place that she knows we are already she knows exactly where we're standing anywhere we're holding the bloody gun not that i really was aware i didn't know her that well nothing complex she is like me let's head back to the tavern we have more than one room right can we leave the gun with trinket in the other room that's precisely why i want to leave the gun with trinket in the other room it's not loaded it's all right it's so complex to make it work it's fine it would be very funny but-- we're going to leave it with trinket in the other room for the moment and we're going to discuss things leaving it under the bed with a bear in the room i think we need to tell her employer that we are not responsible as we were the last people to attempt to employ her suspicion automatically falls on us and we need to let them know immediately that it was not us fucking method bless you i think the question is do we tell them and see if we can enlist some help with this now or wait until after we know-- do we get any help before we do that though from her employers figure out where she's going what she's doing how many of them all these things i'm sorry that's what i'm worried about i have another option i have another option we still have her notes we still have her notes it is her diary notes of how to build my gun her notes let's be safe you've literally just grabbed my hand and are yelling into it do you know where she is she's heading for an island though an island of glass trees yes yes it would take way too much time we are on a schedule but we might be able to take them from her and perhaps even finally put her down before she puts more of those bloody things into the world sure i don't-- i spent less than a week in her company in my life i know very little about her other than-- i spent a week in her company and i spent i don't know how much time trying to track her down and all i really know is she's very smart and she is the worst person i've ever met people don't frighten me he doesn't frighten me i don't even know if she wants anything maybe she wants nothing yes very much so i made a terrible trade i made the wrong trade and i made a terrible decision i know that (laughter) let me get this enchantment off my gun let's find somebody who can pull it off and put it onto something else and leave it here and then let's run screaming to this island and see if we can catch her and if she's not there we spend 24 hours where i will recount every desperate attempt i have made to try and kill her in the last few years of my life and then we head back and deal with the other monstrosities that are waiting for us back home in three days but where do you rest in the-- also if we can find a way to teleport to the island if there's a way that we can we can keep scrying until we see a tree here's the terrifying notion if you see a tree in any of your scries can you teleport to it so as long as she gets next to a tree-- once she's on the island if the island has a tree laura and we're going to be looking for her that's where i would set up shop if i were-- that is deeply assuming that it actually conveys sound which it may not yeah we're going to have to move that enchantment onto something else i know what he wants no absolutely not he wants the green gems and i'm not prepared to make that deal it's not going to work yes here's the question and this is what i've been thinking about sitting here for the last few minutes is either way this is terrible either we don't tell them and leave town and eventually they find her and she's got strange holes in her from some strange thing that could possibly be a thing that a man with white hair who breezed through town a week ago was holding or we go and tell them and i cannot believe this is about to come out of my mouth that it wasn't me it was a one armed woman who had-- an identical thank you weapon of this one of a kind weapon that no one bloody saw maybe somebody did see her and maybe they'll know where to get the gun i am keenly aware she's the only person who's ever gotten a good look at it she's the only one she won't a lot of that was instantaneous we did camp three or four days-- so long as we teleport we're fine no we did not in fact it's worse let's go downstairs and talk to her employer i'm going to leave the gun upstairs still there's been a complication the mistress is-- she's been assassinated did we bring the note with us good and the cloak stolen the cloak she wore in her room beneath the house we are very clever but not clever enough to stop this this appears to have happened possibly before we even-- we don't know when it happened it happened a while ago 13 we think we know who did it in fact we are near positive we know who did it and we tell you this as opposed to leaving we are desperate in finding who did this for what it's worth we will not draw first we want to find her have any of your people seen a woman with one metal arm she's so dangerous and now so much more dangerous in the meantime i'd like to at least to start to tell you what we need next for when our story is confirmed this woman has been tracking us she placed a mystical tracker upon us at some point we've just discovered it and we need to find a way to move it away and put it somewhere she does not suspect that we know that she placed it and does not see us coming when it's time for us to kill her yes we believe so always piercing eyes (sighs heavily) that does not make me feel good she is so dangerous it's going to obfuscate any of the scuffle they're only going to find a body with holes in it yes i did point this out to everybody before we came down here but at the moment we were a little bit thrown by the dead woman they will be able to tell the body is at least a week old i'm so sorry if we were smart enough to take care of her and smart enough to pull all of this off this would be a ridiculous move i would beg you to explain why we're having this conversation the woman in question helped murder my entire family took great pleasure and delight in it i have been tracking her for years kill her that's all i've lost my taste for anything beyond that but she is dangerous and she is evil my feelings for her have become very complex i don't care who kills her at this point she just needs to be removed from the earth i don't know what he's wearing but it's very nice i feel very good about that deal let us know what it takes money is money and we have a long way to go and a lot to deal with but we are happy to pay for the work that is done or transportation she's heading she's on a boat she's heading north to the island of-- bay of gifts it's a local joke i'm so sorry we're not asking you we have other friends as well we are looking for speed and a crazy captain or if you were going to go do something like this who would you find in town not full disillusion how about a transference to move the enchantment to another object how much longer that's worth its weight i know i was going to say if somebody wants to go booking passage on an airship my personal feeling is that grog and scanlan would be the people to send on such an adventure i'm only saying grog because then they know what they're getting into no well yes would you rather sit for an hour in here or would you rather go outside and talk to somebody about a giant flying boat i don't know that's my opinion personally unless anybody else-- our friends are going to arrange travel for us the rest of us are going to stay here is that appropriate julius my god i'm pregnant vincent oh wrong one sorry i always thought it was the same guy in my head it's a sequel help help it's actually happening no hold out let's see this is it abbott or costello i'm not sure which wouldn't it be the meat man goeth oh well never mind no this is like the third run six is the double down isn't it six is the double down so roll one more die you're never going to get a kiss i feel a valuable lesson has finally been learned for the first time in this game is he still wearing the disguise is he wearing the hat of disguise so would his head not be necessarily where his-- i will ruin everything i will ruin everything i was really hoping she was going to go away that's all i was really hoping that she was just going to go away every second she's alive is untold damage to the world do you know how every now and then i say something awful i love you both very much for that when i think of that terrible person inside of me i see her face she has a very active imagination she knows how to make these machines and her imagination terrifies me if you knew that that was me would you let me live has she made ten more of these things has she made 100 does she hand them out to people maybe i don't know maybe she's running around and torturing people's parents and siblings to death and then handing them a gun and kicking them out into the world to see what will happen because it could be funny no it's not no i'm not i was so hoping that maybe-- thank you i was hoping something heavy had fallen on her from a great height saving the world a few thousand lives that's really what i'm hoping that may help she is the biggest mistake i've made and i'm horrified by who's paid the price i'm counting to a hundred i'll be fine once we're out of here i'll feel fine once that thing is off my machine i will feel fine and i'm thinking of something else i'm thinking of building something awful to help deal with her i've been thinking long and hard about it i think inevitably anytime i think of something it might be too late i think i'm going to be very careful about what i build i'm going to be very careful about where it goes and i'm also going to ask anybody if-- when i die destroy everything please this is why i don't write down notes any of my sketches they're put away and they're put in a place where i can remove them once the job is done but i sketch my idle thoughts and right now i'm having an idle thought for her and it's simple it's nothing complicated it's just vicious one night of sleep i'll be there that's a terrible thought i know there are things that one day i will speak of that i'm not really ready to deal with yet but i think i may even have something that could help us with the dragons i have a thought i'm going to work on it on our way to the island it will be something that once the dragons are felled i plan on destroying immediately after and i think you'll be all right with it when you see it it's too complicated for any one person to really deal with but i will feel much better if she is in the ground i do i told you my idea of killing all the dragonborn to start a war between the dragons that's why i don't share those ideas i'm not proud of them i hope not but it could it could make it very easy to kill a lot of people let's deal with ripley let's collect a few more things that will help us deal with home let's save home and then i will spend some good time undoing some of the damage that i've done i should have killed her i should have it wasn't i was not being kind i was being selfish i didn't kill her because the briarwoods mattered more to me even though i knew that she was far more dangerous that if they had escaped the world would be darker two more vampires or whatever but she was the genie and i knowingly and very willingly said i'm fine with that and i knew at that moment this was not a thought i had later in my head i went she is going to kill hundreds of people and that's okay right now i think i stumbled into the correct answer i'm not sure i chose correctly i think i got lucky oh i feel absolutely responsible for inspiring a maniac of course i do once i have something drawn i'll show you what it is and i'll have something drawn by tomorrow something simple that is absolutely a promise oh no you'll comprehend it and it's not that i don't think you can comprehend it i know you can it's that i know what it says about me that i even thought it you've been drinking i'm sorry i'm an idiot i'm fond of you as well yes dear thank you i accept that compliment you as well you are a better woman than you believe doesn't feel good does it there you are that's what you get for saying things like that terrible person i'm very excited that's the best thing i've heard all day that captain damon well done that's amazing i wish i could say that once they're here actually yes why not i'm glad that's a thing again i really missed that i suddenly can hear thousands of twitch viewers googling googling like mad all right i have an object-- so hard to talk to that face i have an object that i own that someone is tracking me with they are aware of my whereabouts they've put some kind of enchantment on it i was wondering if i could transfer that enchantment to another object and send it in a different direction so that they don't know that we're following them i would even be willing if possible to remove part of the object that i currently own and then replace it with something else if necessary can i get you a drink are you all right i know there's the mug so i'm going to show him the gun and i'm going to say what do you think and i'm going to show him where the enchantment is we just want to know our options sir and time is sadly of the essence what can you tell us about this yes can they track where we are shh no i'll tell you what you do the work quickly you do the work well and you follow a few other instructions of ours and i will not say her name out loud right now how does that sound to you not anymore we just want the enchantment destroyed and i will not say her name so that she will know that you do not know who she is this is me giving you a deal good sir this is me showing you respect and you if you can hear me and i get the sneaking suspicion you can i'm not ignoring you anymore you wouldn't happen to know where to get some construction materials on very quick notice oh yes go ahead do that and we didn't say your name something simple does the liquid hold its potency or is it just within the tea set good to know excellent i was imagining the fbi agent from the frighteners i was having a lot of that thank you that was very helpful that was very helpful they don't know that we're coming as they don't know how we're going or why because we have spoken all of that outside of the range of that device they don't know any of that all they know is that we found the enchantment and killed it no there will be no more melting of my property for a little while yet i have a bit of a quick shopping list before we head out of town i was wondering if it would be possible to gather some quick supplies if some of your people knew where to get simple construction materials quickly today no yes i need lumber steel lead and a couple other things very simple just some materials i'll show you what i'm building and i'll have you figure out the number loaded straight on the ship that'll do i'm trying to get enough construction material to build a very basic 125-pound mountable cannon that i can move around the ship on wheels and a little bit of shot for a cannon about five pound shot it's simple but it's going to be a son of a bitch --does exist but does something that small that can move around a ship exist this would be something that four people could pick up and move around a base will do and i need to build a thing to build cannonballs i'm good with that 60 gold and then a little extra to make cannonballs and otherwise get them to deliver it to the ship and i'm sending everything to be delivered immediately to the ship everybody this could be part of your problem here it's like you've got amazoncom on your phone and you're going eh eh it's not going to work but oh i hope it does i'm so excited yes we got it for a steal yes we're a bit thinner it has been difficult and we have friends elsewhere preparing for more difficult times are you aware of what's going on across the sea well if you're interested we are definitely moving towards correcting some of these problems quickly is this an insurance thing oh no yes i'm a deep believer in insurance fraud of course tomorrow i don't have a bracelet but i have the pins were the rings up in there did they come back in ah that's my-- i'll put it down okay (whispers) i feel so dirty no no because i'm not going to say that-- it's not true it's not true i feel sick before-- i swear this is important before we say anything we would like to take a moment to meet the rest of the crew to make sure that nobody suspicious has snuck on board and nobody is hiding their identity no good for you excellent and there's no magic attempts to hide somebody's face or anything like that and this is everybody we're looking for a ship called the shrew there is another ship on the way there as well there may be trouble well not necessarily every day we scry every day we hone in we keep following where they're going even a comet wouldn't be enough this is big i'm going to be far away from that then we'll attack them in the night the boat itself there's work that always needs to be done there'll be lights unless they are hiding this might be the best sleep that we've gotten in months at this point like babies i'm going to sit down with a pen and paper ready to write let's use the gun now let's go nuts it's got a lot of her work in it was there anything around could you see the island in sight was the sun with the island or was the sun away from the island is there any way to even know that were they on the north side or the south side i had a plan i'm putting it away trust her she's crazy he's reading he doesn't know he's checking to see if it's a thing you can actually do i'll also say there's nothing a ship doesn't like more than fire we can retrieve it from the bottom of the sea if we have to i don't think they're innocent crew members i think she had help we have ten people 12 people i'm hoping to take care of this before the ship even sinks it's not like there's going to be a dozen of them out here once we're somewhat in the distance fire an eyeball and get a good look at that ship i want to see if it's a trap you have an arrow are we close enough that one of her arrows can make it once we're close enough you can port them down prepare i'm telling the men prepare the harpoons it may be a trap prepare for a hard turn to shore if they begin to show any signs of magical attack i tell the captain no matter what happens use your judgment with any man or sailor who wishes to parlay and come aboard but if any woman attempts to come on board you do not recognize as one of us kill her kill her immediately at the very least check for a fake arm and remove it i'm trying to use the scope on my big on bad news to see if anything interesting is happening on the deck can i see the person who was firing the flares all right they're all below the deck it's a trap let's move away from the ship move toward the beach we're going to sink this ship from a distance i tell them to turn turn now why are they down below there's no hiding in the middle of the ocean that's a death sentence she's still got my gun we are we've got two fliers i'm going to i think it's time we're going to attack them if we can with the bolts if that's possible let's fire they're going to go i'm going to fire on the ship fire on the ship is there any way i could have gotten any of this in my scope 14 yes not cool i'm already shaky today yeah you know what i'll use a grit to deadeye the shot to cancel out the disadvantage that's not bad 24 let me find the correct dice for this 23 points of piercing damage he still got a shot off but it went wild vax keyleth search the ship take anything you think might be hers stay with keyleth check the ship search the ship keyleth search it take the captain's quarters you can breathe underwater tear it apart as it's going down start walking to the beach keyleth get to the beach yes keyleth can you meet up with us at the campfire i am having such a robert louis stevenson moment right now i'm so excited no we did not i cannot imagine that i might actually get four hours of sleep tonight that's amazing
