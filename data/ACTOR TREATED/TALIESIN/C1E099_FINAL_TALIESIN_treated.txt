we're talking about the young avengers this next week we just finished wonder woman it was a great time we wore tiaras and capes and talked matt wore the cape and i wore the tiara it was really good we're going to be talking about the young avengers which are-- you are-- hulkling and iron lad but we're going to be talking about the teenage superheroes of the marvel u specifically the ones who take the avengers name and they're really fun and the modern take on them is really going to be influencing a lot of the stuff that ends up on tv and it's going to be a lot of fun they're some of my favorite books they're badass superman us i might just start shooting there if they keep coming do you have any good terrain modifier something to trash them i do what do we have that's dead in the bag of holding right now let's just start throwing them down some things to eat and i'm going to start making some noise let's fly above it and i'll take a few shots and we'll just start dropping things down i'm going to start making noise and just boom-booming yeah some shots at them as i go we'll throw some meat down there too we can't create chemicals can we we could do shots i'm just kidding we burned through that ages ago what are the chances i have materials for making explosives on me no but like just the materials not the time to make them but just the materials because one of the materials in making tnt is diatomaceous earth and if it's micronized diatomaceous earth that means it's actually an insecticide specifically for hard-shell insects well it's still there it's just been filled in now they can dig extra the etch-a-sketch has been shaken i told you i'm going to steal a sip of the drink i haven't swallowed it i'm just going hmm hmm your house well done i want to see where he's going with this it's got a bar in the middle that is the most brian blessed thing ever you turn around three times it's like comic con all over again did we ever discover whether or not the magic jug does coffee tea charmed let's not get ahead of ourselves but thank you you're not the first man to panic at the loss of his shackles i hope you eventually enjoy the freedom that you've just been given from your legacy i don't know this is a lot it's very impressive well don't expect us to be okay with this that's not going to happen yes well technically there's no more discussion until there's food and caffeine this is madness this is hunger talking we need brunch she can come to whitestone anytime we can make it happen it would have been a very long cloud stride is it even possible to cloud stride plant walk tree trip treecycle leaft sun tree is still doing it the first time three years ago my god it's a shopping episode i'm so excited just appeared out of nowhere we're going to buy so many imaginary things travis no really what is happening what's this all about it's been several years why you should be even vaguely surprised by this reaction is baffling to me excellent carry on keep shopping it's a farmer's market there's a farmer's market i think they're all heirloom tomatoes there's no such thing i assume the castle's going to be doing a run of this anyway but i want to see the trinkets quite impressively actually the theobold festival it's very popular that's very impressive the phrase 'day-drinking' has already come up today lionel is this what's happening right now was trying to ignore it now i'm failing this is your first time being a messenger is it before you were so strangely interrupted you didn't have it did you lionel i have a feeling you're going to get confused even if we call you lionel it's percival it's a pleasure chod hello lionel i'm also going to put out there that we all know we're going to go do this because we're desperate for anything to put off the inevitable goodbyes that we were heading towards so let's distract ourselves for a little bit we'll see if i were to trick us that's how i would trick us quite a bit of practice 25 perception i don't know i'm just looking around no 13 no yes possibly what is it that you want to know yes i am what is this information you don't even need to tell me what it is but that would be worth quite a lot and what you knew would have to be worth quite a lot what is this worth well this leaves me with a bit of a conundrum traditionally when people come either asking to see my designs or if we come across people who have been attempting to replicate them we just simply have them executed on sight traditionally well if i were going to do it it would have already been done now wouldn't it that was a very good threat it was definitely a strong six well this meeting is only happening because we were hoping to meet our meat man dealt with the designs of the guns are out of the question that doesn't mean there aren't things on the table we're sadly very protective of our copyrights and my designs are not for reproduction attempts at reproducing them tend to end poorly many have tried most have failed if you wanted perhaps a few designed that could have been a conversation but so far i'm not impressed by you i'm quite surprised by the brazenness what on earth made you think that we would sell these designs to you you obviously are paying attention that's fair one pistol can do a quite a bit one pistol can go far how's giving you one of my weapons world-saving at the very least this is a conversation of whether or not you're ever going to do business in this city again and what that business is going to look like earmuffs earmuffs what what no oh well done you we were not there yes no no i hear that and i start walking out now i run you can go ahead and just say or you can try and intimidate us and say something really scary or make some noise that's true i'm going to start walking back to the inn and i'm going to start pouring a lot of drinks and putting them on the table it is set up yes the skeevy asshole that would be the one you would say that wouldn't you i want to listen what would you have done if i had just decided to open fire on you yes but really this was not a good plan yes yes none of your business at the moment tell us your business i was with you on that one it's really not you have advantage on wisdom saving throws there was a comma there that's a lot of matching robes you tried to get me to give you my gun designs for what you have a gun no i didn't give it to him no we didn't i'm going to put some pistol shot in a small bag what's kaylie's mother's name what is it i toss it to him dick and i leave for the record it's sybil so are we going to see an orb in the morning pike grog do you want a drink grog i want to go find that orb i kind of want to go work the blood out scanlan or not i like lionel

again yeah roll again best of two better go for it don't think act oh grog's ticklish that's a 20 he's also got brutal critical so that adds 2d6 to that but we'll get to that roll again better no you only roll the d4 once pike do you want to go deal with that he'll be fine i didn't say he's fine i said he will be fine let's not get ahead of ourselves there was chocolate milk on the way were you standing on the table when this happened i'm so excited we'll have another another round she can take it i'm covering i'm covering sorry there's a pile that's been growing on the table of gold for the furniture no i think that's done now i think it's chocolate milk time maybe i drink too much i'm not sure this is really nice aes is fine aes is fine no we know it's why we took you to a bar he's lied to us too yeah that's the trouble he does always have your back until he doesn't i get confused because of the cup extremely dainty well you've met the couple that do hadn't i'm really angry i want to go see that bloody orb lionel you're so good about this normally i have quite a few names myself don't break him please no no no don't say wait go on were these desert ducks these must have been very interesting ducks nothing-- said a voice that wasn't there carry on an oasis yes migratory perhaps aes ain't here right now you're not the first boy that's not true but that's good you're a fascinating creature sir good man never mind not disappointed d4 you already hit just the d4 but you weren't raging yet i am walking away with my chocolate milk and walking over to you guys they're bonding you can try you can certainly try perception is 19 you're rolling with sleight of hand so add sleight of hand to whatever you roll well done yes and no i have them you can't have them they're bonding he's a bit adorable i am angry frustrated and violent and so i'm going to try something new and drink chocolate milk and listen to you and do whatever it is you think is best at this point i don't know what to do what do we do what do i do well i'm not there yet but i know i'm feeling emotional and i know that's when i need to shut up and listen to you i'm less not-okay than i thought i'd be i'm worried about grog i'm very worried about pike i don't know what to do oh that's going to hurt and you get to re-roll that one don't you all right one second i'm going to gently walk up behind them while this is happening and i'm going to vulcan neck pinch him with the diplomacy that's where is that there it is 21 to hit it's a i have to pull out the thing i didn't pull this together as much as i thought i should've it's a constitution saving throw which is a d20 i'm going to roll the damage really quickly oh wow this is a lot of damage i apologize 17 points of lightning damage constitution saving throw now he saves that's a natural 20 oh well that didn't work that was supposed to knock you out and now it didn't this thing never works properly i really have to work on that you can take it you've earned it another gold coin goes on the table no i kind of like him he's the sort of positive energy i think your family's going to need around i understand by the way what you said back there with your family about me that was very flattering doesn't mean i can't be flattered i'm quite flattered that was very flattering and you know if things were different i would feel the same way if things were very different you're quite a catch you're quite a catch i thought it might be fun all right i'm going to gather up our things and prop up the table again and leave-- how much gold would be appropriate for the damage and then some i'm going to leave ten gold and be like i'm so sorry but try never not to make it worth your while and not be too horrible thank you for running
