c drive usb port http forward slash ugh speak english all these wires and cables i can't take it anymore for a system like that it's got to cost what $200 maybe $300 a month $100000 a month i literally burn five-dollar bills to stay warm on chilly nights what was that url again one more time i'm caught in wires there we are we don't actually have an official theme yet but i have a strong sensation that it's probably going to be something about riverdale i get the vibe that we might be going to riverdale there might be a teenage witch maybe a band i don't know we'll see it's not official yet but i'm working on it you got your nerdist in my geek and sundry that's so disgusting it was far down there are we within earpiece-shot (sings) sail and this was the end why am i drinking your coffee i'm going to stop right now we all were wearing the necklace so we all got a beep i felt something we have some amazing physics books that we will actually get into at some point have you two found that diamond-- oh sweet pelor i think somebody's got a carpet ride down the hill coming to them i have to confess i've been feeling a bit stir-crazy myself not jump-off-cliffs stir-crazy dear god i'm just saying that i understand the impulse this was not necessarily the best expression of it i think let's take a nap and then maybe go out-- i literally have books on the subject let's all go home have a drink and discuss this over a drink because i think this may speak to a larger issue amongst us that maybe you are the canary in the coal mine here was it i'm a golden god you're not still alive you're alive again yes i think everybody has at least been dead for a moment at this point technically yes we could make another kiki out of what you're wearing right now he died at the palace maybe we need a hobby that was magical to be fair a goldfish even at that velocity-- although the velocity would have lessened it more that's so true we were living tolkien and now we've suddenly shifted into game of thrones it got very dark very random very quickly we're going to have their vehicle searched for anything that doesn't belong to them and then made ready for them outside the city bounds do we have anybody with a criminal background search the vehicle i would like someone extremely sketchy to search actually vax would you search the vehicle including anything that you think would be in more capable hands if they were in your hands vax quick check to see if there's anything we care about all right just wanted to make sure there wasn't anything (sighs) complicated leave the gold obviously and the food there's a sign that says closed for adventuring this is a form of nepotism it's pretty reasonable is this the same day or has it been a day now oh thank god how often do you just eat strangers' cream puffs you're right that is fun well if it's all the same i may have another prospect for jb anyway it can't possibly be that good this is why we're the cool table bake her into the pies well there is another option which is that we have a giant pile of histories and library and novels in our collected library and we are searching for information about the thing underneath the castle and we need readers we need lots and lots of people to read lots and lots of books or you could sit in the castle and read diaries and ancient tomes of whitestone i definitely notice i don't care we haven't done that in quite a while to be fair just checking do you want to know no matter what good or ill fair enough speaking of deeply distrustful persons jb do you want to come see the library does anybody else want to come oh absolutely in the best possible way i'm highly excited and i think you're going to do very well see oh that made me happy this is more work than we put in hiring our first castle guards and a pot and if you break it there's five coins and throw them at chickens at least we know and there's no harm in being careful it's not like it's never happened before it's not the first time that we've been trusting and been betrayed or the second or the third it's reasonable to be a bit cautious and we were a bit cautious of cakes to be fair we are going to be eating them i assume we've gotten to the library i don't know there are books i read as a child everywhere bless you the game of logic by lewis carroll gives me the sense that this kid's going to be fine just showing her what we would like to pay her to do which is all of these books there's this huge section that are mostly histories diaries folk tales or otherwise take one of these slips of paper when you read a book you write your name on it and you leave it in the book then anytime you find anything peculiar-- a ghost story or a strange occurrence in any of these books anything at all that might be fanciful or unexplained you mark with a piece of gold thread and put it back on the shelf and then one of the other librarians will come and find that book and bring it down for further study you just have to find the most interesting of these books and make sure that they're well marked i had a funny feeling what makes a book interesting i genuinely don't know how to answer that there's not a lot of that in this library well that's the trouble with looking for something that if you don't know what it is but if in one of these diaries someone remarks upon a strange murder or a ghost story or honestly anything interesting that's a bit peculiar you just mark it and then we take a look that way we thin out the amount that we have to read down to a manageable amount that does help yes i assumed where is pike if she would like her own room that can absolutely be arranged i pull two engineering books off the shelf and hide them i feel like this has been taken care of you know the system would you like an extra bed sent that can be arranged take another look at the thing downstairs it's been here an awful long time now we don't even know if they created it or if they found it the castle's always had strange stories yes i've thought about it i definitely think there's something on the other side of this and this thing is how i think i know that our work is not yet done i dream about it sometimes do you ever come down and just look at it what do you see let's back up a bit of a distance well we can actually get to the edge where magic starts again and then it might reconnect once it goes through what i'm so proud of you it shouldn't work but it did no this is a whole chunk of stuff briefly back in the old days they were experimenting with texting us whispers i'm glad we stopped trying to text each other whispers her eyes go white and it's just (scribbling) yay three syllables we're being invaded by dingbats you didn't really we have to figure out how to-- is there a way to make sure we get every detail i'm finding pen and paper we're writing everything you can remember down is there a way to recall someone's memory in perfect detail is there any sort of magic that can actually-- okay this shit's happening it was the backblaze dimension this is spectacular this is great we have to let everybody know oh god we have to let everybody know and i grab her and we bolt out no yes maybe i don't know i'm not sure this is a breakthrough we have a breakthrough we have a breakthrough i am running to cassandra who i'm sure is asleep we have a full roman sauna underneath but that's fine whatever you need natural 20 natural 20 it's that night the trick is it requires human sacrifice i'm calling a meeting of the council i'm sending out the word i'm telling everyone that we have new information yeah i'm starting it now so that people who are not here can figure out their way here not them to the studying council anybody who's been studying the object i'm letting everybody know as quickly as possible there's new information he'll find out in the morning this is good we'll start looking with the new data as soon as everyone gets here this is excellent excellent good night go to sleep why are you awake no and i'm out the door i run to vex's house we're done yeah yes if he wanted to be found he'd be found his daughter's there and maybe he is possibly smart enough to explain to her how that stone works not successfully not since i briefly found him and then i lost him but i always have people looking i think maybe bigger things will help it's been too quiet no i mean i've enjoyed it this has been great everything everything has been great this is wonderful but i will admit i miss-- i don't know what i miss i miss it though i feel like i'm tempting fate and i'm going to regret everything i say right now one day maybe we can shut it down for good maybe we're going to go find a small black tower somewhere filled with death and despair no keyleth had a bit of day well vex had a brilliant idea recently you came to a very interesting power this is everything as she described it this is everything i could write down we've been very busy we can get you back there today if you think time is of the essence why did you go to emon i think we're good why are you awake nothing never mind this changes everything i'm changing the research focus in the library specifically to things on this subject so that we can more focus she was going to come to the castle check the book doty's book i know i helped build this thing can i figure out how to get the book to eject that's so cocked that's a natural 20 does that look like part of doty is it magical that's a 21 i genuinely don't actually know what this word means i normally have some clue about a word should we call everyone let's not call everyone who should we call let's call everyone has anybody seen tary he's not can you have some coffee and come down here quickly yes what three coffees i popped the book out right i have my things upstairs one second i'm going to get all of my tools i have everything on me including the cloak because i want to be able to absorb any magic that comes off of what looks like possibly a bomb just going to be careful i'm going to very gently remove the book flip to the last written page i'm waiting for keyleth i'm putting the book back thankfully we have a scry spell or two look at that that doesn't look normal once everyone clears out of the room i will try and remove it i am going to try and remove it let's see what happens i'm going to use the cloak to pull it off so that i'm shielded from it if anything happens it just means we knock her unconscious as opposed to killing her when we get there it will be fun let's do this well this we can deal with a roadside inn we know were tary comes from we know which roads one would take to get there from whitestone conveniently we could do a locate object go check hilda's house as well for clues then why is she at an inn well if she is at what sounds like a waypoint and if you can travel as far as you want why would you need a waypoint i am good at math why what sort of math last night it wasn't necessary a bamf it might have just been in and out get on a horse and head towards-- how far could they have gotten on horseback within the reasonable-- 100 miles there's only so many roads that lead out of the city i'm pulling out a map and i'm marking any roadside tavern that's within 100 miles of the city i can't make doty do things can i doty look at me never mind oh yeah i gave him the book back yes doty don't do that i've got a plan i need to borrow the scrying orb i'm going to make a list on a map i'm going to mark every roadside inn within about 200 miles okay where's the sun we'll finish this and i'll give it a few hours for the sun to go down so that i can actually figure out what direction the inn is facing save the sphere i've got a plan in the meantime let's search hilda's house we're going to get him back now right do i have enough of an angle on the sun now where this should be doable figure out which way is north south east and west if i try and scry on tary all right kiki let's do this well you're giving me the orb since you have the orb and i'm going to give it back to you when i'm done i did yes sure i'm going to try and glean as much information about the nature of the landscape around the person that i'm focusing on as humanly possible help with type of plants whether or not it's getting south east west not north most probably south which way is the shadow of the horse this is not my strong suit that'll do though 22 they've gone east they're still on the northern end of the continent if they're on the continent at all east on wildmount is there any other sign can i see a tree is it giving me any sense of anywhere i've been before that'll do well that'll do they're taking him home they're on horseback they're already quite far i don't know precisely where they are but if we can make our way to-- they're going by horse they'll probably be there sooner rather than later would be my guess well the city that tary's from-- it would be best to go there and cut them off we know that they're coming from the west there's got to be a way to get there how far is it how far away is it how far away is the city from us how many days on horseback so if we misted draconia how close would draconia be to this that's not bad we could misty from draconia but you can't tree stride today can you no that was the same day we could be there-- we could be there in hours if need be gear up everyone she was nice she was tied up by a bad person she was tied up by some elfy boba fett she was fine to be fair carbs are never really your friend are they sam's shirt northeast so i say we head north first find the main road we did know that they were on a road headed west heading east which means if we head north and then the minute that we hit that main road start heading in that direction we might even pass them on the way and be able to identify a horse not really my area of expertise but 22 history check correct 22 what's the name of the city one more time deastok so it's a bit prussian okay that will do so don't expect a lot of hospitality and let's just have our business get it done and get out we're going to fly up until we see the main road we see the main road we're going to take it towards the city we're going to stay a bit high if anyone spots a lone horse and a rider with a human-sized package on the back we're going to do a little spin-around spin-around spin-around and we're all going to park ourselves maybe a quarter of a mile up the road we land inside the gates from what i know of this city it's not a locked city is it so we can walk in if we need to but let's not make any waves unless we need to doing air math it's great nothing quite like air math i'm just heading the direction-- i can't hear you (airy laughter) i'm going to be keeping an eye out for anybody on the road 12 i keep skirting around looking for a lone horseman (hiccups) i'm going to scout around a little closer to the ground and see if there's anybody maybe any of the paths off the main road where someone might be hiding and just run through the trees looking for anything i'm searching around a little bit i know we're close to the city and i'm keeping an aerial view because we should be able to see an awful lot from high up no interest of getting anywhere near that i'm popping back on the road we can land and have a conversation yes tary can you hear us all right his dangly bit his tary squaring his hypotenuse his dangly bit yeah i'm going to try and motion everyone to follow me in a circle around the city and then back out the front gate i don't know maybe we beat her i'm going to try and motion everyone-- just a little not far back onto the road and off the road so that we're not super visible about an hour's walk to the city is where i want to put us well we've either beat them here or she's really clever do we have a way of scrying one more time before the day is up but it's the road that we've so we could in theory mist low to the ground on this road in that direction and in theory catch up with them just the one i say we mist that way all right i'm going to start making my way a decent distance and running a little bit off the road i'm going to try and find some cover and get ready to injure a horse stealth roll stealth roll is-- oh that's not bad 21 plus ten 31 and i'm getting down i'm preparing for the shot i'm also going to activate the secondary mechanism in the diplomacy glove i was actually going to-- the second she started to leave the road i take a shot at the horse's legs disadvantage can i burn a grit for it i'll burn a grit for this this is worth a grit that's not great but it's not bad 20 that's a strength saving throw or prone 20 oh and also takes damage i did i really shot it it didn't have a good day do i have enough there's no horse left yeah oh boy that's 30 points of damage that's my maximum damage with a single unaffected shot i'm keeping a second shot the second i see her head i am taking a head shot on this girl nope 11 i'm slowly making my way a little closer to the action but i'm going to find a place where i can watch both sides of the road and also what's happening off the road right now actually if you come-- well that would be interesting actually i think it might be an easy way into the city i think that's fair laura and pretty quiet it's a bit her fault why doesn't she just owe us one favor to be claimed later i am groot bidet it's going to be a dark window isn't it this entire trip i'm very curious let's see this place ow oh god that's all right it's not my shooting arm i know it's okay yeah ow yeah i'll need a bit more later thanks he's got a point not me rusty trombone where is your sister i own more than your tribe owns we were working on that particular compliment and i feel like we have a little way to go do you think she knows about this what do you want to do i'm not even sure if that's something that should be entertained it's not fair to her either that's a bad example no i mean he's right that money would have solved this but that's not the lesson keyleth is right we're here we can figure out a way out of this we're smart we're clever we're powerful and what's one more cliff not again i want to find out what your sister knows i don't necessarily see how two wrongs right anything here it's just really kicking the ball down the road while you make another random human being you have not met miserable oh this is so depressing i'm not going to even pretend that this is true absolutely not no you'll be miserable and that will make her miserable we are bad news for anybody like that i'm sure it would be worth their time to get us out of town possibly get you out of town you can't be good for business some bells absolutely i'm going to regret this but yes i like that you approve of the arranged marriage but it's the bells that really-- nothing happened bludgeoning he doesn't like to brag every fucking moment of my backstory man i'm so excited for this shit bonus backstory one fucking page you came up with most of that shit off on your own you didn't even write it down maryanne was off the cuff i thought it was because your logan's run crystal started flashing that goldfish wouldn't have remembered it very long either
