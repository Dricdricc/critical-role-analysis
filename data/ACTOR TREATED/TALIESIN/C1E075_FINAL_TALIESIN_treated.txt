face to be fair he didn't say oklahoma now we can hold him one moment we're going to-- no that's just fine we're looking for a suit of armor he may have won in a card game --that vanished during a card game it has great emotional value yes let's i've got a ring of lightning resistance i've got a ring of lightning resistance we did okay i would put it on pinterest maybe we could tell him it's a thimble we could tell him it's a handcrafted thimble and i have the ring of lightning resistance no are you using that okay (hums yakety sax) he can wear it as a pinkie ring it's going to be like a little eyebrow piercing that's going to be weird oh no can we put it in the bag of holding it's like a piece of pre-packaged ikea furniture we bought the new bed frame it's called the nupe if you have the magic still we could find out precisely where the armor is is it on the ground floor or does it feel like it's above us there's a giant velvet elvis pie iesu domine dona eis requiem better safe than sorry though this is the first time that actual travis has really leaked into grog wow and really interesting fanart loot crate magical loot crate you have a deeper understanding of the tragedy of that i'm going to lean in and-- (no vocals) so many bad ideas start with-- no we're good tell her to show her last card i cast minor illusion on the first card to turn the three into an eight it's true we're going to be fine anyway we have the mansion 11 let's sleep in the mansion so we can gain some of our-- we should go back into the mansion can we get water from the-- they're not speaking in metaphor we know you can create water let's mansion for the night and then i think in the morning we can't find him tonight can we and what happens if you can't plane shift out of that house we probably want to get out of the house and then plane shift in case it's magically locked down in which the phrase i have many enchantments upon my home led me to believe there's probably-- you're writing the best children's book ever can we trick him into the mansion we can quietly attack him from all sides have a fight that won't draw the attention of the guards there's nothing we could damage in there that would remain damaged he wears jewelry bikram yoga that is the hot one yes he's not a giant killing machine he's a businessman looking to purchase-- where are we going to kill him i was actually going to say quintuplets we could all look the same it is now somehow a stamp with an upside-down airplane is worth a fortune this obviously is more rare we'll make her taller and you two shorter no because six is what he's walking around with he's got more back in his shop does the sultan mark his slaves does he have a seal if we were to sell ourselves as slaves we could be marked as the property of the sultan and then we could claim that he was trying to steal property of the sultan you don't get to negotiate that aspect even if we're just sneaking back into the house and stealing the armor we're doing it as identical sextuplets there's no fighting that anymore if each of the sextuplets-- i'm never going to get tired of saying that-- were unique in their own way and yours was that you had a trace of celestial which is why you have wings yes which is why plan a is much better we don't have enough money to pay off the guards remember we're just to show off you've got more mine's better somewhere between the folies bergere and caligula's living room i think it's like a windows pc you can change the desktop settings you could have little slave chickens you've already made a sale and you have more back at the-- baby ghost rider that's baby ghost rider just the break from the heat is the only thing that would force us to deny your hospitality but we will keep the door to our rooms of course in your abode why does he keep doing that there's something wrong in it there's something in the basement that's the saddest thing i've ever heard out of curiosity sleeping outside of the effects of the heat should make-- there's ac i am going to send a little time working on a couple things for the fort when we get back netting ammo for the trebuchet just a sketch to start to design a very simple bolo for the trebuchet just penciling and then penciling-- i've got a notion for a watch tower that's super super simple platform for two people tops with a rope that connects to a bell so when you start heading down it it goes (high voice) fuck simple white robes they have white wings correct when he pops his wings the wings will be gold we are learning way too much about everyone that's very fair okay keyleth can you shape something can you grow a gazebo it's a magical tent can you grow a gazebo out of grapevines no it will be fancy i think it will be fancy plants where there are no plants is fancy let's keep an eye out why doesn't whichever one of us is the one that can be sneaky and look around all right all right what and then we have extra slaves it's beautiful let's not have this conversation with them yet sister until all has been taken care of what sister do you need a hand up brother i want to do an insight check on that insight check okay that's 22 you're an idiot and i'm very proud of you don't do that again what if i were to do a very strange accent good to know so if you summon your magical room-- you only know two pick one (laughter) g and r that's what you've got pike-- vex sister do you want to perhaps do a walk around with the two boys and see if we can't attract some attention i'm not getting far but i'm going to take the two boys-- i'll be very careful with them i'm going to say don't talk to anyone don't look anyone in the eye and don't answer any questions without my permission do you understand i've got a plan follow my lead this should be interesting you can try again in ten minutes i'm going to look around for something interesting i try and discern who runs this establishment most humble greetings good master my sister and i have been sent by our owner to peruse the market for things that he might enjoy and i have been asked to inquire upon the nature of what you're selling and your suggested price never making eye contact my master is always interested in creatures of unusual disposition and he will be excited to know what you have for sale i thank you for your time may i please leave your-- i've lost my brain i bow i back off properly what are you feeding me in this cup (laughter) i'm making sure that the whole market knows that there is someone perusing and purchasing for unusual creatures and making sure they see the weird twins and the two angelic-- i'm making a show of it and i'm making a show of our non-chained obedience we're not going to hurry we're going to meander so
