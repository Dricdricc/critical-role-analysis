guys just like draw weird circles right okay i was just checking it's pronounced siggle yeah yeah you drain erika ishii's blood it's pretty great it's a great trick you can only do it once baker's dozen you watched galaxy quest you know they have the dubbed version of the alien language on the dvd (alien noises) the whole movie the entire movie-- you can watch it if you're drunk enough we're here we're here jenga don't say her name three times then your rolls won't come true monks are not in my wheelhouse (whispering) popcorn  (whispering) he wants popcorn you've got the touch like taiko (low drum sounds) two lair actions nice cobra kai never dies it couldn't hurt very filthy for you to show him what you learned (high-pitched groan) it's just a kitten going-- (mimes punching a kitten) it is technically one point he may go down nine hit points five we worked it out at one point we worked out the math at one point it's like two hit points it's going to be a very tough kitten anytime you're welcome it was amazing potions or women bless you i wonder what scanlan would say if he were here right now yes yes very asleep do quick shopping and then head home and look at all the things so glad i'm not in this room it's like if you gave him an ice cream you see me running around on a sugar high for the rest of the day never gonna burn that off forgot the ears thank you you should probably pass that i think no i don't walk by i just-- i'm amazed that no one remembers that we can hear everything over these earpieces carry on carry on (all laugh) community theater wow we went there yes of course it has one do i happen to know where it is or do i not i feel like it would be the sort of thing that would have just existed for fuck all ever thank you would i possibly know this i don't even know if i would know this a history check that's so-- okay a natural twenty yeah that's a natural twenty with my history is-- -- is a 30 that's a 30 okay there's a pancake brunch i'm honestly not sure grog i really have to think about it i don't know if such a thing exists that's good to know that's good to know excellent i wonder if he's awake yet pudding pudding we've had people taking care of that there's seven children in this family i think they're used to some tomfoolery i have no idea they lick them apparently you missed all the fun and the dragon is very dead very very dead that was me worse family and for fuck's sake sir i will say i died in that fight too no and let me tell you something whatever lie you were trying to feed your daughter out there about the man she thought you might be that you just thought you could tell her and then she would walk away and never actually meet you or get to know you so that maybe she would never see what a shit you can be and you can be a shit that fucking girl out there is a shit too she's a miserable lying shit and for fuck's sake the thing that brought her back here was the things about you that you don't like about yourself and don't think that they don't count either you're a shitty person we know that's not the fucking point the point is for just one moment-- one moment-- once in a blue bloody moon you come through in a way that others can't and you do it and we love you for it and you are worthwhile there's a reason we just nearly went mad trying to bring you back and it was not pity and we didn't bring her-- we brought her here so that maybe she would snap you out of wherever the fuck you were going to and i know you're not out of there yet i've been where you are and i know it's shit and i would really recommend as somebody who misses an awful lot of people that you are honest with that girl and maybe discover that she actually likes you as a person because you are actually likeable as a person i know it's coming out of my mouth i can feel the shit from it but it's true and for fuck's sake get to know her and stop making false promises that you can protect her and you'll always be there 'cause you can't and you won't no one can and you're fucking lying and it's sick be a man be a man i've seen you be a man i know you can fucking do it and when you're done with that and we will leave you with that fucking shit girl i would like you to look up my parents' name you can find it on every fifth hallway in this fucking city and then i'm out mm-hm i give her a big hug a kiss on the forehead-- (makes an air kissing noise) i'm around the corner up on the-- i'm outside of-- if you went far enough you'd see me hi yeah 'course i'm torn i don't know if he'd like that i don't know if i do either i keep thinking i could just shout right now and half a dozen guards would stop them well what's half a dozen dead guards these days there's tale of a brothel in the west end of whitestone i don't know if it still exists but i'm sure if you go drinking in that area you might find something sorry when you're in the mood grog i know we don't always agree and i know that i can be unkind but you know you're family right it's nice having an older brother again way to paint a tableau i think 'crying in your pudding' is actually a british saying  oh i'm not there it's like a black mirror episode this is awkward we know that was weird good morning worked well i think we all have our ways of coping just some sketches there's no cake there are people for that oh hey i've got all my hit dice back that's nice well as far as i know we have three things still on our plate we've got a hand we've got the ashari and we've got a demon i run to the kitchen i put together something that is not quite but probably a hot sauce with half a raw egg and shot of something that is quite possibly but not quite some sort of fantasy variant of tequila swirl it all up this is a thing yeah just get it down just get it down don't look at it i was kidding you shouldn't actually drink that can i get a roll damage (all laugh) yes you're welcome let's take a quick look at what we got from the cave we found this be careful it was with raishan several things have died on top of it what do you recommend we do with this book going to vault that for the moment not anyone in this room is what he's saying i say hand it's simple to the point and we can find the ashari on the way back jet lag tree lag i'm for the record not wearing the cloak when we do this and just for the record i know i'll get yelled at for twitter on this i have informed my sister where i'm going and what's going on not just going willy-nilly the daring trial and tribulations of tary darrington it feels weird new dad is wearing old dad's skin and trying to do an impression of him and-- tell us about the lootcrate sam tell us about the lootcrate ah mother lied ah dick i'm just saying look it's not like we don't have business right now you seem what does he seem like you seem like a person and that's great i'm trying not to judge at the moment and-- i know i've had a bad day i take it back i like him and i just hex into the shadows right one moment sir huddle none taken (all laugh) yes that's my thought i'm not going to pretend i'm not mildly entertained by the distraction at the very least we just have to drop off a hand do you want credit for dropping off a hand we also could report in to a certain dragon about things that have happened let's just-- very proud of you grog c'mon then vex let's let the money tag along it'll be fine did he flip the coin at her i was thinking of intercepting it anyway so-- yeah i have gloves of missile snaring i intercept it i'm not saying i can't be bought-- let's get the hand to its final destination (sighs) unbelievable yes he was he has it all-- i love that-- i wish that everyone could see that the crew is in utter revolt behind us right now and they've all got nerf guns you're tearing this family apart
