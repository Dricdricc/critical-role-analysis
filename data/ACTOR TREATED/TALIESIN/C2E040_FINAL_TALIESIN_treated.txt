i'm sherlock holmes because that's the best i could do in two hours' time after figuring out that i was supposed to do this while working on another project by far the most put-together costume at this table yeah also i forgot i just announced i'm going to be at loscon november 23rd through 25th so if you're in la and want to check out the convention i'll be hanging out there and talking about d&d and voiceover and all sorts of things like that loscon l-o-s-c-o-n that's what i've got we're getting two daylight savings times because we had one in london too so we get two hours we should travel the world i'm pretty sure it does i want a judgement call on that i know i'm well aware yeah in theory i assure you it's safe now is jamedi wearing any weapons actually i'm going to use this new d20 and see how that goes the con ah that's good that's a good start 27 i'm going to cast detect magic on everything including our friends and everything in the room nothing jamedi is wearing at all is giving off a-- mr fjord i feel like i should mention i'm keeping a lookout for anything and i'm getting a bit of a magical aura from the three columns i don't know if it's related to this the three columns are very similar there's nothing unique the pattern within them doesn't deviate too much all right i was heading that way myself i think the lock's picked i'm going to start heading towards the stairs i'm going to recommend everybody else let's go i'm going to-- is everybody outside is everybody in the chamber right now i'm going to hit the button to re-close the-- to close the-- oh who did yeah okay do you mind hitting the button to close this thing again yeah i was going because i was-- oh god mage hand come on yeah we'll get up there and drop a rope can yasha fly i'm going to try and-- oh god all right i'm actually weak somebody stronger is probably good i'm tall now i'm very tall i might be taller than the hole right yeah i'm pushing people through yep oh i'm casting spirit guardians and rushing them i've got a light on my stick anyway i would have cast light on my stick then anybody i don't like within 15 feet is currently getting ransacked by tiny fairies wisdom 16 that's-- freaking out a little bit 3d8 radiant damage that's 11 (counting) 12 points of radiant damage no it doesn't-- they're fairies i'm heading straight towards the exit seven and seven both seven they're also drowning too right someone might have a water breathing potion i'm also-- is he getting within 15 feet of me okay then as he enters that space he has to-- your speed is halved while you're within 15 feet of me and the creature enters the area for the first time or starts its turn there so the 3d8 that's 19 so half of 19 okay so he gets into my realm-- one of them is within-- i don't have to reroll it's the same for all three right the roll i just used or a new roll all right that's-- yeah top of their turn it's like a little-- there you go i'll go last she's going to lose a little air but yeah is she engaged with anybody okay then she will toll the dead yes that's 2d8 oh yeah 2d12 where are my 12s ten points she's going to try to get the most advantageous point towards the door as well i'm going to take a blight staff swing at that one that's right next to yasha right there oh actually that's true actually never mind i'm not going to do that i'm so sorry i'm going to get them into the most advantageous position to make sure that everybody i want to hit is within 15 feet of me i'm just going to hold my breath and maintain my calm yeah i believe that's full damage let's see spirit guardians 16 not bad 16 points are the other two not doing anything by the way no i mean our other two friends okay that's fair yeah nope nope just letting the fairies do the work 15 points of damage oh no she's out i thought she's out yeah get her out of there i would appreciate it but up to you no no one does asshole is he going to take an attack of opportunity on her full speed oh yeah that's fair i did i rolled an eight can i cast-- i got a crazy idea next turn can i try something i am unconscious ah man i know i was just sitting on a spell that apparently i didn't know that i was going to lose the spell so i'm throwing away my plans i had an emergency exit and now i can't use it it's all right fuck it 14 thank god that would have been the end of me that would have been number two done right there instant tko fuck man jester at the very least is going to cast spare the dying-- is going to grab me in the feather fall and cast spare the dying thank you i don't think you made it to unconsciousness because we burst before your turn yeah and i don't think that spirit guardians doesn't go down when i go unconscious it's not concentration-- oh it is concentration isn't it where is it yeah it is concentration fuck god damn it no i'm not i'm unconscious you're sliding me basically thank you for that oh my god she doesn't actually have anything that can wake me up right now oh my god she has one left doesn't she holy shit i forgot about that i'm not even little anymore oh i'm up i'm up oh did i lose all my hit points when i went unconscious okay i had zero then well fuck i'm going to cast-- really quickly since i have nothing else left i'm going to cast disguise self and look like one of the lizard people oh no i'll use thaumaturgy to create the sound of a rushing group of us but throw it-- happening i'm going to move us off into the jungle in the other direction you can create instantaneous sound that originates from a point of your choice within range-- this is a rumble within 30 feet a rumble of thunder-- i can't make it the cry of a raven-- such as is what it says i'm making the sound of people rummaging through-- yes i'm pushing it away from us and moving us in that direction come on man not some sucky stuff ah not bad 15 i'll take just barely today i have something else but i'd be curious if somebody else has something my favorite saving throw 18 certainly not the weirdest i've already done that as well (groaning) oh fuck really 16 she was 16 ten i yeah i have the ability to carry a large amount because of my size can i piggyback and not get too much of a roll if i throw caleb on my back okay oh man i'll have ya-- yeah no that's a better idea because i was-- five hit points maybe not (sigh of relief) oh my god-- oh thank god-- yeah i'm just-- this is yeah that was a lot (laughter) it's only a teacher if we actually learn from these mistakes-- i have a giant pile of stuff in the other room can we ever not look yeah i would be amenable at this point there's more than one there was more than one creature we need three onyx eyes three ivory eyes three amber eyes a creature of the sea a creature of the air with fire-- marisha and i think the question really is what we're going to have to do about this i mean this is the direction that we're heading this is what's being put in front of us i don't know if running headlong into the next temple is the best option i think maybe if you didn't find the answers you were looking for down in the water maybe it's time to look somewhere else all things considered i think it would be best if we left on good terms let's get to port and restock and that's when we'll figure out-- i don't know perhaps some sign of agreement to share information with the understanding that you're both working towards the same goals and maybe it would be better to have two groups doing this instead of one she's already said that she's sent people out to do this work it wouldn't be that much different i suppose as opposed to what to be honest it would be worth actually following through with it anyway she knows things that we don't we get to find out that's true is this some sort of pirate town jester's carving something into the bow of the boat and we don't know what she's got the axe and she's moving it in a direction without looking are we now going to go and sleep and properly sleep i think i'm going to go to sleep i don't know about the rest of you i'm going to pat him on the shoulder and just for fun cast protection from poison you've got an hour i don't mind it i think i just have an issue with the things that are in it and being under it and i'm going to go to sleep and probably yeah throw up a little i can't leave yet we're going to figure out a way for you to breath underwater it's going to be okay come on a long rest i'm very mixed about this whole thing i have a passive perception of 18 can i figure out what happened just by looking at him sleep well with your bad decisions rolling a d8 right six stop fighting a success what do i get at level seven and not a drop to drink (background chatter)
