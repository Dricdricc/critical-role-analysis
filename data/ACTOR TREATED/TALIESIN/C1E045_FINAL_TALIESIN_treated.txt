epilay it's like ten minutes of your-- you have more minutes than two minutes spend a couple of minutes roll a one oh i got a quick one book of murder came out today so you can hear me do a very weird accent it's great so yes very weird accent cleric is what it means not at the same time keep crawling out of trees i was going to say we should take the armor and the necklace to the castle and have it inspected no we'll be putting you up in the castle we're heading to the castle we're going to talk to friends we're going to take a look at-- it-- yes yes good friends that was a really good kashaw yes we appreciate it greatly they will be well worth your time we also have something that needs a bit of study we found something we found two objects of power that we think may help us turn the table against the dragons two objects there was a necklace there was it's been a very long day yes the-- -- trap was a bit-- it was a bit ah-- there was a trap and it was well-protected yes what not at all i hand it over just what he said it's a cage legendary cardstock well there are some options here no that won't work damn it well i was thinking we could find a safe place surround it let it out and if it's dangerous take care of it we could even take it down into the pits beneath the castle so that if it's a magical creature it would be harmless except i don't know if we could actually release it down there i don't know-- yeah which means it wouldn't work in the first place it might be an ally yes yes no the raven queen-- can i make a roll for this okay thank you nope nope it's st patty's day religion or history matt and 11 no we actually can actually we can put him back in so would a trap we could also trap other creatures-- yes it's exactly like a pok√© ball you don't have to go in willingly that's sort of the point i'm more excited about the idea of carrying around an empty trap or the forest outside of whitestone not really anymore didn't they ravage most of our collection she wasn't a revered deity in this part of the world we don't have a lot-- woods or vasselheim that's actually not a bad idea to get far away from whitestone this is sort of our secret and we should perhaps keep this-- well we were going to go take a look at-- it's just a couple hours away correct we can take a day and do this yes let's take a sleep and we'll do it in the morning i've got some work to do i need to yeah to do a little-- and i've got a little thing i want to work on i'm going to take vax aside very quickly i had a careless moment and i apologize and you're the first apology i'm putting forward i don't know if i would have done anything different but i hope you know that i would've never forgiven myself i rushed in and triggered the trap that almost killed your sister i can't say that i was careless i felt the danger had passed and i moved too quickly and opened the casket without thinking that's all i just didn't think i was tired wasn't thinking sometimes we move too quickly but i want you to know that it would've-- i'm very glad that she's alive because i don't think i could have lived with myself yes that's the hope yes that was more of a lesson than i was hoping for thankfully not too much of one and none of us are beyond mistakes but that is a mistake that i am going to be thinking about for a very long time we are going into dangerous territory and we all have to think a little bit more and she especially i-- i couldn't-- no yeah let's take it goodnight vax i'm going to work i'm going into my studio tinkering check with dexterity modifier okay 16 i've got a thing do i have time to poke at a modification to the explosive arrow i want to try and build a rock breaker i'm curious to try and build an arrow for taking down walls or taking down doors a light form of siege arrow basically i want to have a tip that actually manages to breach stone and then an explosion that goes outwards so it's a shattering arrow i have nothing else to do okay so that's 23 no i've got an okay workshop here all right siege arrow a few things i've been working on and that's one of them god the guilt okay yeah (singing) somewhere out there i'm imagining this as a canvas of lisa frank majesty by the way like the greatest lisa frank trapper keeper cover in all the land stop it you're wasting water makeup's runny we are a city of seasonal affectation disorder so i'm right here (coughs) hello good morning what what no i'm fine good morning everything was empty if i recall let's do the caves we're in a fortress vex by the way-- vex by the way i've got something for you and i pull out the arrow this is an evening of unbridled guilt come here let me show you in theory this is a siege arrow shattering stone shattering doors breaking things that should not be broken if that is what you're after it should work never forget you're my favorite and i'm so sorry that was much nicer than your brother (stammering) i didn't sleep there'll be more in a circle aim it into the center of the circle it's jenga one one-thousand two one-thousand three one-thousand four one-thousand if only someone had armor that could make them immune to paralysis let's spread out in a circle we'll let it loose in the center that way it can't even see all of us you just teleport there's like a phase effect it's fine you're fine i've got a little bit of distance yes that's good i'm going to get on my knees and put out my hand and call it galdric galdric yeah it's a little bit better ten i'll take it gently i'm gentle with it trinket is scooby-doo apparently waddle no i think he's a wolf i think perhaps something a little less ambitious i think perhaps joining the whitestone conclave might be a-- having him guard whitestone perhaps it goes bad i think he would be helpful to guard the town at this point i don't think we need to i think we can communicate to him-- ask him if he'll be willing to keep the town safe i'm not ready for that game to be fair that's happened before with the troll no it wasn't me was it you i don't remember until the danger has passed has passed you did good you did good i'm holding onto the raven's slumber jewel at the moment it's empty now and do you know what i bet would fit in it very nicely it's automatic and no time passes just point yep and because of the way that the projection works you could also in theory capture a baddie and then let them loose off a cliff and watch them drop it's very convenient your home i imagine fire ashari it is that's far i agree that's still very important nothing's close we're specifically far away from everything fire ashari is the next-- take it it's nifty that you have a book that tells you how much something like that costs what is that what does it do i'm pretty reasonable does it require attuning yes but does it require attuning i might be attuned out at this point what's your dex your dexterity is not very-- actually it might work out well for me weirdly enough i can undo something that i'm not using matt i have access to alchemy supplies here in whitestone correct eh as long as we're quick we can go about it i know you don't want to go but we need to go i say we take the rest of the day you make your potions we leave first thing in the morning maybe allura will join us by tomorrow morning if not we teleport over sure yes of course i don't feel that way about you (laughter) i mean you're very attractive oh where you get your freak on yes yes we have them oh i imagine so no i have no idea where they are i do know that they exist i actually had things to do here i didn't have time for these i wouldn't actually know where any of these places were would i i figured as much i'm just fucking with him okay no your secret is safe with my indifference that's fine i know you do you're wonderful yes you can i do it all the time it's a hellmouth it's basically a hellmouth but this is quick this is something that we can knock off the list i'll help you make the potions we're going to make our potions there's really not a lot of it so potions i'll let them know that they should start trying to pull the residuum out of the wall but it's dangerous down there and tampering with it is definitely should be ginger it would i'm trying to keep everything ginger down there we currently have 1000 gold from my family stores that are in the group treasury at the moment i feel like it was more than that he's not there i was going to do such a nice thing for you but never mind now no never mind you went to buy a shortsword i'm trying to be gentle with my family right now they're taking on an awful lot and we'll see what we can do always fucking hear you in my mind we're busy making potions pick one no potion all right all right this is fine this is good lucky charms no no that was perfect oh god that's too deep let's do this i attempt to use the optics on my gun to get a better look at them 18 are they dressed like the ashari that i've met i don't know who these people are we should 29 hi stop looking at your phone lol 13 i don't actually know what one level of exhaustion is ah yeah no we're running now cardio god
