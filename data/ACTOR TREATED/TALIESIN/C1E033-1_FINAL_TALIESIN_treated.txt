i've got another character ready to roll when this all goes down much like my parents i have no plan b yule poop there's yule poop here and then there's arrows i'm now wondering how much of our audience is currently-- no never mind he's so hairy we hardly notice i've got plastic on my character oh and just to do it again since we haven't done it enough please do check out the spotify links and the comics go to the actual geek and sundry website because the more traffic the geek and sundry website gets for you guys going there to look at our stuff the more excited they are to do cool stuff for us so if you want more of this definitely go there we have so much stuff we want to do for you guys we have grand plans thank you ma'am you'll be dming a game for your family i would assume (laughter) oh yeah you've got your little mini hey now not cool not cool we do not use the w word around here yeah he knows sorry goddamn it they don't know where you're pointing are we calling everyone over for this conversation do we want to waste power on somebody who's i'm wearing a hat of disguise so that i'm not immediately identifiable link from the legend of zelda i don't know i'm going to figure it out right now just as a reasonable whitestone peasant trying to blend in we could also just ask her to drop it well we could ask her to drop the seeming she did i stay in the shadows yes anna let's be frank with each other you have two options either you are going to die in this cell-- and i promise you you will die in this cell-- or you are going to convince us why you shouldn't so i would start talking right now or i swear we will not leave this dungeon before you're dead 16 tell us about the experiments beneath the castle that's a number question two what are you doing down here really can you lead us to cassandra de rolo that may be what your life is worth i pull forward i look her very deeply in the eye and i say you should know who your friends are here do you know that we're friends and i'm going to become friends i'm casting friends i'm getting creepy just for flavor there is definitely some creepy happening you've been truthful with us so far correct you haven't been fudging around or playing games with us really have you so you'd be happy to help us find cassandra de rolo wouldn't you anna you will take us to cassandra de rolo you will tell us what you know about what's in the basement you will tell us where to find lord and lady briarwood and you will tell us where to find professor anders and for this we may let you go i'll let you leave the castle you are at the moment the luckiest person in whitestone do you know why because you're at the bottom of my list (laughter) i will be happy to give you an up close and very personal demonstration unless of course you would rather have conversations about other topics it means there's only one to shoot off to make sure she won't be a problem don't use luck yet here's the deal anna you do what we ask you do not betray us you do not make our life difficult in any way and you have my word that you will leave whitestone unmolested by us if i sense the slightest hint if i have a moment where i think that you might make a run for it if i have a moment where i think you may cough inappropriately i would ask you to think about everything you did to me and i would like you to know that i have learned so much more than what you taught me that day and i cannot wait to show you and i will but not until i find you again no it'll arouse suspicion i'll follow her perception is passive as hell right now i am keeping very sharp eye on-- we'll get there and i want to see what she's built anyway as we're walking i just want to very gently take my gun-- and just put it gently at her back going nothing personal i'm just feeling a bit nervous we're going to try to get my sister first yes unless there's something new then yes i was born here damn i'm going to take a moment and i have an epiphany and i'm going to shift my form into a castle guard we'll get it on the break anna i lower the gun and let her move forward was that a thought for the day then don't sprain yourself we need you later yes i don't need it has it worn off i had enhance charisma on for a while but now it's gone so if you do it what i had is gone-- all right putting that down wait until we're in the thick of it let's head to her room i want to see what you've been working on i watch very carefully you know i almost killed you in stillben do you remember i was kind of curious if you had figured it out or not show me your work i'm disappointed i was expecting something more imaginative (scoffs) hack we'll give those to you when it's time to leave let her have the armor as a sign of good faith and give me your ammunition and when it's time i will hand some to you the weapon's useless convince us to let you keep it and god forbid you'll see how gracious we're feeling when we find cassandra de rolo unhurt was there any more black powder i've taken all of her ammunition and black powder i suppose anything else that looks useful to me that's intelligence oh well hell eight i hate what you've done with the place we'll have a conversation about what she was trying to do off-camera so i can have a better understanding of it i figure i may poke you later to get a better understanding just so we don't have to bore other people with her technical accoutrements but i would like at some point an out-of-character understanding of what i'm looking at of what i could discern about what i'm looking at all right no i just figured it'd be i don't want to-- (laughter) exactly committed as much to memory as possible let's go touche which room a quick question before i open this door am i going to have a violent reaction towards you when i open it good (sighs) i motion to everyone stay back open the door and i push dr ripley into the room with me behind her torch i walk over to the closet i open it looking for signs of life with the paper on the desk yes let's have a real roll that will do that's a natural 20 it was doing this on group hug man she's not here where would she be anna i'm going to take a leap of faith and believe contrary to all evidence that you are a smart woman i pull out the gun and i put it to her head now if you were the briarwoods where would you put my sister i don't know and if you don't know make me believe it distillery i pull the gun away so you're telling me that somewhere in this castle there is a storage facility full of caustic acid that dissolves the very stones of this castle well this is interesting oh dear are they still melting down the whitestone for magical energy we'd better move downstairs (growls) is it possible that my sister would be with him we'll check his study and then we'll go just his study then we'll go even if he's there if she's not there we'll leave very well well that happened dick i love you why would she be saying it's a trap if it's not her goddamn it is that including sprint that's full dash what the hell i percy'd again no i was on group hug last week with somebody else's dice and it was comedy thank you i'm the anti-wheaton 28 can i drag ripley with me fuck so as my bonus action before anything happens i'm going to tell her she lives you show us where the entrance to the caverns are you walk with your things and run full movement oh yeah we've got this new thing now that's so much better (heavy footsteps) you can see me though whether or not you want to inspire me at this point is definitely debatable damn it remember what he did to your beard hulk versus wolverine man i'm excited by that (sucking sounds) (raspy) i have your power damn it goddamn it i'm sorry yeah family resemblance with no weapons and no armor leather armor yeah i'm going to run in i can move six right one two can i get a good view of professor anders and maybe get a little cover from the dining room table all right i'll take my cover i'm going to pull out-- bonus i pull off my hat of disguise drop it on the floor and i'm going to just unload at that motherfucker shot one oh for the love of god i'm going to attempt to repair it really quickly trying to remember how to do that because i hate it (mumbling) action shit (sighs) so i'm just going to sit and scream a little bit (shouting) that's my turn no 18 that's my armor class so 19 points of slashing damage total yeah i think you saw that cautionary tale in there somewhere i'm going to break-- first off i'm going to fix my gun i'm going to make my roll come on what do i have to roll (muttering) i hit the difficulty does that-- if that had been a slightly bigger fuck-up that would have been-- oh god okay i'm going to use an action surge anyway so it doesn't matter i'm going to break off from this guy and i'm going to rush towards professor go ahead don't care yeah i push him in the face i don't care i'm going to unload in him that's 21 to hit that's 25 to hit that's a natural 20 okay let's see that's 11 14 yep this is the critical which is seven 14 15 16 17 18 20 with fire damage how close to him do i get and this was without smoke damage i might add yeah i'm unloading as i walk towards him traitor and i've got two more shots next shot how close am i to him at this point perfect i put my gun in his mouth to shut him the fuck up you're the face i saw when murder entered my heart this is your doing and i pull the trigger (heavy breathing) that's my turn fine i don't have a turn yet does trinket get an attack of opportunity for that i'm going to pull off the mask and walk forward a bit about there and take three shots at the armor sharpshooter shots with one ice so 14 make sure i'm doing this right yeah goddamn it 17 dropping sharpshooter for the third one not that it helped 16 that's my turn
