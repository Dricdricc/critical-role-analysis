saving throw okay these rules are new so pardon me if i'm a little iffy so shot with pepperbox is-- wow what's wrong with me 28 to hit well yeah there's damage plus a saving throw he has to make a constitution saving throw eight plus my proficiency modifier plus my dexterity modifier it's actually ten 18 yeah you're right and it does six points of damage-- i'm sorry it does 12 points of damage plus three points of fire damage and now my other shot marking that off i'm going to shoot him while he's down so do i get a bonus to hit there okay i get advantage so i'm actually using-- okay so i'm using sharpshooter then thank god natural 20 so this is going to suck for him does it i'm back to three every time i crit that's right math okay so i get double points right that's how this-- okay oh that kind of sucks seven 14 24 25 30 points of damage (cheering) out of idle curiosity if i try to make a break for it they would get two attacks of opportunity against me right ooh that doesn't make my life any better does it no never mind then actually you know what i'm pulling an action surge two more shots i'm shooting him two more times while he's on the ground same thing with a plus ten to hit with a sharpshooter disadvantage 23 to hit let's see sorry trying to do this five plus 16 so 21 points of damage and now i'm going to take that last shot and swing up and shoot at the one that's to the right of-- that one right there oh god natural 20 i'm just sitting in the corner going (maniacal laughter) i'm in the pajamas with the butt flap and the butt flap is down the butt flap is down

are i'm just going to take two pot shots at him as i'm running by and just because i don't really care i'm going to take the negative-- the sharpshooter plus damage negative to that so 16 and i'll just do both right now and-- i got another 20 thank you this is phenomenal i know i've got such terrible things that are going to happen to me because of all this good luck so that's-- i'll do the first one really quickly that's 20 points of damage for the first shot 32 points you're going to make me change the sharpshooter thing by the end of this round i get the-- it's kind of spectacular i keep rolling 20s i keep rolling 20s really poorly normally i'm coming grog guys that's very fair that's very fair you should write a song about aldor and i say we could just cut out the tongue it's
