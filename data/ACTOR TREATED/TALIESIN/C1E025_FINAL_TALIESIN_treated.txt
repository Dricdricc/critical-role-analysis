walk to the very edge of the spell right here so i'm standing one closer to our friend there not just to you i want to be close to the big strong schmuck is the broker holding anything is he is he using a weapon just a shortsword okay before i start to do anything i'm going to look at him look him in the eye what is wrong with you don't you see there is nothing here for you run away before you die there is no option and i'm just going to start unloading natural 20 (yelling) pepperbox that's 16 points of damage to the broker i'm just shooting at the broker that is doubling both of the dice now a sharpshooter shot sharpshooter shot misses and another shot seven 19 all right cool that's eight points of damage blowing an action surge and firing three more times that's 25 that's ten points of damage plus four points of fire damage sharpshooter shot that's a 22 that's 21 points of damage another sharpshooter shot with ice fire finally i get the breakdown on that one the gun jammed i put

onto this i'm going to get a little weird and i'm taking straight chest shots and i'm just firing chest shots and i'm just making a hole the size of a baseball in his chest and as it happens as i keep unloading the gun still breaks and i'm still pulling the trigger (yelling) you fool your soul is forfeit die die i'm going to look at the other two and start pulling out my bigger gun and putting on the fucking mask a d6 inspiration die oh this is embarrassing 17 wait with intimidation 19 mask gun fuck it also just checking does my glove still have a charge by the way okay i mean is there any indication like it would have a slight glow to it that is the end of my turn that is the tiniest cheat sheet ever lillith does this mean you are free from those who are hunting you your accent good we
