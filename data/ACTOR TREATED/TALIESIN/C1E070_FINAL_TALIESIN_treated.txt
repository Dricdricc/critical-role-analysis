hi ugh my product it's going to be a halloween treat war harder apparently not they could've been though i was nodding like yeah verdant lightning i have that (german accent) we'll be doing these accents-- register my voting center actually has a tank out front that's a national guard center that we play on the tank there'll be a picture of me with a tank later yeah it's nice i think perhaps if i may be so bold as to tidy up what keyleth is trying to drive home here is that for all intents and purposes from this side of the table you strike me as a desperate creature who's pretending that he has a choice to be here and has brought-- she excuse me that is another conversation you've brought very little to the table we are not impressed with your notions that somehow we can work together you need us and this is all you bring (scoffs) where is asum where is asum let's stop pretending you have a choice here i'm comfortable with that being a conversation that happens later before we would consider any terms we would need the white dragon removed from the playing field really this is a conversation about whether or not we wait to try and kill you until before or after the cinder king that's fair i think oh we know it is i'm not keyleth your threats they won't bend me because i believe you i believe that you would rend this entire city asunder that's why i'm at the table i am conscious of where we are i'm conscious of who you are and i'm conscious of what you need i'm just trying to make sure that everybody's clear that the minute that red dragon dies all bets are off you know it as well as i do and you should be wary because only one side of this table is underestimating the other thank you grog one step at a time white dragon how willing do you feel to be a participant in his demise get your hands dirty well i assume once he's dead either you'll turn on us or you'll run away either way works for me no i want a dead dragon yes grog once the white dragon's off the board then we will hammer out whatever promises can be made but until then there's just many players on the field to say one way or another it must be so humiliating for you that you need to turn to us for help you do have my pity in that regard it's the chicken soup of dungeons and dragons you don't have to is it two days until the white dragon of course if he did find out he was here it would be very easy to turn the two of them against each other it is of great consolation in fact i would go so far as to say that i am willing to say that these talks will continue post the destruction of the white dragon so long as these talks take place in whitestone we'll have enough and if there is no whitestone to hold talks in there will be no talks he is correct i'm really enjoying that also they could've avoided it entirely and waited for us to go to draconia as opposed to having someone come by to remind us that we were going to draconia in the first place it seems like an awful lot of work honestly because it would damage the castle i don't recommend lists the only reason i'm stopping you from doing this-- and i swear this is the truth-- is because this is my home there would be nothing left you will join us in the fight against the white dragon nope that's not the deal we will consider your offer once the white dragon is dead not a minute before this is everything of a negotiation you fool your life a cure to yourself your desperation is so obvious would you like to see it have you of course he-- one dead white dragon and then-- one dead white dragon and then the negotiations continue we will speak to no one of what you truly are although we may caution others that we're looking a bit sideways at seeker asum that's also fair whitestone will not fall if whitestone falls all deals are off if whitestone is attacked all deals are off you keep it off the radar that'll do do you never go into my room do you never look at what i'm working on thus also exposing the city we will be attacked that will be the end of whitestone i guarantee you the complete lack of satisfaction that you feel when she's finally dead will be just as potent two days from now no i'm going to disagree i think that everything that she said is the truth and i think that she's not saying an awful lot more deception is far less interesting if you're not telling the truth all the time and i think she's telling a lot of truth just not nearly all of it they're far more tricky than simple lies and i think that we've heard an awful lot of truth so yes i'm willing to work with what we have i believe we're all on the same page yes we agree i'm in this far okay we've gone far enough off the track okay reeling it back we will reconvene tomorrow for battle plan for travel tomorrow morning to arrange travel and the battle plan towards-- no that she hasn't already creeped into let's be fair i'm not changing the status of the castle she has the same status she had before there's no sense in changing them thank you captain kirk i'm content with this thank you see you tomorrow while you're whispering sam's got another rap for you hey-o the feather shirt really adds the whole-- (laughter) downstairs to the real room to the real room downstairs downstairs to the real room do not absolutely do not think that's a good idea we're really not i know how hard that was i know and i wish i could say i did as well as you did when it was my turn we can't spy on her well we can spy on her but we have to be careful we shouldn't spy on her when she's speaking to thordak because thordak might see it which would mean that plan or no plan everything would be ruined and then if i were her i would destroy this city and all of us as quickly as possible and run that's true yes it could it also and this is a third option (sighs) thordak could have tasked her with bringing us to him in a way that he feels comfortable with and only then will he cure her i believe he holds the cure as sway which means that we do have an ally for defeating the white dragon sam and well if the opportunity presents itself if the opportunity presents itself to kill her there in a way that is fitting and where we have advantage then yes in draconia which is highly possible sometimes we can notice but often-- the other thing that can happen is we can set different forms of attack when we finally go against thordak so that we have our mode of entry and the way that we are going to be moving that attack forward and make sure we have secondary lines of attack that she will have no knowledge of that we will keep separated from her a bit but not a lot there's just not enough time that we know of it's a good start it's brazen i like it there's no easy way to do this can i make a history check there's no defeating a barista not history it'd be religion one day there will be a creature whose name we don't make fun of liam and we are the peter parker of this game we walk around mocking things there's like this seventh ring of hell where they're all hanging out going and then they called me purvan i was named after my grandfather man i'll send one of the guards to go bring her in do we have a library to consult i think it's a great idea the worst thing that happens is it's going to have to fight two dragons we have its name they can't all be dragons does the little black orb absorb that and suddenly the demon-portal-hell opens oh that's all it took (laughter) i'm going to go research but we do have priests we have two priests you could also always pray to the raven queen i did yeah a 20's a 20 investigation 21 after that minus three but this is a natural 20 well that's intimidating yes i think the dragon will be pleased i'm fine either way it's very helpful whoever survives-- we both go out the door at the same time please-- i've a few things i think we should do first i think we should brew some tea and not drink it no just to have some poison maybe we'll make it in the morning i was actually thinking if we had a bit of poison and if we could get it into the system of one of the larger creatures at some point a big pot of poison maybe raishan's not going to drink tea and die yeah i want to go downstairs and i want to see if grog will give me all of the guns to go upstairs and look at our giant cache of guns that we suddenly have marisha and what are the actual chances that he will even know how to operate it i'm not talking to either of you i'm talking to the powers that be don't do that at home kids just don't do that oh good we need to go through the guns we need to see what we have we need to clean them up i've got a plan i do i need to clean up the guns you do that's right you were very clever i have a book it's a very nice book no no i have a cloak would you like a cloak the guns i thought we were making a trade here all right do you want a cloak then no i've just got a cloak (laughter) it looks smashing and it's quite warm yes it is a cloak of smashing i'll need them all no i need them all i really don't have anything else well no i need to clean-- (chuckles) i sort of need those glasses-- yes is everybody here is everybody watching us i don't trust him either i did have siblings i'm aware of how this happens four i need the glasses because i can't see things that are up close i can see things that are far away perfectly fine i don't know he also has ripley's gun why don't we come inside so i can explain to you my plan so that you can feel good-- i have a title i can title you would you like a title all right i will title you if you give me everything that i need i need all the ammunition all the guns especially the complicated guns i'm going to need everything all right no plate armor and greatsword are completely up to you grand poobah de doink of all of this and that of all of this and that it comes with no money and no land but it is a title no it's hey you over there hey you guy sweet chestnut oh yes they're used in very different ways okay or the shortened versions thereof you will enjoy them i'm sure we will all enjoy them didn't even bother to insight check did you that's great that makes me so happy i'd actually have to teach you how to use it you are aware of that maybe we'll have that conversation i'm going to take a look at their various levels of repair i want to take a look at how they look how many of them need work how many of them are at least functional i'm going to do this not in private but i'm going to be then i want to look at ripley's gun oh my god really this is mean i missed everything i'll watch it on the preview because this is a-- now i'm aware okay i'm going to do my best to clean and work on these guns tonight and at some point i'm going to send a guard to find vax good man oh good it's you not at all i was actually hoping you would stop in mostly break quite successfully i assume it was vague and unhelpful excellent you're welcome (sighs) i'm terrified but other than that i think i'm good i would assume it was the sphinx that was guarding her treasure oh you should take a look at this and i point at the open book with the picture look what we have that is our friend my door's open i'm in my thing but it's open and i've already sent people to send for-- yes and if all goes well which it never does that will be fighting the white dragon and possibly the green dragon and one of the two of them will kill the other and then we swoop in and clean up what's left i know i understand i feel the same way it's probably not going to work it's probably going to go terribly i think it might work i'm feeling good about that no-- yes that is something in a jar it's not a brain though call for a guard there's one literally down the hall no i see what you're getting at this is luring her away somewhere she'll spend some power i think the ceiling would give how i think far away on another continent is a great idea i'm happy just to take her she's going to follow us already it depends if i needed them i would put myself in a position of safety make myself useful and then make sure i was back somewhere where they would not attack me as quickly as possible if i didn't need them i would turn on them immediately after the fight if we die her plan foils if we do not feel she put in enough effort her plan also foils my feeling is use your treachery-- where are we we're in my shop right now okay we go through with it we made an agreement i say we honor it until such point as it is deeply inconvenient vax your boy your boy i'm thinking of creating a company of shot for the castle with these guns do you think that would be a position that would suit him guards that would be forbidden from carrying these weapons outside the walls of the castle itself and would arm the parapets if there was an attack from a dragon hopefully a better judge than i am i'm a big believer in second chances at least i am now i wanted to check with you i thought this was something that i assumed you would have some insight into he may already know a bit he spent some time around them which is also why i thought it might be helpful well i figured we would talk to him i'm still not 100% we are going to be fighting these dragons and i am not at my best i'll continue to work on these bring him down when you find him tinkering check stop that where did all my dice go okay apparently i have three dex proficiency if i recall okay that's a 29 a 27 and a 13 she's been helping me clean mary says a lot of things yes she has kept secrets from us and we have a perfectly legitimate reason for not telling no we have a very-- fine we still have a perfectly reasonable reason for not telling anyone which is that if we tell people the city gets destroyed you are welcome to tell her and then we have to deal with the city being destroyed as opposed to staying here she will she's a soldier they're used to not being told things we can tell her not to come well we can make that clear then tell her that there are aspects of this fight that sadly must remain secret that it's far more dangerous than we could possibly even explain-- and that things may go completely tits-up even if we tell her the truth she's still going to want to come i don't want to tell her no i'm happy for her not to come because i don't want to tell her because i don't trust-- i barely trust us to keep this secret let alone another person i'm okay with this plan you really won't we go in the morning no i was assuming we would go there tomorrow set everything up and then have it happen the day after we can go camp in our house deep in-- we go there we set up raishan can handle herself tomorrow that'll give kik a chance to replenish no wait might as well test the waters shut the door lock it this is not how i wanted this to go down but apparently this is how it's happening-- wait a minute your boy is gone by now right we sent him out i'm going to go take the boy for a stroll and show him how this is going to work and explain to him everything gentlemen you actually plan how we're going to kill dragons excuse me give me strength seven minutes six minutes this is precisely why you people need me four minutes look at that she says she can't lie and there she did it so well i'm listening in to this whole thing through the earphone as i'm talking that's how i keep telling you how long you have because i'm laughing so much i'm going to let asum in on our plan no i left with him i haven't been in the room because i took him away oh no i've walked kynan to show him how i would like things to function i'm going to attune animus and drop the gloves of missile snaring for this fight well all right we'll have to have a talk about that is it all right if i let asum know what our basic plan is we're leaving now we'll be heading there the fight will be tomorrow there will be a creature that we will lure and bait the white dragon with we will attack at the end we expect to see her participation if we are not acutely aware of it all deals are off i relay that information i knock asum i walk away assuming that asum will know where to find me i go back to gathering my things pulling powder and shot out of what was necessary i apologize i hope i didn't disrupt anything important tonight we go to draconia tomorrow we fight the dragon we will bait him with another creature of great strength-- i don't think anything you've ever heard of before what the hell i pull out the book and show him the picture sorry thank you yeah there's a lot of gender issues in this i figured that quite possibly in private you and i have the closest dispositions once that fight has concluded we mop up whatever is left we expect to see your participation in some form i understand if it can't be direct obviously we may have some extra people with us as well that sadly i cannot inform although there will be draconians they are disinterested in our politics i would hope not but i understand your point of view i will say for the sake of this encounter our point of view will be dominant but i understand and respect yours when dealing with ants you must respect the needs of ants surely you understand so there will be that we will have a couple of accompanying members as well but since you're staying hidden it shouldn't be a problem i would recommend not showing up in this form at the very least we will be leaving on our own you will have to meet us there i'm sure getting to draconia shouldn't be too much of a problem for you it does but sadly we are trying to keep our own reality quiet the needs of ants and also they don't want you around they don't trust you surely you can find a faster way you got here very quickly you so rarely lie that i'm so fascinated that when you do i think i'm starting to get your tells just a bit of them i take that as the highest compliment see you tomorrow i turn the corner get far enough away and drop to my knees and breathe deeply for a minute head to the sun tree wow it was an appropriate usage of the word very well done very good she's downstairs with her wood you smell of pine of what that's a lot of mind-- i'm okay with this that felt fair oh no he had that coming we can only apologize for him so much yes i'll be the last one out no 11 let's find a place to hide the mansion and sleep yeah shut the door she has guards we also have the leader of the dragonborn we can see where he is right now there will be guards at the guard stations all around the outside just the guards and it's not really allies at all everybody will turn the moment it looks-- that's your dex save not your dex modifier i have to sleep it off i feel terrible so i'm just going to sleep we're going to tell tooma to tell the dragon that they've found something to kill and take him out into the wastelands where we're going to release it we could send i would say vax-- very close no just them if they run into a problem-- should be fine we're not attacking the dragon i'm a halloween fan myself nothing is going to go wrong everything is great and an army yeah and i'm annoyed that i know what that perception check was about and that percy doesn't know it really annoys me yeah i do
