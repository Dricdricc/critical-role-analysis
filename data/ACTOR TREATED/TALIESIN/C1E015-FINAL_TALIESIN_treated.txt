oh hello thank you i just got off an airplane hi the flight was-- it was slightly shorter than the drive here hi this looks good (high-pitched) it's really good yeah we can find them a nice lady to date i think it would work out pretty well i got one too i got the manual of quickness of action i'm keeping this one i think pike should have the belt my question is once you grow the beard if you remove the belt does the beard fall off or do you get to keep the beard because then you guys could just switch around until everyone had the appropriate amount of facial hair i wouldn't well that solves it there hasn't been enough in-game time for this to have actually taken hold yet has there the manual of quickness of action it takes 48 hours worth of reading it okay so i'll have to wait i'm starting this i've been looking forward to that conversation for two weeks it's been sitting going maybe he'll say this i don't know you did turn him into a mouse but he then did get the killing blow i like to be contrary you look like merlin from excalibur i've got a book i have chicken i have some tinkering i'd like to do i would like to try and build a couple things i have a list actually no no arrows are on the list i want to start working on some sort of tazing implement for direct contact i want to do an electrical charge that i can rev up there's that i have a list of things how many things can i start poking with in two days that's a week-long thing night vision into my current existing helmet there's no way that i could try to pull that together damn it so this boils me down to two thoughts this is good i want to put a slight dent into the barrel of bad news to get a ricochet shot so that it basically allows me when i shoot a bullet to also do 1d12 worth of damage to one target that is immediately adjacent to the main target shrapnel it's not quite shrapnel it's a ricochet but yes it is basically a shrapnel shot yeah like a bank shot a secondary lesser damage would it be possible if i did it to one of the barrels of-- ah okay okay i'll start the taser and work on some arrows then that's what i'd like to do stuff's expensive man it's tough to tell he sort of has that look i'll do my tinkering rolls and then i'm good i wanted to work on a grappling-hook arrow that attaches to the unending-- that ties to the unending rope so that we have actually something that will pierce heavy stone and anchor like batman i don't know why batman's on the brain right now could be any reason all right first tinkering roll is 13 12 just proficiency bonus damn it i feel inspired there we go now i feel inspired i actually don't even remember but it wasn't that bad all right so that's 18 (sings) tinkering on a prayer 100 gold and then i want to try and recreate the exploding arrow as my last little thing i want to do today sounds like a day spa for the first time you're safe ye olde icyhot yes i'm going to try for three exploding arrows and i've built one before thank you another 150 gold all right i certainly do i know exactly what you mean no now i'm nervous 18 all right 15 natural 20 (cheering) you would mark it so you have a grappling hook arrow two exploding arrows and one exploding arrow with a star i'm getting to kiss everybody in this game i've already made my way through siblings this is getting-- all right i've kissed the twins i have well thank you possibly reusable call it a bear-rel roll listen to the tiny disembodied head oh percival fredrickstein klossowski von mussel de rolo iii at your service orion laura and they call me percy quite quite no no no no tiberius if you would be so kind yes putting it in the box on the way back i think once the horn is off the ship oh dear it's all right she can fly we've gotten to sleep there for two days percy was the third of seven children born to a noble family who lived far to the north in the ancient castle of whitestone with so many siblings to share the burdens of lordship percy turned his attentions to the sciences engineering and naturalism one day a mysterious couple named lord and lady briarwood came to court during a feast held in their honor the briarwoods violently took control of the castle killing or imprisoning everyone who would stand in their way percy awoke chained in the dungeon only to be freed by his younger sister together they fled chased by the briarwoods' men as they ran percy's sister took several arrows to the chest and fell percy kept running eventually jumping into a freezing river and floating unconscious to freedom he did not remember waking up on a fishing boat he barely remembered the next two years as he slowly made his way as far south as possible then one night percy had a dream a roaring cloud of smoke offered him vengeance against those who destroyed his family when he awoke percy began to design his first gun (gunshot) we're going to do that we're going to shoot a rap video i think he underestimates how naturally pretty we all are yes i'm going to spend that time reading my book i'm reading that book anti-petrify i'm working on it i'm working on it i'm working on it ugh that's the worst initiative i am capable of having nine grapple-grapple laura and that's such dick what is that thing at the very front of the ship that is the least innocent thing she's killed in this game so far but well-trained i like that little dance looks quite nice how far away am i from that wyvern that's currently attacking everybody yeah this will be funny okay i'm going to back up and sit down against the back wall of the ship i'm going to pull out the biggest gun i have so i'm going to pull out bad news i'm going to sit down i'm going to take aim and i'm going to do-- i'm going to spend a grit and try and take a wing shot at this yes well we'll see if it works i'm shooting him in the wing 18 okay 19 20-- really where's my d12s i was not prepared for this here we go 14 points of damage and he has to make a constitution saving throw 23 okay that wyvern drops hard 20 feet boom all right thank you and i reload like possibly pathfinder a while turn into a flying shark intelligent flying shark save every one of us i think he's going to hit a lot of bludgeoning damage when he hits the ocean you've got to grip the table for that i'm going to just hold on to bad news as i'm flicking around i'm going to pull out my pepperbox i'm going to take a wing shot at that bastard right there (laughs) 29 that definitively hits so let's figure out what we're going to do to this person that's nine points of damage plus a 14 constitution saving roll-- so it drops 20 feet he still has him in his claws though all right i'll take another shot at him i'm going to make this a fire shot and i'm going to try to get him to drop him now 16 all right let me just make sure i'm doing this right yeah no damage but he drops him all right and then i'm going to spend the rest of my move getting up getting situated and then moving a little bit where's my-- yeah i'm going to move a little bit further up the-- yeah like right about there are you proud of yourself you look proud and majestic inspire yourself i'm counting on you yes batman way to go nameless guard dubstep poor life choices yay in one of 20 dimensions you're awesome right now all right i'm taking out the pepperbox i'm going to turn towards it and just unload ten total ten 22 i'm using my bonus action using my action surge that misses and then 19 yeah that's two hits i was also using my sharpshooter mode for that so that i can do some extra damage and that's number one that's-- 20 points of damage plus one point of ice damage and the next one is-- 25 points of damage and one point of fire damage western-style i'm just going to-- i'm going to fan the hammer i'm going to just tear that wing off oh look everyone we still have one to interrogate isn't that nice i'll go check you interrogate if they were clever they didn't leave the room i'm going to run down and check the box i'm going downstairs i'm knocking on the door all right desona lady kima hello yes pirates we've taken care of it do you need anything is everything all right almost feels like cheating okay as long as everything is fine there was no incidents nothing unusual excellent i'll report upstairs then carry on everybody seemed fine they said no events nothing-- guards in a room i mean really my insight was the box was still there welcome back everybody this is way better than e3
