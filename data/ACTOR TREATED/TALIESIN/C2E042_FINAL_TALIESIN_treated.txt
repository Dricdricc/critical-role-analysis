i brought a copy actually i forgot to bring it out onto the table but i have a copy that we'll probably play it's got little stand-up trees and the little creatures are very miyazaki-looking and the whole thing's got a very candyland for goth kids vibe the dice glow which i also think is really cool calligraphed you got a participant trophy well we should take a look around maybe get a sense of this place since we're going to be here for a while when they fix the ship i have a few things i'm looking for we could do that sure i guess she's a heather i'll stand how many of them are true believers give or take i'm terrible at these 26 is there anybody who's awkwardly into it but definitely would probably walk away if they could is there anybody who's a little-- that'll do shattered teeth what's the shattered teeth did your teeth shatter is that a place oh i could fill a book with what i don't know you didn't even ask him if there's a bookshop nearby that's two punches taken away it's like someone ordered a special at an extremely expensive tiki bar marisha and that's why i have my tiki mug today i'm looking for a blacksmith actually as well somebody worth their salt since worth your salt is a really nice term that's great worth their salt somebody worth their salt it's worth my salt oh i don't know i haven't really thought about it at all now that i think about it that's a good question i mean there's so much salt around to be fair it would probably take a lot of salt to be worth something i mean you could get it right out of the water everything is worth its salt at that point really it's a terrible currency has anyone been watching me drink i have been nursing the same cup the entire time and have been fake-sipping it the entire night i haven't actually had a drop whatever they handed me i've been doing this to be fair the entire time we've been together not heather make a note a fisherman here's a cube have a cube there's a cube i'm hoping this is a place where somebody named rachel diver may have bought a piece of land or something i was waiting for him to go bill murray damn what's allison been up to that sounds like a great idea what should we be looking out for is there some sort of natural dangers unnatural dangers oh that's a bad roll 11 outside i'm going to get some air maybe that is better i went out i'm standing by the front door bouncer-like and trying to get my bearings take a look around see what the vibe of this place is where are you guys talking oh never mind i'll have to secure the things-- i'm sitting out front i'm doing the door i think i'm doing all right i'm just contemplating where we're going from here i am a little more at ease i've only gotten drunk once in my life and that was because of nott i thought i'd try it didn't agree with me everything hurts and it's violently offensive to the body on every level that stuff's disgusting just awful well it feels polite and not everybody is as understanding as your friends you know i just sit in the corner and i listen to everything that i can for as long as i can and it got a little noisy in there and thought i'd get a little air oh yeah this place is dangerous she's dangerous i think that's a good idea and fjord you know why everybody's doing this why we're all here right i think you know it i just want to point it because that woman she doesn't care what any of us want i'm sure she'd be interested but it's way low on her priorities and i don't trust anybody who puts other people's needs that low on the list and you should keep mind of that while you're getting in bed with them so to speak nope what part of the body is the amigos okay amigos we share amigos that's even better i think i get it i'm not going to talk out of turn and i trust your intentions so-- you're asking if i can tell you're conflicted you'd be amazed but all right sure i'm so glad you put it that way you're a good man fjord so be careful because i imagine it's a little out of character being honest and truthful with somebody in a deceptive way it can muddle a good man up whereas it doesn't muddle a bad man up that's one of the reasons why i like you here for you man i've been learning to swim oh two are mysteriously vanished i think they were mumbling something about trying to find an alley-- we don't take that long i think 30 minutes is-- release that's where you're supposed to go god i love you so much you give so much (laughter) i want to take a night walk the crew should also have some place to sleep let's make sure everybody is taken care of they're having a bad time-- what do you guys want mr orly we feel terrible about everything that's going on we want to make you guys as comfortable as possible through this deeply inconvenient situation we've all found ourselves in appreciate your honesty what would not be an insult-- like that-- i know that would be an insult-- but what would not be an-- how many kids are here without question that's a good idea thank you kids we are-- unless something goes tragically wrong-- we expect to be returning and i imagine you'll hear word if things go tragically wrong how long do we expect to be gone for if it's two weeks the ship is yours i appreciate that hopefully you will not have to play a funeral dirge for us that's fair what's a mermaid how many teeth does a mermaid have-- what is that those are both very dangerous any idea how long ships have been going down in that region thank you for your time and thank you for your trust working on it let's take a walk let's see what there is to see i'm excited about this yeah like a tea-cozy a sword-cozy i caught a bit of that right actually i have to stop really quickly and use the bathroom there's these little outhouses over in the corner right here that drop straight down into the-- yeah it's like the tower bridge it's the tip of the tiny tiffany ship which one's tiffany 26 like orlando not everyone's a retired person or a college student somebody's got to actually clean that place up (laughter) i really do i have plans (laughter) deep plans amigo i'm lost i like marmalade that was a long walk that's in an emergency why are there two of you here franklin and eleanor roosevelt and then you're two people on a ship and you're involved in things and-- i mean it's a good emergency plan but can you only go once you can't go twice a few of us were eating apricots at the time you're very sneaky i can give you guys enhanced ability too for the remains of the evening you can pick something and both of you if you want to be better at something for a little while i wouldn't know how to help with that it also seems like a lot of commitment but okay i can keep an eye on that have we seen anything around like another tavern or something maybe a little i hate to say more upscale but cleaner something with less piles of shit behind it yes three rooms i don't know actually i'm following it actually for the first time this entire-- you'll be a good go between if we hear something bad we can get an owl to ship if you hear something then-- no no i don't think we-- we don't need to actually know what's going on in there why does anybody need to know that well i think the thing to do here i mean it just makes sense is that if you leave the room for any reason we send frumpkin to the ship they see frumpkin they know it's time to-- that's the signal i'm staying downstairs to wait for you to either come down or for her to leave i'm going to sit and probably try and find something non-alcoholic to drink so i don't have to be an idiot upstairs let me see yeah i think yasha is probably either with you-- she's either with you or with us i imagine how's a dex bonus go for you how's an advantage on dex or do you already have-- less that could possibly go wrong so before they go in i'm going to cast enhance ability on these two at a level three so i get two people that's fair all right it also will give you zero damage for a 20-foot fall if i give you a dex bonus but-- you have feather fall so you want charisma that's not helpful charisma unless you make a decision in the next 30 seconds cool and you're getting wisdom you have advantage on wisdom you have advantage on charisma then right before you go in i'm going to give you guys both a resistance bump before we push them through the door just in case you need it for one minute they can add a d4 to a saving throw is it just a general d4 bonus a cantrip you touch one willing creature once before the spell ends the target can roll a d4 and add the number to its roll oh you're right absolutely never mind then not a big deal thank you i'm getting used to this concentration does nott's cloak unattune if they take it off you still have-- we're bad at everything oh no oh no i think i'm going to join in really quickly is everything all right you guys need anything i've been sober all evening so i'm happy to help who got stabbed waldok got stabbed but waldok's so nice who would stab waldock that's terrible where did you hear this from where did this come down from oh he seems okay i guess come here we're going to patch you right up c'mon i'll take care of this everybody come on let's do this yeah how bad is it okay i'm going to give him a level two cure wounds to get him going that'd ought to heal him right all right let's do a level two let's see what that looks like that's 2d8 don't know why i'm being so fuddy-duddy about this do i get a specialty-- no it's only when i'm healing myself okay 18 okay you're going to want to sit down take it easy for a while i wouldn't get up for like a good half hour be very gentle on yourself why don't we get this man a drink why don't you get that man a drink someone was eating gems in bed that's loud okay all right sure just a purple tiefling you have advantage i've never seen your eyes glaze over like that matt how's that charisma bonus working out for you i'm wet and upset why did you do that he's walking she's swimming unless you'd have taken that dex bonus and then nothing would have happened at all but you didn't you're both wet talking to the guy we're bonding man these guys are pretty okay once you get to know them weird night well everything's not quiet on this end one of our kids apparently got stabbed by-- well one of the crew stabbed the other crew i can't imagine why that happened there's been no word but i assume it's just probably pandemonium all over everyone's pretty happy though you should come down and have a drink with everybody i hope someone has followed this right back to the inn so that's good i'll tell you what obviously whatever went down-- we're going to just go make sure everything's copacetic back at the boat we'll be back in just a couple minutes just going to make sure everything-- yeah we'll let you know i'll walk brazenly down to the ship with you we'll go check it out anyway i'm going down do i see a commotion from here nothing crazy going on on our ship i don't see some figures or anything really i would never well that's fine because even with a-- (counting) 22 with disadvantage (laughter) i might see if there's a torch-bearer walking around really quickly excuse me sir we had a little trouble on our ship earlier i was curious if everything was all right i heard a little commotion well if i wanted to find out what went down do you know who i would talk to i'll be right back i'm going to go find a guard and ask them what's up i just want to find out what was up from somebody really does he need healing i can do that or otherwise yeah i'll take care of it real quick oh in that case healing word level three make a medicine check yeah that'll do that's a 23 i love this character so much it's all right there you go let's give him a cure wounds level three just to-- or what does he look like a level two or a level three to you a level two should be sufficient all right let's just take care of this can you tell me what happened son 21 while you were up the crow's nest what happened it looks fine up there what did you-- what was the last 24 hours for you what did you i mean like i don't-- oh no (sighs) i may have left some of the fruit that we picked up in our last stop in the kitchen i don't know what you've been eating for the last-- that's maybe my fault i really hope it isn't but-- seven i'm going to be worried-- i'm going to check to make sure i've got all this just in case because that sounds awfully familiar do you need a drink come on we're going to bring you back it's okay poor guy come on i'm bringing back-- i'm going to just sort of-- yeah bring him back and then tell everybody i'm definitely going to tell everyone my fruit theory because i'm down a fruit i'm tired he's very stern for charlie adler don't you have a spell you can cast that solves this problem if you just bring everything out really quickly i'll cast detect magic on there i'll cast detect magic in the meantime nah he's fine oh wow we're literally looking at them right now and i detected magic before we opened the boxes that one's got a little bit of tingle to it i'd be worried about that one why don't you take a look at that really quickly that book's not worth its circle of salt perception check insight check i'm pretty low so what do you got 13 what was the necklace while we're here well really what's the necklace before we go any further to make sure it's not a come-find-my-shit is there any part in the book that is actually a cipher for its own okay it would be amazing if you pulled this off but not this one take a second to identify the necklace so we don't get-- yeah here's the thing are we going to remove the mention of you from the book there's no way of inferring within the book-- but it doesn't connect the newcomers to the new chosen one could not infer that the new chosen was part of the newcomers from the way she wrote it or no is it separated thoughts all right worst-case scenario is we could mend a page and it will remove the ink if we want to delete anything it's very helpful that might be either-- in the best case scenario i would say if we could hide this is someone else's room underneath their bed i would love for these to be in somebody else's room it's still going to be findable to anybody who's looking for it though i would really recommend putting it i don't know somewhere where we don't mind it being very specifically found especially if we're trying to-- well i hate to put it that way but uh i don't know this seems-- that doesn't matter it's still in her room we have to make sure that you survive long enough to get it there i mean i wish you'd just grabbed the book that would make life more easy yeah we do we still need to prove the book that's too much i feel like we can take the book to him i think if we say that we knew about the plot we suspected and were looking for proof-- we have a copy of the contents of the book i think he'd kill both of them i think sending it with-- just sending it to him and just giving it to him-- i would almost say if we could give him the whole kit and kaboodle everything that was stolen top to bottom with a note saying this is the full-- i say translate the one page give the cipher so that they can figure it out on their own let's give the whole thing to him just all the jewels all the box the whole thing top to bottom we'll be fine then we can take our boat let's let them make any insinuations they want the crew will fall the way they will again i think giving too much is too much the guy's itching for a reason to get rid of her let's give him what he wants no conditions no terms nothing in the safe maybe we're not going to translate the whole book just one page well how is she going to get the book back does that make sense he's making the cipher let's rip a few pages out no i'm going to my room it'll wake us up though oh new spells i thought-- okay we're-- okay new plan sure it's in the safe that's not true everything comes out what's going on man hey good morning i'll go get dressed i'll grab my stuff how long does that take the whole thing pop out of the room that-- oof yeah it was no problem well it looked-- that leg was pretty rough hmm i can-- no i can find creatures i can't find objects it can only go better we have video man i didn't do it
