golden girls 000150744 --> 000153955 travis marisha and contentious 000156619 --> 000158033 it's entertaining 000526248 --> 000531248 this will be you one day 000532760 --> 000534117 i don't even-- 000535847 --> 000538153 we succeeded 000539277 --> 000547493 we did it was nice we played it more like minecraft really like minecraft with 000552424 --> 000558585 snipers oh this is such a nice garden we're-- and it's over i don't even know what happened 000558585 --> 000601459 we found a bunker 000602725 --> 000604207 i really enjoyed that bunker 000605527 --> 000606147 there was balloons 000607162 --> 000611522 of course 001715882 --> 001722458 yeah 001825608 --> 001830988 that's actually a good idea i'm also going to-- 001836925 --> 001841567 perception checks 001848209 --> 001849226 also i'm going to cast eyes of the grave i'm going to do this a couple times 001852341 --> 001853318 eyes of the grave that's perception of 22 001900341 --> 001902260 oh with disadvantage 001903621 --> 001909438 oh okay i thought we had put them back up 001917438 --> 001919132 12 001923890 --> 001925081 with eyes of the grave 001926560 --> 001931293 yeah the sheet of paper you turned in nine months ago 002022164 --> 002028665 i'm perfectly happy to head towards this 002120253 --> 002121366 quick point of order who's got the node we should probably decide now 002933718 --> 002935294 who was the last to node are you noded 002937278 --> 002940414 you node 002942662 --> 002943457 i assume we would have done it i was just playing flashback but i don't know 002950152 --> 002952303 that was more of a point of order 003005607 --> 003010566 do you need a light 003148795 --> 003149462 all right 003150171 --> 003158559 well this is a mess 003908621 --> 003909302 i think doing a once-over might not be a bad idea 003937612 --> 003940548 maybe bring the little octopi with you 003955255 --> 003958503 oh okay that's a-- 004000188 --> 004003224 that's-- okay 004005111 --> 004009616 i think we should probably all stick together one way or the other 004012857 --> 004014048 i'm going to let the flora and fauna in here know that we're looking for some stuff one 004048323 --> 004052068 of our people used to live here we'll be gone and everything's going to be fine 004052068 --> 004101167 how big a creature does it look like was taking a-- 004118276 --> 004120359 14 004127025 --> 004135206 maybe it's time to-- 004256147 --> 004300333 just a little walk around just to get a sense of the place 004305984 --> 004313870 hm no 004347659 --> 004356229 thank you petco 004741330 --> 004742391 yeah i don't know if i was quite outside yet i think beau and i maybe switch 004814229 --> 004816352 places if that's okay 004816352 --> 004818062 crickets 004903954 --> 004905404 four 004940886 --> 004943134 i mean it means your advantage cancels that out though so-- 005431232 --> 005435984 good to know 005906737 --> 005911284 it went great 010128095 --> 010129153 what does slow give them 010530144 --> 010531687 am i going to double this up how are you feeling 010634861 --> 010641229 pretty good i'm going to use a bonus action-- i can do two first level spells in a 010646129 --> 010648508 round right if one's bonus action one is an action that's fine 010648508 --> 010649318 just one or the other 010650681 --> 010652601 cantrip there we go thank you i'm going to scoot past you with half of my action if 010657911 --> 010703594 that's okay and take a look outside to see what's up how far away-- 010703594 --> 010706718 i have five feet no matter what okay goddamn there's no getting back in anyway so 010718765 --> 010726207 fuck it yeah there's no sense trying to get back inside i'm just going to be vulnerable how far 010726207 --> 010730175 away is that one is that more than 30 feet away 010730175 --> 010731516 there's no way i can get close enough to get within 30 feet right now is there 010735201 --> 010739568 you know what it's not like distance is a problem here i'll go in an angle and de-clump-- 010746392 --> 010747622 yeah right there 010747622 --> 010752473 i think all three of those are within 30 feet then at this point i think that's pretty 010755480 --> 010757538 fair i'm casting bane on all three of them 010757538 --> 010800469 (oohing) 010800469 --> 010802098 that's a charisma save against 16 010805171 --> 010808673 they all take a negative d4 from an attack or saving throws all three of them 010829620 --> 010831591 it's not a bad 1st-level spell 010833733 --> 010841518 that's everything i can do 010853753 --> 010856887 wait take negative d4 to that too 011056650 --> 011057836 wait what 011114241 --> 011117181 okay ah well but it's still got bane 011119297 --> 011120894 you got baned 011126020 --> 011127449 bane's pretty cool 011129025 --> 011132098 hey eh 011209076 --> 011211146 you may not be able to get to him 011358451 --> 011401620 with a negative d4 011513192 --> 011514709 minus four or minus a d4 011621800 --> 011628028 don't you fuck around with me 011629486 --> 011635713 minus-- well it doesn't matter because it can still only bring it down to 18 right 011717658 --> 011719489 what 011720664 --> 011722029 no i'm saying that with the d4 it wouldn't bring that attack down at all would it 011725601 --> 011727128 enough to be managed 011727128 --> 011737013 well i'm canceling the critical anyway 011740016 --> 011744938 nope 011802726 --> 011811708 yeah 012020183 --> 012022814 we don't want them reporting back to people 012038725 --> 012041831 27 012055370 --> 012059969 11 months from now do you have the rusty key 012438456 --> 012442581 how many people got hurt in that fight by the way three of us i think took damage 012705668 --> 012707461 while we're walking it's going to be about a ten-minute walk is it insane to-- 012715317 --> 012716428 yeah as we're walking i'm going to start prayer of healing i guess i know it takes 012722876 --> 012726601 about ten minutes but it's a one-spell heal-all 012726601 --> 012728292 if that's okay everybody gets oh 17 points back 012738845 --> 012739797 i was waiting for it 013223805 --> 013228288 i mean i don't think that's-- 013242344 --> 013243755 regardless i'm blind regardless 013259813 --> 013302866 i can't see so i'll stick with somebody 013330129 --> 013331967 i'll stick with yasha 013344867 --> 013347022 yasha and clay and everyone else is singling or-- 013413668 --> 013415701 i think the notion is that you're not supposed to look directly in it some sort of 013605021 --> 013606203 thing maybe 013606203 --> 013607849 don't look at whatever the eye or light or thing-- i don't know 013611110 --> 013616296 thunk 013821291 --> 013825805 yeah i don't think that's a-- 014030320 --> 014032558 no 014033341 --> 014036205 i think they're going to be nervous that fjord doesn't speak the language and is moving at 014048484 --> 014050802 half-- plus he swims funny 014050802 --> 014053440 not for a fish person though 014056920 --> 014102559 i don't have-- 014243618 --> 014245343 there you go 014256463 --> 014302660 this is a terrible idea 014401577 --> 014402773 i don't think we should go in this way either 014426222 --> 014427538 i think that's a very reasonable plan 014620947 --> 014622400 one question this is definitely coral that we are sitting on top of right 014738897 --> 014746883 it is a protruding large slab of stone and not a big-ass mouth or anything like that right 014755561 --> 014757699 i'm looking at it (raspberry) 11 014807095 --> 014810579 it's been a day 014812559 --> 014818369 (exaggerated sighing) i'm putting tinfoil on my windows now i'm fucking done 014826755 --> 014828451 yes dm i think we send jester 014830905 --> 014833611 i think maybe we just don't take the coins maybe 015044718 --> 015047196 the minute i hear things start i'm going to cast some light on the walls so i can see shit 015208357 --> 015213598 we're in the room 021539525 --> 021540145 i may be blind other than what i can see but if i hit detect magic something's going 021547755 --> 021549689 to light up in my-- 021549689 --> 021552524 all right i'm just saying if there was something i feel like i would know that 021558413 --> 021601922 i'm going to cast detect magic why'd i put a question mark at the end of that 021606589 --> 021609101 i'm going to cast detect magic really quickly 021611910 --> 021622799 the magical aura's coming from the mouth of the cave 021627245 --> 021629913 oh it's where the light's being projected from i imagine but nothing in the room 021639373 --> 021646594 i would also be able to sense something magic through it that's buried up to three feet down 021659326 --> 021700260 okay i'm not getting any other pings in here 021703539 --> 021704666 just that weird thing up front nothing else 021708162 --> 021719885 i'm going to ask the kelp hey guys this feels a little ominous you'd let me know if 021808079 --> 021812438 there was something untoward happening around here right right 021812438 --> 021818626 thank you that is fair 021822125 --> 021824169 i'm proud of you for that hopefully that'll be the first good roll you've made tonight 021908212 --> 021910624 to be fair they don't really talk back but sometimes they can acknowledge these things 021917118 --> 021919013 besides it's polite 021919013 --> 021922369 i literally can't see anything right now 022047915 --> 022052160 things tend to live 022054961 --> 022057719 i would ask permission before putting a light in the kelp to see if there's anything in there 022144525 --> 022148090 when was the-- yeah all right 022204752 --> 022211688 did it trip my detect magic sense at all 022327246 --> 022328813 i'm going to do another detect undead really quickly 022338067 --> 022341502 all right eyes of the grave as an action you know the location of any undead within 022348334 --> 022352038 60 feet of you that isn't behind total cover and isn't protected from divination magic until the 022352038 --> 022353898 end of your next turn 022353898 --> 022357385 six seconds 022400658 --> 022409557 we have undead 022424236 --> 022426327 i don't know i'm literally blind i want to light this-- 022451767 --> 022455432 just to start i'm going to throw some light into the center of the kelp 022458488 --> 022505474 i think this thing is carnivorous 022553996 --> 022556259 yep 022557633 --> 022607491 i think we should leave 022613083 --> 022619069 yeah lights off 022632272 --> 022635015 i've still got a few minutes of detect magic so if anything-- 022658307 --> 022706544 i'm going to cast light really quickly too 022934121 --> 022936903 do i even have to bother or do i know what that is 023157513 --> 023200401 it's something different 023202374 --> 023208378 oh then i'm going to do the eyes of the grave one more time the minute i see it there's 023218887 --> 023221754 something else down here too 023221754 --> 023224143 you're going to take it 023233361 -->

--> 033534682 no a little-- i've got a pen for this oh my god it's dead now to be fair we've been 033540018 --> 033542828 using it for years just at the foot of the stairs 033542828 --> 033543991 yeah like there we'll make a nice long line so it'll be a little touchy-feely thing to 033548043 --> 033556631 get from one side to the other i'm going to hold my attack until i see her which is going to be a 033556631 --> 033558082 sacred flame 033558082 --> 033600466 as a bonus i'm going to do healing word on-- you are probably pretty down so i will throw 033614862 --> 033618583 you a tiny bit-- it's not a lot but it's nine points 033618583 --> 033620414 that was me 033633349 --> 033634655 and save against dex 16 033747540 --> 033749669 motherfucker 033751065 --> 033752362 yeah all i need 033754332 --> 033801163 you've got a d4 on saves also dex save 033857588 --> 033859453 six 033912945 --> 033918748 all right 033930273 --> 033946591 damn 034111788 --> 034115363 speed is halved 034204171 --> 034215151 technically i think you have line of sight from what i'm looking at right now 034234292 --> 034236132 damn it 034340668 --> 034341981 laura and you still know where she is because of hex though right 034348003 --> 034353538 who's up 034426653 --> 034428618 help 034432886 --> 034439517 yay thank you 034515735 --> 034516411 i'm just going to do the-- fjord you should probably get what we're looking for and get 034650970 --> 034657958 after her i'm going to hightail it towards where she was heading 034657958 --> 034658989 including burning an action 034705574 --> 034708147 yeah 034709220 --> 034710320 still have a reaction 034713213 --> 034714494 i can take a little more damage before i'm awful 034718243 --> 034720682 no 034756454 --> 034758231 yeah you can't do that no 034820526 --> 034825453 oh remember your extra d4 i forgot them 034857731 --> 034900393 19 034912170 --> 034912913 i'd rather not have this 035116533 --> 035119619 i don't feel okay with you being alone 035133376 --> 035136196 i'm going to do the same 035149895 --> 035152934 checks no saves and attacks 035237529 --> 035238474 i am basically holding ready to shoot a bolt at anything that moves and i was actually 035631656 --> 035640898 hanging a little bit far down just in case one of them drops i can heal and somewhere where i'm 035640898 --> 035644803 not going to get attacked by kelp and i'm keeping very aware 035644803 --> 035652508 i would have made my way a little bit further 035933312 --> 035934705 puncher of ghosts 040044137 --> 040046251 i can see this happen right 040142910 --> 040144796 sacred flame 040147389 --> 040149029 that's ten points of radiant damage 040156073 --> 040204419 i'm staying right at them and i'm looking for any movement while all this is happening 040252664 --> 040254249 23 040301719 --> 040302403 (whispering) this is such a bad idea 040655585 --> 040657028 i am just waiting for something to move 040817800 --> 040818451 i don't like this place 040853168 --> 040900888 are we out of the cavern now 040937496 --> 040940605 we're going to back out slowly get out of this cavern does everyone want to meet me 041015765 --> 041021095 right-- once we can see the surface of the water 041021095 --> 041022243 marisha and are we there we done 041024162 --> 041025002 (snapping) water walk 041026564 --> 041027865 we are going to jet to the surface of the water it's 60 feet around 041031522 --> 041037966 it wouldn't be a pressure thing because we have water in us anyway 041100432 --> 041104258 let's walk to the ship 041124471 --> 041129762 that's why i made sure to pack some stuff just in case let's get out of here that 041135090 --> 041136082 place gives me the creeps 041136082 --> 041138567 to keep pouring blood on well 041141513 --> 041142499 we'll be moving at twice speed since it's normal speed and not our halved speed 041158210 --> 041159270 you ever see those videos with the (tapping) walking on the pudding like that 041208144 --> 041214398
