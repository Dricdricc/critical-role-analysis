i think we're going to have our wednesday club this wednesday i think we're going to do wonder woman we were having a straw poll where i think we're going to be talking about wonder woman yeah we don't normally veer relevant but we figure this is kind of a big deal so you know and it's an interesting conversation no but i know of groo we don't know groo well enough to really delve in not the one you'll be on you'll watch it then okay (laughter) you gave me that really good comic book for-- was it christmas last year or the year before because i read it in colorado it was really nice a nintendo switch i'm with travis on this one it's just not the same no is this your first battle royale so what happens though is that the people who are obviously the problem often get targeted first and then it'll be other people who somehow have all their hit points in round four mr loot-drop may go down early four three yeah 29 ain't gonna have a repeat of last time i was just low enough if i had been above liam that would have been the end of him but he hid i'm going to activate the boots of spider climbing should knock that out i'm going to charge diplomacy and then i'm going to-- i ain't hiding that little hut actually how far-- i have a-- (counting) six one two three four five-- yeah let me get just one step back or so still at the edge on the other side though to your right yeah and boots are activated diplomacy is activated i can't who can i see i can barely see grog with three-quarters cover that's fine that's my first shot then let's just take a couple shots at grog you know if you hadn't made it all the way up that tower you'd be in intense trouble right now okay just pointing that out yeah i ignore three-quarters-- let's do first shot with animus that's a 29 to hit that hits all right let's just roll all three first oh no and then the second one is a misfire laura gun-break misfire it's gun-break misfire that's okay yeah so i'll just take my third shot with bad news just for fun 20 to hit one animus shot one bad news shot and i also take really quickly i take a little damage 2d6 psychic damage five six seven seven points of psychic damage did i-- no it doesn't matter anyway because i was going to call hex but i'll do it later fuck it all right let's roll i'm also going to run some cabal's ruin into this just for fun so let's do the first one is 1d10 yeah so 1d10 plus 1d6 so first shot is ten points of piercing damage and four points of psychic damage then the bad news is-- so that's cocked that's seven eight nine ten 11 17 points of piercing damage and let's just-- three four five six seven eight nine this is not halved is it i'm going to empty cabal's ruin into him 10d6 six 15 20 33 points of lightning damage i'm not going to blow my bonus for now but i am going to run down and across towards that tower towards you as far that way as i can go is there a door by the way in that thing okay i'll eventually be heading towards that i hit you with a ball of lightning man like a tesla coil do it does the ball count as someone else or just doty you have a beacon it's a very nice beacon it's probably going to attack us like the worst spin art ever doty's not going to win this i'm going to dive into that room so i've got two more movement two more bits of movement i'm going to go over to the chest i'm going to try and fix my gun really quickly that's fine had to roll a nine i got a 12 and then i can't open the chest as well all right i'm just going to hide and wait yeah yes i'm so excited that i don't have to be the one to kill you i don't want to be the one to kill you i'll never live that down this is a great map we can't give suggestions can we over the earpiece oh shit damn it fuck i had such a good thing to do this is the overwatch map i've been waiting for whittle him down you're not having a good day you're like an ernest film right now ernest goes to war your nervous system knows to keep you awake and conscious for that whole event it's un-bear-able 35 he's a lootdrop we just have to-- like he's like such a lootdrop not anymore it's now eight it's nine rounds or eight rounds this is such a community episode in eight rounds he dies of exposure i wait nine rounds (laughs) i'm going to check that chest is that a full action all right i take the greater healing potion and then i've got some movement right okay and then i go one two three four-- can i get to behind that building behind the building towards you no no like directly-- yeah like as far over there as possible i'll come out the door i came in yeah over there and if i have anything left i'll start walking up the wall i know i won't make it not quite next round i'm going to pop up knock it prone yep i love it this is like battlebots you could release him into the acid though i imagine this as the interior of the genie bottle from i dream of jeannie pink and plush oh my god they'd have to think of it i wouldn't think of attacking the room and he's designed to hurt rooms the room could collapse and squish him like a bug for all we know oh god i love watching his brain strain you punched a hole through time and space well done pulling around the corner yep casting hex on grog and now i'm going to take a sharpshooter shot and add a point of grit for an aimed shot to the legs actually does that make that harder for me to shoot him later no i mean if you're prone i can still shoot him just fine in that case i'm going to hold on that grit and i'm instead going to use a piercing shot with sharpshooter so for shot number one with animus sharpshooter oh for fuck's sake it's another misfire no so that needs to be picked up that's fine irritated i pull out bad news and take another shot this is also piercing another grit spent oh thank you god damn it that's better 22 yes thankfully it can't misfire when i do this 16 aw shit so that's (counting) that's 33 points of piercing damage plus four necrotic damage and i'm going to take my last shot actually i'm going to take a retort shot because this is the fucking day i'm having and i'm going to burn another grit and i'm going to try and knock him prone because you're welcome that too this is another sharpshooter with retort ugh that's a 16 16 to hit goddamn it i'm diving back behind the bloody doorway goddamn it yep that did not go well yep oh you have a disadvantage on wisdom saving throws right now wisdom checks i want to make sure you really suck at them right now like the matrix i take two psychic damage on top of that i forgot about that all right i'm only nine hit points down no you went to hammer 28 hits 26 points of damage okay fuck fuck dude all right is that everything so far is that rolled into what you just did 51 points so i'm at 26 51 i have a hail mary at the end of this we'll see how it goes oh yeah okay i actually have to do the math to see i don't think i'm unconscious no i'm not but that hurt i'm going to do the math with a calculator-- 26 51 and 19 i've taken 105 points of damage i have 35 points remaining i'm at 35 i'm at 140 points i have 140 hit points i also had nine points of damage from psychic damage from my own fucking gun oh i took how many points of damage i could roll a natural 20 no hex gone it's kind of brilliant oh here's a hail mary first thing i'm going to do is i'm going to use my bonus action to down a potion of greater healing which is how many d4 4d4 plus four let's make that happen that's okay 15 points of healing that's one hit from grog that i can now take i'm going to try and hit him with diplomacy since i'm technically in grappling distance i can't shoot and if i try to move he's going to hit me so i'm going to attempt to hit him with diplomacy and see what happens what is that since i haven't used it where is the card i have a lot of them out it's a dex-based unarmed melee attack just dex modifier add the proficiency bonus okay thank you that's less of a hail mary slightly oh my god 14 i've rolled three ones and a two this game another round with it 17 okay that's 2d12 electrical damage that's 24 points of lightning damage guess what make a constitution saving throw no you actually no longer have disadvantage you have a 27 oh i'm so fucked nope it doesn't do what i was hoping it was going to do that would've saved my goddamned life yeah if he had rolled low he takes 12 points of lightning damage what the fuck else am i going to do i can run like a motherfucker let's see but i can't use my gun can i oh wait i would've had advantage but i didn't get advantage on the-- i can't hit him with my gun but i can still hit him with my sword okay so i have two more sword attacks and then i've got to figure out some shit let's take two-- i have three attacks but i had advantage so technically that was one attack so i'm going to take two sword attacks no i don't that's a 27 piercing no i'm sorry that's to hit i'm sorry my brain is-- you're scaring me 25 to hit and 21 to hit so both hit (counting) 22 points of piercing damage and i'm going to burn an action surge you can't use an action to disengage unless you have it i'm just fucked aren't i i'm going to take my heal with that action surge i'm going to heal up yeah i know that's awful 14 points of healing but it'll get me away 26 to hit hits 24 okay that's his reaction so i can run now oh well that's fine yeah you'll be laughing when i'm far away from you i've got to get some distance i'm going to start running straight up the tower that'll do i don't need a ladder though i don't want to go around that wall i want to go up that wall yeah that's the end of my fucking turn all right i have to roll a strength check against bramble shit yeah no i'm fucked anyway oh i have another action surge that i didn't-- i was hoping 38 plus six lightning damage and then i'm going to take ugh this is the worst i've ever rolled in my life 38 plus six lightning i'm going to bring that down to 25 points of damage from the gloves of missile snaring so 38 down to 25 plus six lightning damage still alive 16 actually this is better i'm so sorry strength saving throw 22 that hits no it's smart i'm bleeding out i'm just blood once per turn it's a reaction i'm out are we doing death saves he burns an action doing this i assume (laughter) yeah in my bag is vex on fire again this board was designed to actually fuck with the two of us because we don't have any good long-distance shots but they have nothing but cover he is being so smart i know it's a horrifying piece of paper do something crazy start texting you have that thing you can do it's time yeah i've been waiting for it (cackles) a two and a one even better he rolled a two he rolled again and rolled a one but it does mean that you have disadvantage on the attack it could be anything it could be something you're downright immune to here's 10d6 one two three here's ten here's ten right here all the ones that are not yours oh man oh that's bad points of damage on fire and ones you reroll right (cackles) 70 is that getting closer to the dragon that's a d6 no two four six eight nine and you have one there you go 35 points of poison i'm enjoying being the rules nazi here just hide and be extremely inconvenient to matt i'm so sad i'm dead right now this would've been worth everything good god i'm so proud of you this is the end of cabin in the woods i'm so impressed lighting a cigarette at the end of the world he literally has no idea we should totally do that we should plan something yeah do it i'm so proud of you no good really bad day oh my god choose the form of your destroyer i'm so excited oh i know how ruin works oh shit this is amazing that's the highest number you really know everything is just more fives here's another question when was the last time you hit something that's going to be hard to clean up fear you've had a few of those tonight don't be greedy whoa this is what's been happening all night you have your bonus and your movement you are the luckiest motherfucker this has all been just-- oh my god ooh oh yeah oh my god there's six places he should have died oh that's depressing four five six seven eight nine does he stay on the broom quite well i might add he's right under you i don't think we ever built a safety net into his broom yeah oh my god he had 25 solid and there was one trunk left i kept thinking about telling you yeah bottom left but it wasn't my turn so i didn't say anything (giggles) that was nuts there's so many ways that you could have died tonight if that glove had worked i would have had an action surge and five shots to the head it's a wicker basket that plus two to modifier there's a lot came in the mail a little while ago i went down hard man again if the glove had worked it would have been amazing that would have been an ugly terrible death for grog with good rolls not only that but the gun that does damage when it jams jammed twice show us your hands you're going to be hard to see in the forest i think 20th episode really
