we'll see if i feel better no feeling better it's right there salt the earth not everybody matt and that's coming to my house it's going to my house right there ow ow (pained) no it's very nice to see you too ow ow does that mean they're not skilled can i use my passive perception he had a point i'm last well grog says i'm right in front of him that wasn't me it might've been me not really no and we're locked in religion check (splutters) i'd have liked some warning oh i think she is very happy no that's impressive too you you strike me as married yes yes (stutters) well i may have-- almost died well not fire actually but ice another ice dragon you're more married than him i've never met a dwarf that wasn't surly she's blushing it was a shame we didn't have it it would have come in so handy for our adventure this story will be great if we could see the carpet i think well you cleaned it and that's nice we slept in a tent we slept in a tent in the woods with the loudest librarian on god's green earth she talked in her sleep this is what happens when you de-enchant the carpet yes quite charming i could send him to the blacksmith i went to a pet store at the blacksmith's it's an old god you've probably never heard of it oh i see how this could work out poorly we're shopping for potions excuse me i'm looking for potions can i get some service we've already got one (stutters) how much was that is it a superior healing potion i'm not spending 500 gold on a greater healing potion why do they not make that some people need iron (whispering) what would vex do (whispering) thank you ugh ugh we're getting you a leash so i've just been sitting here watching this shocked i was upset about the carpet and i wasn't-- he's huge what was i going to say no i didn't it was expensive and-- oh god so it's credit there's credit it'd be expensive though it's somebody's time for a week you're going to do great [break] that's funny it took a second i don't think it's supposed to make that noise yes it sounds lovely what's the worst that could happen oh never mind that was rhetorical don't actually want to know what the worst that could happen would be it's happening there's nothing you can do to stop this anymore embrace the inevitable we could make a compass if we really needed one it's not hard to make a compass we had two extra horses you can ride the bear let's bed down it's not like we don't have to sleep eventually i'm going to try and cast some more ammunition since i'm out god damn it 14 i was getting a little iffy i can use metal they're basically made of iron so honestly i don't know yeah i knew i would just get a little bit on the road right now five shots that sounds about enough do i get an up to my hit points at level 11 do i get to roll more hit points at level 11 i haven't done anything other than take my new abilities roll a d10 yeah that happened that's ten i'm up ten points hit points i rolled an eight and my constitution modifier is two yes i am what do we get no i was there i was with you right here on camera (sputtering laughing) there's like five jokes i'm not making right now let's get a move on i think 17 oh look we have two options for our ways up two paths i want to examine the path to see if there's one that's been more trod that won't make much of a difference 14 are the prints going both directions or is there a majority going one or the other footprints horse prints both no horse prints i see the path is probably too treacherous to bring the horses we might want to leave them here one path has barely been touched the other one has been pretty well ridden through i say we take the more common path 13 i've got a mask for this i'm going to put on the mask 11 don't say things like that out loud i think so 16 18 is the entity still lifting boulders okay i'm going to stop if i see one pick up a ball i'm going to stop and take an action if that's okay i'm going to swing around i'm going to pull bad news out as i swing around back myself down and i'm taking an aimed shot at its arm spending a grit point it's been so long there we are yeah oh the curse is broken that's 29 31 31 the arm shot is-- okay sorry it's been a while i've never done this one before no damage but it drops one item of my choice and i use the strength of the shot to pick myself up and keep on running 23 that felt really good 15 yeah yes we face this together 19 17 my mask doesn't give me any advantage does it 11 oh sweet baby jesus does this make you feel better god damn it wheaton no it's going crickets crickets have 25 to 20 nine we're sitting here like is this a cirque du soleil thing we have immunity to what now that's better 15 how many points i like the comma there the comma really brought it together that misses 25 definitely hits i am on fire aren't i god damn it and it takes an entire action to put myself out can i run he's going to get an attack of opportunity on me yeah i know fuck it i'm going to run first and then put myself out i'm running towards the wall i'm getting some distance yeah and i'm doing a stop drop and roll on my way to put myself out damn it okay and you've moved me as far in that direction as i can go right yeah i'm also going to spend my bonus action for second wind because fuck so that's 19 points that i gain back we all look great and lose five pounds hey now not cool that's pretty good (singing) oh that girl is smoking on fire-- you first or me first no i put myself out take that soda can pop-topper off me okay i'm pulling out the pepperbox and i'm taking an ice shot at the little one attacking pike and i'm going to take a sharpshooter-- that's the wrong dice to roll i'm going to take a sharpshooter bonus for it so that's a miss that's a nine actually no shit god damn it that's a misfire i'm going to spend an action to fix that oh what is the check on that that's a dc 12 eight nine ten 11 12 i hit my check fire again no i looked it takes an attack if it goes then i'm-- yeah action to fix a broken gun let's try it again without the sharpshooter bonus better 20 to hit and i don't get the bonus on that because i suck seven points of damage rolled a one and i'm going to back off it is an action i thought it was an action to-- it did break i would have switched guns anyways but okay next time for some reason i thought it was an attack action to fix it okay that's fine it was shitty damage anyways hey i get to keep the bullet i'm fine i'm at half i'm at 56 that was full road runner can he do a one-space move without an attack it's a what it's a 19 i'm going to spend a grit point and say that doesn't hit yep i'm going to gunslinger's dodge i'm going to unload into its body i know i'm at a disadvantage because i'm that close but i'm just going to unload into its body three attacks with disadvantage that was a 17 but it's okay because i have disadvantage so that's a 21 17 26 orion and 18 plus 23 26 35 points of damage yes constitution check okay 21 yes 21 can i use my saving throw reroll that i get it's a skill check damn it okay 12 33 bravo water would be lovely would it enchant anything in animal form oh and if you're in denver i will be at-- is it nan desu kan i'm blanking i'll be in denver at nan desu kan so you can go see me in denver
