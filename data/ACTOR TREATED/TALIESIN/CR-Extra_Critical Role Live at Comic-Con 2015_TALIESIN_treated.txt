oh god i've got to start really okay i can do that that's much more interesting than voice acting my name is taliesin jaffe i got into roleplaying in high school with-- well i had funny hair and wore a lot of black so i played vampire the masquerade and i larped i was a big larper for those-- i don't think i have to explain that and had a group of friends in high school and we would do everything from weird games like we played gurps and rifts and cyberpunk and all those games in the early 90s late 80s and it had a been a while for me and then i got pulled into a completely different game with matt and a few friends of ours so we played for about a year and a half and then we'll get to the story of liam's game but i got pulled into the game that was the first game and it has ruined me for every other game i could possibly want to play i love that today seven people have come up to me with this intense look in their eyes and they've come up to me very quietly and been like hey briarwoods man wow wow (laughter) better them than us it's like the internet but nice it's so crazy oh boy percival fredrickstein von musel klossowski de rolo iii they call me percy i decided after i had an image of the character i wanted to play i wanted him to have a ridiculous name because i love ridiculous names it's actually a mixture of three things one of which is a character i was a child actor also one of them is the name of a character i played as a child actor the other section of it is the name of an anime character from legend of the galactic heroes and the third chunk of it is actually a friend of mine who i will not name but who has the greatest name on earth yes i'll leave it a mystery because he doesn't know that i stole his name for my little d&d game and thankfully he's 80 years old and lives in italy so he doesn't have to know about this and i want to keep it that way that's basically where my character's name came from this is a mix of all three of those things he types all in caps too so i'll never know how angry he is bring us home i was quite proud of the magic carpet save our very first run-in with the magic carpet it's a very complicated story but we found the magic carpet out of luck while falling out of a building and everything kind of worked out okay no one died i saw a guy dressed as hodor with a box of raisin bran on his back it was awesome really quick tell them about the hourglass we had a buddy
