arizona comic con it's going to be amazing in arizona with comics wow you're fired you're razing arizona with fire that's okay i'm down to play it i don't want anything spoiled and casting for ms marvel isn't that hardcore we should register at very least at this point there's a pirate store there's a superhero store run a d&d game for kids look at all that-- yes yes that's a good question i suppose i'd like to get a vantage point to see what we can see is there any way to-- i think we all took damage i think we're all hurt 57 let's get inside i want to see if i can get a vantage from the top do we send them away or do we send them down below like for shelter it's safer than running around outside that's where i want to end up you can put them in my workshop actually-- yes let's head down to my workshop because i have to unlock it anyway keep them out of my workshop but put them into the spare rooms and anywhere we have room the cathedral is a great idea i'm running up to the tower as quickly as i can vex i need you on the roof up here so we can get down real quick well shouldn't there be a door that leads to that anyway okay that'll do got to get that thing finished 27 26 26 does it seem like the dragon has noticed us how dumb am i okay cool all right i'm going to pull out bad news and i'm going to make a targeted shot at its wings and try to put a hole into its wings natural 20 (cheering) i'm back baby it's a constitution saving throw yeah eight plus my proficiency mod plus my dexterity mod-- so i don't know-- six seven eight nine ten 18 hold on is that right it's proficiency bonus plus dexterity which is six stupid dragon 27 points of damage let's see one more yeah one more shot at the wings just to see if i can take it down make it 25 (laughs) drop fucker height by 20 feet and i imagine that would throw it a bit and let's do some damage and damage is 20 points of damage i'm going to hold my movement until it's so close that i want-- i'm going to hold my movement until-- okay then i'm going to use my bonus action to turn to vex and fight or flight all right you can answer next turn yeah that was a good plan well we're above it the cloud would be between-- just for clarification which door is back into the keep that one okay all right i'm going to drop down-- like a boss i'm going to leap 29 okay the next thing i'm going to do is i'm going to concentrate really hard and i'm going to try and conjure hex to see if it works it still works so just to remind you that means that he has disadvantage on all agility checks oh on which checks constitution ability check on any ability checks i'm going to spend a grit point i'm going to take another shot to try and drop him yeah just for fun are they not because i'll use that grit point for something else if-- it's its own circumstance in that case i'm going to spend my point for deadeye advantage on the shot and do i want to go nuts i'm going to go nuts i'm going to add sharpshooter to that might as well that's fine here we go both-- 25 2d12 oh thank you for reminding me-- 17 points of damage plus four points of necrotic damage i'm going to use the rest of my movement to duck in there i want to try and spin all the way back so i'm completely out of sight is that door open open the door no it's the other door that leads to our keep so we're both going to get in and dual-wall it and then i'm going to use my bonus action to take one of my few remaining potions the medium one what does the mid-range potion do i should really start writing this down is it one-- the second-level potion 4d4 plus four yeah eagle to the eye including us inside seven actually i'm going to spend my resolve and reroll that ten don't do that what can we do to unfear but it's holding pike so it has no bite did you do a saving throw technically fire damage should be good yes no i step inside my workshop yes of course is there anywhere private in this place at this point all right all right we have an opportunity here but we're going to have to be careful all right we're going to need more than just you we are going to need a few of the others just in case this is how it's going to work i'm going to take it out i'm going to have you go i'm going to remove it from its hiding place while you go get the rest of them from upstairs at the very least vax keyleth at the very least exactly we need good people and i'm going to try and talk to it to try and discern what it is and how it works and what it wants and if for some strange reason things go wrong i need people who would be more than willing to at the very least knock me out so i'm going to be needing you and at least one other preferably a magic user ready to deal with me if something goes weird i need one other just in case keyleth-- or vax pick-- your choice honestly whoever is less busy upstairs i'm going to take the skull out of the hiding place so he doesn't see where i'm removing it from the second he leaves the keep i rush to pull the skull out shut the door put it on the table sit down in front of it and say okay talk you have my attention okay i got a minute before he comes back (softly) at what price i then take the velvet cloth and put it back over it and put it over and set it up as if i haven't talked to it my door is unlocked oh no i built with you in mind good i felt that this was only possible if we had a few more witnesses we have an artifact a skull there is something alive inside the skull there is something evil or at least not good inside the skull and it is offering to grant us any wish we desire if we set it free now grog is inclined to take this deal i am and i imagine this is surprising having some reservations i like having the terms spelled out and i feel that so far the terms have not been spelled out i'm going to lift the fabric off he wants to be freed it how would we free you it was an option and i felt it was worth exploring and i think now we do have an option which is we have to take it somewhere and have him identified we have to know who this is it's not always genies in cans i would like to know before we make any deals we need a name we have a chance to kick the can down the road we don't know that whatever is in here could be worse than what's out there but we could find out and since it's a wish we'll have plenty of room to fix this we don't have to do it immediately yes i don't know it's in there isn't it and how do we know the dragons weren't guarding it as opposed to it being a signal it could be the thing they're angry about i wave my hand and the skull drops into a shadow on the table and vanishes the blanket vanished into the shadow as well it's now just a shadow i've put it back in its hiding place that was a reminder that you should know what you're dealing with before you touch power yes i'm not going to pretend i always make the best calls but i at least would like to know its name we have a chance to stop anything worse from happening or we have a chance to unleash something far worse on it i am a betting man and this is a bad bet you know exactly what i did is he reaching or is he-- your plan is good it just requires a little bit more study it's a good plan yes come please come in vex vax do you want to-- well actually we might as well get keyleth down here as well pike keyleth meet me in my-- i'm going to walk and attempt to gently scoop the skull up and put it behind me he can't lock it let me see your sword i point at the table and i say reach into the shadow and see if you can take the skull good luck i look grog right in the eye before they come in i very quietly say does your friend have an opinion on the skull your new friend you did or pick who you trust i trust your judgment and i said 'no' you read the spell didn't you i have the skull i'm not going to use it i don't trust him not to use it yet that's fair all right i pull it out from behind me and hand it to you it's in the bag wrapped in cloth i love you travis (laughter) put your pants on grog really don't give me the skull but don't give him the skull either i think we need a name for the thing i'm using quick draw yeah 28 i'm shooting a warning shot past his head diving in taking the-- i've got six spaces of movement in my turn diving and grabbing the head and curling back around-- grabbing the skull and going-- i'm moving first and i'm happy to spend an action surge if that'll make this work better i can make a roll for it gently pull it out of his run so i'm going pull it-- oh if she's that grappled to it then i'm going to try and push her out of the way of grog 15 it's less of a shove and more of a pull out of the way of grog's rush well i grab her ah shit 14 oh shit 17 oh saving throw 21 i'm prone on the ground but it's vex's turn i wasn't trying to wrestle it it doesn't want me i don't want to use the skull i want to keep you from using it burn burn can i get up at this point or no i'm going to stand up and grab a poker off the table i'm leaving my gun on the floor i grab a poker and i take a corner that's a bonus action oh jesus 15 (muffled mumbling) this couldn't be because of our journey to the elemental plane could it we saw him there we didn't set him free you don't think is there any way of contacting the fire ashari no no this was a land mine waiting to be stepped on we survived they threatened us many years ago vex you would know barely whitestone as well i'm going to just sit it's been a long long day aye brought to you by wyrmwood gaming specifically designed to absorb tears (laughter) i would have kicked your ass by the way just throwing that out there i picked up the poker because i didn't want to hurt you (laughter) throwing that out there flash gordon when do i level up it was such a bad deal i said no like can you imagine how bad of a deal that must have been i was really looking for a reason to say yes nothing good happens when you let mxyzptlk out of the goddamn skull i was going to gender swap i wanted-- percy was going to become percina (laughter) there might have been one after you i want to know about whitestone we have a lot a phone calls to make does decimate mean that 1/10 survived or that only 10% died i can never remember which one decimated is i know it's one of the two i know 10% died that's what it is why do you got to be a dick man
