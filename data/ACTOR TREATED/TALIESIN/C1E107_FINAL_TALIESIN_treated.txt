lentils no one really knows to be fair lentils are here to punish us yes we have done something terribly wrong and now we must eat of these we are punished by that and we need to be immune to poison wisdom saving throws we'll take a slightly early break in the long run i'm amazed that took over a hundred episodes i've been waiting for the interpretive dance for a long time is that max goes up 18 so 18 max up and then an 18 on top of that that goes away once you get hit are we doing this now underwater you're nervous about everything is that what we've come to i would assume so you we do flip for it heads or tails boulder-parchment-shears it's mr and mrs vex let's be fair i'd rather be here how would one go about finding out if you're being watched via magical means is there a way to do that other than if one is not a magic user is that a perception check just curious yeah right over there was that affirmative or surprise we might want that later if we get a ship then when it's all over we have a way out we have time for principles immediately afterwards when we come back oh no oh you're still here (knocking sound) (door creak) i don't know why i made the sound effect we were hoping to charter a ship at great expedience to about five miles off the coast to the plume of smoke and the underwater volcano excellent no we would need to-- we would like to charter a crew also to maintain we're going to be doing a bit of underwater search and rescue so that will do i don't know it was far less than this but at this point i'm saying let's blow the money i don't mind clever i think we're ready did we get the platinum from the bank if i recall i'm trying to remember we would've platinumed ginger i feel like i would really be thurston i feel like thurston's better we can all see the sea it's right there santy of the shore shanty spotted-- surely not i'm so glad i don't have to do that you just do it for me it's very nice i think i've still got one more charge on the flashlight if i recall yeah extremely useless i'll be in the middle i may join in on that because i have a flashlight 21 i hate that phrase are the faint glows repetitive like they're coming from the same place over and over again let's head towards the glow it might be magma also if we see anything resembling an air bubble then we know there's something that breathes oh okay irritated creatures we have a broom does it not work underwater 14 let's roll around a little bit see if we can see anything else i like control the currents i don't know let's do a little walk of the perimeter and when we're ready we're going to jump down and we'll mary poppins it looking using the light i'm looking for other expelling gasses interesting plant growth lights 14 but can trinket fit or grog can punch it let's let grog punch a volcano teach it to say your name ow my ears popped i'm going to put my face in the water and breathe i'm putting my face in the water and attempting to take a breath i'm just trying to use the water breath we might start getting a little loopy if we stay out here for too long i'm going to open the light fully i'm going to tilt the light into it and take a look down i think we're already starting to make our way out okay that's right that was early on wow it's nothing you haven't had to regrow before i've got the boots so i was going to use my boots can we fit our head in that jug you've just got to carry the jug and as long as we stick our head in the jug every time we need to breathe-- you're a genius you're a genius i will say that seven more times we'll space them out fresh water we'll take it out of the water i'm going to use the breathing jug it's how i solve so many problems in my life it's the solution to half our problems i activated my boots and walk 34 oh no plus ten that's amazing you are not my parents goddamnit no 12 my lowest possible initiative i rolled a one we're learning we're learning things somewhere between 15 and 20 maybe you get it back when you turn back is it the alpha style with the black border i've actually performed the jace the mind sculptor it takes three friends to really pull it off well that got gif'ed i'm going to activate silence so that's up charge diplomacy i'm going to give it a little rev with my bonus action and i'm going to-- oh wow can i actually reach i can't quite reach but i can get close i'm going to head against that wall and start climbing up that wall yeah up there just put me up there yeah there we go that's my action my bonus action and my movement what happens if you-- what happens if you titanstone-- never mind i'm going to find out jump back in that's something travis would say it's something travis would say happy birthday that's a complicated tray (laughter) it's only been about 25 seconds but we do eventually have to breathe the soul is imbued with heroes' feast not the body see it's all there (laughter) i'm going to start peering around the corner with the flashlight i'm going to head that way the pool of water is just a pool of water i can follow you down there too because i've got my boots on predator vision this is the most irritated i've ever seen matt objects in hammer are closer than they appear i'm walking down there more of that all right it's a shop's closed i suppose i'm going to touch the doors there's no obvious mechanism for opening it that's awful no six anytime i look for anything worthwhile i stare at rock going huh found a rock just slid down are the runes glowing are the runes not glowing tommy wiseau is what i'm getting from this i'm going to take the sun stone out of its little container and really light up the room and just illuminate the whole room now thank you somebody that was me you are the best jump scare i'm going to quickly inspect one i'm rolling terribly nine does the style indicate anything i love walking on the wall so i'll be in the middle of the group walking on the wall do i understand how this triangle works i'm going to hop up to take a better look at it as well and the point at which they connect is that about a quarter size would you say complete point okay we can't figure out how the triangle works let's start smelting yeah so let's start the smelter at the very least the faces of the statuary maybe we should prod them we might as well start prodding things because nothing's going to happen if we don't prod them i'm going to crawl up to one of the statuary soldiers and see if the helmet comes off or if the face is removable i'm going to start tinkering that thing is going to go click isn't it i step up i'm into it i like this plan
