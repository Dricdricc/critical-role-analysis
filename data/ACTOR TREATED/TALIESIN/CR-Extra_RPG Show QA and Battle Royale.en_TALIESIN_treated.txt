i better get mine turned in well a burn there was a beautiful sunset happening right offscreen my friends who i'm sharing a room with were like-- we're going snorkeling yay my first episode of signal boost went-- oh ow that hurt-- live on tuesday i'm going to burn us down this whole game is coming down now yeah you should check it out i'm really proud of it and i'm happy with it and there's more fun mortified well i will have a hive soon it is happening it's being built right now technically next door to my room but yeah right next to the chickens screen window crucifix it'll get the whole thing stopped (laughter) it's about four o'clock why oh i'm really looking forward to overwatch i haven't hit it yet it's going to be a thing oh yes of course that makes perfect sense i got so enraptured in that story i'm trying to think-- ashcan pete thank you that was all i hoped for we did a sabbat vampire game tabletop years ago at my friend don's house that involved a savage burn on the haunted mansion and pirates of the caribbean at disneyland and we were resurrected as vampires inside the haunted mansion and he had built an elaborate map of the entire ride it was really spectacular (laughter) percy would absolutely kill another member of vox machina if he thought that it was for the good of the whole group he thought if there was a situation where it was like put one down because they were a threat to everybody else he'd probably be okay probably i couldn't kill trinket i think i'd feel really bad i couldn't live with myself tonight's special percy'd be dead by now he would have walked into something stupid and that would have been the end of it (singing) just a small town girl living in a lonely world (laughter) bless shaun okay we need a title now you've got 20 minutes good morning what's up draw lots what's the video game from rick and morty i'm trying to remember you're taking him off the grid he doesn't have his social security card (laughter) many of those people in those books die i feel knee-deep in act two right now yeah he's totally act two waiting for that big break to happen good that's a really good decision oh it's going to be a crashing head i'm curious there's so many things that are on the cusp of happening don't wow fuck why didn't we think of that that's so not true so many things that could've gone wrong didn't yeah that's the darkest thing that we ever hear in the game you can certainly try i'll roll my die to spite you it's not the email you guys are intimidating out there legitimately oh i saw that rolling through it's a good one i'd say an interesting mix for percy of self-loathing which is definitely a big thing for him too and the unbridled belief that his parents put into him that he's the only adult in the room someone also said is it fair to call percy the doctor doom of his world no he is definitely the reed richards of his world and if you read fantastic four you will know that reed richards is a terrible person he's a terrible terrible person no he didn't tell i found out when you did yay nothing at all i didn't even know i left it open to have just been nothing it could have just been that he had a dream one night and went nuts it literally could have been nothing i want my gun back i haven't had time everything keeps exploding if something could stop blowing up for five minutes i'll finish four projects around the house waffle iron maybe their video is broken yeah that was very impressive she's not exactly miss charming either is she let's stick a miyazaki princess in the middle of the show and see what happens that'll be great i like everybody i'm horrified by the thought of losing any of us-- i know i thought we weren't and then suddenly oh this is happening now for the first time ever i feel like matt is actually-- you guys are really awkward it's weird not really just kidding twitter asks when making sketches for inventions does matt ever shut you down or 'you 'can certainly try' you and no usually if it comes to the sketch point it's the i don't understand what you want to do please explain to me what you want to do and i'm pretty good-- i try really hard not to push the technology of anything percy makes past 1901 1880 i'm not looking to bring the vietnam era to d&d (laughter) i have no interest in breaking the world any further than where his story is literally that he broke the world which i'm sure will come up again at some point no that's fine it's all over i don't talk about who i'm jonesing for in general percy does not talk about these things oh taliesin does taliesin will never shut up about it (laughter) yeah percy has no interest in-- he'd have to come back on the show at the very least absolutely there are decisions that you make that are specifically like i don't want my character to learn that much that quickly i don't want him to be that smart and that well i've learned a valuable lesson about how to treat people and how to-- nope here yours cool it's fun i'll say both taliesin and percy are really amused by the entire situation i love your scarlet pimpernel-- no there's places you just don't go on the internet in my mind i'm imagining fronk our local noise dj i take the sounds the sounds i put them together and they make noises just like in real life though you really have to pick your friends we've had games where not everyone's playing the same game and it becomes a problem i've been in that game several times in my life where there's three different games happening find everybody who wants to play the game you want to play i've got one here this one kind of amused me stefan pennington said you said what your characters' greatest flaws were what do you think your characters' greatest virtues are which i thought was funny we've never talk about what's good about our characters very often because what's wrong with us is so much more interesting i know this is an interesting thought percy i would say is-- he is genuinely filled with gratitude towards the people who saved him from the abyss that he was falling into he is very grateful he is many many things but he is deeply deeply grateful for the people in his life and is willing to do some dumb stuff that he knows is dumb because of it i know i want to hear what i'm going to be killing in here let me know what dies tonight i'm so glad that she hasn't learned the mom voice yet i'm not angry i'm just disappointed oh my god three on the kinsey scale she still has to hear about it all the time and it's really hard to find a greeting card for that like i've been looking for years to find a pop-up-- snap yeah that was so amazing no yeah i totally see that that's another thing i think we need community fanart that's pretty good wow it's like-- it's going to be three minutes of us staring at the-- spoilers god some of us haven't had time i haven't even started this season yet i've heard the internet told me the treasure chest by far if i had killed vex i would have felt really really terrible actually weirdly more out-of-character than in-character i would have felt really awful because that's such a fourth-grade mistake really junior-high-level foolishness that whole bar episode was great yeah i want to yell at percy all the time he does dumb shit a lot and i'm like i got to let it happen did you just say that oh my god and you'll turn to me and be like am i reading this right and i'll go oh yeah and then a thing will happen like whoa yeah yeah no this is going to be fine yeah i'm behind no the world that created the matrix film is a desolate sad place is that actually your beyonder voice if it ever happens 17 liam and do you have my sword or do you not have my sword right now my ac is 18 but i'm going to try and use the gloves of missile snaring that brings it to a-- oh yeah roll damage that hits i'll do my 39 damage right now i didn't roll the right die that's 13 points off that so that's-- that's 13 points off that so that's-- constitution saving throw that's a d20 right yep 11 am i in line of sight yes i am in line of sight aren't i do i have partial cover from that no i don't constitution saving throw constitution saving throw that's a 19 19 points bonus camera we do not know where vax is we know that he is back there somewhere let's figure out what we are doing with this first of all i'm going to-- you got away you little son of a bitch you're hiding back there aren't you first off i'm going to cast hex on keyleth for the moment because i've got to get that thing off the board and i'm going to make you have disadvantage on strength checks i'm going to hit her with the retort pistol-- first shot is 23 that's 15 points of piercing damage plus four necro damage oh good to know all right i'm going to take one more shot then and i'm going to spend a grit for a headshot to give her disadvantage on attacks until the end of her next turn oh thank god it's not bad news 15 that doesn't hit damn it and just for fun i'm going to take a third shot to see if i can do anything that does hit that's a 21 and that was not a grit shot so that's that's nice 15 halved again plus six necrotic damage and also make a constitution saving throw 19 is the dc so does she make it matt and damn it ugh should've done better and then i'm going to dive back here for now i'm going to try and get some cover yeah dive back there for some cover meanwhile in chapter seven chapter seven is actually hiding in chapter four it's really hiding from itself aren't we all 16 there's only four of us i know it was also full necrotic damage i'm out of sight now thank god does that mean there's that much light in the cavern that i'm not at disadvantage yeah break it down i'm coming in around here i'm going to take some shots at pike am i not ten feet away from it oh i wouldn't even know would i dex saving throw that's a 15 but i don't like that i'm going to reroll it yeah that's a natural 20 so i took ten points can i back up away from it i still have one more space of movement okay fuck that guy first thing i'm going to use my bonus action to run a quick heal that sucked so bad that's 13 points back (counting) that was just awful that just makes me sad that couldn't have gone worse that's burned all that i'm going to take a shot at pike and my gun seizes flipping that out for bad news i have room for one shot before my turn is over here we go my one shot let's not do that again that was really inappropriate better 32 to hit 23 points of damage yeah no i'm really annoyed right now i'm really annoyed you know the minute i have sights on you you're dead i know i'll never have sights on you i may have to burn a turn fixing a gun too not with liam liam is just like whatever it's like you don't know you don't know me he's being so secretive this is pressure i'm feeling some pressure what is it perception that's a 25 literally i rolled a 17 i would probably have to roll a natural 20 to actually see him i rolled a 17 there's nothing i could have done no it's good that tonight is your derp night okay i'm peeking around i see the giant earth creature and i'm taking a shot yep here we go actually i'm going to make it a-- no i'm just going to take the shot i have to reload bad news anyway so this is the reload shot thank god nope never mind oh my god for the love of god and all that is holy gun broke for tonight i will never actually take it but for tonight ashley and i didn't know that well it doesn't matter because the second luck was also a gun break anyway i'm going to burn an action surge to fix the gun on bad news and yes it's fixed yeah it's way above the number and i dive right back there yeah actually i'm going to dive all the way back here aww wait no damn it okay i'm going to be fine this is fine wow really okay oh my god that's so-- oh god oh god yes yes i am frightened i am very frightened yeah i was about to say bad news is-- i'm fine i'm fine i'm fine i'm going to use my amulet and bring it up to 23 i hate you i hate you so much oh oh from the depths of hell where you going liam where're you going god damn it god damn it i've had to burn all my good stuff already this is good this makes my life easier i'm excited did i just scare you he missed i was about to say concentration oh hex is not concentration is it oh okay that might be new because it's been so long since i've had to-- holy cow okay that's a four i'm not having a good roll night not having a good roll night yeah this has been ugly break him into sticks to twigs and feathers smear him across the cave i will be so pleased if this works we're not going to act on that intel wow that was painful to watch damn it okay one two three four and i'm taking my shot here let's hope this goes a little better than the last one since this has been really sucking straight bad news shot better that's a 32 to hit yes which is why this is my only shot that could be worse 18 points of damage and i'm backing up for cover yep that's my run that's what i got 18 points not that hardcore oh god i just saw a zero pop up oh god i don't want to look i just don't want to look that's what you get 24 okay so that's-- i can do that all right yeah i'm fine i've taken 87 points of damage so i'm fine not dead i'm going to take that attack of opportunity attack of opportunity there's a marble stat 17 is my perception unless i can add my passive perception to that no i won't look you can show him fly you fool that's akimbo that's cocked all right i'm putting bad news aside and pulling out my sword and i'm going to start hacking away at the cleric i'm cutting at the cleric like we do slash number one 16 21 god damn it ah 23 and that's nine points of slashing damage wow i'm looking rough i'm going to take my slashing attack that hit that's a 31 that's ten points of slashing damage does that drop stealth my ac is 18 yeah yeah i'm going to do a catch it is a reaction oh does that burn my reaction no i'm done yeah i'm out i rolled a lot of ones and twos this fight no i was prepared well done no you took yeah you did some intense damage it's okay that was awesome aww i only feel that that's fair oh yeah i should probably kill me okay so i lose a death saving throw i'm one down under over ten nope that was like i rolled another three keyleth incinerates the entire cave was it well my money was on either you or me dying first oh god the pain begins not a lot of 20 in this game is there making yourself a private room he's in the room with you whoa it's like trying to hit him with a spotlight and then throw everything you can at him it is it's an anti-rogue spell the beyonder is a mysterious creature the laws of physics do not apply here this is phenomenal to watch i'm reading chat and everyone's like wow taliesin's spaced out no i'm just reading chat i'm just watching it normally don't get to see chat i'm not your buddy friend they're still doing south park keyleth is fine she may even be pristine metaphor it's like where's waldo with knives (creepy voice) where am i i would think a dark reboot of where's waldo would do really well i imagine a little chessboard-- wow that would be-- never mind oh my god again welcome to the club whoa remember the walls are caving in ten points you were metal would you like some extra d6 (counting) there you go all of that wow oh my god oh shit sear your shame lock in the flavor don't help don't help i've got to think up better ways to kill you i had plans but you scared everybody into the corners the minute you vanished it just changed everything the minute anybody had walked in front of that i had a ten-foot push clerics two rounds now i know i was about to-- that was when my gun broke i was about to get you to drop and then the gun broke i know that your strength is artificially increased does that artificially increase your skill sets too so actually technically your athletics should be four you don't have other stuff to deal with either
