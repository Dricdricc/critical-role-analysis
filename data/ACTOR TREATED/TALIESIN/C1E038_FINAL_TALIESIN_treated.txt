ad for atmos surround you hear (ticking noises) oh my god nothing can go wrong this is a great idea she can do this we would like to deliver this personally as we don't know if he has any

walking in a direction all right i'm going to use a different die because it's funnier that way that's an eight scanlan scanlan i feel we need you i'm still recovering my spirit here it couldn't hurt

sorrier in the morning it's all right it's okay it's okay oh yes you can't divine the sad out of alcohol i don't think that works that's such a dick question to ask yes but let's do this anyway this was a while ago perhaps we should at least take a look to see if there was something else down there that was dangerous you humble us all by comparison we can also put some beds out in the workshop which has now been vacated i shove keyleth into her room good night damn what is 'our kind' supposed to mean did you hear that pike you had a very good time and then we planned to investigate a house and possibly pilfer we're going to investigate a house possibly pilfer yes last time we were there things attacked us so we're going to double-check mysterious things have been happening though nothing we-- we agreed to take a look inside this house and if there was anything valuable we would liberate it that's very fair i'll make sure you see a sunrise now come on we need you with us anyway to keep us honest we should take a look the faster we do this the faster they leave at the very least it'll be fine we'll explain it on the way trinket's coming yes a wise bear i think we're already on our way aren't we and the new owner has also left in a hurry it's tough being the good one just skate over that one 16 are there any guards that we can see right now if we come across a guard i'd be happy to inform them of what we're doing grog that rhymed well done walking to the front gate i'm coming in the trap room the little portal in it let's find the source of the smell oof i throw the gas mask on let's search the upstairs first see if there's a body or otherwise compost it we've all got earrings let's start checking rooms and we'll get to the room that we know is iffy last yes i'm

nothing like that then me 26 i'm going to examine the skull i'm taking a look at it i'm checking to see if it's attached to the-- it's sitting on a column at the moment i'm seeing if it's attached at all and very gently turning it if i don't see any-- i was just going to turn it i wasn't quite going to lift it yet all right i give it a little lift oh god it's going to talk to me isn't it a recognizable cold chill or a brand-new cold chill i hate you so much i'm a little evil magnet i know i'm checking is the emerald set into the socket or is it removable all right natural 20 i think i've found something evil it's like a ripple almost like a pond that's just gently disturbed oh i have a thought this is precisely the sort of awful thing that i would design if i wanted a way to look into a hallway i'm going to place it back on the column facing the wall i would recommend that if we are going to purloin things we should do it on the way out rather than the way in let's go down it was just like this last time except there was brunch that's all i remember in her defense the last time she tried this it did fly away it's not a flying tapestry such an asshole are we going onto the teleportation pad then nine i'll assist in that perception check all right taking a look that's-- because it's the flat 13 yeah yeah whoa and i back up and draw i found something i'm inspecting him as
