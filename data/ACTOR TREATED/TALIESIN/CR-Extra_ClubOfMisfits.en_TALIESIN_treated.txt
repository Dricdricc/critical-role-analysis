only 70% of the show is mom and pop he's been giggling about it slytherpin my name's andy everyone knows me to be fair i'm a beater for the slytherpin squidlach team we're doing very well this year we might take it all the way to tri-nationals as it's going i don't care who you people are hi dear victory that's the smell of victory smytherpin i wrote it down wrong you finished yours then you can do mine then that's great here get right on that that would be fine i've got five quid which is just enough for me to not kick your ass all right are there locks on the door yeah i'm going to just use some prestidigitation to see if the door can lock or unlock from here yes so i'm just going to see if there's a locking mechanism no i was just going to tell them you did it oh wow 15 yeah i do i mean it would be irresponsible not to go check and see if someone's in trouble right if the room was on fire we obviously would have to leave that room could be on fire someone's yelling all right i dare you to go first go check on the door get up okay i get up now that i see it's not locked i'll get up too shh help or don't i'll-- yes i've joined are they in detention too keep watch nerd we need you to take a look at something coming up right now you ever seen anything like this before do you know what these are together no more deniability i'm so excited oh no that's terrible crickets eight we are sharp aren't we that's my armor class two attacks yep damn there's one on me i'm going to use my bonus action to summon my beater stick it flies into my hand i'm going to spin around and try-- i live for this-- i'm going to try and hit the one that took a swing at me and i'm going to strike with a green flame attack that's my specialty (triumphant laughter) 27 to hit that's oh wow that's a lot this is going to hurt that's a 1d4 and a 1d8 13 points of damage i'm going to flip around on top of the desk and squish the one that is on the desk i am going to swing and squish that one that's a 16 to hit that's not going to be quite as hardcore but it's seven points of damage tiny daggers that hits okay oh yeah 22 so three points of-- yeah okay 12 i'm going to take another swipe at that one that's not dead yet on the table that was just mewling at me i'm going to hit it again with my beater bat yeah that's pretty good that's 22 that's not too much damage i just realized i'd done my damage slightly wrong i've got a plus two bonus that's all right that's 12 points of damage i'm going to run over to you and i'm going to smack the one that's right in front of you that's fine don't be impressed or anything i'm going to use green flame again yep that hits that's 26 i'm a monster i rolled a 19 they're really good i know so that's an eight and a four plus eight my god that's nuts 14 points of damage on green fire too so it's flaming goop i'm going to use my second wind to get some hit points back so that's nine hit points back and i'm done you're bloody weird aww no but i've definitely heard the commotion so i'm going to at least come running up to the stairs and see what's up can i see the sprite i'll see if i can get in a position where i can see the sprite yeah i see it i'm going to use-- it's gnawing on a book is it gnawing on a book i'm going to use catapult spell on one of the books i'm going to squish it that's a 14 dex save that's-- (laughter) that's 17 points of damage to the book and the sprite gross that's fair of course the centaurs this was the best one what are you going to do about it what about the good drawer i mean-- are we doing this then i'm going check underneath-- i'm going to check the drawers i can open see if i can find a key that's hidden-- if she's maybe done the thing where you hide a key where the-- all right 15 gross i'm going to press solid now i feel bad it certainly explains a bit still no way to open the main drawer though is there that was the main drawer i've never seen you so awkward in my entire life i've got an idea i'm going to find the lock on the cage i'm going to take one of the tiny daggers from the little tiny sprites and stick it in there we got attacked we heard a ruckus we came upstairs i don't like getting caught i'm going to do one last check for liquor in the teacher's office no nine i give up head downstairs do you want to stay and wait for them to get angry i know why he knows that why do you know that blingotts perhaps 27 well is everybody feeling all right by the way we did just get attacked by a bunch of sprites you look a little pale i mean paler than normal i'm all right i would totally back that up that's great what's your ac out of curiosity how easy to hit are you are you nimble what's your dexterity your dexterity's 11 but you're ten we're going to need this report what is going on what sort of commotion which classroom is this one more time there's no potions in here are there i'll go downstairs and hit things with sticks until they go away eight eight i hate this stairwell we are still pass without a trace natural 20 i don't even know where the kitchens are 17 i feel responsible for some of this i'll go fourth i'm into this is this normal we know yes so you're going first excellent sure carefully well whoa that's a big map you've got an ac of ten right oh for gods' sakes i'm going to smack you in the back of your head and cast mage armor so everybody's maxed also you're ac is changed your new ac is 13 plus your dexterity modifier 13 plus your dex modifier you're at 13 now i'll take the castle the castle on the end right there yeah we just have the ability to actually kill the other pieces if we so wanted to ah i've got an idea second pawn ahead two spaces not that one that one is it going to get into combat with the spider one space then what does that hit exactly the tidal wave where did you say you're from that explains a lot all right fine oh yeah that hits that was very cocked that's a 23 what's the range on it it's so true well i've got one of these coming at me so i'm going to-- i'm going to do both but i'm going to attack first so i'm going to hit this thing with my club i'm going to use the fire club first i can do some serious damage wow (counting) that's 18 points of damage to the spider i'm going to hit him again that's ten points of damage how's the spider looking if i walk away he's going to take a swing at me isn't he i think we should probably move more of the pawns forward rook or pawn sam and ten feet per square approximately honey badger don't care just some movies to watch at the very least technically i think how it is is until we move they don't move so as long as we don't move-- so much paper i feel that i remember that oh my god that's so rough we share our numbers so it doesn't matter okay i'm going to keep wailing on that spider hopefully it'll go down at some point let's take two attacks-- i'll just start with one attack on that spider this will be my flame attack 16 plus seven that i assume hits i know it's crazy that's 13 points of damage half probably but if it moves one then the next-- well if it moves one then the next attack will be its attack might be the end of you yet oh yeah probably 28 is my guess i'm kind of stuck aren't i i'm going to try something weird i'm going to cast grease on the king and queen they're the ones that i want they're the ones that-- oh oh oh wait i'm casting grease on those two there they have to make a dex save of 14 she is prone also this is up for a minute and a creature that enters the area or ends its turn there must also succeed on a dexterity saving throw or fall prone so if he tries to move he has to try again can't fuck with the king man i believe in you you can hit things no probably not i'm going to run up to that big spider and i'm going to smack him all right let's fire up the swing again 21 all right i lose my big hit but that's okay that's 12 points of damage i'm going to burn an extra action so i get another action which is two more attacks i believe i'm going to take two more attacks that's a miss and 16 okay one more hit that's nine points of damage i'm whaling on him this is like the end of it right now spell attack modifier oh yeah that definitely hits that's fine i have an ac of-- oh no yeah no that hits ugh 11 i might be out travis and i am not out one just one tempted to just wait and let it just work itself out yeah i'm just going to saunter over to the spider yeah i'm not even going to break eye contact i'm just going to swat at it without breaking eye contact fine 19 that's 17 points of damage oh that's not going to go well i'm fine i think we're all just really messed up-- i'm pretty fast now it becomes ferris bueller 21 thank god 25 we have to check to see if your passport has been revoked for that accent
