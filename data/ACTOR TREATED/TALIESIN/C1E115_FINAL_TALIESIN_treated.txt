a little more fancy it's got the ribbon and leather and gold foil it's got an evil tome vibe and it's got lots of little wonderful details yeah there's lots to talk about in these books i'm very excited we keep trying to tell her that don't we yeah it's october so we're doing halloween we're doing hellboy which i don't really know much about i couldn't think of anybody who knew a lot about hellboy do you know a lot about hellboy do you want to come on wednesday club it's going to be wednesday club on hellboy i do i've decided it would be really funny to be here really late three days in a row for the rest of my life and so i'm-- i don't want to quite say taking over is taking over the word i'm taking over gather your party on friday nights now and we're giving it a bit of a revamp it's going to be a bit of a different vibe it's going to be a little shorter it's going to be fun our very first episode is going to be called gather your goth and we're going to be giving some of our friends goth makeovers and having a goth dance contest tomorrow night well i'll tell you what you let me know and you can come over and have a goth makeover gather your laura you would goth out very well i think i would be excited by that the magic of the goth makeover strikes again (cackles) no i bought this shirt when we went shopping where's the carpet that would be nice yes please i imagine scanlan dropping that last potion as it's coming down yay just raised wow two for two tonight yes i'll try my regards to your family thank you as well does not the battle is won fucking dead (laughter) lady yes i've got the last flare from whitestone from all those years ago i've been waiting for it no no that's a lot of words you can it's all i wanted tonight yeah no gold if i recall you're making that monologue face like that face someone makes when they're listening to some very complex internal monologue you don't make that face very often you're making it right now just start speaking whatever's in your head right now free-form okay this is starting to paint a picture you feel better now okay are you lying right now except pissing (laughter) i'm so tired that does remind me scanlan you're going to have to give it back now you know exactly what yes i don't think it's your gun you didn't there's no fair and square and honestly if you were anybody else i would find it when i was rummaging through your corpse later but it's you so instead i just use my words and i'm trying to be a better person if you really like it maybe we'll have a special one made that's a little safer but not that one that's one of mine i'll make you something fancy that's a little less prone to explode especially with the head thing it's quite nice you should get that tattooed in permanently that's a really good idea on the forehead laura and well we got tattoos that's all that matters look at it go wow (laughter) i think so does anyone want to start walking towards the city to see how bad it really is we've got a carpet some of us have wings liam and we can ride on the broom try to scry on him he's probably having a bad day there's enough time there's a gold dragon that should be-- grog do you want to trade boots by the way again we don't have to if you really like them she has seen them they're very nice that is the greatest thing i've ever heard locate pants i would like to scry upon the pants the pantalones he has pajamas he changes into i would run if i were him he may finally have had enough never say never but probably not he would have to work very hard to make it happen well we knew that going in let's go see who's left any word from gilmore in the last hour he's all right into the woods i've never known a true sense of security i'm not entirely sure get up and say something just tell people it was brilliant and great i walk to step in between yes do you recall what you told me once i do no no that's-- actually you know what hey that's right i'm going to resolve that this is not about you that's a 19 22 damn it i have a 19 i do not accept this of course no i use manners on scanlan wow where is it these are my coffee stains yes i do it's a-- ranged attack roll with an attack bonus equal to my dex modifier plus my proficiency bonus against you yeah that's a six 12 24 i think it just hits you can make a strength check against 20 i'll let him out when i'm feeling like it actually i'll unlock it so he can say that i very quickly go through scanlan's pockets to make sure there's nothing else that i need to take back from him thank you nope i let him out manners i'm going to quietly wander outside oh i'm going to break off for a second my god we're saved did you use my die well yeah i'll take care of something i'm sitting in a corner and i'm staring into the reflection of my sword and i'm gently tapping the contract in my pocket and i'm going to say ipkesh you're too late you've been doing a thing could you bring him back would it the thing that you gave me bring him back hmm nothing at all all right i have no idea i think i really miss my family i think i miss my sisters and my parents i think i was going to be a clockmaker once i haven't thought about that there was a moment do you remember when we met i for a brief time thought that i had died within that prison and i was having a fever dream from starvation and this was what that felt like was my mind making stories of friends and adventures and these things i would never do because i was a coward and fool i miss my family so much and i've done some terrible things i gave grog that sword it didn't feel real i don't know this is new i'm sorry many years ago i went to make a deal with her and she told me that i was broken and that i had always been broken part of me was going to save your brother and really i just wanted to prove it to her i wanted to hurt her for hurting me i am so tired of hurting people i love you very much this has been a terrible day where's kiki where's scanlan i think i owe him an apology oh god i owe grog an apology maybe i'll not apologize to grog that sounds like a really terrible idea yes thank you i was going to say let's destroy the one in whitestone maybe we could seal it up leave it because you know but-- how would i know seems worth a shot i'm too tired to be angry was that today it legitimately feels like a week ago at this point (laughter) yes i know yeah but you're you you don't have to apologize we just assume i will not accept it so that when you come to your senses later you don't feel like you've compromised but thank you (laughter) no yes sorry about the skull i'm a human i'm made of contradictions you people wouldn't understand (sighs) oh my god i legitimately don't remember how is that temple right now that was a really good wookiee noise pike i could use your assistance i don't think i should have this and i need this to be taken away from me before i do something foolish and i hand pike my contract this i thought was proof that i was in control of myself but it's just a terrible thing waiting to happen thank you how do you have it on autosave do you just have it i don't think it can be destroyed but maybe it can be put far away i have every faith in you thank you i think i'm done with that i'll take it away can you text it to us actually that's a three jpeg man sorry why doesn't she stay with us for a while i think maybe a little time spent in our company as opposed to your father's company would not be the worst idea i think that's a great idea to drinks i put like 20 gold on the table we will take the cheapest worst beer you have and a round for everyone in the bar if everyone's all right with that it's a special occasion been having a good time then that thing that i was bugging you about well that's fair now that i have a bit of alcohol in me oh god he flipped a page i hate that she made it back to whitestone one would assume that's how she got there i'm sure i have faith i'm drunk don't get used to it marisha and the brightest and the darkest home for a bit at least and of course everybody is welcome always i'll also say for those of you especially grog you have your freedoms and if you wanted to become lord of greystone and have a place of your own that you could invite us to as opposed to wandering greyskull well i think we're going to need help getting to whitestone and then i think it's going to take at least a day for you to regain the power to return to your people we're not getting rid of you quite that easily i don't think any of us do how did whitestone look i forgot no you're fine nothing you're fine love you very much you are oh this could go so badly i think i've had enough for one day oh definitely not at whitestone i've always worried about the two of you you're such a dick let's drive a tree it'll be fun that's more of a shrub yes that looks nice oh yes let's head home i'll be in cassandra's room yes of course i think that sounds lovely and you're always better than comfortable i had a thought actually my god it is hard surviving isn't it perhaps keyleth could use a friend right now and i know that you carry one with you just for a bit i think she could use a companion who's not going to apologize or give too much sympathy we'll figure something out i grew up here i'm used to it i'd like to see that best teddy bear ever there's a lovely tea rose garden in the back i'm so proud of you roll a natural 20 oh no oh my god (laughs) (cackles) this is your doing hashtag no regrets oh god i can't even she's just yelling obscenities it's just obscenities that's all it is i'd like to think that in the next campaign we're going to find you in a glass coffin like sleeping fucking beauty may he rest in bed sores for all eternity you lost card privileges oh we already took the whole deck are you i don't think it was personal i might have lost my arm or i might be hiding it behind my back i'm not sure that's good to know i pull a card from the deck suddenly i lose everything wouldn't that be amazing it's why i don't pull cards that was amazing laura matt and that's the most scanlan thing i could have ever hoped for i would have recommended my tutor but of course vax slit his throat right about the time you met him he was a good tutor before that you're full of shit just full of shit i don't really think we should settle down that seems like a lot i think that i would like to start a very complicated art project that's going to take many years i'm not going to work on it all the time day and night but i'm going to invest some time in this no i'm going to build a clocktower like the one in prague i'm going to take many years and it's going to sit at the front of the castle so it will be outside and there will be other people working on it it will as a proper clock does it will tell our story once a year everything will play out and we may start inviting tinkering artisans every year for whitestone to come show off things that are not necessarily useful but to show off fanciful inventions and things that are beautiful but let's not stay here too often (laughter) there's a lot of names laura and so many ways to irritate your father oh at the very least jesus there will be bears will be involved in the festival obviously especially since the clock tower is part of the festival and bears feature heavily in it only you can prevent the rise of vecna (laughter) yes i trust your judgment it is not for me but i'm definitely all right with anything that makes you happy to be fair you'd do it anyway i help cassandra as best i can i think at least once a year we get out and do something irresponsible maybe sometimes drag these kids out for shenanigans we also insist that she leave whitestone at least once a year for a period of time to do fuck all let's not well yes there's well i'm content to make a clock tower and make art and never make another weapon i'm good it's got a bear i'm imagining the bear from burning man actually oh my god
