oh well then you're in trouble yeah suddenly i showed up and there's 30 yards of red velvet that i've been begging for is there a passage so we can get out of the flow of the water once it's been released well it's either that or back out i'll be between pike and grog right there chaos introducing chaos we're always impressed by how much water comes out of you last time we did that it kept floating up top it is also an option if we do get overrun i think he swung at something 15 we entered in the left side of the body looking at its butt all right to the right leg so if we split we probably want to keep to the core of it we'll check obviously for air currents 21 i might have been using my flashlight i would imagine i'm blinded i'm going to spend my turn removing the mud from my eyes and i think i still have a charge in my flashlight at this point i'm going to spend my bonus action clearing that and then-- yeah is there one right next to me right now i'm going to hop over by the little pool fountain i'm going to back up and get out of this clump of people you may not even hit grog necessarily that was subpar not natural 20 but a 20 nonetheless yeah 16 do we get an attack of opportunity so i'm going to take a swing that hits actually i crit only with my guns on a 19 right i don't crit with my sword the hemorrhaging shot obviously doesn't happen even though it's a natural-- that's fine i crit so that's a ridiculous thing to hit 32 to hit so that's a 1d8 two plus seven and it's silvered if that matters that's 16 points of piercing damage you get all sorts of bonuses to that crit is that doubled and you doubled everything into your extra crit-- (singing) underground probably yeah i'm going to-- what well i'm going to use my bonus action since there's nothing to attack at the moment i'm going to move slightly to the other end of that little precipice that i'm on over where keyleth disappeared yeah get away from things i'm going to use my bonus action to do a heal that was embarrassing so that's 11 points of damage that's great and then i'm going to hold my attack until something approaches yeah gun in one hand sword in the other no i can see we've got two light sources now make a splits check so we're heading left let's get out of here we don't need this i would've made a run if i had been thinking about it (whispering) stop it the question is did you turn invisible then run i love that you're actually being a badass where no one can see i make two attacks on him before anything happens anyway no this is sword too close i knew they would jump so that's 22 and 24 yes you know that's 26 points of damage oh wait i get three attacks don't i that's right that's right 26 points of damage plus-- oh yeah that definitely hits plus eight more points of damage nope and that hits yeah okay there's all the healing i just did it's all gone attack of opportunity fly into the air so there's two above ground but they're behind her i'm going to pull out the gun and take three shots at that thing that's swinging at vex yeah oof that's close that's a 19 then the rest of them hit too it's like 21 and 20 so let's get some d10s out no i got enough some d10s and some d6s so here we go (counting) that's 12 points of psychic damage i don't know what that was i'll put the first shot at that and then shift the next two to the other one okay so that's seven points of psychic damage and 36 points of normal damage yeah okay i'm good yep this is super serious you guys i'm very excited about that oh very nice knowing the history of this city would we know what this is it's not a crypt or anything like that or a very expensive crypt is there an image on the stained glass is it depicting something i bet it's a crypt which means that it's trapped and i bet that means there's something expensive and interesting inside yeah i'm feeling it all right let's do this i bet there's something really nice inside it just works let's see what happens yeah well which is always a bad sign but there it is check for traps i'm keeping my distance and pulling out the rifle and i'm pointing if anything needs shooting i'm going to shoot it i think he's still in there and he's maybe been turning people mad that would be my guess okay then we can-- no oh you do we are nasty enough that if we have to put this thing down we put this thing down titanstone knuckles go ahead natural 20 what feel you i feel you oh yeah two more this could be very good ah there you go anything in the box last box hold your breath it's like a paintball gun what's in the center i think that's where the good shit was i think this was just to take people out the door just opens on it-- i'm in the back ready i'm right by the door who just rolled a natural 20 i'm by the door though 19 i'm going to blow a resolve that'll be fun because that was bullshit 18 i put my finger in his ear do we want to open it we paid for it it's open what's inside take everything let's get what we need and get out before it resets we don't know let me take a look at that belt maybe wait you have to be trained in arcana to identify something don't you is there anybody else trained in arcana does 23 do anything i want to attune to it and see what happens next time yeah let's get a little further i mean we're on our way but we've got a lot further to go i think i'm going to try the belt on and see what happens it's obviously enchanted it doesn't-- no i want to find out so i'm going to pull the gloves off and i'm going to put the belt on there's no throat left you just killed an npc am i starting to get a vibe or am i not starting to get a vibe the belt starting to get a vibe it says okay the attuned gains resistance to psychic damage in addition they are immune to being paralyzed or petrified and cannot be knocked prone as an action you can channel your anger to produce a shockwave of thunderous energy as with the thunderwave spell dc 16 cast at fifth level you cannot use this feature until you finish a short rest how do you not yes clean it please is that with your arcana at a drive-in near you stop it yeah i'm backing up detect undead 29 i'm shooting it in the foot so i'm actually making this a leg shot burning that that's a 22 with a gun oh that's nice yeah that's 17 points of damage plus five psychic and it has to make a strength saving throw 20 goddamn it that's fine i'm going to shoot it in the foot again because that's what we do is that cocked goddamn it i know that's okay that's an 18 24 i know that's ten points of damage plus five psychic and again strength saving throw goddamn it that's all right and to make life a little more fun let's take a head shot because obviously he doesn't want to go down and that's a 25 that hits that's one more of those and one more of these and that's 11 points of damage plus three psychic 14 points of damage and a constitution saving throw holy fuck never-goddamn-mind and with that i'm going to dart in back behind keyleth is that as far back as i can get yeah and i'll use my bonus to reload he started attuning to it before the break (laughter) what if it heals him he hits him so hard it actually puts health points back into him craven head what i'm so amused that'd be amazing oh that other room we don't know what's in there fuck shit up that one that just got up is irritating me so i'm going to start by shooting him in the face that's irritating so that's a 32 to hit that's 12 points of damage plus five psychic so 17 points of damage that's irritating all right hitting it again that's 26 to hit and that's ugh nine points of damage and one psychic that's ten points of damage for fuck's sake are we missing something here yeah fine all right i'm taking a third shot on that one well irritated by that one i'm going to turn my attention to the one that's bothering keyleth and scanlan and i'm going to take a headshot at it burning grit because fuck it it regenerates let's take a headshot and that's 32 to hit and that's 16 points of damage plus three psychic so that's 19 points of damage and he has to do a constitution saving throw god fucking damn it stop it that's really irritating i wasted so much grit and nothing's happened all right i'm going to back up even further out of the room i'm going to back up to the very edge we need some fire oh man what the hell he's so excited it hasn't been hit yet since she-- vax do you want to check for traps and see if there's anything interesting in there yeah that's all ain't nothing else happening just taking a look yeah she's got this i'll check for traps it's a 22 i'm going to check that trunk the chest this is not quite as-- seven i open it
