i cannot say enough good stuff you know i will admit if i get within striking distance i'm probably-- chapter one i have spider-boots he's got leaping boots i get it cabal's dragonslayer animus well he's fine i have tylenol but it requires attunement (laughter) do we have anything sitting around that's not attuned though-- i cannot find my card for my ring of lightning resistance it seems to have vanished do we have anything else equipped that we can-- are you wearing armor okay so the bracers of defense wouldn't work it's breakfast it's the most important meal of the day we get advantage on what saves we don't get advantage we have the ball i'm of the opinion that-- personally i think it's safer to know what we know now and go in because if things-- i'm feeling strangely positive god the sound those things make it's like your dice have a subwoofer let him lick it if he wants it it's just gonna make him happy well i hate when you put it that way it's a buffet it's a heroes' buffet worst-case scenario we can camp for the night if are victorious and spent let's make sure that one of the gate stones is left here in case one of us has to make a mad dash give it obviously keep it in cassandra's care if somebody comes back you know everything's gone horribly wrong maybe we should give-- taliesin and i quietly sneak up and give it a good kiss really we talk all the time he never mentions you scanlan stops us before we start for the record this is a terrible idea and we have no plan just putting it out there i'm with you this is a terrible plan and we're going to die i'm fine i have a cold i don't feel well i'm taking something for it i'm not singing there once was a barbarian named grog who had the iq of a log-- i'd keep going but now you're excited and you've made me lose my-- it can keep i rolled 33 and scanlan rolled 31 plus ten okay how did you do that now boarding star tours what do i know about opash and the crimes and what sort of tinkering okay that's good to know so the scarring does not seem recent yellow 'dragon crossing' signs she licks a tree no dragon has been here (laughter) well if raishan came back then who knows what horrors actually do exist on this island it's possible that she found some of his notes and built upon them there could be anything interesting i'm just playing some conjecture in my head you have a powerful necromancer if there's any possibility that he could've found a semblance of unlife of opash wandering around and bent him towards his will then we don't know how that gem got into his chest in the first place we don't know how any of this happened and there's just too much we don't know yet we have to find the cave there's just a lot we don't know or maybe quicksand this could be all the quicksand we were promised as children it was such a big part of my childhood would the rock tell you if it was having a headache right now how would it tell you that weird point of contention for my imagination are the trees wilting or do they seem like there was a bit of a blast okay so there's no pattern to it how did you just notice that how very flash gordon i don't know if we should move it just so that if the dragon tries to run they have to move a giant boulder it would be really convenient or would it be easier just to scrape across the side scrying on the inside i think we'll just go in i mean what are we gonna see that's gonna make us change our mind laura and that's huge technically it's somebody else's aw man yes i'm gonna get the wrath of this i can feel the heat emanating right now i'm so proud of you no this is an excellent start it's okay there's options that's good we have no way of keeping silent do we we don't have any way of-- we've spent more opening a door you're our last resort at this point wow i actually do blame myself for this this is interesting i don't know with handholds on it it's fortress of solitude we can now get enough of a hold to make a lever and move the boulder out a little bit get us all in and then drop it back into place in theory we have this hole now that's big enough for let's say a magical weapon that can't be destroyed and we can just apply as much pressure put a bunch of other people pushing on the other side and see if we can open it up enough to get in and then let it close behind us i don't want to burn that right now who's got a magical weapon that's very long kima we're thinking about building a giant lever could you put your sword in that hole and help us pull very very hard to see if we can move this boulder in theory no it's a magical sword can you break a magical sword with pressure that's fair so i'm going to try and build this lever all of us are going to put pressure in the other direction we're going to try and have as many of us moving this thing just a couple feet not far just far enough to make an opening to get as many of us through as possible we have holes drilled in the stone by dragon feet 17 scanlan rolled a four i scootch what a wonderfully convenient way to close and it also means that the dragon will not be able to open the door it's wedged shut just let's remember to pick those up if there's anybody left to get them i thought you were stealthing 34 and then scanlan 18 for scanlan could have been yeah you're literally wearing a creeper shirt you have to be careful what you say god every time it's a tough one okay put it in the bag of holding also vax what were the titles of those books earpiece listening to your vague description of things grog would've read them even if he just made up words i did ask about the books the titles of the books the left hand of the tunnel yeah it could be a security camera actually where's kima then i think it's you and kerr and then me and-- ash and scanlan i think destroying it will trigger it do not underestimate the power of burlap just thought it was a college prank can i get a little light in here just for a second okay so i can't see the mechanism on the door okay that's fair for the best it would just scare me take a look around you see seven i've built a fire-lock mechanism for a door before would i recognize this as being a set a fire in the bowl and that might open the door i built one for the raven queen temple intelligence check that's with my new intelligence level that's a 19 it's magic so if it did it would be magical if that was-- do you have something sharp to just scrape some off they don't work he just does that to be an asshole no it's very attractive can i taste it tempting do we recognize the architecture of the door and i also want to take a look at that book what is the book's language what does it look like i'm not picking it up yet i'm just looking at it on the shelf we're going to see if we put the pda in the bowl see if that'll-- well we do have samples of blood in theory in the bag of holding you've caused a feedback loop is the book trapped i'm holding onto the wing i'm gonna flip gently with a gloved hand flip through a couple pages just to see if it's text text text or if there's any-- i'm going to flip to the front really quickly and see if there's a title i know that feeling that's me i think i've solved this let's extinguish all the lights and someone with low-light vision has to read it no that's not funny do we have anybody with perfect nightvision well i can't see a thing begrudgingly we should light the brazier that or raid the cabinets we passed we're bringing the light back that'll do 24 this has happened to me dozens of times at least now we don't have to try and stealth anymore the book's fine i assume that's awesome do i recognize the smell of whatever they used to ignite that or was it more mystical in nature okay i was just curious all right well let's try and pour some of the dragon blood into the bowl and see if that does it let's blow a vial see what happens let's try basilisk and work our way up you guys work on your thing i'm gonna work on another thing i'm gonna go over to those other shelves i'm gonna see what the fuck is up there i'm gonna quick-jog to the other shelves and take a look at those books oh fuck firecracker outside zebrawood is i believe the one that i have 22 for scanlan he rolled a natural 20 17 i can turn myself invisible it's a level three spell i'm gonna turn invisible and back up against the northern wall in the corner and see if the skulls notice and i'm going to hold my action until i find out whether or not-- oh invisible is my action all right i'm gonna back up and yeah she's inspiring four saving throws with advantage cleared all of them it's her magic power save save save save 42 points of damage wait how much some mild asbestos in the coat how much sorry it's a box of kill i'm irritated so which was the one that you were shooting at i'm gonna start with him and i'm going to just to be a dick i'm going to pull some deadeye and a sharpshooter on this one so i'm going to start with him taking a shot with animus with the animus gun which is with the sharpshooter on is 26 to hit that's-- sorry i'm a little out of it what do i need i need one of these oh i'll use this one it's prettier just counting the dice that's nice that's 17 27 points of damage plus two points of psychic damage next shot (laughs) i killed it so grit point back actually and i'm going to spend another grit point for the same shot so yes that's-- i'm gonna just switch to the one-- yeah just gonna switch so that we're not flanked by the-- same sharpshooter same thing same attack 26 that's not as good but it's okay 22 points of damage plus six points of psychic damage i'm going to take another shot at it sharpshooter but not with the deadeye pew-pew not as good a shot 16 that'll do that's 20 points of damage with four points of psychic damage i do a quick reload and i run up the wall to-- yeah that way but to an angle yeah i'm gonna perch up there oh yeah i get the grit point back thank you i'm trying to write you know i've been led to believe that bears had more affinity with dealing with forest fires in general i feel it's just-- this is definitely a problem do you have a bald bear i was gonna say somehow a skull is giving you shade and now he's not he senses the all-powerful deity to the outside of it and just leaps towards matt's face every week every week for two years we've been playing this game for two years at the edge of the map so it wouldn't matter so what's 40 minutes yeah we're good let's take a-- you can find out really easily on top of nine i'm still rolling i'm rolling really shittily wow i'm down a lot i'm at 140 i'm not at the top of my peak is it possible-- god i have instructions on how to run scanlan and i'm debating how to best do that i was going to say according to the instructions i was given-- well that's the thing i want to make sure i can do this in a way so i don't take anything from him later he really-- yeah no i'm gonna try-- before yeah i was given specific instructions he's gonna push a little forward up to the stairs get away from the rest of the group oh then he's going to push a little far back and just-- which is nine hit points yeah he's gonna get himself quietly away i think he's had it packed already so there's not gonna be a big elaborate-- he's just gonna-- i'm not gonna sully it with my good dice i'm gonna use one of my crappy dice this is i guess the most stoner die i have for this so okay constitution saving throw 19 oh saving throw 19 ah i love it this is the worst thing ever no it's great yeah this is weirdly-- two-day mansion the large print giveth and the small print taketh away (laughter) tom waits everybody tom waits bless him i dig this we got this i keep meaning to build something for something like this i just haven't had the time and just let us know which direction you think we should head vex i do i know i do that wasn't a mistake though love you madly that was for vex vax which one why don't you tie the endless rope to yourself so we can pull you up-- so here's an interesting thing we don't have an immovable bar anymore we left those both outside all right that's fine let's-- we could shuttle or use a rope i will avoid cardio at all costs grog first dispel magic ability check okay i will admit i have no idea what i'm doing 21 (sings) rock glyph you don't have to turn on the blue light rock glyph you don't have to give our bodies to the spikes love you sam love you brought it all the way back for you i have no idea it just looked dangerous and i figured that's better safe than sorry sure they'll be fine i'll go with you 'cause i'm fine so i have options oh no we saw did we make it down and nothing happened somebody's got a coupon for a back massage welcome to vox machina you seem tense it's about the speed of the children's rides at fantasyland at disneyland right i think probably maybe scanlan and pike are in front of me and then i'm probably hanging back with kima and allura just sort of ready to-- i want to be at a distance when he said 'chiseled rather roughly' he meant brad pitt okay i'm going to grab on to the bridge i'm going to test it i'm going to step to see if it's real i'm checking it i'm gonna grab one end of the infinite rope and i'm gonna hand the other end of the infinite rope to someone who's staying i think that i pose a good chance of getting across this safely i'm going to make a run for it well not a run no i'm going to walk gingerly i'm tying the rope-- that may be one of the smartest things you've ever said i don't actually have a retort for it on any level it means if i die you win i'm going to tie the infinite rope to myself and hand it off to grog oh god i'm handing it to grog and i'm going to start gingerly stepping out onto the bridge being very careful and checking with each step that's it's real and looking for weird glyphs or signs or anything out of the ordinary that's not bad that's 22 i'm also using my boots and i'm gluing them to whatever the-- yeah are things just getting weird out here well this will be fine is gravity flipped i'm going to spider-climb i'm just going to use my spider-climb boots and i'm going to make my way with the rope we've got now a third rope we can literally just clip people to the rope now we can use the rope we just made as a clipped rappel rope can we that's a thing that we can do if everybody wants to try and cross we can actually-- we now have an unencumbered piece that we can use to get people across there's probably spikes up there oh i have a theory i have a weird theory i'm going to grab-- what do i have that i can do this with try and clock them see if it's the same bodies over and over again if it's an infinite loop of falling oh fuck no i was about to interject and i know that i didn't make that fast enough but at some point i would already like to be moving to interject in this i'm not going onto the bridge i'm pulling out my gun-- i was gonna start skeet-shooting at some point so but she's still tethered all right my first action i was just pulling to try and skeet-shoot and sharpshoot with bad news to hit the undead that had grappled her and i assume i have spend a grit to get him to let go to shove him off i still have that d12 inspiration oh for fuck's sake really misfire the carpet is not what we need the rope that is currently tied at the other end of the ravine where they're currently above us right i'm going to try and reverse rappel with the rope the other end of the endless rope up to them i'm gonna reverse-batman this shit the rug's a terrible idea right now anyway i'm just i'm going up super fucking fast it can hold four or five people hang on i'm coming get across we need people to pull us back scanlan also has a plan if you guys are about to really fucking die you can use the rope just to steady yourself on the carpet just so you know the second my feet hit the stone of the upper wall i'm going to hold on-- i no longer have to repose i've got the spider i'm going to double-dash towards them with the rope and i'm just tying them to the rope tied them holding onto everybody and i just have been yelling pull i've got them on the rope pull the rope down who else is on that side of the-- yeah as many people as can start running out that way i'm going to use my spider-walk ability to actually just maintain everything and just keep an eye out and try and safety-spot everything and scanlan i grab you and give you a big kiss big sexy still-tied-up makeout kiss hey well done not passing out this time good for you i untie the broom and the-- i slowly start shoving keyleth back towards the ravine scanlan's with grog it's more of a thursday (laughter) well okay how are we going to get the last-- there's still a rope bit of an arc you want to pee don't you i've got a great idea you grab the end of the rope that's still tied of our endless rope on the count of three scanlan's going to jump on your back on the count of three they're going to make a running jump and we're going to run all of us holding like a giant game of tug-of-war and just see if we can pull them across like a kite well if you tie yourself to the rope too no matter what we'll be able to-- so you'll at least be tethered chain of returning i've got a crazy idea (laughs) sorry but we have two are we just going to do it twice oh and grog can get in the necklace that's very clever i'm gonna anchor this rope also to trinket just so there's extra weight all right you guys feed it i'm gonna be ready i think with a natural 20 you could steal jewelry from one of them as you went by like that's a nice necklace he knows modify memory (laughter) scanlan is also inspiring her you want to try again i know that you're considering it reasonably or not close enough oh god i don't know if we should touch the water that's coming out of the fountain i think it's coming out of a petrified human that's been turned into a mystical source of water is the vibe i'm getting i'm going to walk up the wall towards very gingerly doing my best to check for traps or anything unusual towards whatever it is that the water's hitting on the ceiling that's a natural 20 my perception with my perception 28 do i recognize the green emerald gem it's a green gem or is it residuum and the water is hitting that gem i'm feeling the urge to fuck with this i'm really hoping someone tells me not to i'm going to edge towards it gently and i'm actually-- this is going to sound weird-- i'm going to spit at it to see at what range my spit decides to move towards it okay so it's the water itself that's being-- something maybe in the fountain i'm standing next to the gem i can pry it out of the ceiling if we have to i might run down to grog do you have a spare jar or jug that i can borrow i just want to borrow it for like five minutes and i'll give it back i have nothing-- yes it is it won't even fit around your neck do you know how to tie an ascot oh that alone that's adorable i tie a little dickie's first day of school christmas bow and i take my little pin and i pin it on him thank you (laughter) for science but let's try and leave this room without doing anything maybe i'm not gonna do anything unless something happens so nothing-- the fountain did nothing let's bring everyone towards you now is it time i don't-- it might just be the equivalent of a big red button the world loves buttons you have a jar of unending water if you wanted to-- i'm waiting for everyone else to-- i'm circling to the other side of the green-- yeah if everyone's gonna cross the room if the water were running which direction would the water be running down like if the fountain filled-- this is just i'm trying to conjecture i feel like the fountain's gonna irritate me for the rest of the god damn night do it touche i figure i think if you've made it this far that you've not touched several things at this point so this is so obviously a-- i know yeah i'll start walking towards them i hear this over the ears and i'm gonna slowly crawl not too close back-- oh shit i have a theory now never mind i don't want to fuck with it anymore i hand her my jug (laughter) i'm moving right now we can make it whiter i may play dungeons and dragons on the internet but now i'm embarrassed good to know thank you for handling skype so well it is not easy to be on the other side of that camera it's so frustrating
