i'm so excited i haven't heard yours yet here actually do this with me let's make a double rainbow gif for later (laughter) that's on you internet and then if you're at blizzcon i think we're going to be wandering around a little bit yeah i'll be there we tried not to peek somewhere they're saying that's my bear address it to me if you do now ten percent more realistic critical role more authentic homebrew that's available on android i almost wore my special spider belt too but it felt too weird probably like punk rock hippopotamuses that's kind of racist we are going to get a bunch of angry tweets from stegosauruses and triceratops i think you revert back to normal they are like stormtroopers they are you are being attacked by stormtroopers you're fine and when those go out you are back to human hit points sounds about right we're going off the map you could pick 'em off as they run through i'm not helping i'm sorry not there shutting up you can also hold your action just as an option not to help but you can hold your action i approve of this plan you could move and then move back i'm only helping with gameplay strategy sentences you never expect to hear in your d&d game he is reaching under the table ladies and gentlemen doesn't he have at least half-cover from the roof you're doing so well it's so great the roof is wet you can use bigby's hand to-- fly it like the carpet through the sky you did get a beret i thought you got a beret ugh why do you have to do that man i totally forgot i'm so sorry i'm at 26 i got distracted because i have a new-- i'm using my new sheet and i'm just confused so yeah new sheet i leveled up so i had to do a thing oh boy okay is there a way in are you facetiming somebody so is there a way in at this point i'm running over to the door and opening it i can hear the commotion from inside and i'm running in the door i'm holding my turn i'm holding my action i'm going to go straight through the hallway and try the door on the left yeah move the one to the right yeah sure that one there's no way to just quickly push the other door open too is there and i signal we're going to have to thin these ranks out quickly i'm going to be playing rule nazi tonight is that attack of opportunity possible since he's grappling somebody trying everything i can to save this bear thank you for coming with me on that journey i'm going to make a run for the door is it open can i open the door i would have to use my action to move you know (sighs) yeah this is going to be worthwhile i'm going to-- well (laughter) i hate you shoot out the window okay i'm going to be helpful i'm going to burn my action to get into the room right there yeah i want to stand right there how crazy-- i don't know if i can do minor illusion that way right now so i'm going to call hex on that first guard there yep i'm going to burn my action surge and i'm going to start taking my shots and i'm just going to work my way up okay this is with sharpshooter that sucks ten 11 natural 20 and so since that was a third shot it was also a bonus shot so that's got an extra-- okay does that mean that everything gets doubled not the modifier though modifier stays the same roll twice or just double my die okay so that's-- i should have just used my-- i know i should have just used it nine 13 26 42 points of damage and four of that was fire damage okay i move the black cloud to the next guard he also gains disadvantage on all-- let's make it dexterity saving throws ability checks yeah so all dex checks that's the end of my turn that hits that hits that hits that does not hit this is a first (shouts) sunlight yes it is i would have enough to point and say-- oh for the love of god okay fine i take my next shot at the next crossbow bugger that's 15 god damn it that's 22 yeah it hit that's 18 points of damage my third attack also on him is also 22 and that's-- ooh that sucks two points of ice damage plus 11 points of normal damage i'm going to take a step forward up the stairs yeah because of this you had eight it's a vampire i'm putting my gun away anyway what's that charisma score again where is it what's the damage on my rapier again was it 1d10 plus-- okay then in that case i'm going to bring my hex up to the very next-- and i'm going to put my gun away walk up to him and begin stabbing oh that's right i'm just going to walk up not quite that close but one step back take my next three shots that's 21 that's 23 i'm going to stop there in case that kills him actually i had to reload anyway all three was reload attack attack so that's 16 14 okay i move the mist to the next guy i had a bonus action so i just used it did i you're technically correct so go ahead we don't want people running to report we're here though no witnesses they might call vampires i'm going to start exploring the upstairs that mist is probably following me around at this point isn't it yeah oh boy okay i think so i feel cruel but in control this is controllable at the moment my charisma modifier is two i'm fine for now i'll let you know you'll know if i'm not yes let's keep looking
