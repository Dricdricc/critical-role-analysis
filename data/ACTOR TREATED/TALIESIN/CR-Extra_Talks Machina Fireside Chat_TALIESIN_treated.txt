great i've got a firm shot at it (laughter) no i've been loving it this was my purchase in berlin i'm quite pleased with it thank god pretty aware i would say he was definitely not the worst he’d been i was not prepared to where that was going to go there was no understanding of how the guns or the curse worked at all until it just started happening there was no conversation about that at all that was just me as player sitting going what the fuck is happening right now what is this oh no i may have made very poor choices i didn't actually even know where my character was at that point you just went with it man it was kind of crazy we could basically do sim farm if you want we could all decide to become sharecroppers and that could just be the show are we going to do eggplants for this next season or are we going to do carrots thank you that’s what i was going for i mean it's a long list and also i would disagree with greed it's a long list of things that he feels responsible for because he's the only adult in the entire world it wasn't greed it was just hubris yeah it was just hubris he's a character based on hubris people make that joke occasionally like immediately going into hell like okay nobody ever make a deal don't sign anything and then immediately within one hour is like i'm going to to make a deal yeah it's because this is what you do when you tell all the kids don't touch the oven this is my oven i'm going to cook something it's what you do when you think you're the only adult in the entire world it always goes well matt and that'll be the 90 minutes after this 90 minutes you maxed out the taint bar man eventually there's like two a block you can't escape them yeah i'm totally into it we named a couple of them and qwop i kind of like that they don't so that if people want to actually play the kids in their own games they can do what they want to do we haven't had time to sit down and go over this a couple of them would've gotten the other siblings' names i think we'll go over it yeah i feel like i have but-- oh wow that's a lot i'm just going to be sitting like this for the rest of the evening no it's weird one more-- (laughter) i'm so excited this is everything i’ve hoped for and more and it would have been very awkward and strange that may have just been because there was a lot of tension of when that was going to happen yeah i did so that was a thing when i was unconscious brian taliesin and he unplugged the machine you actually-- i've been torturing everybody i've been very specifically torturing all of them it's great it's making me younger i know a little bit of what ashley's doing we broke that right they know that those aren't the characters
