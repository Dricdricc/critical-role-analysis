it's like one cookie at a time you can't bake one cookie at a time we would miss this sense of wonder that we get to share with the community it's really nice it's like watching home alone next to macaulay culkin it's great i'm getting so much out of it stuff things i'm using it right now i literally can't see anything i think they would be less intimidated by a glowing mace than by glowing hands at this point i'll be behind you is this pressure by design or is this what's been done to the structure by the transformation that's right i forgot about the ring if we have to we can just have grog beat it down is it we can try and time it to a step 12 we could go have grog smash it down in tempo with the steps so that the sound will be covered i was thinking of the tainted love levi's commercial i like the idea of you punching this at the appropriate moment (singing) wait for it to go again and bump bump bump let the twins take a look i think it would be safe check the sconces see if they trigger something people don't install those unless there's something awful that needs to be done yeah i like this marching order he's better at blowing up than you are dear oh no maybe a second interrogation room and there's another room behind it maybe i am up here i'm right here tap the mirror wow is it in piles that would be about human-amount of ash all right i'll gil this one yeah natural 20 that'll do it's organic ash i hate to say this but tap the button i'm going to touch the door simon we barely knew him is it warm it's an oven i'm looking for some sort some sort of cancel mechanism somewhere on the outside of the door let's say that investigation was somewhere around a seven (laughter) we have been gone so long what's he going to say if you call to him was he going to say something why don't we try pushing all four buttons at once he's coming up with some bullshit let's try pushing all four buttons i'm going to do bottom left bottom left getting out a hanky and (blows) yes of course that's what it's there for the back of it does the mirror have a fancy frame are any of these symbols mirrored in the frame itself is there a mirror of any of these symbols in the frame no because you have to hit one and then you have to hit the two together-- so one-one two-two-two-two three four-four is our physicality of this map correct if we show you this i gave it a little bit of a rub look out liam marisha and how high up are the buttons so if he had something that was-- if he had a mop basically he could probably tap it but only if we're in there and then we don't need an unseen servant to do it let's give him a stick yeah he has a lance my god it will finally be useful one last time no we are not disengaging a smoke alarm with a fucking trammel there is a limit let's explain to the unseen servant what he's supposed to do electric boogaloo all right keep going i'll join in that perception i'm behind you know the standard-- i got a 25 vex is right 25 (old man voice) where's steven i'd be grateful if anyone got a sample of that bioluminescent fungus temple is the temple on the way does it make sense to cross through the city or does it make sense to fly up we've got some time and i feel like this city is an opportunity to find some more advantages it's not a city that just existed this is a giant primordial beast that people inhabited god only knows what existed in here if gods really understood how this world worked this would not be happening right now he doesn't necessarily know this place as well as-- what was the average land speed of a laden undead i'm not even saying look in it let's take a look at what it-- we might be harder to spot if we stay on the ground for now anyway i'm aware and then you three on the carpet you on the broom we're all ear-pieced this is in no way by the way an amazing mirror of that one time underneath kraghammer they're just going to find another clarota i will not die in this stupid temple i slap him in the face okay can't split the party we all go looking for the stairs oh you asshole stop it (laughter) whatever we do we can't split the party (fast-forward noise) okay we're going to split the party that was cabin in the woods shit 26 first time ever let's try and serpentine around and see if we can trace back yep been a while if there's anything left on grog by the end of this i'll try to swipe them off with my sword i'd like to pop in and see if i could take a couple-- i'm not i'm going to use my sword 16 i'm going to run in draw the silvered sword and take some swipes let's take three swipes right out of here that's one natural 20 one natural 19 do i crit on a 19 with the sword okay never mind and a two but that might be enough because i have a really high-- that's a 15 as my lowest to hit does a 15 hit so the 15 is-- that's 14 piercing damage to the first one with a silvered sword number two is 13 points of damage to the second one i twirl around and take my third wonderful pirouette attack which is 20 points of damage we have to stick together no it's far i think it'd be safer to stay on the ground level and sneak because if we're the air they are going to see us yes 23 we also have the herbs when it's time we don't have a lot of it let's prepare it and when it's time-- it's just burning the herbs though we don't need the censer just hold it in your hands it's good that we didn't go on the catwalk also have your unseen servant make a bunch of noise and have them all-- we can have the unseen servant pick it up what if he were to go in and get it himself yes but not here if we were to be clever if we're at the edge of vasselheim the vasselheim forces will be distracting his forces so we'll have less to deal with so we want this fight to happen at the edge there will not be a long rest i don't think i've only burned one thing that requires a long rest if we can pull this off without burning anything important then it doesn't matter i'll be on the broom with her we all have to be together we can't separate i can also climb up the wall if need be just for shits and giggles i'm going to take one last look around to see if there's any infrastructure for getting up there must be infrastructure for getting up here there wasn't layers of a city on top of each other this is why we hoarded it in the first place if they chase the jewel we can grab it and run anyway okay i'm not saying no this is like those little handkerchief ghosts you would make in kindergarten not the rock the lantern light the lantern and throw it it doesn't matter they're not paying attention they drop out of nowhere they faint it's going to be good i thought you were made of sterner stuff travis come on now is not the time to get squeamish we made a solemn oath we agreed weeks ago drop it in the bag of holding trying to avoid them weird question if i were holding the blue gem and had dropped it down this hole what would be the likelihood it would have ended vaguely where it ended up just checking does it do anything to the titanstone knuckles does it have the vibe of something petrified my only other thought of how it could be useful at this point with what we know about it-- it seemed like the undead were crowding towards it which means that if we do get attacked by a group of undead we might be able to shiny-object them unless of course it's dangerous in their hands that literally made the dungeon master laugh so i don't know if that's necessarily-- that's the color of dr manhattan i don't necessarily know if it's the same thing not crazy trying to crack it it could be a chunk of heart hold onto it for now it could come in handy are there exits i literally rolled a one i'm aware that there's a hole so there's a bar the door is barred then so break it let's get out of the way and pop the bar see if we can pop the bar right off the door the left one we set ourselves up we have some immovable rods whoever's in the back should have the immovable rods so if there's a sudden rush of water we can create a grate for ourselves myself and the twins i suppose i'll take a glance at these things to memorize their general shape this is some basic shit that you're picking up right now do these resemble underwater breathing emergency yeah let's take those just in case why is there no water running what yeah that's happening huge mammoth turgid leave one of them alive but don't let them leave 13 it's almost as low as i can go i know (beatboxes) not that one that one looks like he knows too much yeah but he's vined he had the map if he built the map there's a way out oh shit son probably not they'll have to move the orb to do that we need to dispel this shit oh shit and look what they're doing i have no ideas for anything oh for fuck sake yeah all creatures within range i hear a whole bunch of commotion so i'm going to pop my head up out of the hole and see what the fuck is going on well i'm coming up the hole i take a look oh sweet god i'm going to take a shot at the guy i see up on the table there that's better yeah the gray and that's 28 i'm going to drop back down the hall you don't roll you get the max until there's something to hit okay it's going to be okay everything's okay oh no here they come if we can hit them they're probably squishy we've got to get everyone away from that thing and then there was a third one radiant damage is what we need in here i'm going to stay in my little cubby hole i've got some good visual on a couple of these guys down here i'm going to yell at everybody to get the fuck away from the ball i'm going to hold my attack until something happens that's going to give me something to shoot at that's awfully close to the ball he's lost visual range of the ball like he's parting the red sea taliesin and that's not gandalf that's a cosplayer five hobbits in a cloak that's all it is it's not a wizard inspire yourself i have three wow that was a deep cut i see that and i take three shots at this fucker up here immediately how far away is he i'm going to use bad news then because that is within range for my fucking sniper rifle he's going to take that i can't use a bonus action and i have to reload once so i can only take two shots with my action i can't take three so two shots with bad news here we go that's a 25 and 27 to hit first shot is 22 points of damage second shot is not as good 14 points of damage there's a lot of noises going on in this place i think it'll be okay so the sphere is still there was there a third guy that's an answer he could roll a save though reload going to take another shot going to take a shot yeah let's take another shot probably got a low ac let's make this a sharpshooter just for fun yeah that's a sharpshooter shot so that's a 24 to hit all right so let's do (counting) 26 points of damage we can still interrogate him he doesn't have to be alive for that any other problems let's rifle through these guys' stuff which one do we want to interrogate let's throw gray robe into the annihilation ball let's get rid of him everyone gather up we're going to get our stuff i'm going to get odell oh okay there was a third guy right that they killed early on assume we're going through everybody and taking their shit i think that's a good idea oh yeah we're taking all this shit were they drilling i want to take a little bit of an inspection were they drilling with this thing is that why they had it why did you have to tamper with the fundamental forces of nature wait was that a wisdom saving throw let's leave it tend to the sick and leave the well alone all right let's all back up finally i'm in the explorers motherfucker i'm in the explorers no yes i'm really in the explorers i'm one of river's little brothers i'm ludwig i think he's not ready to pop a wheelie on this thing yet yeah no i'm okay with this bring the sphere back down so that we can throw their bodies into the sphere so that they don't turn into undead fuckwads here's a weird question what saving throw do they have to make to speak the truth and what's the save are we going to try this crazy shit yeah what's the plan what are they trying to do what's vecna planning how many of them are there five he might not know that but what are they excavating for what are they looking for i think i know too but i want to hear him say it it'd make me feel better get in the zone no not me we'll take the fanciest cloak burn the bodies fuck it throw them into the sphere it's so nice to be back
