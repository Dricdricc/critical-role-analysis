slytherin slytherin ravenclaw's pretty good pretty good i thought we called you it's like a new york subway over here and the year after it's going to be at my house it'll be great yeah i can now be your companion as of this week in fallout 4 if you build a robot and give it the male voice i can be really polite to you for hours on end laura and you can have me be very polite that's the only way you can have me be very polite that horrifies me normally sedated oh god yes i'll take a look ooh that's not bad (eerie music) 23 are they in the clothing of the natives or do they not look to be ashari they look undead doesn't-- possibly one looks vaguely familiar but there's something wrong we should proceed-- let's go up and find out what's happening slowly and armed yes there's something unnatural over in that direction we should probably be the ones to investigate you're okay let's take a look at least we're supposed to make sure they're not part of something larger that's heading in-- he said if they don't bother us to leave them alone but that we should just check to make sure that they're not part of something tread gently and see if they react so it would be best to get their attention now when everything's quiet there's only two maybe four of them that's exactly what we're saying you did 30 let's just put it down quietly no magic just weapons no guns i pull my sword the d20s talk to each other and they know that you're not true oh my god it's better than tragedy candle really i mean that's a shite band to be fair good to know he's not under pass without a trace (whistling) well that got dark yeah okay this is her game use one of your good dice should've used the good dice i'm feeling a lot less guilty suddenly i was really hoping for a fatty arbuckle skeleton impression i was really really hoping for it what you did was cool but like that was just my heart all right i'm in on this oh hell yeah is it a candle though it's like a thing like there's no-- it's a candle the way the wheelie things are hoverboards i think it's weird oh look at that where's the big one that one the one holding the tridenty thing thank you fatty 27 i'm fast as fuck first thing i'm going to do is i'm going to use my pistol i'm going to do a trick shot for the arms actually the first thing i'm going to do is i'm going to use my bonus action to-- you know actually i'm going to hold off on that i'm going to make an arm shot to the one with the trident that was my first shot and that's 25 and that's a strength saving throw that just barely makes it that's fine he's going to take his damage and then he's going to take another one of those because eff that that's 13 points of damage all right i'm going to take another shot 20 strength check he dropped that and that does seven points of damage third shot's going to be a sharpshooter shot that's probably going to miss 14 all right that misses i'm going to take a run behind and hide behind that rock outcropping we have we'll try and remind you if something affects it i'm just waiting for the hand to go in and just-- can't keep fatty down i actually don't i don't know what happened to my d8's i'll buy some at the convention tomorrow way better than last time you knocked one off the plank keyleth i'm toe to toe with that one right there aren't i it's in my space okay i'm going to draw my sword i'm going to try to do a back and forth let's see how this goes i'm going to take a swipe at it with my sword that's a 30 that hits yes you did i have fire resist on me so that's how much how much fire damage four damage four damage four ooh 15 points of damage he's being a dick i'm going to try and break away and back up i'm going to try and roll away from him to be on the other side of the rock my armor class is 18 but i'm going to use my shield for plus five to my ac so that won't hit instead of going to the other side of the rock i'm going to run straight back and i'm just going to shoot at it as i run away i'm going to make two more shots at it oh i'm going to take one more shot because i have to reload that's a 15 wow holy cow no that was amazing that's ten points of damage and then i reload we did not take a short rest did we there has been no time 13 (singing) take a bad roll 13 he's cut things out of cardboard this doesn't look fun there was an instructables involved in this this is just really-- we're doomed i could feel it from that side yeah i know i could feel it i can hook you up i have a kit that's not even a figurine it's just a chunk of plastic i'm halved because i have resistance (laughter) ah you're adorable but first you have to take your fire damage here you can see it right here you're that little red ring right there and then your two followers are right there if you have anything that goes in a cube you'd be fine do you have anything that's a cube shot whichever way you want to be facing you could just have them swat you like (zombie grunting noises) weird question what saving throw does a creature have to make with your sword it's a wisdom saving throw constitution saving throw good to know that was wisdom fascinating okay i'm right in the thick of it aren't it i'm going to break away i'll take the hit i don't like attacking these things straight on nine points of fire damage down to four okay i'm going to break away and take a run for it towards that crater in the far right corner thank you yes that ain't going to hit that's fine i'm going to take my bonus action and i'm going to cast hex on it on the one i just ran away from with a disadvantage on constitution saving throws teamwork ability checks god damn it all right never mind that's fine since i've broken off from him i'm going to take some shots at him anyway i'll take three shots first one is an 18 that's seven points of damage second one's a sharpshooter that's 25 i haven't actually damaged him yet have i that was the first damage the second damage i haven't done yet 20 points of damage no i'm not oh shit so that's six extra points and that's seven extra points total third sharpshooter shot thank you for reminding me on the hex that's a 12 that's going to miss weird thing can i spend an action surge and put myself out of the fire you know what it's just fire i will be on fire i'm going to be on fire yay wow science check does oxygen penetrate the sphere damn it because that would've been amazing if he just died that's a d8 there four gallons easily probably way more than 50 gallons it would be a few hundred gallons of water again again oh yeah this spell is awful i'm looking forward to rolling it back through the rift oh god i hope this works pop and lock pop and lock wait plus plus-- that's halved to five i'm going to shift my hex to the tiny little (irish accent) fucker god you've got me doing it now damn it it's a plague no no no the one furthest from me yeah right there i'll move my hex to him i'm going to bust out the bad news rifle i'm going to sit and i'm going to take a nice calm calculated sharpshooter shot at him and bad news just goes (click) i misfired it's fine i put it down i pull out the pistol and i'm going to take a shot that was really awkward that's a 25 to hit yeah six 12 22 points of damage and i reload and that's my turn it's the girth of gern where did the glow sticks come from it's just like a weather balloon thank you thank you we actually had a critter tweet us how much water 225 gallons we've got steam i think he would lose-- can i put myself out while all of this is happening shove him in the hole you have inspiration yeah with an app can i knock him down a notch can i try and shoot him to drop him out of the sky a bit i'm going to try first of all i'm going to hex him he's hexed i point hex moves over and i'm going to take a shot to try and drop him i'm going to take a grit shot to drop him that's 22 and that's what's the saving throw for that strength throw aw really that's fine he'll just take his damage yes thank you that's 17 points of damage i'm going to shoot again yeah just with the pistol right now 400 yeah 1200 for bad news i'm sharpshooter i have no range increment range increments are for-- we don't do that here that's a 31 to hit and that's 16 points of damage it's going to get worse all right and now i'm doing a sharpshooter shot pew pew
