there is a wednesday club we're doing comics 101 it's going to be our intro to how to read comics the notion is like the show that you would show your grandmother or your friend who's never apparently seen a written word next to a picture before they do exist i'm sadly not going to be there but amy and matt are going to throw together something really really awesome and i'm going to be helping out from the sidelines throwing them stuff because i'm going to be out of town but yay yes i'll be doing my old man voice it's very fun yes i think he's a maybe yeah it was super cool mouths are for eating not for talking 15 that's looking really crowded over there i'm going to wander over to that first prison cell and take a look inside that door yeah a lot 27 okay how's my visual on that guy through the window and i ignore anything other than full cover i ignore three-quarter cover all right i'm going to take my first shot at that lock yeah that's fine i'll take my first shot with the pepperbox at that lock that's 27 obviously it doesn't take psychic damage that's 16 points of damage cool i'm going to turn and take my last two shots at orthax i've got a plan i've got an orthax plan never mind i've just given the game away oh man i'm too tired i'm going to mess up my plan this is so bad first shot i'm going to take the animus and i'm going to try for a trick shot for an arm shot one for grit and just for safety's sake-- no that's all that's a 31 to hit and that's ten plus eight plus 1d6 psychic plus i'm going to burn eight points of cabal's ruin which empties cabal's ruin so that's going to be 14 points of damage plus one point of psychic damage plus-- five six yeah i'll take a seven and an eight i'll give these back to you (continues counting) 23 points does that seem right 23 points of lightning damage and also he has to do a strength check or drop the axe he makes that strength check (laughter) and just for fun i'll take one more shot that's 31 to hit that hits nothing fancy on this one obviously just the old-fashioned-- 16 points of damage plus one point of psychic damage and then i'm going to use the rest of my turn to if possible open that door and get behind it for cover of that room i just want to use it for cover he did another thing i already like it this is a beautiful glimmer in your eye i'm excited if he's prone does that mean that negates the difficulty to hit through the ring so that's a mess yeah i think i can see that vax is having a little bit of a problem there's a window in the door i'm going to swing around the other side of that door really quickly perch on the wall right over there and i'm going to take a couple shots at mr skelly skellington no i was tempted to see if it was anything-- we've got him on tax evasion (laughter) i was hoping we would find a person in there i'll keep digging okay so first shot i'm going to burn a grit for a torso push actually i'm going to add hex to that just for fun i'm going to hex him that's 23 to hit that's 14 points of damage two points of psychic damage and five points of necrotic he also has disadvantage on constitution-- checks and he's pushed ten feet back i'm going to shoot him two more times second shot i'm going to burn one more grit and i'm going to try for a head shot which will give him disadvantage on next round's attacks 24 to hit that's 11 points of normal damage five points of psychic damage and two points of necrotic-- piercing damage he has to save against a constitution saving throw against 20 he has disadvantage on all of his physical attacks for the next round one more shot for fun and let's make this a sharpshooter that was not my wisest thing ever 16 oh well i'm going to flip back around on the other side of that i'm going to spider crawl all the way on the other side of that door again i shot him in the face that happens when i breathe for a second before i shoot i'm sorry here's a d8 you've got bonuses and stuff though smear him all right i'm going to reload because boy i'm out laura and yeah no that's right i was like what what bubble-- yeah (gravelly mumbling) got a little thing i didn't know it had a name and now it's the obvious name for it it's bubble throat i'm going to swing back around and back up a little bit and i'm going to take three more potshots at that bone because that's what i can see i'm not going to get close to him i'm going to back up a bit just back up in the middle of the room i'm going to keep going nothing fancy attack number one that's 26 to hit and that's nine points of piercing damage five points of necrotic damage and two points of psychic damage better and i'm going to see if i can-- is there anything i've got two more shots oh i can oh all right let's do that that's funny another shot at that guy 23 23 oh and that's right i don't have that anymore the hex isn't until next turn where i can move it that's 15 points of damage plus one point of psychic damage oh all right and then i'm going to take another shot i'm going to make this a sharpshooter just to end this yeah that'll do that's 14 20 25 i didn't know i had advantage that's lovely that's 18 19 20 21 25 points of damage and four points of psychic damage i get another grit back that is other than just backing up a little bit more as far as i can go just to get out of the-- getting away from everything i'm good at a distance yeah aren't there still two-- that's plenty if i have a moment i'm going to look in all those doors really quickly okay then i'm going to wait one second not to look in those doors but that happens and then-- yeah we pull it i threaten it down and say run and owe orthax your freedom run okay can i use friends to help with that or no just go for intimidation yeah i'll use friends to add to that intimidation so is that advantage all right that's cocked that's fine anyway intimidation is ugh eight i shoot my gun next to it i feel like i'm losing it what's in the other room (laughter) if there's anything interesting anything on the body on the giant on the pit fiend yes of course we were running-- let's just say we had a grudge and we took care of it always no we didn't ew i like crimson peak as much as the next person but this is kind of over it we're going to be okay we were expecting this then what it's a big prison i think you're going to be very far away from us very quickly i'm going to sit with doty i'm going to stay in the room i'm just going to be sitting on doty probably matt okay i say oh no whatever will we do we have this enormous piece of equipment that you don't understand and could possibly be very dangerous and probably should be locked up with the rest of us oh no it's actually working better than i expected it's going to be fine we're going to be fine not yet nope they wouldn't have taken it less talking more doing it's on the other side of the bars as long as we're free already-- am i still chained down by the way all right that's fine have we technically had a short rest since we were basically just manacled walking for a while okay just checking nope nope let's just-- can we still plane shift later okay stealthy bats they can see no they have both i mean biologically they have both yup everything's fine 35 a gate we can go through straight in the door keep going straight nothing quite like googling '5e bats' smells better than the prison oh yeah oh yeah and we're doubling movement okay yeah just the two of us attempt to acrobat roll so that i'm up and rolling we did a lot we did well 30 are we making noise now do we care including the two of us even though we hit one good to know okay i'm going to take my six paces towards the lava pit and then-- -- blood pit and then i'm going to hold my attack until vax does what he's going to do i'm loud get in position and then wait yeah i'm useless i've been holding an action right can i burn that as a dash action can i burn my action as a dash yeah i'm burning my action as a dash i'm going to keep booking you can't hold movement we're all human now okay got to fix this super fast yeah we all know oh shit no no that's not-- oh that might be campaign over yeah that would've been fucking bad you have a bonus stand her up yay nice fuck sound at this point i suppose i'm going to run and just get them into view all right three shots and i'm going to do a pushback on all three and i'm going to push them all-- spine devil spine devil bone devil three spine devils and one bone devil three spine devils and one bone devil no coke pepsi and the bone devil's a real problem i suppose okay in that case i'm going to push him back i'm going to do a shot to push him back and that's a 19 29-- that's my power song you don't even know 15 points of damage plus five psychic and he moves backwards ten feet can't get pushed any-- he's still-- all right second i'll take a spine devil the one that's threatening the most people 25 that's not the damage oh yeah 17 points of damage and six points of psychic damage the other one i'm going to spend a point for grit for deadeye just to get advantage that's cocked 29 14 points of damage and one point of psychic he's still standing action surge three more shots hitting him again same thing with a grit yeah that's good to do 24 to hit that's 11 points of damage and four psychic third spine devil same thing-- actually i get my grit back third spine devil yeah actually i'll reroll the cocked one but it doesn't matter yeah that hits yeah fuck it it's worth it though 13 points of damage and five psychic and another shot same thing with advantage that's fine 24 thank god they're easy to hit that's 16 points of damage and four psychic i'm going to spend my last grit last grit is a shot to the spine devil that was one two-- i'm done reload and that's the end of my turn need to heal do you have anything to heal with (laughter) we've got to find out which room he's in yeah 15 oh my god yes do i get an attack of opportunity since we're moving out of its combat range who else wants it grog you want it so we've got one two three four i'll say yes yeah i'm out of its range now okay i'm going to back up a bit move me behind that-- and then move me-- the other pillar head that way does it look like those chains are feeding it and it has eyeballs would a headshot to those eyeballs actually be a thing that might work i'm going to try it i'm going to burn a thing and see if that does it so yeah let's find out right yeah that'll do 32 to hit all right that's a d10 and d6 that's 11 points of damage and three points of psychic damage and it has to make a constitution saving throw there's no snapping breaking the glass man you made me burn a grit that sucks that's okay i'm going to take a sharpshooter shot at it and just keep damaging it i'm going to do a sharpshooter shot that was shot one shot two that's a 25 that's ooh 27 points of damage and five psychic and another shot same thing sharpshooter fuck i never do (groans) could be worse 14 does 14 hit okay and then i'm going to stay in but keep an eye on everything that's happening million oh you have a slight ripple figure phantom bear it's a dex saving throw and 20 is what we need i'm going to use a resolve and see if i can make this work nope same thing 17 all right can we make a chain you i'm going to try and break out of this chain goddamn it strength check or strength save 14 can i use an action surge to try and do it again yep i've got one more (sighs) nope just touch will work laura and you may have to throw the knife oh god stress out out go go
