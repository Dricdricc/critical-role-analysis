i think everyone's mostly fine it looks like a river at the very least don't trust anything in the feywild how far in does it take to cross all of these little rivers what's the speed and roughness of the ten-foot let's find a nice mix of not-too-wide and not-too-rapidy not too fast and start thinking of a way across it and making sure that it's not magical or strange and i rolled a nine i think i'm fine i'm just wet ten wow perception check with disadvantage that's not that bad where's my perception there it is 14 we didn't actually even defeat it that was very clever with the pot by the way that was less clever but still very impressive what if we were to throw your chain or if we could throw the rope across the river yeah no that's better no vax has already crossed we're not going to feel the angst coming off of him here's a thought we take the rope we tie ourselves to it we toss it over to the two of you we start using it to wade you help pull us over everybody would have to be terrible for everything to go everybody will be fighting together to get across as long as we're tied together we can only go so far it'll be like mountain climbing i think they're across two that's good 20 feet across yes i'm sure that was a little harsh see better we can do that in five minutes easy plan easy peasy teleport with the immovable rod you shoot one end of the rope to him everything's easy peasy i grab it too what are you doing oh that's good i rolled a ten i'm not that strong so i tie the rope to myself we're going to tie a rope to you you should be in front and then the rest of us vax vex 13 only for aquaman is this favored terrain you're great run i believe in you that's my jam 27 to the future me it was vax garmelie vex keyleth don't say that that's not cool i haven't seen that river in two years it's so nice that was terrible initiative i am embarrassed by my initiative 13 he's thinking an alligator voice is going to hurt a lot that's what he's thinking (laughs) yeah you haven't raged yet uh i feel like we're learning a lot we'll see we're all still tied to him can he roll for gag reflex there's a rope coming out of his throat oh boy a lot of my plans got swallowed okay i'm going to pull out the retort pistol because bad news will not be happy at this range first thing i'm going to do is i'm going to take a head shot i'm going to try and blind him for the round this is going to go great see i'm too nervous to even take sharpshooter so we're just going to do this clean and i roll a natural 20 fuck it the trick is not to care it's good enough 26 fuck i forgot to cast hex goddamn it can i throw my bonus in there really quick they watch the show they've heard me say worse can i sneak hex in there i can get it in between attacks technically not it's a bonus action i'll do whatever you say i'm not going to fight you i'm trying to find my d10s okay here we are so that's 11 points of piercing damage the save dc is a 19 on a constitution save it's not blinded it has disadvantage on attacks until my next turn and now i'm hexing i'm going to give him a disadvantage on strength checks strength or constitution i'm not asking why am i asking people asking is for quitters still at disadvantage because of the close proximity is his mouth open am i close enough to start laying in a few shots inside i'm going to lay in a couple shots inside two more shots inside with hex attack i'm going to try and go for the sides if i hit grog i don't care he can take it with disadvantage that's a jam on the retort pistol wait no that's a save reroll fuck my life okay so that's a jam and one to try and fix it really quickly just trying to give it a clear with not disadvantage because it doesn't matter one yeah roll damage anyway i hate you that's ten points of damage i don't have a jam okay so i'm going to do a clear sorry one more shot i tried to clear it clears i hit 16 plus-- i don't have a third shot but now i'm at least reloaded do i need another round to reload or does that count as a reload a clear i can never remember okay so i'll have to next turn okay i'll just call that clear the last thing i'm going to do is i'm going to move away from the crocodile with all my strength and i'm going to say everybody pull and i'm backing up this is going to be so sad it might be fine oh god i have the worst strength eight we technically have our hands free and are tied to the rope so in theory we could still use our hands and just try and all shift backwards like stupid people i hope i have its attention it's really hard to count up here you're still raging too because i hit you bring it that hits i'm using my new fancy counter i'm so excited to take damage i'm not that excited to take damage 34 grappled and restrained you got this you do so i'm grappled there's nothing i can do and everything i have at least at the moment anything with a gun is at disadvantage oh but i've got hex on him so even if i hit him with a sword it's an extra d6 i'm going to try and start hacking him to let me go ooh weird question if i use the drop-it effect the grit drop an item can i get him to drop me as an item sticking him in the jaw i can't get him to i can't make him roll to drop i was hoping okay in that case i'm going to grab my sword and start hacking at him okay that's a 15 did i no i don't have advantage for these that was the first attack since her guiding bolt 15 okay the next roll wasn't a 20 so it doesn't matter anyway that's 28 matt those do have disadvantage all right so that hit and then for my last one that's not bad 21 let me get my new d8 that's super oh i can get all my d8s and then 3d6 for some necrotic damage so that's 13 points of necrotic damage and 37 points of slashing damage oh god that game again it's a sign he's going to turn on us at any moment i'm a little iffy but i'm okay what is that how many-- oh she's rolling dice 19 that's nice there's so many rings on it it's great ow grog could you help with this i really wanted alligator boots but i suppose that will do please help what no oh ow i stand up and kick one of them all right there's a river actually there's an empty stomach isn't there i'm going to stick my head in and see if there's anything in there just for fun grog smash this anything exciting come out i'm going to pick one up and bring it to keyleth for you well done (applause) i'll go can i acrobatics check this to try and make the landing that'll be a 21 i was already covered in crocodile bile this is another layer of sadness cast hunter's mark really quick we should move until it's time to camp and when we camp we should camp in your palacious i don't think it works that way i think you have to tell them and then they have to say it 16 apparently he's fine 33 i'm going to mask it that simple this is not the woods this is a bog so take the broom back and fly 100 feet behind him it's an idea really they may know where we want to go though i'm not saying they're nice i'm saying that maybe we need some new guidance we'll shoot you first you won't feel anything no not really we'll send trinket too so either way you feel like you've accomplished something you'll both die and then you'll know that the bear goes with you don't answer that that's a fair point we'll keep an eye out vex it'll be fine you are charming you're both very charming so be charming you're extremely charming she is charming i think with this many witnesses it's not a threat it's a promise i want a good vantage how many windows are there just one window what size person is the chair for do you describe this her house is going to have chicken feet (laughter) i am watching that hag through my scope with everything i've got run we should go
