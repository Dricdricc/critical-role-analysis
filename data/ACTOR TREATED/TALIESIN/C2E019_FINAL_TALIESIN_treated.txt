my face hurts i get nervous spending too much time in one place but if everyone's going then we're going you're at a table you're doing well eventually you're going to want to walk away from the table the table always offers you four times the amount you've ever seen you got to walk away while you're winning but all right seems a little late for a wager at this point fair i'm in shit not like it hasn't happened before did i notice him casting haste okay blood curse of the eyeless full strength the darkest galaga i pull the full riker hop over the chair (laughter) and it is out of town it's almost perfectly out of town i've always wanted to go to deadwood i am feeling greedy versus both yeah it does sound like fun we're already in i'll get it oh that's up there huppers i can use a little-- yeah are you going to be able to heal enough to-- for going down river or well i suppose it's going to be-- oh that's well-- your hit points of course we have the cart and the two horses yeah we have the cart at least we have horses horses for days we're already ready to leave at a moment's notice nine potions the tenth one's free i'll take water-closet wc north marisha and i was going to say i was hoping to find the same thing nope that was a two with advantage a two and a one i've got a torch for this group that's pretty good i'll take third watch what's your-- your perception's probably high as balls yeah you take it should've put money on beau kicking myself for not putting money on beau it does actually make me feel better thank you you're not there you can't hear any of this you're asleep although that would be what i would imagine jester saying (as jester) guys it's so crazy you know (as taliesin) that was terrible insight check i've been holding out nope natural one has she tasted human flesh i mean i'm on one of the horses yeah oh no this'll be funny come on first good roll of the day that'll do that's a 16 does it look like happy fire smoke or bad unfortunate something's burning dark-- no we'll do this later do you see the smoke over there (loudly) everybody there's smoke over there we've got to get hold of this right now there's definitely a plume of smoke i don't know what it means i don't know what it's about it could be a good thing it could be a bad thing but we have to stop this conversation right in its tracks honestly i can't tell from here it's very localized is it into the woods or further along it's about a mile off the road it doesn't look like chimney smoke i'm not sure does it look like campfire smoke there's people though or something i mean just be on alert they could be burning anything we'll find once and for all the answer what do children taste like they'll be happy to see a cat i don't think we're even going to pull over for a bit i'm following great that seems fair selling any wares or do you need any news from the other side of the road there are skirmishes at the border and soldiers are moving east lots of them worth noting we're trying to avoid it for sale oh yeah yeah that's still we have some bits and pieces what do you need we have gold but you don't really strike me as the type who cares i've got a few bits what do you need do you need tools i'm going to pull out-- do we have anything fresh produce we're a little thin on because we're just on the road but we do have-- that's a nice piece of hide armor that's very nice how about 16 gold pieces and you throw in a little bit of meat perfect ten i pay the man pleasure doing business with you be careful there's soldiers running around all over the place right now have a lovely day i've met weirder and meat there was a trapdoor in the floor and there were just people stuck underneath there wasn't there three more points on that perception roll and i'd have been like that carpet looks like it's been moved recently it's all right i think i've met weirder people what kind of armor is it out of it's hide armor all right we made a friend yes he's very dead and then he rose up from the grave again and we had to kill him again twice same man i'm thinking of planting soybeans that'll do what kind of meat is this out of curiosity nope it's just going today as far as i know it could be veggie if only i had help counting to the number four i think i'm going to want more of this i'm not sure where it's coming from but i
