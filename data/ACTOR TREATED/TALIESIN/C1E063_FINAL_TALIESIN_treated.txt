i'm feeling the hag is anybody else feeling the hag we're not feeling the hag but i think we should avoid her and we do have a direction to move i'm pretty sure she's the hag i'm okay with that i honestly i could use a bit of sleep at some point and i think moving in the correct direction getting a bit of sleep somewhere safe i'm working on that as well if there was a time to not be us this is the moment right now he does in fact have a javelin of lightning i feel like we've done enough damage for one day i promise you we're going to kill something very soon huh that's weird that's weird i got a 19 35 or maybe things just got strange new die i'm gonna try and scope it ugh could be worse 16 a pair of trolls that we see that was a thing yes they could be smart trolls they're eating something that's stuck which could be us very soon let's keep moving we're going to try and climb a tree for a minute i don't see a change i'm not sure yeah you have one don't you let's see what happens all right take him i'll be fine i'm gonna i have a potion of climbing oh yeah with advantage athletics or acrobatics okay that'll do 16 24 natural 20 i think we want to observe it and rest up we do we have the mansion really it's been since the river i want to see if i can find the source of the bog muck i'm gonna get close enough to at least make out some detail is it a solid trunk or is it like a combined trunk i'm gonna back up and try and find a place to scan the ground find a place to put a door for our mansion safe yes no but i'm close to it nothing no if i were animal life i would live beneath the surface like the trolls i think there's quite possibly things that live in the muck probably not on top of it no although if you find a log approximately two feet thick i could certainly use that a log about two feet thick doesn't matter it's fine i've got a thought so i'm gonna try something i could use some sleep and i've got a little thing to work on for the moment swamp shoes i think some swamp shoes might not be a terrible idea thank you swamp shoes yes i mean not quickly it won't help you walk quickly it's not necessarily the most stealthy thing on earth but you won't drop two feet into the muck every time you take a step maybe the muck is unhappy to be there it does make us sad to be around it it's just muck we haven't yet let's take a long rest i mean no you didn't say anything i'm going to make a jump to another tree oh my god my potion has worn off hasn't it one hour seven i want the mansion now it won't hold i'm just gonna hold on we just need to get in the mansion it's fine sure give me a little bit and i'll do something to it i don't really know what i can tell you but i'll take a look thank you i need that tree as well let's take that down to-- want to help me with this before your nap or after all right i'll start on it then you can help when you finish i'm gonna go work for a little bit i'm gonna make swamp shoes they're very simple but yes i have to make a lot of them and i'm going to be enlisting her help it's literally just thin slices i'm not making them super nice i'm just-- yeah i'm gonna have her-- that's pretty much what i'm doing other than sleeping i have to take a negative 10 for that like that really removes 10 let's burn that page can i remove that extra two from your charisma i'm gonna wipe it out it's proficiency bonus plus dex i hate you i hate everything that you stand for oh this is nice this is um it's two 26s i'm keeping the inspiration dice and let's see and two 19s they're not pretty they're made of rope you've been watching a lot of olympics i'm going for a full long rest after my crap and there's food sail you're my hero sorry i just love that word it was good it was good do you speak rock i feel like a terrible person i think it's just a great word that's all i walk in at this point and i'm just looking for some chicken a dozen bakers is keyleth still covered in goop do you have any left on you i'm going back to my room can you roll lower just for fun while everything's going on i'm running two passive experiments in my lab while i'm working on the shoes i'm leaving some of the muck on some chicken that i took from the kitchen to see if it has any effect on flesh after a long exposure and then i'm distilling some to see if i can even identify anything in there or anything weird do you have to roll for that metaphor metaphor ooh long rest eat some chicken all right all right yeah we're in my room making shoes they're not but thank you rustic very rustic i'm proud too you're not here you were a bootmaker that's very true huh that's interesting at this point can i tell anything about the muck from just boiling it to separate components trying to just see what's in there i'm assuming it's probably just death-paste it's just rot but it is decayed matter the tree is producing it well here's my question what do trees need to live where is the sunlight and the tree's alive well it's got to eat something this is what it's producing and it's got to eat something maybe it eats trees it probably does but at the same time you don't get something from nothing and life needs things to live you don't get life from nothing a little iffy it's just a hypothesis but what if the tree's carnivorous or omnivorous it's very big it might be a cannibal tree interesting how do you poison a poisoned tree sunlight is definitely something you should put in your arsenal whatever it's not used to being exposed to i don't think rot is going to be how we kill this thing i think it's not going to be like the crocodile it needs purification i think it might just laugh poison off i don't know nothing laughs honey off can you make honey in that jar you've got very little brain don't you that's not what we're hoping for i was about to say i don't think it's much of a cautionary tale really yes i think that's definitely i think light i think electricity there is water in the was there groundwater of some kind i'll watch this can we cure you tie a rope around her this time holding a rope terry we got a name yes i have no idea i'm racking my brain and wishing i had access to a library it's all pornography just the entire library is like-- it's like beauty and the beast it's just pornography it's more than an expression it's legitimately something you do unfortunately you need salt for that that wasn't salt that wasn't salt that was something else and i used it all for the cannonball inside the tree is the bow i think if we remove the bow i think if we find the bow inside the tree i think that's how-- the heart of this tree i think we go in if i were the heart of a tree i'd be in the center i'm curious to see the library i just want to see what a giant disaster this is i think that's a shopping list yeah seemed like a thing we gotta get the archfey out of the tree you are so charming and you have so much good advice after a rest i'm going to sleep that would be great but we're also getting the bow i think it'll give you wings so you can fly i am going to sleep there's nothing that can be solved right now that cannot be solved over coffee and bacon i will make bacon from chicken that actually sounds really good yes yes good morning it's all right no you're welcome and it's the lovely thing about a title and i had one to give is that it's when used appropriately and properly it's mostly there to remind you you don't really need it yes yes well technically my sister but yes if that makes you feel a little better never do that again that was very weird it was really it was it was worth it to see the look on his face it was quite wonderful no and it worked out well because technically speaking there's only really about 15 foot square that's actually standing that you technically have a baronry over and at the moment it is currently a shrine to the raven queen so that works out well no she's just fixing it up for us we did not give it to her it wasn't mine to give just the title you're welcome and it doesn't change anything yeah although i imagine you're eventually going to become very insufferable but yes oh you have to be there's a thing but we'll get to that later there is a thing i forgot there is a thing yes a thing we'll get to that it's really not important right now that's if we survive that would be very important but right now it's not no we might i think that's an excellent idea let me join you i have shoes for everybody they're awful i'm aware we're going to wear the shoes they're swamp shoes they're circular they're like large circles and there's like a base connected to them and whole thing's connected together with ropes it does it will keep you from sinking into the muck it will allow you to you'll have to walk very slowly you can't walk very quickly and if things get hairy you can cut them off they're just wood and rope they're not that complicated yes move like a giant frog you don't need them though you're the one person who doesn't need them talk to it see what happens and if everything goes terribly we just retreat back to the mansion it's not going anywhere anytime soon i'm going to keep back in the treeline i don't think we have one no no it'll be fine a tree is just a door that hasn't been made yet remember it's an old druidish one thank you yes i'll take the rear then going in (chicken noises) then me way too tense to talk about all the great things lootcrate will send you every month crates will just show you everything they have still going in i have no respect for anyone who says we're not so different no no he was being terrible oh he was a dick and for that matter anybody who says we're not so different that's usually a sign of a terrible person terrible person well that's very fair i was only not shooting him to be polite 21 i'm going to dart to the right and keep about 10 to 15 feet distance away from the exterior wall because that looks creepy as fuck about there first thing i'm gonna do is i'm gonna pull out bad news and i'm gonna take a shot and i'm gonna try and disarm him so we'll see if that does anything natural 20 it was the best it was such a wonderful wonderful-- a fan gave that to me yes they did natural 20 and that means i don't even burn the grit for it and that's arm-shot so strength saving throw against a dc 19 okay so it maintains it i forgot to cast hex but god damn it that's fine so taking my shot that went well that's 19 times two that's 38 that's 44 points of damage of piercing damage i'm gonna reload i'm gonna cast hex that's fine seems to be taking it that's fine i'm casting hex i'm giving him disadvantage on strength saving throws i'm gonna take another shot-- yeah checks excuse me i'm gonna take another shot at getting that damn bow out of his hand so we'll see if we can do that yeah that's a 19 so that's 32 to hit he can roll his saving throw so no he drops the bow bow's on the ground that's a terrible roll that's okay so that's ten points of piercing damage and two points of necrotic damage bow's on the ground oh shit acoustics iphones ipad pros apparently he can we haven't found a winner we haven't found a winner we've just been hitting him really god damned hard we're gonna set him on fire we're gonna hit him with light we're gonna hit him with things you shouldn't have been that hits that doesn't hit okay okay do you roll that or do i yeah you are doing some crazy shit sondur oh you got the fudge end at the very least i might try and get him to drop the bow and then you're gonna be the one who has to grab it if things get 14 we're both prone does that mean that we're in combat or can i walk away from it and it doesn't-- all right i'm spending half my movement to get up and i'm backing up against the wall backing up against the wall i'm not using bad news i'm going to use retort i'm going to try and first thing i'm gonna do is use a bonus action to heal a little bit yeah that's nine plus twelve so that's 21 figure that out when it's not my turn next thing i'm gonna do is i'm gonna start shooting to try and get that bow out of his hands one more time first shot retort yeah same trick but not nearly as much damage that's 16 to hit firing again that's another 16 18 to hit god damn it okay that's my bloody roll god damn it 23 doubled i made a friend that hits that also hits i'm fine that's mean yeah that was rough i don't understand how magic works yeah oh no oh no 12 helps number two maybe you have to roll it angry angry die always angry that don't suck and then he's on fire now right god damn it that sounds like a handful of hate that was like four dice you're good you need healing it's a constitution ten damn it just hurt him just hurt him did you use the cone no you can't use the-- oh you could use the cone oh don't make that face ish esque sharing space i just watch this i put my gun down pull out my sword and just start hacking at the tree that's 25 23 and 27 that's a thing that happens now okay and so that's (travis elbows the set which makes a loud thump noise) 35 points of slashing damage all three together yeah i just went thump-thump-thump i'm going to move i'm going to charge north just to split the group up a bit yeah actually if i can hug the edge a little closer-- around that way and then ten feet away from the wall and then bonus action to put my mask on in case anything more gassy happens and then i've got a grit left so fuck it i'm gonna-- oh no because i can't switch weapons fast enough never mind i'm gonna call it i took it back from you last game 'cause you weren't there yeah you can have it back if you want i just took it for the swamp 19 23 yeah parkour watch out for that tree yeah i'd be angry god damn it bastard i'm gonna do a missile snare 23 points of piercing damage that's gonna be 13 points of piercing damage and can i use that four i'm gonna take that four lightning can that hit the glove i mean like hitting so-- all right so that's rolling now that's in play thank you as you've cupped so many before (singing) i believe in you you can do the thing really burn it i know had it worked it was a good plan asshole god damn it blight's nasty fuck yeah all right okay no breakup is that rough i'm going to i'm switching back to bad news and i'm going to reload and i'm going to try and got that last grit i'm gonna just try and get him to drop the bow part one that'll do 24 he has to make a strength saving throw made the save using a legendary resistance okay that's fine don't care that'll do that's 20 points of damage he has to make a it's strength saving throw yeah he makes it and just because nothing else seems to be happening i'm just gonna burn my action surge and just keep plowing into him for two more shots that did 20 points of damage taking another shot that's 29 that's 28 points of damage hm no i've been doing damage yeah sorry that's 20 points of damage and 28 points of damage 22 wait 20 points of damage on the first attack attack i just did was 28 points of damage and then the third one that hits that's a 31 i do not crit on a 19 18 points of damage lay into him and i'm gonna run and try and get some cover on the ent in the dead-ent dead-ent dead-ent very very fair and he burned a legendary save yeah walking around like an idiot the entire game i'm gonna walk up and grab-- grab the bow real quick he was terrible he was terrible that was a terrible person we have a mansion that's within walking distance
