i think it's fine she was too dangerous to let live i pull out the broken barrel and inspect it i had some thoughts but yeah 11 i'm going to just take the broken gun and point it at my sister what do i feel i think i'm all right i think i may be all right i'm going to do something else you were the one who wouldn't give me the other gun i'm going to go over to the little lab setup is there some acid there 17 i'm going to start trying to scar her name off the barrel i think it's fine you're going to have to have some faith no (laughter) well i think perhaps we can talk to keeper yennen perhaps put together some priests to deal with that enlist the help of the entire town now that there's no longer a revolution to be fought we forgot about that so perhaps if we tell everyone the briarwoods are dead cassandra wouldn't that be nice never in my right mind would i hand my gun my insight is 21 you are going to cost me so much money (whimpers) i'm so upset that i have to do this going to kill you i'm going to kill you for another three minutes i hand him the broken gun i reach in to try and grab it out no he dropped it that was so expensive wisdom saving throw 18 he's paying for a new one he's paying for a new one i'm going to have to-- oh god it was so expensive oh just throw the carpet in there now why don't you (yelps) you were never mother's favorite she told me oh god yeah i'm letting it go oh god that one was enchanted okay two enchantments yeah all right i'm not alive 27 25 sorry did the math wrong i step forward the briarwoods are dead there's still a great evil beneath the castle but the briarwoods are no more there's still a matter of some things beneath the castle that we must deal with first can we pass by the alcove pike is shocked pike is shocked and offended can we-- definitely want to go let's stop by the alcove i want to stop in i give her a big hug this would not have been possible without your help thank you for everything i have not we have not searched the castle yet though we don't know it's not airtight or anything i mean they're breathing no we're going to give him shit there's no problem here that's going to explode two years on a sitcom i can hold this all day (laughter) i leave it to you this is what i really wanted to see grog while we always must dispense our justice this is now a town of mercy as well and i will expect nothing less from all of us than to give what we have lacked for so long duke earn your life again they've just had this shit in a tupperware container like in those big bins in the back for the last five years with like duct-tape lids i want to take some time to tell keeper yennen about what is beneath the tree and let him start to macerate some theories on what to do-- it's a word for big name thank you do it it's a beret i don't think he made it dorky i think it comes with that already sewn in with a beret i don't know if that's-- less aviary than celebratory no there are traps we've marked them it's also disturbing we can send word is it going to be throwing the rest of my guns into a pit of acid replacing the guns that you threw into a pit of acid i really can't think of what else i'd want to talk about please go ahead that is not a terrible idea and it's possible that the books are still within the castle and we do need to build three new structures where the lords' houses were and i find the idea of rebuilding those mansions to be a bit distasteful we will discuss it it's got a ring i will admit you were doing something as well it lets you commune with nature it's like a dm version of natural 20 in that ancient way that trees talk thank you it's morning somewhere i would be very grateful we shall
