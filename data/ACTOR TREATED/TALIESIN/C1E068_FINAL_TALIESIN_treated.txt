no notes flying without a net is that actually a real movie let's make a poll that was slightly less awkward than a real segway it feels like it went away except for the ones who come on our show he has great shirts casts just smell like you after a while i've got mine for a disney trip later this week that's real close i was also on the beach i want to check the boat new die i got an eight i tousle the blanket aside what pack is there a pack in the bag i'm not at my best i legitimately have no idea turns into stone it's deep-battered covered in cheese scanlan i may borrow you for a second i have an earpiece damn it when you get a moment we could use you for a second down here when you have a moment he says he sees three things nurture check i'm going to flip one of the boats over as a shield and hide behind it hey i don't quite know what to do i legitimately have no idea what's about to happen because-- 22 that's the same as me it's going to mock my cover isn't it okay this is not a ranged attack on any level i can't counter because it's not a ranged attack okay this is just going to suck ah well that's nice 20 yeah it can't fly too far 13 points okay that's 89 okay i'm sorry i'm doing math which is apparently really difficult it's been a day okay out of desperation having no possible idea of what else to do i'm going to try and shoot at bits of it to see if i can dislodge anything i don't know trying to shatter some of the glass and yell bloody murder i'll take a standard shot to begin with for the moment i'm going to stay where i am well actually i'm too close to get a decent shot aren't i all right i'm going to back off about ten feet yep i want to be about waist-deep if i can i'll move five more feet-- yep that's fine my ac is 18 (sighs) it's reminding me of something that happened this week okay i'm going to take a-- blender of glass it's a whole thing i'm going to take a shot at it to see if it does anything i know we never talk anymore that's 23 to hit all right let's see what happens with-- i'm trying to shoot a whirlwind i don't know if this is actually going to do anything i'm not feeling very hopeful nine points of piercing damage huh i assume none of my trick shot stuff is going to use-- that thing's weird okay i'm going to take a couple shots see what happens i'm going to do a sharpshooter shot that's another 23 yeah that was a much better roll so that's 24 points of damage i'm going to take a third shot and here we go with the same sharpshooter 21 ooh that's nice 25 points of damage it was a very good shot and i'm now going to call over the earpiece everyone back giant flying glass wind oh god and i'm going to take a deep breath-- that's actually what i said i'm going to take a deep breath and i'm going to dive underwater put my gun away and dive underwater that's cool you'll be fine would i get caught in that it's also water i honestly am just looking for an excuse to hit the glove i'm happy to take the damage awesome possum he says he can't hear you over the comm (sing to the tune of fly like an eagle) yeah it's like you've weaponized a cvs auto-door basically is it technically grappled would that actually-- okay fine in theory if there's a storm you go underwater i am absolutely sure dragons are real i've killed two of them that's fine oh that hits oh wow yeah that somehow just barely hits 112 i am not doing well but i am alive pain and lack of hit points i also assume it gets an attack of opportunity on me if i leave its radius of course it does it can break away from the wall it just can't pass through it okay the first thing i'm going to do is burn a bonus heal i've got a heal that i can do so i'm going to heal myself a little bit so i'm not quite as close to death let's add 12 points that's nice slightly better than before oh bugger i'm going to pull my sword and technically speaking i'm perfectly fine to just hack and slash on this thing right now right i stand up using half my movement and start slashing at it like nobody's business it is a magical sword thank you for reminding me i'm going to roll three at a time to make life a little easier that's 21 22 and 23 i do you know why i hit easily because i do very little actual damage it doesn't count as a dragon does it oh look at that yep 13 i rolled six six six roll of the beast that's 39 points of damage has anyone seen this terrible movie called rob roy okay i'm going to start conducting it and spinning slashing and then dropping it to the bloody ground i'm going to slowly start making my way with great determination and not particularly much speed i'm going to hobble my way toward the next one of those bastards i'm calling it futzed you need some d8s or you cool we haven't leveled up yet we're still hanging at 14 let's take a look at the wind wall you are definitely you are practically my textbook definition of a gaseous creature muppet liam dueling dictionaries mine's been rocking i don't know what your problem is how far away is it god i'm going to pull out the gun and start laying waste to it i'm going to reload and take two shots with sharpshooter oh no now that jinxes it see that's better look at that that's lovely 26 and 23 46 points of piercing damage yes there were two shots with sharpshooter which is a base of 16 times two so that's 32 plus i rolled a ten on that which pushes it to 42 plus a four so 46 that was for you now i feel guilty natural one i'm cleaning my gun i'm not even looking thank you okay i'm putting this away and not thinking about this for a little while i believe that was for bad-- no it's the pepperbox i believe scanlan can you use your very very delicate sword and put some very very gentle difficult-to-see holes in both of these boats that was not what i had in mind straight delicate stabbing did we actually end up searching the boats for everything or did we not end up searching the boats for everything does anyone else want to take a short rest where's she going all right you want to keep the dog for later don't you that would be lovely i'm bleeding over everything that is so kind of you to say oh thank you ow that's nine nine is good i'm a little better thank you it's a spyglass i assume yes here you can look through and you can see that everything is very far away just like you thank you i think that's a good idea i do it's not quite as powerful as that although that is an interesting idea i might play with that later that'll do i'm examining one of the red rocks does it look like anything the red circle spheres probably well he was because he was starting a spell we should spread them out everyone should not have-- you'd need one and someone else take the other let the twins have them because they're the ones who will get separated it's a way to call for help grog i don't think you're going to need it very often i'm going to follow he's got the right idea i'm going i just had this weird thought do i smell anything do i taste anything in the air is there minerals i had this horrifying notion are there signs that this island has even been vaguely inhabited at all recently how many people does it feel like are here see if you're going where i'm going on this 12 straight i'm going to keep my senses aware as possible for the signs of a mining operation and you find it 14 ten (quietly) we can stage whisper then i suppose it would be grog me and keyleth maybe you going to see anything other than me really i'm like the city lights of los angeles i'm such a wannabe (shushes) (whispering) i say we put her down-- (quietly) i say we put her down as quickly-- that's right we have to stage whisper this is fine let's all assume that everyone cannot hear us (quietly) we don't she's probably immune to magic we're going to have to take it right now she might not be catchable (whispering) she probably can't magic one of the others i'm going to-- i'm going to create a distraction when the distraction happens we all charge and attack i'll shoot her i have a very good distraction no she'll know i'm here when she feels a bullet hit her i was going to make the treasure chest look like a trap triggered i was going to have it explode with an illusionary poison that's fair magic users try and chase the others off see if they'll back off we've got to get that box away from them yes i can't move it just a little-- i'm going to make my way to the tree line and get ready i'm going to make my way to a tree line sitting down i'm going to try and get a nice clear shot the minute that i see anything happen it does nails and screws [break] where are they and the box right now i'm going to stay in the brush but i want to get forward enough to get a clear shot so i can really take a nice well-aimed shot at ripley's head i've got some nice distance i'm going to cast hex on her with my bonus i'm going to hold my action i'm going to train and i'm going to shout from the woods step away from the box and tell your men to put their weapons down and we will listen it's a hold person stop moving put the crate down or i'll shoot out your ankle put it down right where it is if i see a twitch i fire you can talk you have however long i choose to give you explain to us why we shouldn't kill you now and let your two friends wander off into the sunset not to be touched by us if they turn and run vax keep an eye out make sure that there are not people in the jungle coming this way i am in agreement that on that level all debts are settled and fair however i believe we have some previous debts to still settle you are so dull you two really follow her are you idiots 12 hey anything we should know before we continue what's she paying you i bet i could double it attack her right now and we'll discuss terms i'm not actually sure i could double it but i could definitely make it worth your while right now it would be hilarious she's awful oh are they moving behind you do you know you can't see they really don't like you do they know what you did to my family do they have any idea what you do to the people that you stay with how many have you sold (sighs) well i guess i'll have to live with that i open fire i'm going to do a-- she really pissed me off i'm so sorry okay i'm going to spend a deadeye shot on this which is a bad news shot with a deadeye with the hex by the way she is at disadvantage on strength checks the hex is probably not going to do a damn thing i don't even know why i bothered magic fucking cloak with sharpshooter i am so nervous natural fucking 20 laura and did the hex actually take then wouldn't i have noticed 17 it's been doing fine for me although i will admit i rolled gold for this roll yes i did 30 i just rolled a natural 20 on my initiative it is 30 has she actually been hit by the hex by the way that's fine what do i roll for concentration again my hate lives oh man that felt good okay where was i i'm going to stand up that's fine what's the distance is it only bad news distance or am i within 400 so i can actually put bad news away and actually deal with this they probably all have much higher-- they're going to have initiative up the wazoo so i'm going to-- okay no i'm going to pull the big gun out again give it a reload and give it a shot right at ripley i've got the hex on her let's pick a fun disadvantage let's see let's give her a dexterity disadvantage all right first thing i'm going to do is i'm going to do a standard shot at her with a leg shot i'm going to try and knock her prone no sharpshooter that's 26 to hit she has to make a strength saving throw against a dc of 19 make sure i'm rolling all the right dice that'll do that's six plus ten 22 points of damage plus three points of necrotic damage that's funny i'm going to burn an action surge and i'm going to shoot her two more times because it's funny where is she what's behind her i'm going to hit her again with an attempt to knock her down i'm going to burn another grit for that that is 32 to hit not quite as good 14 points of damage plus three points of necrotic another strength check just for fun-- no then that's just her bonus action for that although that would be pretty funny i'm going to hit her one more time with a sharpshooter shot do i get a bonus to hit her because she's on the ground or no even with sharpshooter even with standard sharpshooter bonus of ignore three-quarter cover so the full range sharpshooter ignore three-quarter cover would not cancel that out the whole theory being that it's easier to hit smaller targets that's okay she's down what am i going to do i'm not even going to pretend i'll burn a point of grit to also ignore that that's probably not going to hit let's see 14 i throw my gun behind on my shoulder and i'm going to head to my right to try to get some cover with that tree yeah around keyleth yes thank you for watching critical role brought to you by poor decisions i should mention i suppose that these rifles are probably very breakable wouldn't a roll of a one with a rifle misfire one more player off the board i'm not at full but i'm much better you're probably down next to me with some cover though probably not up kill her you take your action to cry oh god we'll send him out they are the hong kong cavaliers still at the ready good that's funny you are a beautiful person oh look they made little caskets for all of our figures no but good enough 18 is it too late to reroll that no no better i would have been dead stop making that face it can't kill me 15 that's fine i'm still fine thanks to you so that's halved again those were bad numbers in theory i'm able to sense my hex i'm not sensing my hex not at all that's fine there's really no point of even moving at this point i'm just on fire i'm going to pull out the retort pistol and i'm going to shoot that wizard in the chest with some fun i'm going take three shots at him the first is a sharpshooter shot that's 27 with the minus i rolled really well 24 to hit i'm sorry actually it's 27 i'm really angry right now i'm genuinely angry i can't even roll should i count that or not should i reroll it that's 26 points of piercing damage what the hell i am so calm doing this i'm going to shoot again same thing that's 12 i'm going to burn a grit and i'm going to do a torso shot because that'll be funny no sharpshooter i am it is hilariously funny as possible oh and there's no save for this it's just if i hit come on be cool that's cool enough 21 i'm going to use my bonus to have a greater potion that's 4d4 plus four and then i'm going to make sure that i look the wizard in the eye and i'm going to yell to him you're not leaving here alive you're going to die as i reload well i can't reload yet but i'll reload in a second turn him into paste please if he tries to run you'll kill him anyway you can only do it once per round yes she does i don't although i do have cover i don't have full cover i have some cover that'll hit adds five to my ac currently that also hits that's funny and useless but okay 14 points total all right i'm going to try and slow it down with a catch so i'm going to try and lower that 18 ooh i lower it by 14 points so four points of damage plus four psychic they don't move that fast (laughs) i'm going to be laughing my ass off for a minute yes that is a thing no i very rarely use it because it's a bad-- i can do a quintuple but you forgot goddamn it okay are we rolling that all right nine additional points of necrotic oh god i just saw it what a lovely number roll them again that was five and does he get flung we don't actually know where ripley is can he not do anything while he's in there well then we'd know where she is she's got cover by the way it's a tree and a bear where you can totally do the point break mid-air combat isn't point break the one where they keep jumping out of airplanes i can never remember does that mean he can't fire his gun for as long as the spell is up good to know his options are pretty limited if i recall is it going to be able to hit her there is no way that the guy who's currently got a knife stuck in her isn't going to get some of this just asking it's okay there are options that is a series of poor life choices oh shit (high-pitched) he's not going to get hit because he's touching her at the time that she gets hit oh shit this is about to get very bad oh thank god it's about to happen 23 38 28 29 hold on i've got to do some math oh my god no i'm good i'm good okay okay she has to go over and pick him up it's already taken some hits with your eyes closed he is made of stone mine are almost in the singles okay first thing i'm going to do is i'm going to-- this is such a bad experience on every conceivable level first thing i'm going to do is i'm going to run up to that jerk with the knives and i am going to press my left hand with great authority especially considering i've just taken another bolt of intense electricity and i am going to iron man the living-- on the head i'm going to just do it i am going to use diplomacy for the first-- this is the second time we have ever used diplomacy i actually have no idea how to roll for an attack for this i have no idea how it works so i can roll and tell you what i roll that's embarrassing okay i just rolled and unless you've got something to add to that because that is a sad number that you just threw at me okay because it's touch i don't actually have to put any-- it's a 22 is what i rolled i am horrified by what's going on 16 but my strength is a one so i'm horrified okay oh god technically if it's one long rest i may be at three charges two or three charges okay that'll do ten points oh for that 11 that's fine he's stunned okay am i close enough-- in theory i wanted to be touching distance to keyleth can i use a bonus to feed her a potion or is that a full action (high voice) all right next round okay that's fine for the rest of my action i'm going to after that two slashes with the sword to finish it up and then hop down do i have advantage because he's fucked at the moment okay so let's do two little slashes natural 20 oh because he's stunned oh and so i'm going to roll crit damage that's funny i'm going to whale on this fucking kid because no we do not have time for niceties so that's 4d8 maybe (counting) yeah 34 points of damage no that's 34 total i'm going to then hop down next to her and on that side of her so that i can deal with that thank you can i pop in a bonus action i meant to take a potion anyway for myself thank you what's a regular at thank you i'm having a heart attack right now nope she should write a book she's got a broken gun right now can she repair on a bonus it's an action it's a full action to repair an action to repair ha (laughter) but she can't fire unless she has a-- fuck i shouldn't have even said my god damn-- god damn it all right this is meant to punish me for everything i've ever done i'm well aware that this is punishment god damn it that's a 25 i am still ducking behind the tree but that still hits that's too much math happening over here how many 25 points of piercing damage i'm going to have to try and catch that because it's going to fucking knock me out so i'm going to attempt to snare that bullet it snares all ranged i can do it once a round yeah it's a reaction (groan of frustration) i snare eight points of damage off of that so that's-- how many points is that i'm not going to fall wait uh necklace okay i'm happy either way shit okay just checking that's fine shit okay i am unconscious mm-hmm mm-hmm okay is it his turn next god damn it take it currently i do have some ac because i have some cover i don't know why i'm arguing with this because i'm amused by this entire process at the moment my grit doesn't restore from-- none of my stuff restores from death does it i am desperate because we are still so fucked you have a success anything would be helpful right now oh good you're awake i look at our little friend up there i get up a bit i look at him just run i pull out my gun and i take the two shots with the reload that i'm allotted at ripley so oh thank god it's the retort pistol because that would have been really poor that's a 29 to hit and 15 okay that's fine that's 13 points of piercing damage i doubt he'll do well without her i try and take cover i'm going to pull as much cover as i possibly can and take a defensive stance oh and i'm going to slug a healing potion for my bonus thank you i meant to do that i was literally thinking that that's the greater which is 4d4 plus four yeah go on i'm fine i've got so much coffee in me okay i'm yeah that's so sad all right ripley literally attacking the darkness this is what dnd is all about he might laugh off necrotic she gets to heal can she make a ranged attack while she's-- i feel like i'm learning things here she's out of grit i've had to deal with this shit so much that does not-- oh do i still have some cover with the cover does not hit yes it does i had that coming has she not lost her-- is the psychic damage attached oh a thing i don't know so it's just a thing i'm going to try and catch it so we'll see how that goes i'm trying to find the die for that which seems to have vanished there we are 17 points all right let's see what this does okay so that's down to nine points okay so is it 17 total okay so that's nine plus four so that's 13 points i am still standing i am rasputin here this is getting ugly that hits oh yeah no i'm out again but she's out of shots but she ran her full movement didn't she oh this is getting uncomfortable i'm sorry my issues have guns god fucking damn it has anyone else ever been to a horse tranquilizer party because it's like that and epipen except you can't afford to do them anymore sadly i'm awake again i was but now i am awake a moon shadow i'm aware aren't we always i'm rerolling that seven with disadvantage wow this is here to hurt me let's pistol shot with disadvantage three so 16 misses oh my god i'm going to climb can i stand up and climb on top of the-- he doesn't have an attack of opportunity against me where he is right now i'm going to stand up and i'm going to ignore him i'm going to hold my attack until i see her the second i see her i'm going to attack then as a fucking bonus action i'm going to drink my last potion a regular you can hold your attack until she appears again the returning was inside you all along sharpshooter shot retort misses 12 sharpshooter shot retort 20 (sighs) that's all i got because i burned a shot attacking keyleth so i have to reload (sighs) yeah i'm going to stare at her and the best thing i'm going to do is no matter what today i forgive you but i cannot let you leave and i'm going to sit and reload bless you scanlan for the win how can she still do that oh shit i burned that trying to make that thing no i decided not to back away heal no wait something the wine was a poor choice it was a good wine but it was a poor choice until we hold and we wait for her to appear again which she will inevitably will sadly that's fair that's two moo jokes i might add attacks of opportunity vax ran to the bathroom also doesn't technically the young squire get an attack of opportunity i trust you i hope he kills orthax and isn't even here 18 plus nine to hit wow does that hit that's crazy that's a 23 to hit of course that hits as well just unconscious again you stealthed that hard i'm out again it's a slash attack all right 21 points it's a crit within five feet ten i don't remember guys let me say i have the coolest character lined up but okay this will kill me by the way everything you've got no he can't really do it marisha and wow am i the first one to go i'm prone and i'm in shadow with cutting words roll a d10 well no do i still have my cover bonus it is a giant mess in there so you have to roll a ten this is adorable i'm not unconscious technically speaking that's three can you do something about this this is necessary at the moment do you have nothing can you do something with that okay never mind then i'm not looking i don't want to look i'm okay with this i think percy would like that i think that's very appropriate as the person who is sitting here i think that we will see you next week it is time no i need to process pick this up later yeah let's stop this conversation for now we'll have more of this conversation later i will not have this conversation online either guys sorry he'll be getting a mohawk thank you we'll have this talk later it's okay honey thank you matt
