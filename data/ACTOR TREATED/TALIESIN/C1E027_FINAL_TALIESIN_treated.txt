it was literally bucket list that was one of the things we discussed when this game started it could lead to a game with vin diesel it's like a group mass suicide at this point antifreeze and lilac yes hello (shouting) help natural 20 28 (cheering) he was sitting here 20 minutes ago i rubbed him for luck when he was leaving the building 28 so i just see him up like this just for some reference does it look like he's possessed or does it look like he's trying to remove something how insane would it be to try and make a shot beneath his legs i'm going to drop down can i make an aimed shot against something i can't see okay i want 51 start here and make it all the way down i'm going to take an aimed shot for my first shot and then start firing blindly it missed i'm just making sure i didn't misfire no i didn't thank god 15 still hits 15 hits oh that's 16 points of damage and he has to make a constitution saving throw to not be knocked prone where is my dc dc of eight plus my proficiency mod plus my dexterity mod so 19 i'm going to take two more shots right above his head i don't 20 that's 13 no 13 points of damage and then 20 again nine points of damage i'm going to stay where i am and i'm going to keep yelling help i don't think i have an earring that hits that does not i have a technical dispute really quickly could the wraith have gotten that far since i knocked him prone oh thank you never mind ignore me 50 keep up people come on thank you all by the way for leaving a bear on suicide watch that was really cool (sighs) there's no way i can fire at the one who's far away from me right now is there i can ignore cover though i'm going to see if there's a charge left in my glove and try and take the-- there wouldn't be a charge left in my glove would there okay (sighs) hold on sorry it gets weird when it's up close okay let's see what we do all right there's no way i can step back right now is there okay i'm going to try and take shots then firing with disadvantage screw it i'm going to take my first one with sharpshooter to see if i can do any damage that way nope actually that's a misfire okay do i have six seconds well it misfired okay i'm going to do something a little weird i'm going to pull out bad news i know i can't shoot this close with it or god only knows what would happen i'm going to try and swing it like a pugil stick and i'm going to try and hit him with the butt of bad news 15 15 four 14 i hit it with the stock i was careful yeah i'm kind of-- yeah nope armor class is 18 can i do that crazy thing oh you've removed that okay never mind i don't have the new update sorry i don't have a dodge anymore right what is that a d10 i'm going to use my action to try and clear my gun what is that again did it change since last time okay so it's 11 i'm adding my bonus die god damn it nine i'm tossing it into my room i'm using an action surge actually can i even do that yes i'm going to use my action surge and i'm going to walk over to the wraith on the ground put the barrel of bad news up to it and pull the trigger is he not i'm just going to try and shove it until i hit something and then pull 22 19 if you fail i get to scream in your ear i get a grit point back i have to use one to reload i have one more attack but i've already-- i didn't move i'm going to try and roll around the corner and i'm going to take another shot 27 19 points of damage sorry i'll make an arcana check too not going to sleep down there i'm going to go into my workshop 17 i'm fixing my gun is it the whole cost or half half cost oh my god that's awful okay tinkering check 12 technically that would be a success oh i was asleep i wasn't with them so i just woke up really early 75 gold i was going to be at the door i don't feel like doing that oh lead on i really don't i think we're here because i wasn't prepared nine nope i think we are in the situation we're in because we now know how much we don't know how much i don't know i'm not prepared if we face them now i'm going to get you all killed well that's just weird i'm still weirded out how soon will you return i still feel i owe everybody an apology i still feel terrible about dragging you all into this and putting you in danger if you're with me we can be prepared for them this time we know enough to prepare ourselves we can have ourselves ready this time i think a week to prepare is reasonable and then we leave we leave quietly i've been avoiding it for too long and now i know too much hold on i'm going to hold you before you go i just wanted to say i'm so sorry and thank you and thank you for doing this for me i fear my temper before this weight is lifted from my heart i do not wish to lose myself like that again and i am so sorry for everything i've done i will do my best to maintain myself i apologize i'm going to finish up those things that we talked about earlier spend some time making some ammunition and i'm going to attempt to build what we were talking about earlier 24 no i used that okay 11 they're not hard i say that as like knowing my actual skill level i could make one i could make a collapsible one where it's basically a one-third dodecahedron like an observatory story-wise it's more amusing it's copper at this point i have less than 100 gold but it will fold 22 there shouldn't be a glass piece-- aw man what could we put it on the mending wheel 22 (sighs) i can always use this for spare parts for other things i've already built a smoke bomb and some rounds of bullets all right i'll put a little more time in this can i get some inspiration for this too if that would be possible come on come on 23 okay i'm going to put these away for a later time and if i have one more day i would like to work on-- we've got it taken care of that's my week okay say what you're busy this week this is made of things i don't like the nose yet it's too low was that a jab at my-- no never mind oh god yeah just going to let the guards know to watch our guest while we're away keep him under protection i think so yes and you say (gargles water during marisha's speech) you know you can speak english you don't have to-- yeah i know where we're going we head to turst fields turst fields is just northeast of westruun it's where we would make our camp i'm going to draw out a crude map while we make our way so i can let you all know where we're going can i share my map you know i've forged all of our documents you are aware of that right any time we've needed papers i would prefer not the direct route can you say that anything that is not laced with sexual innuendo i would prefer taking that direction i don't want to head straight towards them the parchwood forests are dangerous as they are there's really no safe way i want to inspect it from an engineering perspective if that's possible ten that's quite a good idea it's a ten once you're across let's secure the rope that's attached to you and we'll make ourselves a guideline that we can hang onto clever ten yeah 26 is it something i would know 21 can we find a place to maybe settle down it's getting dark i think we should camp i'm still awake i'm going to fall asleep last sure i'd like to think so yes it's been a while yes i suppose thank you been trying not to think about it i did say that didn't i honestly i'll say i've had a number of years thinking about what i would do and what i would say and how i would go about this this kind of obsession is not healthy and i know that and it's no way to live and i'm sure that was something on the list of things i thought i would say some attempt to be scary when i met them as opposed to being scared i think i was-- (sighs) again i don't really remember much because i was so angry i've never been so angry and i think i was just trying to sound threatening and i'd had these dreams before you know i've-- you don't build anything like this without the knowledge that you're-- i'm aware that inventing this thing has been a mistake i pull out my gun i've had thoughts about it but i didn't really think about what i was doing or what i was going to build until i decided to take my revenge and i'd never thought about building it because i realized what a dangerous idea it was (sighs) and i fear for the day that that comes back to haunt me i don't know what i'll do but i don't know i think i was just trying to say something to be intimidating i honestly didn't even think i was going to kill him it just happened is your insight really that good add my charisma modifier 18 i do regret what happened and i know he was a bad man but i still hope to never lose my temper like that again honestly i think we both need sleep i love you too thank you probably another day before we can camp close enough to attack let's keep stealthy have i walked this path before i never walked this path at all 32 is this the river okay so we're not at the river 16 i heard them i heard them describe it would i know it from the description just from my local knowledge nine
