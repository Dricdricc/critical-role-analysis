possible that we did get it packages are not necessarily opened in the order that they are received nor are they received in the order that they were sent nor were they necessarily sent in a way that actually was received by us we have them we've possibly opened them we're pretty sure we have them we don't open everything on air so it's entirely possible that we did get it just because sometimes we see a package and get curious like a small woodland creature yeah they yell at us and 826la as always and first place for youth it used to be a notebook it's not a notebook anymore you all have
