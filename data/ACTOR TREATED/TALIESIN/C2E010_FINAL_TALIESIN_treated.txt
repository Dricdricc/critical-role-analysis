or turn it into an octagon i did he's starting to do stuff down there he was enthusiastic i'm excited it's good stuff incognito i don't normally speak with the dead on a first date but we'll think about it that is fair you are shabby i'm not bothered does feel like a terrible abuse of hospitality is the traveler the only god you've ever seen or have you seen other gods out of curiosity so this is the one that decided to make itself presentable to you i've been drinking we're having the room party after the sewers i want to defile a very expensive shower and somebody else's hotel room will get us clean let a man be eccentric i'm a real fan of this one i'm tossing a silver over just for that yeah don't tell me how to spend my money what you're hearing is the happiness of a performer fuck you birdman (laughter) i know one thing that's a photosensitive thing if we need to make a fast escape i'd rather have some light maybe if it's something like that daytime's better for that different environment i don't know travis and i say we do it i'm buzzed and if i have another drink i'm going to be more than buzzed i'm right where i want to be i want a 45-minute walk to get there we have a light spell though don't we i must have a torch or something i have a tinder box i have a hooded lantern i have all this stuff in this bag i never opened you've got a handaxe have you equipped it yeah look at that oh wow a poor man could buy half a cloak half a cloak between them i love it coming down up up down down left right left right south always down that's fair this is your fault how would you know that i'll be with you i'm activating one i'm pulling a hand down one of my swords and i'm getting it to light up oh my god six six 16 don't you have a-- actually you've got an unarmed strike so that means you can do four points of damage technically it's not one point it's four points-- no it doesn't help i see the mess this is making and i'm going to turn around and i'm holding the sword but i'm going to punch with the hilt of my sword no the one that attacked yasha plus my strength my non-existent strength modifier that's a 12 to hit that's one damage i can take a bonus attack though and i'm going to hit it again 12 well i'm using my other hand since technically i have two attacks it's not two-- it's another point of damage way to date yourself right there you worked to make it so nice i did seriously caleb how are you if we hit you really hard would you still be standing up right now that's a good question i hadn't really thought about that rat spiders ooh at first i thought it was some sort of evil gassy dog are they undead rats with advantage all right where's my intelligence-- there we are that's a-- no that's a nine mostly undead let's be sneaky yes 12 i think we should try to cut it down in case it's a person or a rat i'm going to try to very gently maybe with everyone's permission i'm going to gently start cutting into the bottom of it not too deeply i'm sorry do you have a plan well all right then i keep moving downward yes it was the radiant rite or they haven't been eaten yet i'll work with that let's try and not set fire to the human shaped things poke and wiggle then a flame well it knows that they're alive--- so i'm sure they wiggle every now and then anyway they look pretty dead don't they that'll do yep little bit of magic on both sides little bit of tank he's not using it i'm going to very gently cut her handaxe out with my radiant sword don't eat it all of the ones webbed to the walls are just as emaciated and dead six i'm going to start trying to cut down find the points of the web wall where it's being held together and cut any of the web i'd forgotten to be fair invisible spiders are the best spiders because you can't-- hey look at that i'm 13 we have a couple around we should probably clump together that's a lot of dice you can go first i'm going to head towards the spider as close as i can get there's not a lot i can do i'm going to use devil's tongue i'm going to use vicious mockery (guttural infernal sounds) it was gifted we are golden gods i have made a terrible mistake i'm just going to hold an attack for the second that it's within range it might auto if you select your-- it really ties the sewer together (laughter) or do damage he's a liar he's a lying liar fair blood maledict i see it look at her and i immediately full blood maledict i'm going to do the fucked up one and i'm going to take four points of damage for it there you go i have that moment i look at it and my neck bursts and i bleed out the vein bamfed let's form up stick close don't get so far that we can't get to you if it hits you i'm sticking with everybody and let me take one-- where am i let me take like a step back and hold my action there mm-hmm because reasons it's called princes of the universe yay slightly warm toasted i'm going to at least run up to the other side of jester just to keep us clumped a little bit what i can do is i can do vicious mockery again i'm going to cast vicious mockery and (infernal voice) i'll cut off your legs give it a shot make a roll against wisdom (infernal voice) who ate all the cracklin' oat bran save versus wisdom wisdom modifier is three i mock him and that's three points of psychic damage and he has-- really does it not even matter then he has disadvantage on the next attack something about my words are just making his blood boil (infernal voice) i whisper and then i fire i never had it do that before you see what i mean these people are fun i'm going to go poke it with a sword i'm going to start binding it up for travel it's very dark still also (muffled screams) no i hear the commotion and come halfway over and nothing seems-- they're burning spiders you are checking the bodies for things right well that's fine then we see him collecting everything anyway we know you're going to lie about it she was a good person i heard gentleman i'm walking over who's the gentleman oh of course friend we've never seen you before in our entire life does anything about his tattoo irritate me you know what i mean all right that's fair and some coin why don't we get into some daylight and take a look we do have a spider body to pick (sings) continuity roll for continuity maybe they buried something here i'm walking over with this too i'm waiting for them to break up and i suppose we're packing the spider up to bring topside nott we'll give it a push i hang back for a second and i very quickly gently socially pin caleb to the wall face to face as awkwardly close as i can get no you're not hey caleb i'm fine if you skim something off the top that's fair but be clever about it just distribute 60 or 70 percent of what you find okay good boy give him a little slap on the face and then i go up party time these papers oh that's a spider quite a few there's also an egg sac that got taken care of you don't look like an administrator i mean that's actually almost a compliment extra pay would soften the blow travis will never see that card yes it's like working bitch face look at that that's brilliant i don't know about you i've got goals i'm working towards something something buy me a drink and i'll tell you dinner and bad decisions and cleanliness would be great that's why people have bathhouses to clean up or would i still be in the room let's call that a 20 whatcha doing what were you looking for were you looking for this i hold up a folded piece of paper what will you give me for it no something-- i don't want money i want something give me something not gold pieces what do you have that'll do (laughter) it's a blank piece of paper i hand back the acid don't try and go through his stuff you're just going to get caught what did we talk about grumpy people maybe if he spends more time around beau he'll get grumpier that's a fair point i stand up don't go through my things i know everything i have and i walk out the door and i walk by him she's going through your stuff by the way i've already walked away i am downstairs having a drink (laughter) well he forgot that he put it there you think you'd still feel that no no no well done oh that was terrible exactly what she said well it's inevitable if you kick a cat you're going to end badly that's just how it works oh sure if they're already dead just go for it is this a thing that really happens but she paid for the whole night with all of us i try to look him right in the eye when i say that roll for random bar no work let's go make an ass of ourselves at the evening nip scout it out i think that's a great idea just because someone has tattoos doesn't mean they know everyone who has a tattoo these are very different tattoos we learned something today six more hours let's make it so they have to break this into like five youtube videos i feel like we all grew as people charlie farting in the corner you are not
