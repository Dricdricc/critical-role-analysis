i don't want to say i'm so excited now to see what it spells out it's almost over i'm walking in there what do you wish to know hadn't occurred to us even with these gods there is still much doubt as to our success we are not certain we are not sure where are the lives of those who witnessed it i'm going to read off some titles 12 12 fuck there's no pattern oh like some sort of astrolabe or something like that are there any books in the bowl i'm going to take a look at what's in the bowl i'm going to read the names of these books maybe sing it who are you i was sitting on the couch -- rocks and the trees and birds in the sky i'm not supposed to know that (groans) what was the name of the sword where was it last seen that pleases me be happy here strangely yes yes quite didn't think i would be back to where we came from back to the cabin the little house because we still have a man tied up he's been sitting there for probably about an hour or two well i want to talk to him too but yes they are pretty impressive why are we going to whitestone then well now that we know where it is you can probably bamf us there can't you you can check him out right there i'm going to go into the room and find the nice creature that we left there oh i don't suppose we need you any more do we i'm going to take out my sword and very slowly end that manners i'm going to check through the books to see if there's anything 22 no i think that may have actually come with us that might have been us looking through books you know i'm not angry my books are still lovely the library is still lovely it made a lot of things better i think you're just fine (laughs) mostly apparently i know honestly i'm a little touched yeah if it weren't for the migraine i'm sorry by the way you may be the only one who understands this but i needed something that was mine for a little while so little of who we are is ours and i knew it would end but it was nice ioun is quite a goddess and she does not respect secrets though i on the other hand feel that secrets can be precious well i thought she may kill me at that point i was honestly fearing for my life there a little bit and at that point everything was so awkward well we'll see i don't know yes one of the bonuses of not being one of the chosen of the gods is we don't have to believe in destiny we just i think heard a big speech from a god about not believing in destiny why do we have to listen to anything they say marisha and that was a plant you've been holding a plant and i've been holding a book that got weird i think that was legitimately you were still holding a potted plant how does it feel to be chosen by a goddess at this point yes you i know you've been listening we all watch shake him a bit it will stop the reaction he's keeping it secret keeping it safe i know this is going to be an odd request let's not go to whitestone i feel like we're being watched it was an undead thing it was just going to make a tongue at us perception check also is there anybody in the forest i think as generous as this offer is we just don't enjoy associating with new money let's get out of here now we need sanctuary can you make your mansion we need to rest eventually and you need to commune we'd better assume we're being seen and heard at all times maybe not let's do this quick we need to rest you need to talk there's much to do and this does not feel good or even inside i will literally shoot anybody who attempts to deal with it give him your hat i'm going to grab someone at some point you there what is the commotion how soon who told i just want to find out where it came from good man carry on prepare the room where it happened this is normal he is not a vampire i don't think that's how it works he's not a zombie do we want to try and make one more jump once you've made some bad decisions haven't you do we want to try and run one more time before we-- sam and well into the forge i suppose find the sword head to the forge let's set up camp and if you feel like you want to make one last-- 20/20 do we want to set up shop here or do we want to set up shop in the temple of kord i think honestly here they'll have difficulty identifying which of our blood is going to be splattered on the ground let's sleep here you're speaking words that he doesn't-- he doesn't know what that word means what was kord painting please tell me it was a horse playing saxophone that's all i want (laughter) formation smoke beans apparently i just assumed because i know you hopefully not in the kitchen though so we're going to cook anything we like that actually might especially if not eaten with rice or a bean asking the dungeon master i'm not trained in religion i've been thinking a lot i've been trying to skirt around this information for a bunch of reasons so i've been making a mental shopping list i'm attempting to do the math of how much platinum we can buy platinum go to a bank and exchange it if he actually has the phrase a bunch of digits that would make me so happy right now there's part of me that doesn't want to know we depower them so they'll be weak when they go against vecna it's not like we can't look in on anyone that we need to really quickly i'm feeling the urge my question is does it matter at the moment does it does it just make us panic all right point made point very well made let's start with-- no finish this first with the gem it had a gem in one eye if i recall we may be going to get the skull back it literally has a leaf on it oh my god i've read them did you put stars next to it because it was important or did you just put stars next to it let's find out what's going on with the skull yeah let's give ourselves-- we're going to try and take 48 hours to get as much done as humanly possible part two one of which is whether or not our friends are alive could've been tary just pick a city let's just keep looking at people in various cities a little bit of hemming a little bit of hawing oh yeah we're going to have that conversation that's right we're going to set her up so that she's nice and-- in a chair and we're going to bind her five was craven edge the sword what he has done to prepare for the inevitable attempts to re-bind him i don't know we've got a few things we can threaten her with we can attempt to have her consecrated and buried in the raven queen's temple so that nothing will ever bring her back again also in theory i think it's possible that i could just send her to hell yeah i feel pretty good i like this plan even as a source of information a source of vengeance she is a constant disappointment wait do we have to do it outside i was going to ask i know as many as it takes we have to rest we need the mansion to sleep we can't sleep anywhere without the mansion we're going to have to breathe we're going to have to figure out a way to survive will that save us from the poison from the palace it's the brew that's true it's going to be all right we have one advantage that they do not that too only one of us is underestimating the other we can do this you're fine we know we have to be careful heroes' feast water breathing platinum and then you're going to hit something with a hammer
