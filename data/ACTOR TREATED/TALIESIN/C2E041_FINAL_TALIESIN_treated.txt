i'm weirdly on-board yeah this is the beautiful deluxe edition which comes with a little ribbon and you can see this wonderful cover art with vecna in the center and the four gods depicted in the corners all cowering before his might who are these lovely kids right over here it's right there i already gave my shade i'm done honestly that was all i needed oh i'm in my room because i was-- is this before fjord came back okay so i'm in my room hey mister caleb good evening battered sure what can i do for you oh yes of course i think i'm coming to the realization that perhaps i was not entirely clear on what i signed up for but i don't think that means that it's the wrong path i'm getting used to the idea that it wouldn't be a test if it were easy i i joined your group of friends-- i guess our group of friends now-- as a testament of faith and it would be a disservice to that faith to turn around because it's hard if it'd have been easy i suppose i wouldn't have been needed to be called to it i've been thinking a lot about it jester gave me a lot to think about to be honest mister caleb do you believe in fate there are lots of different kinds of fate i know that's a heavy question but do you believe that we are driven towards something by things that are greater than ourselves (background music) there are times that i think about the cruelties of the world and the things that have been put upon me and my family and i would hate for that to be a plan and there are times when like today i'm very grateful for being in the right place at the right time to make sure that the right people are becoming strong in ways they need to be i don't think that excuses the pain i don't think that you have to-- i don't know i don't think that you have to not care about it or fight it with everything you've got but i think the world is shaping you into something important and i want to make sure that you get to wherever you need to be you won't have to work very hard at it i imagine i think just being you wherever the world puts you will do just fine i can tell thank you i promise i will continue to help you all even when we're not the best of people i feel like we're still moving towards something that's good and worthwhile and i'm feeling the struggle's in my way to bring us to where we need to be i'm honored thank you for this i won't forget it (chair scrape) meanwhile one hour later i'm adding which item (intones theme from pirates of the caribbean) i have a thing called create food and water we can mix it up with the normal food so it doesn't taste as bad teamwork so sorry we just burned an entire encounter like yeah fuck whatever matthew made i was about to say anything like being able to go by the stars or otherwise is something i might be able to do very well fair just lording that rap battle over me okay that's fine i was thinking the one where you actually have to go out and find supplies i might be really good at that yeah i'll take the boatswain some stuff that we don't want to get rid of yeah oh yeah i like it up there a boatswain may i i'm going to take a look at this thing 22 obviously the decision is yours but we are low on supplies which means we have more to lose if something goes wrong we lose vital members of our crew or burn through magic ability we're going to be without food whereas i'm sure they're probably very well stocked and prepared for these sorts of eventualities i feel like we would be coming in from a place of weakness that's my initial thought fine art i think that escalated rather quickly well i said that we were in a position of disadvantage i feel like this is somehow connected to your previous bad decisions in my imagination that felt vaguely like a threat what does the flag look like all right powder ball make ready fire i'm so excited at least you weren't looking in it we are apparently committing an act of piracy do we have a name of this ship do you want me to make an announcement maybe thaumaturgy i'm going to project my voice very loudly onto the other ship fellow friends at sea we wish to have a parlay with your captain and we hope to keep this entire confrontation as bloodless and reasonable as humanly possible we will do our best to be civil and not encourage anything inappropriate over the next several minutes we would appreciate your cooperation in this direction then i'm going to try and make all the doors open and available to us from the other ship with thaumaturgy as well i'm going to pop all their doors open what number is that i have a number in that let's see what it does that's a 22 definitely food and water we are also in the need of some gems if possible i'll also say that if they require any healing at all for anybody that might be sickly on the ship i'd be happy to offer my services i'm by the way human looking right now smeed let us know if you need anything don't get greedy just because everyone's on the deck i'm going to do a quick detect magic and scan the boat everybody in the boat i will also say i'm going to take it and that chest they just threw out as well it's 30-foot okay at the very least i'm going to get close and walk the-- oh yeah there's something magic down below i'm getting a little bit of magic down there i don't know what it is but it's making me nervous oh god that sounds like the worst thing ever oh man this is the darkest timeline oh and that's how i got this i'm having bad flashbacks vampire you want to send me down all right i'm going to start heading downstairs to see what the commotion is yeah he'd pat you a couple times yeah i probably am getting down whoa wow someone did a number on you i might do both of you hi it's a pleasure to meet you i get the feeling you're having a really bad day i'm going to do a little healing spell down here so everyone's feeling a little better i'm going to start doing a little healing on both of you take a few minutes while you guys figure this out prayer of healing on both of them 14 points up for you 14 points up for him i still by the way have my detect magic up am i getting anything so i would have had it when i came in oh is that box glowing by the way i suppose i would have said that box is definitely magic i'd be very careful with that yeah let's be gentle with it was it soma mr soma how did you get this gig i was just curious i mean do you work for anybody or do you have a deal with somebody do you like who you work with seems kind of a rough gig that's fair this is just odd i mean i imagine being sent with something i didn't know anything about by god-knows-who that will leave a mind to wander i don't know yeah you know i would (laughter) sort of a reluctant piracy at the moment we like everybody to walk away feeling as okay with everything as possible yeah obviously it is magical by the way how trapped is it so is the magic not coming from the box or what was inside the box let's get some distance here i mean you got to admit i bet you're pretty curious what's in there keep everybody okay i'm going to get a little distance and i'm going to go outside the room just in case mr fjord i would recommend you get some distance as well mr caleb is going to maybe want to take a look at that later i would recommend hiding it i feel really bad about this can we throw him any money or something i think we won't mention to anybody that we threw you a little cash i mean obviously that doesn't need to travel and you know whatever you need to do to maintain i understand dignity is a thing actually if you like we can walk out of here being very irritated like ugh that guy too much i feel like we should leave these people with most of what we-- i think this has been enough i don't want to you know cause any more trouble than we have anyone else need some healing anything real quick i know i'm dying (parrot voice) captain cupcake (realistic cawing) sorry too much reeling it in wow so weird did we keep the sword i don't remember start doing a little more healing on you i'm going to head down obviously tired and just go follow you guys to take a nap i'm keeping a close eye on what's going on this is very-- they're being so sketchy (laughter) that tickles that's a novel trecorum satis dee you're welcome (singing) not there he had it in the tattoo and the coat yeah i was about to say you can roll a d20 and if you roll a 20 i'll tell you what molly would have thought this is some bugs bunny shit oh yeah how did you not think this through this was inevitably where this was going fields of phalli it would be a really big-- you would have a tiny boat then we'd be a raft in the ocean that would take a long time though we're heading to port regardless i figure at some point-- i figure things don't change regardless as long as we're on the ocean the things it makes are not-- i have good news your favorite chewing gum-- rope sam and i have a shield do you need a shield can i take a look at that thing maybe well (laughter) what's your ac again yeah i really like my shield though but this is interesting no this would push it to 18 all right all right fair i may just for my own personal aesthetic try and mount my beetle wings onto this but i like it i'll do that later you'll have to add it in the meantime it's just plus one to my ac how many attuned items can i have at this level three all right better than sinking dicks i suppose this may actually give you-- wait what is your ac bonus to your shield this would actually-- this doesn't give me an 18 this just keeps me at 17 because i was already at a +2 with my shield oh okay so right now it's only giving me a +2 maybe i haven't-- oh never mind now it's working there we go i hadn't attuned it a little gaudy for my tastes but i'm going to do a little work to it prefer not to make a habit of that you're hard to follow sometimes you know that ah nothing just-- or three i've been paying very close attention and listening in to the hallway and trying to keep a very-- (blows raspberry) 15 haven't heard any footsteps or-- i feel like for the time being it just might be best to-- be the best we can be here and be as helpful as humanly possible our goals are relatively aligned and as long as we don't have to hurt anybody i'm all right but the rest of these people-- always well when we want to find the ship i think i might be able to help what no i mean no definitely not yeah no i really don't think i have anything to add to that i think you've been doing just fine i think i might be able to help you find the ship i don't understand what any of this is anymore i thought-- oh about finding the ship that's all i'm going to take a nap taking a short rest blow me into bermuda black pepper you could make a sneeze arrow in theory 14 beautiful complicated feelings he got away quick yeah that was not a good time nope that was really good do me i like juice i mean to be fair we should let us go home eventually let's make sure the crew knows that they should be repairing the ship and we need to be ship-shape at some point this is golden age of piracy barbados basically we're in the thick of it oh wow okay this is nice they call me clay i serve nature i'm a maker of fine graves we did oh yeah we should take our leave that's metal that's some metal shit can tell you're a snitch can tell at 50 feet of course you're a snitch (laughter) you are you sit in the bathroom stall with your legs raised with a notebook very it's lush i will follow i am so proud of you all the plank king is cool
