what episode is this how many episodes did it take to finally get to this we have steamed the shark did podcast get updated or did that not happen it may not have comic book issue three is available it's beautiful and there's now two playlists out because i didn't announce my playlist last week percy's playlist went out and now there's a vex podcast i would like to know what kind of death metal you're into yeah i was about to say it was probably the boiler room because that's where shit goes and vanishes we are kind of a mess on occasion this is true it's sams all the way down let him paint his picture the only thing i can think to do is i would want to already have my boots of spider climbing activated and my diplomacy charged we get to pose before the battle right find out the hard way 24 he may have to burn another luck wow it's been a while i'm going to run into this room and i want to see what's inside this building all right 23 i'm going to spend the rest of my action moving into the archway of mist yeah how much movement do i have left all right mm-hmm you don't see me do you have a thingy for that i have a cake that'll do constitution saving throw this is magical isn't it so i get advantage on this what's your spell dc oh okay constitution saving throw 25 how much damage i'll take 16 points of radiant damage i'm going to hop right back through that door and take a right out that door and start heading back out that-- yeah right there and then i'm going to use the rest of my-- to cast silence i'm casting my silence ball i am now completely quiet that's as far as you can go five ten 15 20 25 to the door five ten 15 20 25 i would hope so can i say woo that was close do i hear myself damn it fuck travis and well that makes life a little more complicated but he becomes visible right i have lost two of my most powerful weapons already in one round damn it's okay but i've lost two of my most powerful weapons already shit i lost my spider climbing and i lost my silence man okay i have 30 bits of movement i'm irritated can i make it to that door no i can't make it to the door in one round can i i'm going to-- shit this is awkward i've seen what those things do already and i know they're about to do it again there is nothing good i can do i'm going to start making my way over here and try and make it to against not quite to the door but to the wall yeah i want to be one over because i know that thing's got a radiant kick and then for my action-- okay i'm going to spend the rest of my movement then-- oh fuck there is no good thing that door is locked i'm sure it is well i have an action still since i'm here i'm actually going to take a few potshots at keyleth for fun i'm using bad news because the distance first shot is-- i'm actually going to do a deadeye shot to gain advantage actually that's not fun yeah deadeye to gain advantage here we go for that and that crits so i'm going to use that crit i'm also going to drop all of cabal's ruin the entire run of cabal's ruin into that cabal's ruin is best used early he knows why actually that's technically those are not d12s these are d12s i really should have four of these but i'll do two and remember to-- i have to double all these dice so here we go time to be a real jerk would that have emptied it okay that's fine that's 27 points of damage whole theory of that was to throw cabal into that that is irritating i'm going to use one of those attacks to reload all right and then i'm going to take another shot and reload this will be third and fourth attack shot and reload at grog because that was disappointing and i'm going to do a push-back because i'm curious to see what happens when he-- i think that'll almost get him to hit the edge so let's see what ten feet does to him yeah i'm just curious you're near the edge sorry nothing personal that's 28 to hit oh that's not bad at all you're fine that's 15 points of damage and you move ten feet away from me irresistible dance it might be in the new book all of us have taken a little that will do i'm going to run around to the door i'm going to snap all right is the door open or is the door not open i'm going to use animus to open the lock don't fuck me that's 29 to hit i assume the door cannot take psychic damage 17 damage to the lock i'm going to run in shut the door it's going to be an action to open that chest isn't it okay i'm going to hide behind the door so if it opens i'm just being careful i'm not going to be a brass dragon i'm going to be me have you seen his office it's basically brass dragons we can't hear you but i certainly can't hear him i can't hear anything you say it's like a rollercoaster where you know that they haven't finished the last ten feet of track you still have movement and a bonus action so i'm going to open that chest thank you and that's how many feet that's like five so i can now i have a little bit of movement to leave ten 15 20 so i can at least use 20 to get to that corner there yeah toward me there just there do i see scanlan or is he still invisible oh so i see him right there i still have ten feet of movement after that cool i am going to shoot scanlan i'm going to shoot scanlan let's use bad news for-- actually let's use oh this'll be fun let's do animus sharpshooter and deadeye just for fun animus sharpshooter deadeye i can't hear him animus sharpshooter dead shot oh you're so lucky that didn't crit 28 to hit that's 1d10 plus 1d6 psychic plus i'm going to-- eh not on this one this is shot number one so that's oh that's terrible i'm glad i did not that's nine points of damage plus one point of psychic so that's ten points of damage for your next shot-- you take 20 points of damage because that was sharpshooter 20 excuse me next shot same thing also didn't crit you're very lucky that also hits that's 29 to hit and then the same thing 1d10 plus 1d6 plus 18 26 points of damage and i'll do the same thing one more time natural 20 you've just been critted and i'm going to drop all of cabal's ruin into this as well so that's (counting) 40 points of damage and now the 10d6 lightning damage does that get doubled or does that stay normal plus 33 lightning damage on top of that 66 lightning damage on top of that 41 plus 66 was it 40 40 plus 66 106 points of damage on that shot oh i get my grit back on that so that's nice ten cabal's empty and for my final shot (evil laughter) for my final shot i'm going to reload and hide it's going to take him so long to get to me and if i get within ten feet of him there's nothing he can do i beat him up for you so you're either going to kill him next round or he's going to do it to you roll that d4 i'll make it go away again that was so pleasing one shot i did three shots he's not mad at a door that's awful i don't feel like a good person anymore what yahtzee even the tower 60 feet all right okay i'm going to take this opportunity to head out of the room and i want to climb up on top of this building then right up to this corner right here actually this corner right there can i see grog i can't see anybody no she's inside i'm going to go to the center of it and if i could use my action to lay down and hide if that's possible okay i'm going to lay down and since i'm on the roof pull down to the roof and see if i can get cover cover i'm going prone and i want to keep an eye on that front door i'm also completely silenced ten feet all around me are completely silenced i'm going to keep an eye on that tower and if i see any movement i'm going to unload an action on anything i see i'm going to use one of my resolve that's a save okay perception that's a 14 yeah let's see how well that goes you're fine there's nothing use the cake i'm holding an action for the tower i'm keeping an eye on the tower because that's where i'm heading next don't worry i will shoot at you do it i dare you say yes when in doubt say yes what's the worst thing that can happen other than your spells get disenchanted yeah i admire your commitment wow man mid-game you're asking to get fucked with don't call it a comeback he's been there for years we're aware he is on twitter right now it's going to make life complicated i've got shit i can do but it's going to be tricky that was foolish of you well i don't know you always have a plan i ain't going to push it i don't believe you it's why scanlan's not dead yet i just wanted to make him desperate i can't see anything else no i didn't there's a bard over there i'm going to take a jump onto that island acrobatics check that's 24 i'm going to spend the rest of my movement running straight up that tower i'm not entering the tower i'm running up the tower sorry my fault and then double run huh i've been having bad luck with that lately i'm going to take cover from scanlan right there with what's left of my movement against one of the walls i'm backing up against the wall and that's my turn okay that'll do it did that last round i've been keeping track wonderful bottle of pellegrino for the table no you wouldn't have heard ten feet sorry didn't hear it this is why in a normal game this would be completely crippling me because anything could be happening and you could not tell me but on a solo mission it's pretty nice only a truly dumb person this is disturbing i don't know what to do about this i didn't god i didn't see her do that did i i'm so fucked yep this is dumb but i'm going to do it because i don't know you're there i'm going to walk over to that weird little door i just feel warm i'm going to open the door and see what's in there all right just because this green glow is freaking me out i'm going to back up against the wall and then my next action later is going to be-- have i taken any yeah i've taken 16 points of damage okay then i'm not going to back up out of it i'm going to get to the back side of the hinge and i can't hold an action obviously because i blew my action but i'm going to prepare to open and worry about what comes out yeah with a very important message about marvel puzzle quest it's nice it would look good on me oh yeah bring it and anybody in the tower what about my boots of spider climbing that are currently activated they're activated i ain't moving i can't be knocked prone you can't do shit and then see what happens oh no oh no i have been waiting to use this silence spell like an asshole this entire game purple horseshoes o for a muse of fire and down and up and down goddamn it not cool that's a constitutitution saving where's my constitution there we go 24 that ain't bad she's got cyclops laser until we hit her hard enough hey look who you can see now look who you see now good-bye wow that's a local joke right there they're already on their way in the helicopter i am proud of what i've done so far i've been sniping the way i've always wanted to i feel like such a badass right now i know it's going to end i'm going to shoot the lock i'm going to get within ten feet of that lock so that there's no sound and i'm going to shoot the lock open i'm going to use retort for this just because i don't want to waste anything worthwhile 30 to hit all right where's my fancy-- there we are that's ten points of damage all right i'm going to run inside and perch on the ceiling i'm going to use my spider climb boots and what do i see around i don't see anything sure i'm going to hide-- and those stairs keep going down i'm going to go down to the next level can i see down there at all oh in that case i'm not going to get that close if i can't get all the way there anyway so i'm going to get right in that little corner there and keep an eye out oh yeah i was going to say i have to get to the other side of the fog i don't have enough movement to get back from the fog then okay i'm going to stay in the fog and keep an eye on what's down there wow you are not rolling those well i've softened him up for you also by the way you see scanlan as well yeah oh no he'll survive wow i don't know shit vibrated to death (singing) somewhere out there i'm going to go the next level down see what i see i'm just heading down scanning heading down scanning and looking for anything fuck i forgot that i'm going to get all the way to the bottom then and back myself against that bottom door and i'm going to push all the way to the bottom of the tower with my movement i was hoping there'd be a person in there i mean that's all my movement isn't it and that's all my action to move that as well right yep i ran down that tower going i want to fight everybody i'm of the opinion that against the wall i don't think he sees him right now if you were to back off a bit you would see him maybe sorry new earring who's this thank you for being the only person who really laughed at my good joke that was a very good joke chat probably liked it and i will take it all away again next time i see him this is such a big map i love it it makes me very dangerous sorry my fault hi you're going on an adventure i'm going to exit out the door and i'm going to take a run back over here this way (counting) i don't even know if i'm actually jumping i was actually going to walk to be fair marisha and am i in the range of it at that point where's the-- i was planning on walking but i'm fine either way if you make a roll for it i'll make a dex roll it's a dex save all right 19 was it not just for fun let's burn-- let's burn a resolve it's reroll a save i wrote it down weirdly because i was trying to conserve space yeah no constitution saving throw (counting) 24 i still have my action there's no way i can use spider climb on the force wall is there oh i have to roll concentration the silence spell what is that okay same thing 16 this is interesting i'm going to try and right myself and see if i can put my boots on and walk on the ceiling that'll do those were such a pain in the ass do i fall that was well done grog i'll tell you later but i had plans and you foiled a chunk of them if i tell you what i'm playing next game will you just stop this the door got exploded actually i saw that my range is there is no getting away from me i have a minimum range of 400 feet there is nowhere to hide my shitty gun has a 400-foot range no it can't yet i will make ghost bullets one day you know what doesn't take a dexterity save sending to another dimension that's fine constitution saving throw let's do this i've got a plan i'm going to use my second resolve or my second thing indomitable let's hope that's better that's way better 19 and now i'm going to try and do something stupid here's what i'm going to do i'm going to use 25 points of my movement to run oh i'm going to use my movement to run 15 feet i'm going to try and take a running jump to the top of the tower all right acrobatics check come on baby that's 23 that's a much better fall than i was going to get and then i have to do another constitution saving throw for the silence spell oh 23 natural 20 and then so i'm 23 points in is it worth blowing any of this yeah am i feeling the healing all right i'm going to use what little i have left-- i have no more movement even from a double-up using my action i'm going to use my action for a dash to stand on the trap like stand right to the trap yeah i stand there and i'm waiting to see what the hell is going on at this point yeah good man sounds pretty awesome i'm going to head this way on the tower (counting) do i see keyleth i'm down for that that's a terrible roll that's 16 that doesn't matter to me how far away is she i'm going to do something really weird i'm going to pull out the iron bands of bilarro i'm going to make a toss try and nail her in the head it's got a range of 60 feet 30 manners oh you don't does it work damn fucking oh my god that was clutch i just saw that happen didn't i all right that was really scary that was my attack i'm going to back off and then go back to the center of that tower and sit and try to get three-quarters cover over there i want to stay in the green light oh a wise guy so two squares in all around i'm in when we get four we actually start to remove rock blocks she moved five feet remember it's two points in at this point sam taliesin and oh man we did grow up in that era didn't we oh that brought it back the one scanlan was next to i'm going to get up right over here i'm getting up over here on this point of the tower and i'm holding my action until i see even the slightest fucking little black feather appear anywhere on this field and i'm going to lay goddamn waste wow i mean he had to get clutch didn't he that's changed things hasn't it you're still a player she's now just a barbarian no she can't unshift i was just inside over here i'm keeping an eye out 18 that's fine this means i get to take my attacks that's fine how much that's fine 25 hits yeah like 23 i was going to use animus i can do real attacks because this is my real-- this is sharpshooter no he's hard to hit the first time cool sharpshooter sharpshooter plus i'm going to do deadeye because i really want to hit this that crits 19 three can you do that the first attack just misses he can just negate it i don't get my grit back then i already marked it it's fine let's do that again let's twist again like we did last summer that's a 26 to hit 1d10 plus 1d6 psychic which is three four five where's my brain that's 23 points my third hit here we go i'm spending another grit yeah it'll be no fun no i'm not going to spend another grit still sharpshooter that's 23 to hit i'm rolling so poorly 20 points of damage plus five psychic so 25 i can't spend an action surge in this round can i on a held action i'm going to use thunderwave instead of shooting that's fair i would have done that at the beginning if i would have thought about it same thing 15 so that hits 26 to hit that's 24 points of damage oh i have to roll to see if i keep my spell con save 25 25 bigby's hand is not a beast yeah i forgot to bleed you damn it's okay i assume because he's got five billion feet of range that he is long gone cool i'm going to shift to the other side of the tower stay in the healing range and hold my goddamn-- i'm going to run over here stay in the little green light hold my fucking action until i see feather i'm up and ready and do i heal since i'm in the green in that case i'll use my bonus action to down a healing potion does he have to be able to talk in order to do that (singing) my only friend the end bless you yeah all right i can't use any of my held action to run because that was not my intention regardless my reaction will be to run away from where it's falling shoes yeah i'm holding on for dear life okay so i wouldn't try and dodge i don't get a dodge for any of that oh i mean i didn't know the situation i was just trying to be safe oh yeah no no no okay sorry yeah i thought it was like surfing acrobatics check come on oh yeah 28 25 constitution saving throw do i see vax at any point do i see scanlan at any point okay can i take my shots all right three four ha first one is sharpshooter to hit nope i take damage that's a misfire so that's four points of psychic damage to me because i have half saved add that that's 92 now is what i'm at and then fuck animus i'm going to the retort gun for the moment retort's down i can't hear you and i pull out my last shot this is my last shot because i've burned everything yeah and that's come on don't do this to me oh at least it's a hit 19 i can't hear him but okay it's not going to be a bad hit 29 points of damage technically i guess he could do a visual thing oh it's even worse too late now anyway yeah i know it's like we might as well burn it we're burning it yeah oh i mean no that's not my turn that was my reaction yeah so it's keyleth's turn sorry i was holding my attack until i saw people just barely fixed my gun barely and now i'm going to do an action surge shot number one with grit because i'm a little nervous about this 26 i didn't call sharpshooter so i'm just going to call that 31 to hit that hits 1d10 plus 1d6 that was terrible 11 points of damage so i'm all out of grit now that's nice attack number two is 28 oh that's better 17 points of damage cool i still have two attacks i'm going to take my movement to run over to him that's as far as i can go that water freaks me out i don't want to quite step in that water yeah just over there keep me up on the little bit because i don't want keyleth to see me because she's scary okay i would like to curl a little bit then out of her range of vision i know i have two more shots all right i'm taking a shot-- actually unconscious i don't get grit back it's death i get grit back all right so taking another-- but when he dies i get a grit oh well then hm fuck it then i'll hold my attacks and use my bonus action to do a heal no on me yeah so i'm done i'm just getting my 1d10 22 back so that's 194 i'm back up to 194 that's why i didn't step in it how would he even know where i am that hits none of this is magic is it i'm going to point out by the way i don't think i've actually attacked you yeah just saying no i'm making plans that is a question she looks like she's about to fire a mortar into a compound but he's on fire i'm making a mad dash for scanlan i can't make a jump to see if i can get a little further across there my strength sucks my strength is 12 i'm going to use the rest of my action to continue to run towards scanlan use an action to dash can i get a little further or is that as far as i can get i want to be on the other side of him if that's okay that'll do that's my turn i thought i had a little bit of room hey look at that no you're killing vax well done that's my armor class yeah this is probably the best use of this i'm going to use my action surge i'm going to hold my action but i'm going to use my action surge i can use an action surge instead of holding my action just to stab this fucker three times 29 here goes the second one 29 oh look i get a grit back i'm not proud of this i'm never telling anyone i'm like i don't know he ran off i am going to move out into this direction over here because i know the walls are caving in i have 30 movement i'm going to move right over here to start getting out of the way around the corner in that case i'll head that direction (counting) i'm holding my action for the second i see anyone start to fuck with me that was my action surge i can do a lot of damage now just have to bet that i can plow damage i always knew it would be the three of us no i just always wanted to say that if you had gotten your hands on anybody-- and also can i mention isn't he still on fire make it harder to-- thank you lead him out oh thank god oh hey i got a shot yeah but you wouldn't have flown up to your perch i will take my shot first shot first shot i'm burning my grit for a sharpshooter going to burn my grit for a sharpshooter in hopes of really doing some damage 25 to hit here i'm using good dice for this oh yeah 28 plus six psychic so 34 points of damage half of 34 next attack oh goddamn it animus is down that was a 20 bad news comes out that's a third attack come on gil no it's not a crit that's a 27 to hit where are my dice for that that's 26 points of damage i can't use a bonus to reload can i so i just reloaded all right he's low man i'm going to try and fix my gun with my roll and boy that does it sometimes it'll really break i'm going to make my way up on top of that tower yeah a little closer oh never mind i thought it was a little further back i'm going to try to cross the water and get back to the other side of the water again that'll do it just let the two of them settle their differences i am so excited by this this system's a little confusing you're doing great he's already on fire still you can burn him out you're literally sitting on him you're going to burn him i'm a little fucked but we'll see how this goes it's okay do you have the sensory anytime you turn to rock you can tell where i am so it doesn't really matter i'm going to drop silence i'm going to use my bonus action to cast can i see her i'm casting hex i'm taking three shots from where i'm standing with animus four god i'm just getting used to it four sharpshooter number one is 19 to hit oh shit that's pretty good that's 27 normal points of damage five psychic and five necrotic yeah piercing oh so i don't have to break this up this is magical damage shot number two come on man this is all i need fucking fuck fuck i take two psychic damage as it jams i'm jamming a lot shot number three is bad news which is not magic 25 to hit it's not awesome because you take half damage because it's piercing it's 26 points of piercing damage plus one necrotic i'm going to run up the tower no straight up the tower spider boots i want to get out of the way of the fire when it finally rolls trying to get inside of it and you took damage from the force field goddamn it i'm going to try and fix my gun because it's the only chance i have oh just barely makes it yep and then since i don't have an attack man there's nothing i can do i'm going to run on the outskirts on the outside of the tower behind and get some cover yeah on the wall i'm literally on the wall it won't crush next round will it i mean at current rate i'm not doing anything dumb i mean i would know though if it's been going at-- so yeah it's not that bad i've hit it three times already yep i'm seven that won't hit me thunderwave 5th-level yep from my stone king cincture dc 16 6d8 all right halved (counting) 29 halved that counts as a whole attack doesn't it then i'm going to run-- i can't she's got me i can't even attempt to break free i don't get to add a d6 to that of hex damage do i hey six points of necrotic i'm still higher actually no i'm not never mind i'm at 107 so yeah one point higher yeah 18 so it's 26 technically since i'm grappled do i go with her it's my turn now right or no yeah no i'm into that two constitution saving throws here we go that's a 19 and a 21 okay so that's 92 minus 13 74 i'm going to try and squeeze around out of this oh fine natural 20 i really would've liked that on a shot but that's okay it would have made life way easier if i can just use my boots to squeeze off the side-- i can't try and sneak through the window this is not how i wanted to go out athletics then oh boy nope i can't see her at all can i yep huh hmm yeah no i got nothing breaks the wall probably i want to have a moment i make one or two it's the one thing i'm good at oh not this time ten and 12 24 hail mary trying to squeeze out of this nope that's eight i can't count guys 25 this might be the end i'm at nothing 18 and 11 i'm out you hear everything i own crack without a spell to her name i had the weirdest dream a month ago i was really hoping i could burn some grit back and then do a whole bunch of damage all at once thank you marvel puzzle quest for sponsoring our ultimate fighting championship that was mean i started this game being the most clutch powerful motherfucker on the planet and ended it like-- confined spaces fuck gunslingers
