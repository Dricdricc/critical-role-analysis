how do you want to burn this no spoilers loot crate you can put it in your mouth you do probably shouldn't but you can it's like a blood red with a little bit of black splatter-- can you do it yes i do i love rocking nail wraps there also are some new geek and sundry nail wraps that have a blue and white thing and the little logo and i haven't seen if they're glow in the dark yet and i haven't looked yet but i definitely have an outfit that these are going to work with so i'm taking these home no i know it's been slowly building and it's this sudden-- i'm glad that we finally have these we had to fight to get these at comic con it's sam though he's heading this way in about 20 minutes so he should be here 20 minutes after that it's good news in progress my version of good news in progress we have a problem that as far as i know has never been accounted for in the history of civilization the dragons are cooperating with one another we are fighting not one dragon but a conclave of dragons all cooperating towards the destruction and sublimation of man mostly they plan at dawn he was released somehow from the plane of fire or perhaps someone brought him back to life other than his heart obviously having been previously maimed in some way we have no proof that it could be the same beast we were not here but even if it isn't the same beast the fact that a dragon takes its name should trouble you it is an old dragon-- god knows how time works in the fire elemental plane he may be much older than time has allowed grog in general it is impolite to query the age of any being in general i would have assumed you would know that by now we're also gathering allies and we've already destroyed several of his companion dragons we have preparing to kill a white dragon we're as surprised as anyone yes perhaps if it comes to it a little bit of help possibly collecting the vestige that we are looking for in this city that we are currently hopefully collecting and being on our way with causing as little noise in the city as humanly possible we are aware that is complicated for people like us and perhaps an ally in the coming battles to come it may i would imagine please you to perhaps meet these dragons on foreign shores as opposed to in your city walls if it is the dragon that you remember he will come here and if it isn't the dragon you remember the fact that he took that name means that he will come here we do the furnace is the only exit we wish to just borrow an asbestos coat he's using a hydraulic pump he's an imagineer fassbender is busy being a good guy i brought you some stickers from burning man that is everything i've ever hoped for i am definitely having a little bit of tony stark porn moment right now i want to wear it like a suit 18 18 the sound of you slowly dying that's like the dnd version of those awful glass bricks from the 80s i don't think he's real we just have to kill him okay i'm going to first of all cast hex on this creature going to cast my hex and then i'm going to start gentle i'm going to take three shots with the retort pistol including the first one is going to be an attempt at a headshot so that's a burn a grit come on i know it's been two weeks don't be angry don't be a cat be a dog just be happy to see me and it's happy to see me that's a 31 my cats were not happy that's terrible hold on sorry that's 12 points of piercing damage-- oh no sorry that's seven points of piercing damage five points of necrotic damage and he has disadvantage on strength checks and he has to make a constitution saving throw i don't like him no yeah liam's not doing piercing damage the bullets are not magic my bullets are bullets okay good to know that could go really poorly we don't know so that's good to know i'm going to take another shot at the helmet for a headshot 27 better 16 points of piercing damage three points of necrotic and another constitution saving throw he now has disadvantage on attacks until the end of his next turn at the moment i'm blowing bullets not for damage i'm blowing bullets for effect at the moment this is all effect-based i'm not trying to damage him right now (singing) blinded me with science i have one more shot so i guess i'm going to take it and for shits and giggles i'm going to take a sharpshooter shot fuck me 19 27 21 points of piercing damage four points of necrotic all right that's cool i'm putting the gun down and i'm going to back up i'm going to pull to my left and i'm going to try and get against the wall not the glass end of my turn that's what you get for playing with it in the house that's not terrible he has disadvantage yeah he has disadvantage on swinging at you show me what you've got no it's a good plan you have big balls not huge okay i can see the damage that this thing has taken would it be possible to target the wound i'd be happy to burn a grit to target the mechanisms and not the armor try and get a chunk of metal in there okay first thing i'm going to do is i'm going to take a couple steps to the right and try and shove my elbow on that glass to see what it feels like i just wanted to see how strong it felt okay like high-rise glass okay i'm going to pull the rest of my movement the opposite direction yeah i don't want to be in front of a window i'm going to pull out bad news and i'm going to take a targeted shot at these mechanisms with the big gun i obviously can't do a trick shot because i'm shooting at a thing obviously that would not work spend a deadeye shot for it and i'm going to do a sharpshooter and i'm burning grit here we go didn't need that grit but fuck it nope rolled 18 on both so 25 to hit you can borrow the die 25 hits oh boy this is fun come on where am i d12s and a d6 that's a-- (high-pitched giggling) i'm a pretty pretty princess 21 31 37 37 points of piercing damage and five points of necrotic i reload fuck it i am aquaman in this fight i'm well aware i'm going to burn another grit oh yeah no i am but i'm trying to be helpful in the moment this is my third and final shot i'm going to take an arm shot i'm going to try and get it to drop its toy finally a-- oh yay that's better (counting) sorry i can't count 22 no damage normal damage my bullets do no damage but you still get necrotic one point of necrotic damage the dc is 19 it's a strength saving throw he drops it i yell out somebody get that thing away from him i put my gun away and i'm done he also has disadvantage on strength checks live your dreams it's armored it's got a heavy armor on to be fair we have this really great idea of what to do with trinket once you're-- which child will disappoint you today eight so it's eight that's what i'm talking about so much strength disadvantage and now you have one more roll for the second i'm kind of useless i'm going to do something stupid here i'm going to take a few steps to my left so i have a good clear shot at it towards the window yep more yeah there that'll do i'm going to keep blowing through in the hope that i get a crit because then i regain a grit i'm going to pull out bad news and start firing to see if i can throw it off its aim i'm grit farming i'm fucking grit farming it's not bad news it's-- yeah retort it's off-balance so i'm trying to find a place where-- give it some momentum to fall i have one more shot a reload and a shot two shots i hit so that i might as well just roll-- that's six points of necrotic damage and again 21 oh 20 20 not natural 20 it misses i'm just trying to grit farm at this point you know it occurs to me that this battle's going to be over soon point just double checking can i feel if my hex has dissipated just checking do you have a mending spell of any kind i'm not fixing it i just thought it might be nice good god this is a greater gift than we could have hoped for i get the feeling that perhaps even such a thing would make us even more of a target perhaps before we depart my lord i would ask perhaps some local knowledge we have magical items that we require wisdom as to their origin and their function who would you trust in this city would you know who to trust in this city flips through his notes a little rolodex the ipad is rebooting for ancient objects such as we have for vestiges for things that are old i will not tell him of anything other than our gentle acquaintance the way that you leave a royal chamber is you thank them for their patience and their time and for their wisdom you keep your head beneath theirs and you never turn your back and you leave facing them in reverence be pleased don't say the words just do the things i didn't tell you what to say i told you what to do marvelous piece of engineering your technology is impressive your craftsmanship beyond anything i have ever seen and there is nothing more pleasing than a monarch with a sense of humor bless you oh that felt good they won't tell you because i think that's their secret i begin walking out that should actually give you excellent posture for a slight bow it's like the life force of two kittens just a heart attack and a metaphor for our entire existence that's fine we're going to have to take a walk around the tower for a javelin you threw it is there a needle in the desert-- is that a thing i'm going to sit down and do a little math and see if i can get a vague sense not old math weirdly enough i've figured out-- natural 20 i found a window and i'm doing the beautiful mind i'll fly with her and use the math to-- i'm going to hang i've locked my gauntlet no i'm not oh i can reroll a saving throw can't i yeah i can reroll a saving throw because i'm going to pretend that number didn't happen i'm going to do it again i have one more so i'm going to blow them all better i'll tell you what because i had to blow all of those we can say i threw up a little let's go there that's a wisdom that's 19 this was a very poor decision have we gone forward or have we just gone straight up so we're not going to hit them this has been the metaphor game this is a metaphor for our entire existence i'm not going to look down i'm going to look ahead i'm good yeah because of that we've done about 350 have we done 350 where are we now 80 90 feet ahead no sometimes math is not enough let's go fly down it's all right it wasn't my javelin you threw up on my hair oh god i wasn't aware that was going to be a thing that could happen my hair is very absorbent that's going to take some time is grit recovery a short rest or a long rest i can't remember grit recovery thank you it's even less if you don't do it he doesn't like us yeah 1d10 there's a casino if i recall i don't know i mean i do but i never gamble for fun no i do not gamble help me help me oh god help me i'm cool enough to know that perhaps you should hand off that necklace that he gave you they're going to think you're a narc you're wearing a police badge basically oregano i am very excited by this i enjoy watching her gamble yes we're going to get changed for the evening this is not an animated series we have more than one pair of pants except for you i think i do know a way to make the frost hold i could science it i could frost-hold it add about 15% sawdust ratio to it and it should hold its form even at a high temperature i'm with keyleth you can be with us we are vegas-ing you've been retconned even we'll keep a couple feet behind nope i'm going to engage the man in a bit of conversation so is it a straight bet across or are there competing numbers based on historical averages for these creatures at this point where is the money going at the moment that's a one of course it's a one i'm ignoring this i think i'll put 25 on thordak let's put 25 on thordak i'm going to put 25 on thordak no we're learning the game no one's going to give you anything we're learning the game we don't have to be big spenders here yeah but you've got to learn the game what a good excuse to finally order a d9 and have the d9 only for this game let's try another game i'm not feeling this one i don't like betting on live little-- we're going there how much for the extended bet to get the third die to get to 12 or any combination of seven of two or all three must be 12 i need to take a round of this as well all right i'm going in as well 25 gold from my wonderful-- i'll put 25 more in 25 is fine i don't believe in luck six i'll put in the 25 for one more die no it was a wonderful thrill good evening let's find the cheap drinks i'll join in that perception check 21 i was going to go red drunkenly head up there's an ox in the corner how much for ten minutes with the ox be fair did that just happen sweet christmas no no what are you doing we've already been waiting in line for the most colorful ridiculous drink that we can get something with whatever's the local version of an umbrella are we at the bar do they have to-go cups we'll take four just one of every color just one of every color i'll put down for the four cups i take them outside and begin distributing them god i hope so it's about the memory we did yep there's that i give her the most colorful most ridiculous thing i can find in the most ridiculous cup they have it's not like i've never bought a ridiculous plastic dragon necklace with the flashing leds before the phrase let's set it on fire and see what happens usually doesn't work out well only because everybody's being an idiot can i recommend that we perhaps try grinding it up into a tea or something oh no i'm going to take a little bit i'm going to mortar and pestle a little bit and make a tea i've ground and powdered a tea and placed it in the room and walked away i'm not my head is turned around i'm sketching things does he have to make another constitution check at this point you spent 50 gold on this good god (laughter) it was 50 gold as a fine lesson though real worth it if it were any more i'd feel bad but it's only 50 gold i'd feel like an idiot i think he's just had too much spice i've got a great idea i'm going to get a little bit of the wine of the ridiculous wine that we got i'm going to pour a little bit into my new collector cup that i got and i'm going to sprinkle it with some of the powdered spice here there you are down that that'll go quite well yeah just a little bit of the sandkheg i'm going to very gently try and take the gold medal that he got today away from him while he's numb just try and pickpocket him okay ugh no slapping no don't slap yes let's get an evening's sleep yes we are still waiting on that and we have several magical items that could use a little bit of jiggery-pokery so let's sleep this off perhaps and be excited that we're bringing a friend a taste of home at the bargain of 50 gold i mean you know i believe in you walter white i believe in you and whatever you have for a hangover for our friend who'll be down in oh never quite possibly i think he may have had the whole dog i love snobs i'm excited we have business we can see to it let's take everything that we need we have several objects if i recall we're going to actually need a scanlan (loudly) how are you feeling yeah it's a hog's head off to the crystal chateau be back in a bit i'll lead the charge oh for the love of god no six two does the opalescent stone have any similarity to the stones of whitestone there we go 23 good to know i was noticing that's odd had a little bit of spice have we how wide again approximately and it looks excavated and not just like something opened up and then they kept digging do the stones look like they broke the ground or does it look like the stones were actually built around this has this been here since the construction of this area or does it seem like perhaps in the last 20 years or such they've just gone down no it's a hole yes not really that i'm aware of it rests beneath the tree in the hills in the mines to the north and that's pretty much it that i'm aware of well i would if i had paid attention to such things but it wasn't something that i was-- i was very young the last time i was there i don't really know where anything went but i can assume that this came from whitestone this is interesting how did you come to that conclusion you should write that down this is good news if it is whitestone it means that we at least have some leverage here let's find a big door the biggest door we can find and attack it i knock hello we're here on official business matters of trade and of research yes i am it will be very worth your while and someone will definitely wish to speak with us we've traveled from tal'dorei from across the continent that's a very interesting number i know he's quite pleasing may we speak in private for that ten minutes it is sensitive do you know of the news of tal'dorei and emon foreign affairs obviously but i can see that there are aspects of this place that are foreign that you have brought culture here and i pull out one of my guns pull it out to show him the hiltwork which is all embedded with actual whitestone i cannot speak the name of where we come from but i know how this place was built and i know that perhaps we have a connection because of it and i'm going to-- dragons-- there's no secret to it dragons are ravaging the continent a chromatic conclave of dragons unlike we've ever seen before have decimated the cultures of the other end of the earth dragons we have never seen before but you have and i'm going to minor illusion in my hand an image of the red dragon with the ruby in his chest sitting atop i'm creating a little visual of it it's rudimentary but it's there it's obviously an illusion it's not meant to look real it's fuzzy they will come here they will come here and they will ravage we've been given the opportunity and the hope of stopping them before they reach your shores if we could just have a bit of help identifying a few objects of magical power and hopefully finding a few more keys to stopping them it would ingratiate us to you so much that i would be delighted to speak of a future of hopefully making sure that more of this beautiful whitestone that you use everywhere in this beautiful palace is available and deeply indebted i cannot tell him who i am they are not simple we are not starting with the jug show him your bow we have the tea set as well do we have anything else you are the only one that we've told just a few more things less of a magical investigation then i pull out a piece of the green elemental shard from whitestone and show it to him yes i take it back think of all the spice you could get money doesn't interest us at this point we are under siege but cooperation and help in our endeavor certainly does the process is known to my people and a closely guarded secret obviously we would be happy to restore normal relations once we are no longer in danger excited for normal relations and proper trade we are a city in need i do not give him my name but i put together a quick piece of paper with the royal seal it's enough that you need not have any paper proof of who i am other than the fact that if this place was built then that should be very useful to you if this place was built the way we expect if we survive and especially with your cooperation and help we will be back to this city and we will be grateful it's very expensive and very rare sadly worm intrusion oh the wyrm i thought you were talking about the hole out front is that anything we can help with we're quite adept with no heart we need everything we can get and we are down several libraries on our continent they do enjoy watching the knowledge of the ages burn and that is why they have given us their favors because they understand that this threat is greater i think you've already burned the charge on that one for the day good day to you sir yes he was but we did learn some things there was plenty of benefit to him you could go and check and we could hang back i don't trust him with it no how it's just organic it's just 50 gold i don't see why you're getting so uptight about it why would you spend your lucky gold piece well maybe if you just ask them to give it back-- let's take a look we are going to definitely hang about a block back a dire dragonfly they've got the big prismatic hoo-ha hello everyone what's going on are things going on hello i don't know what any of that means they could be hurt an entire city may die if we take too long 26 i'm going to nonchalantly walk in open the door and just we'll all come in and shut the door behind us is there blood on the handle is there blood on the door itself i will check for that too 11 i'm at the door looking out i'm doing a quick gentle sweep of the room looking for any invisible bodies in the corner just moving my hand around i'm heading down if everybody else is trying to get a sense of the situation of the murder how many people there were investigation 13 just to be safe i'm going to close the trap door well i haven't looked at them yet and there's no reason to look until someone yeah i take a look at the body well that was quick that's the best case scenario she's probably spying on me waiting for me to build something are there exit wounds on the back of the body as well we need to get the word out and quickly we need to find her before she figures out a way to return she's still in this city she's got a missing arm though it's not ripley i've figured out how to strategize your dice game has a base strategy which is only double down on a six oh my god espionage thank you so much
