start working on that right now oh it's going to be great no i'm having a lot of fun we're putting it together and-- participation awards all around participation a million people go huh what are you what the fuck are you oh my god i mean that's not amazing that's better 14 14 i'd rather have my low roll here than for anything else at least ten hunter's mark okay we're not panicking no not at all this'll be fun we'll see what happens all right first thing i'm going to do is cast hex on kevdak on the asshole i'm going to hex him so he is now enveloped in my dark smoke of death he's also now at disadvantage on all strength checks that's a thing i know i'm so happy i'm going to take a little step back to get a slight bit of cover from those archers for when they start hearing the big bang-bangs coming from the house to get half-cover so i can still-- i'm going from my current vantage point to about seven o'clock eight o'clock yeah about there for a little bit of cover from the arrows and i can still see kevdak so if i wanted to take my little pistol and start carving a little-- and i've got a nice little chunk of bone i can see in his arm-- can i take a sharpshooter disadvantage to hit that point so i'm going to shoot with sharpshooter specifically for his arm oh okay i'm going to take a shot for the elbow i'm going to try yeah on the visible elbow i'm going to sharpshooter through that shit see what happens okay and i'm happy if you want to put any weird disadvantage-- no i don't because i'm at distance or do i have advantage be-- oh he's paralyzed i have advantage on the attack okay that's fine but i get the bonus ten points still okay all right that's fine natural 20 should've used the big gun really all right that's okay so that's oh hello baby you're over here actually i'm going to use the pink one-- 400 feet i'm scary i know sorry i know i thought about that come on baby no whammies do i double the dice okay so that's 16 (counting) 32 points of damage for the first shot i'm shooting again same thing 17 good enough 17 i'm rolling good no it cancels out because he's-- it's no advantage no disadvantage right (counting) 25 to hit that hits that's the title of my '127 hours with a gun' i know i actually also i rolled the wrong die he didn't take nearly what that's okay so here i know too late i know i fucked that up yeah i know so i did okay five six seven eight-- (counting) 24 points of damage same elbow do you have a d6 that i can borrow i'm going to go for my third can i borrow your pink d6 i want to bowie this shit yeah i want to be flamboyant as fuck all right going to call it 14 (counting) 24 to hit goodbye elbow eh well not bad (counting) 23 points of damage all right i'm calling it for now i haven't burned any grit yet i'm so excited ironically crushed by a tree curse you nature strength check or save oh damn does he still have disadvantage five five hundreds of text messages clang clang clang she's made of armor she's made of armor and they're people with sticks with sharp sticks not in one round i would like to remind you that potions are a bonus action thank you whew you are a tank i gave you the big debrief with the arrow i gave you the how-to-- you've been doing it all night too i figure you know it's only fair no you've had more than one we've been counting i'm looking at him right now actually i've got my gun in my left hand and i'm looking at him i smile the whole time bring it do not fuck with reed richards he will fuck you up that hits that that also hits 11 for the first one i take it in the shoulder that one i'm going to catch that's 14 so not only does it do no damage i actually take it and catch snap it and the gun is going to turn to look at him thank you don't talk him out of it it'll be fine it'll be fine things are working i was really hoping you were going to come up with a-- oh wow that's actually-- never mind i am not disappointed at all you asshole all right this is going to be fun that asshole who just shot me i'm now aiming at him and i'm going to push him off the roof this'll be fun so pushing him off the roof am i going to do extra damage to him or am i well i mean i'm debating whether or not to sharpshooter it to do-- no i think i'll just push him off the roof it's funnier 28 to hit non-sharpshooter but i'm doing a torso shot so he gets no save there's no save for the torso shot he's going to take his damage and move ten feet away from me so that's 14 points of damage of piercing damage fine i'm going to reload and now what am i going to do let's see surveying the field trying to make some decisions i can't well i can hit greenbeard i'm going to hit greenbeard he's got the magicky creepy thing right all right well we'll see how things go let's do a sharpshooter shot at him right now let's see what a little bit of damage does to him so sharpshooter with retort don't miss and my pistol goes (breaking sound) (groaning) and i'm putting it away so dice are doubled too the weapon's within five feet thank you suck it nerd dear god can you roll poorly no oh my god sam oh my god does he get an attack of opportunity how do you own this many models there's no should'ves this is what we got that's pretty good stop it don't be helpful i've got a scrooge mcduck-sized pit of xanax at my house i'm just going to dive into attack of opportunity to be fair she's a bit winded well that hits all right 18 and 18 i can use the-- yeah i only have one reaction so all right i'll take that i'll fight that one i'll contest that gloves of missile snaring it's a reaction it doesn't say i can make an attempt to catch that's 14 points dexterity modifier 11 so i can reduce it to three points of damage i still got hit so oh jesus with his broken hand she's up 60 bonus hit points 10d6 yeah but you're also getting pummeled by arrows so maybe standing there is not necessarily the-- he's going to take a whack at you in a minute anyway i was going to say i can't kill kevdak he just healed for-- oh seven hit points he healed him 70 hit points is he still raging though okay no i can't do that can i i look at the guy next to me i'm going to take a look-- oh god i'm going to take a running jump off the front of the house straight into the-- no i'm going to jump for the other house is it not an acrobatics i can't do an acrobatics i can't parkour this my hands are free i'll take an athletics what do you think athletics or oh no no i'll acrobatics it with disadvantage yeah i yeah no i rolled a one my ac's 18 i'm fine with that okay don't care who can i see from my perspective okay i'm going to as a bonus action i'm going to do a quick heal second wind just to make that go away god that's amazing 18 back so i've got-- and ow i'm going to pull out the big gun and i'm going to take a nice heavy serious look at kevdak what am i going to hit him with i'm going to take a sharpshooter shot in his face i'm going to go for a headshot with the big gun a headshot with the big with sharpshooter trickshot on sharpshooter i'm doing a combo 23 to hit i don't feel good i feel really bad right now i don't feel happy all right so that's-- first the damage that's 26 points of piercing damage plus he has to make a constitution saving throw against a dc of 19 reloading taking another shot i don't care i don't care same thing sharpshooter i'm going to-- i hate this music you're playing no no i'm going to drop a grit for advantage because-- deadeye with sharpshooter that's good it can only go up from there and we do all right that's 19 26 to hit that hits oh yeah no that's with the minus five how about that i rolled a 19 asshole asshole that's better that is a seven so that's 17 18 19 20 30 36 points of damage 18 and that's my two shots so i'm not reloaded shot reloaded shot i'm now going to burn my action surge can i-- i was going to say can i burn that as a run or can i only burn that as an attack i'm going to use my action as a dash to oh fuck there's no way around is there fuck it then i'm taking another shot this is sharpshooter as well no deadeye 23 to hit i want to save some grit for some problems (raspberry) yeah it is oh
