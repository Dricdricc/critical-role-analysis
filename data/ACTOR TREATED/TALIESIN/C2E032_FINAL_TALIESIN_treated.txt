wow big helper we've been really trying to talk to the glove that was smooth well there you go could be anything there might be a surprise if there is tell us do we want to raid the adult bookstore one more time just kidding you're just going to make a sloshing sound when you walk for a while i am all for that you think you got it all right mr caleb-- what are you playing with over there seemed really intent on whatever it was it's too late i'm already ready for it all right gotcha hey miss jester apparently you picked something up in zadash-- i'm supposed to see the thingy in your bag i don't know caleb was being very shifty about it i'd like to see any questionable thing you may have what is that is that even natural what is this thing i'm going to meditate into the box too soon does this place make me feel a little uncomfortable okay all right huh i think i have a passenger and that's interesting i did it was he is it is i'm trying to not make assumptions good to know i'll keep-- mum's the word huh i wouldn't know but-- you should probably experience this it's interesting tomorrow magic domes i wasn't going to say it yeah i remember that it's a very good bathtub it's got claw feet i appreciate that do i know what a gnoll is 11 irregular gnolls irregular ones i'm new caduceus caduceus clay pleasure you're a lot shorter than the last one they-- introduced me to yeah i've noticed everybody else is very short it's fascinating pleasure to make your acquaintance this is a place where you did good that's nice i don't know everywhere that i've been with you so far people seem to be really happy to see you it's a sign in my opinion pick one reminding everyone that we have all seen each other naked oh lord i'm feeling very prideful at the moment thank you this sounds exciting (laughter) all right yeah it'll be fun yeah i don't think i've done this before oh yeah no you just got to ask permission before you do anything oh yeah i ask permission to any animal i interact with anything i eat and it's always a conversation yeah i say we're going to be-- well i explain to the horse that we're going to be moving south and i'd really appreciate their cooperation in the process and how long we expect to be going for yeah i mean can you do it without-- can you talk without talking is that a thing you can do i can hear you but your lips aren't moving this is-- nope it's not working for me nope probably take ten minutes actually trying to do that before we get going yeah manners will get you everywhere that's some black magic right there that's really impressive and you sound like a kid that fell down the well when you're doing that i'll take first watch all right yeah nothing gets by me unless i-- well no that's a natural 20 oh yeah you're just pointing at things got it got it yep got that yep oh got that got that yep where yeah it's tundra except for my little patch fair play that doesn't look right that now if i were inclined to be a trap or an ambush of some kind or-- those rocks shouldn't be that way that's all i'm saying it's giving me the bad feelings the rocks i mean i'm okay if you are never had a rock really hit back this looks a little weird to me it's my mime i'm going to use thaumagurgy to cast my voice very loudly behind the other side of the rocks thaumaturgy it just got stuck in there thauma-gurgy i want to use my thauma-gerchy oh so i can't throw my voice then hang on a second i can do tremors in the ground so i'm going to start tremoring the ground right over by those rocks the rocks look a little weird i don't know it means the rocks look weird they're giving me a bad feeling i don't have a lot of bad feelings all right maybe it's an awfully suspicious trail marker if it was a trail marker you usually stack three stones make it look very intentional have you ever seen a painting where someone tries to paint stars but the stars don't look right because they're the wrong kind of random that's the wrong kind of random the random nature makes and the random that man makes all right let's go take a look then that makes me a little sad on a fundamental level no left right left right ugh we're keeping an eye out for anything else happening 21 yeah i'm feeling good oh thank you 23 that looks like somebody on the run i'm going to change my appearance to a grungy human with shaggy hair a long orange goatee a puffy red beard and scruffy long red hair human tasmanian devil we look related then we do okay that's obscene barter it at the very least he was responsible for the circus that's all he just took responsibility i would love to have an insight check insight check from caduceus i want to know what's going on in there that's a (counting) 27 i'm rolling real well today rolling high i can do this if you like sam and i don't have to know it's more than a thank you i feel that you have to be free so that you can finally pay your debt no this is you hiding from your debt you're a man who is afraid of what you owe i understand that's okay it'll feel so much better when you're finally free from this belief this is not your debt your debt lies elsewhere i know these things it'll be your last one in here no i just know a guilty man when i see one he doesn't want to leave he's not even happy he's hiding in here it's not that he feels unsafe you can just see-- it's all over his face you can tell a lot from people just by looking at them that's an entire conversation for later in a terrible crash with a man named buick (laughter) i want to see-- i think this is a man who needs to be free so that he can be at peace with himself why would you not want to-- why would you want to be in a cell why would you want to stay there someone's offering you freedom for nothing he's putting on-- there's so much there he's hiding something i just know-- i just-- i will throw some money at this would there be a buyout cost if we wanted to pay it is that just the straight-- or could there be some sort of deal yeah weirdly-- and i dont know you've spent more time with him-- but he strikes me as a man who's weirdly happier in jail right now than he'd be out of it i think he needs to face some stuff it would be really healthy for everyone involved that's 12 i'll put 400 gold down right now there's no generosity in this we're at 14 we need three more interpretive dance i gave you four 400 i think it was 400 yeah i already knocked it off thank you nott a word of advice whatever was keeping you in this cell whatever was making you comfortable in here be careful of it there's something inside you that's trying to put you in a box whatever guilt you're feeling whatever thing that you feel that you're to blame for i would unload that burden if not on us on somebody although we're happy to take it intimidation is fine i was trying to be kind of nice seven he's very sad i see funny rocks i see funny people and this is not sitting right there's something unnatural about the build i would like to make a dexterity check to see if i catch it if that's okay 12 appreciate that that's nice of you i told you why i told him why because it's not healthy to sit there and just hide from your problems is it liam and how much money was it yeah how much is that seems fair how much money was that amount 65 thank you i mean what's the point of having gold if you're not using it for something i mean otherwise it's just something that's making it heavier to walk sounds odd but all right worth it fucking worth it i'm feeling it i'm feeling the vibe the vibe was that it was worth it that was by the way the best whisper i've ever had i'm not telling them at all what you said but that was amazing that was deep i'm happy to take it this was definitely my instigation so i should bear the brunt of it that was weird i do my meditation wow what does the other side of failure look like just the horse butt on the top natural one (whispers) their families must know pain i'm really enjoying this i get to see this wonderful countryside sure 19 again with advantage all right natural 20 rocking it today 28 mr fjord what do you think of that do you recognize those uniforms are we okay with these people or should we-- fair is there a way to turn off the effect there's got to be a way to turn off the enchantment maybe i'm probably not the person the make an arcana check for this but here we go nope that is a natural one which gives me a zero what oh yeah that's-- what it may not come back is the thought yeah actually i was going to say you haven't done it yet i think that-- i did may i there's actually nothing on the cart this is a preventative measure against theft you can feel free to inspect the cart yourself if you like ten it's kind of neat right we look forward to seeing you on our return oh i figure we're not difficult faces to remember you too (laughs) mm-hmm no advantage that's a 27 i am rocking today i know common elvish giant sylvan there's giants up ahead liam and shh all right do i know where the voice came from okay all right it's about 30 feet away all right i think he's planning on ambushing us i'm going to cast-- just one i can see although he's talking to someone-- i'm going to cast calm emotions over there just to see what that does it's a 20-foot bomb in all that section i can't see against 16 what are they wearing i'm just going to calmly keep moving the cart by them and i'm just going to wave back and say that's some great leather you're wearing there you look great they also don't see any of you they just see me and whoever's sitting up front right now yeah please bring it i feel bad that we didn't get to-- i feel like-- if you worked so hard on a map i was feeling a little guilty i am enjoying this character so much i'm so tall all right i think it was just me at this point yeah because you guys can see this whole thing isn't he isn't he pretty i can understand this too and i'm going to chime in a bit i think it's really unfair you're just putting this all on him i think you really-- you've got to chill out a bit i mean you seem like a nice guy you're really listening to this god i'm also still very gently still moving forward you guys have got issues man language come on yeah man who doesn't speak giant that's just rude i don't think you're dumb and i'm just still going (giggles) bless you wizards man stay all right my friend you stay all right don't let anybody tell you what you can't do it's not a concentration by the way calm emotions for me is not doesn't-- is not a concentration no yes it is you're right never mind i don't know how to read spells yet yeah so you know we've been rolling yeah we're going and now i'm booking marisha and boom motherfuckers and you have to turn the little marquee again we'd better run i tell the horses we're going fast animal handling 21 the jig is up there we go you can hold 17 or 16 was it 16 you're on your own and we're moving at speed is this the same day as we disguised ourselves or have we had a sleep from the jewels okay so yeah you're fine i'm trying to figure out that thing that i can do where i can make someone vulnerable to terrible things yeah i'm trying to find it ah path of the grave i'm too far away it's 30 feet all right so i can't quite do that yet that's really frustrating so i'm just going to do what i can do from this distance which is sacred flame i suppose i always take the left no on my left that one yeah dex save that's my action yeah that's all i got that's a shame it was a good roll i know we are so done first thing i'm going to do is i'm going to tap my staff and say time to get out children i'm going to bring a little nest of creatures right on the back of his business right there well they get everywhere it's a swarm what is the attack for that by the way i think i might have that here hold on where is it it's been acting a little weird it doesn't give me the attack stuff for it because it's not linked to it properly thank you sorry ten i'm going to need a little bit more i turn to one of the beetles and make him feel this and have the beetle bite me and then swarms and attacks him i'm casting bane yeah because the beetle brings my blood i have to spill blood for this it only can hit the one fucker oh yeah we're doing good that's okay i'm just going to spend a spell slot that's what i got the horses know who our friends are i don't suppose the other swarms get an attack of opportunity so he doesn't get to move does he from this position you can clearly see how this one would reach (laughter) whoa i love it when a line-up like that happens i'm going to be stopping the carts this guy's going to be trashed am i within 60 feet of the guy on the ground the one that's far away there's no way i can get within 60 feet of him i'm going to tell the horses to whoa i'm going to tell the horses to whoa i'm going to tell my beetles to keep munching on that guy who's on the ground i'm going to hold my-- i'm so sorry this is a new spell i'm learning stop there we go i'm going to hold channel divinity until the one on the ground's within 30 feet of me i'm going to whoa the horses and hold channel divinity until there's a creature within 30 feet i'm also going to move to the front of the cart too so i'm right there next to everybody yeah we're all-- yeah i'm going to cast cure wounds on caleb as he's walking by in this state also i'm going to go over and cast decompose on that one that's-- see what pops out i'm going to take a handful and give it a smell (sniff) mmm look at that he's useful now that's good that's so good ah i'm going to go get back on the cart oh man dig your fingers into it goat meat's great there's a lot of medieval cooking that would want the meat to get a little gamy i'm just saying sometimes it improves the flavor thank you let's try a new die oh that's not bad that's a 17 it'll do i got to see this i'm getting up i am so excited for a show well you're going to probably get rustled a bit but i'm sure they'll let you in eventually perhaps there is something else hit her with a sleep spell they're bastards those birds you can make him a little mask and then he'd be the crimson weasel taliesin and caduceus have very conflicting feelings right now i've never been so disappointed to have rolled a vegetarian character in my entire life you guys all right is this all on the level i'm just going to check with the animals that everything is copacetic 12 i mean i asked them yeah no i just asked them do the animals seem like they're cool with this too i was talking to the animals that's all right they're not freaking out at me sure all right i feel that i'm so glad that this is happening this is going to make a giant alligator so happy weasel got a tattoo on his left wing just icarus tattooed on his wing good luck to you oh you got goldfished as soon as one of these animals runs away we'll actually be nine of us that's really exciting i mean the name of the group is kind of a thing you know i don't know (laughter) four a very special episode yeah that's not doing it
