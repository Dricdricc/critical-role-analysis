(singing) should auld acquaintance be forgot and-- this is the most festive d&d game i've ever experienced you were supposed to have a lighter too i didn't even look at mine that could have gone so poorly it's hard to show off eyeliner far too long ah yes it's been quite an interesting two years we'll catch up we need a table we need drinks for me and my compatriots it's a long story and i can't tell you everything right now you know how it is literally everything coming back to haunt me okay cool the second she turns i'm going to turn and give fjord a little pat on the back and make a whisper really quickly yeah i'm gonna whisper in fjord's ear-- i'm sorry this is my nightmare please just go with it it's lucien and i'm back around pass it on (nervous laugh) yasha i'm apparently lucien from two years ago from two years ago it's lucien remember it's been ages i'm so glad to see you it's lucien it's lucien i'll explain later just go with it please i don't know we'll find out just go with it i'll explain later i'll explain later i hate you it might be easier just to have them all killed right now-- i didn't say that out loud i didn't say that out loud i'm just thinking out loud oh god it's going to be fine i'm not panicking marisha and come sit down i give the tabaxi another hug as we sit down how have you been it's been ages that's my name who can keep track these days again a long story that is a story for another day and another drink what did you see god i don't know what that looked like from the other end of things matt well it all went belly up two years ago you told us to scatter and vanish if it didn't-- if things went wrong and wait until you returned we buried your ass in the woods outside of the hideout i mean--  i had a few tricks up my sleeve obviously is everybody else all right i know it has been a while i had to stay underground damn shame damn shame no actually i'm-- where is tyffial i would rather obviously deliver everything in person honestly if i had known you were here i would've made arrangements i didn't want to shock you i'm working on something very delicate i need everything to be very quiet where are my manners they don't know a lot but they're trustworthy i've been putting my trust in them so far that's actually fair technically advantage because it's kind of the truth yeah i think that's advantage i begged for advantage on that one okay thank you it's good to be seen again but again it's got to be very quiet right now it's been like three other names since the last time i saw you please keep it quiet for now that book caused more trouble than you think and it all laid on my shoulders i was trying to protect the rest of you from some of the worst elements of that and i don't want any heat dropping on anybody who doesn't know what's coming yet but let me know where they are and i'll get a hold of them but don't let them know why yet (sighs) that's again mixed company and public company mixed results you don't have to tell them anything you don't want to tell them that's all right foolishness in thinking i knew what i was doing that's the answer you're getting you work for the gentleman these days how is it working for the gentleman i'm looking at our friend all right i'll saunter over with my drink and sit down at the table come on everyone let's do this she's giving out leaflets it is definitely cree's speciality lucien at the table is fine i trust you with this don't get fancy not anymore yes there was nothing fishy in the card shuffle in the cut was there let's do it 12 high profile but low profile she's quick to toe the party line just-- (laughter) (shushing) i'm beginning to imagine it right now actually that's very nice that is certainly one to grow on doesn't actually switch hands you just do this a lot that is so baller oh my god i will say the only thing that i can think of that i would want not even necessarily addend to this contract if we are going to do this to you i'm looking to stay on the down low in general if we can agree even my presence in this city necessarily is as far as it's concerned is none of anybody's concern outside this bar i would be forever grateful i figured you would sometimes remember the name lucien doesn't leave this bar outside i never want to hear it uttered brilliant quality not quantity i'm taking a long look at cree and i want to see if i see any of the things that i expect to see i want to see if there's any markings or anything otherwise that i would expect to see all right because it's better that way perception check wow that's a terrible roll that's a five all right that's fair yasha do i deal with this or do i not deal with this i don't want to deal with this i hate this i'm going to stand up and walk over to cree a lifetime ago i have a weird question and i apologize for it the spell i used to get away it-- i wasn't there for as long as you thought i was i missed how everything ended in the end i hate to ask but i was long gone before anything really started to go down how did everything end can you just-- i'll explain why in a moment that's where i lost you then i'm going to have to find her again at some point the reason i've stayed quiet-- it was never going to work somebody was working against me i don't know who but i can't trust anyone i saw how you reacted to seeing me and it was-- i'm willing to believe it wasn't you who turned but it could have been her but it could have been one of us that's why i need you to keep it quiet please 13 there will come a moment when i can tell you everything but it's so complicated please just keep it quiet for now until i know that everyone's going to react the way that you did to seeing me i will tell you everything eventually i give a hug it's been too long i'm sorry for everything and i give the pat and head back to the table i'm going to walk over with a new round of drinks here drink this i'm told they're stupid ugh lucien for the moment we'll talk about it later in here we're lucien let's have that conversation somewhere else i don't know who's listening here yeah that was a weird amount of into you wasn't it i'm going to cut my finger a bit and bleed into it is it wine worth a try we will have this conversation outside this bar lucien's not going to answer any questions molly will answer every question you have later thank you for coming back i've missed you why do you need to know so many things they're not used to you yet i could use a hand for a bit i'd owe you one she is definitely not joshing why would we be set up we'll check but shit happens and you've got to be doing something when shit happens we just happened to be doing something it's hardly a coincidence what we commonly referred to in the circus as yasha-ing it's a sight to behold you said that in this bar let's not say anything in here that we wouldn't want to be circulated wait is that a beer she's not a crick god was it a year and a half ago give or take how many people are listening in on this clearly right now 14 actually no 17 sorry can we please stop talking in here they are serving us free drinks of course they're listening to everything we say let's retire for the evening we can come back and do this tomorrow you talk to kara then but no more whatever this is i am genuinely a little drunk and didn't remember who the myriad were what am i doing deception ten so i have to tell the truth i have no idea i'd literally forgotten because i'm a little drunk and i'm really preoccupied right now i know i was just doing it to fuck with them (angry meowing) situationally it could be a thing-- yeah we've been talking about the sword yeah we'll hold on we'll see if you want to play around with it fjord yeah many things are taller than nott interesting stuff there that is a fair point i've been informed by jester that she is now to use the wand of smiles (cheering) from the darkness she strikes for a complete list of those incentives head on over to geekandsundrycom that is a very fine idea i think that also sounds like a very fine idea that's a fair point page-turner not yet it was d&d ramen how are we going to get him through the city with a blindfold on everyone's a shady pair in this group somehow even as individuals we are all somehow shady pairs it is just inevitable is this marisha or is this beau never mind we've all been lucien so well i was born on the continent of-- i really-- i genuinely thought i would have some bullshit together by now and i'm really sort of stuck it's dangerous though it's officially dangerous at this point what's the difference but seriously i've been part of a shady group i've been dealing with shady friends for as long as i can remember if there's one thing i've learned about dealing with people that you can't trust is that you have to trust them where you can and not trust them where you can't i'm not saying that i know what i'm doing or anything but i don't want anybody-- i want this to work i need this to work i've not done this in a while all right yeah that's interesting isn't it this might even be easier if you just ask questions i really don't know how to tell this story i woke up without any names or any past buried in the ground two years ago obviously not in the dirt my first memory my oldest memory is dirt in my face underground how honest do i have to be okay i rolled a four all right that's not entirely true it's a vague memory i don't really remember it it's kind of all jumbled it's what i've been told about some of it i don't know there is no before whatever happened before is not me it's not part of anything-- (sighs) some asshole got buried in the dirt fuck him i am enjoying what i'm doing i want nothing to do with that anything that came before i was happy to just leave it be no how would i know that's somebody else no not exactly some of them yes days i was a bit out of it it's hard to remember i wasn't speaking really do you have memories from your childhood it felt like that it's all bright and more meaningful than it should be there was just nothing i was practically catatonic i was barely speaking alone i'd like to think so i don't know i don't know who that was i've never heard the name lucien before or that other name i've never heard of any of it yeah well i like pretending pretending's great who cares where anybody came from that's possible except of course she had weird blood powers few months after i came to i started noticing i could do things knew things that i didn't necessarily know i knew yeah i can-- can i see that dagger pick one ice oh no i can we're here this is happening that's fine yeah i really don't whoever that was came to that end and i want nothing to do with that whatever it was it doesn't feel good when i-- the moment when something creeps through i don't like it i don't want anything to do with it i was happy i liked the circus the circus was great yes that's a good laura you can be monosyllabic if you like with these people mm-hmm yeah whatever that was not without me feeding it to them first i mean i've conned people we've all conned people i've used other names before a lot of this was in the hopes that maybe it would never happen keep moving keep quiet but i'll say this and i'm going to put the knife down is there anything sharp around anything at all something that's even ridiculous like something not normal perfect i'm just going to cut myself again on the wooden frame and grab it and use radiance i'll admit this is new you got to see the first time this happened not that i'm-- well no that's fair sure well it was worth it every time okay here's the thing that you're not catching that wasn't me this is mine i don't want anything from that other person anymore that person is someone else i don't want anything to do with it i did not feel good coming out of that it was-- i'm in for a penny might as well i'm told although i don't entirely remember this part that i only said the word empty over and over again for the first week travis marisha and i don't know what that means empty i don't know barely remember that sounds terrible i don't want to remember anything i don't want to anybody else's baggage in my head and i don't want anybody else's problems thoughts ideas i like this person right now is a good person is a fine person is a happy person sounds shifty nope i don't want it we all have a few i assume can you imagine what it would feel like to not feel anything about anything that had happened to you so far travis liam and why am i not surprised it's very freeing it's the best thing-- it's the thing that happened to me it's not the best thing that happened to me it's the thing that happened to me i found peace in building a new person the moonweaver-- what if it feels that i owe it something i spent two years before i met you all cajoling people occasionally ripping them off occasionally doing a good turn here or there never trust the truth the truth is vicious the truth thinks you owe it something none of that i like my bullshit it's good it's happy it makes other people happy it is exactly who i am well do you know who the moonweaver is excellent the swords are cheap carnival glass there's nothing special about them literally a decorated pair of swords to make them look special that's true things came back quick and the circus helped they were good people they did a lot of me and joy can fill an awful lot of a person's life maybe i feel tinges of things on occasion nothing i like because i always lie and bullshit i may be a liar but i'm never a betrayer i'm honest in my work and i believe in doing a good turn i've never cheated you out of money i've never robbed from you i stayed with that circus for two years i know how people treat each other it's important and all that stuff you told me before i've got to admit i didn't even listen to any bit of it i was just trying to teach you a lesson i don't care where you've been i don't care what terrible things any of you have done you're here now this is how it works yes darling of course i use fortunes to tell people what i see in them but sometimes sometimes i feel like maybe there's something that tickles the back of my head i will admit some days am i lying thank you i always try to be helpful when i turn cards for people people are looking for a path they're looking for a path and i'll tell you-- and this is true-- i did my best every town i went to and every town i left no matter how they treated me-- and a lot of them treated me with deep disrespect i left every town better than i found it is it-- yeah no so i show off the peacock a little bit one of the peacock feathers on the neck-- thank you liam one of the eyes on one of the peacock feathers is a bright crimson red which any of you if you'd ever made a fucking insight check would know god i was waiting for you to fuck with me it's also the same place that he bleeds every time that he uses any of his powers there's also a red eye on the snake on the palm and there's a red eye on the snake on the opposite side of the hand there are various-- i'm just showing the snake the two snake eyes i'm showing the peacock eye and then i'm going to show the eye in the floral arrangement i tried to cover them but they wouldn't take ink so i just did my best no i don't know what they are i don't know i don't but now that you bring it up because i'd never occurred to it i might start oh that was for caleb never mind sorry who butt shaves anything else before we're done here no we tried-- that's dangerous work and it'll usually backfire no interest in that it's mostly just trying to help people get their shit together did someone send you on the wrong path that's fair i don't care to be fair yes everything i like the safety of it and if i had had my way this would've been a conversation for a later date but i need to protect you and myself from whatever that is so you need to know that that is a wild card it's a terrible name i don't ever want to know who that person is let me make this abundantly clear my name is molly that person is dead and not me it's just a person who had this body they abandoned it it's mine now and i feel that you're fretfully ignorant and filled with platitudes but i still like you regardless maybe he killed goblins maybe he was a goblin hunter maybe he ate them raw this was not how i expected this to go thank you i'm waiting for the spell to dissipate before i say anything i both like you more and less at the same time thank you dear (sighs) even that undead wispy things is that triggering anything in the brain 19 undead orbs they're basically will-o'-wisps you usually find them in swamps or things like that yes am i smoldering yes i know anyway all right did you do this alone or was i in the room when this happened i would have loved to have watched this i walk up get a little uncomfortably close put my hand on your chest the power was in you all along see you at breakfast did you just tell a joke (sighs) it's a shame it was a very good one she's slowly sharpening a blade at home just-- do i recognize these people okay i may have the chill cloak flipped to try and be a little less conspicuous rolling around for what it's worth we're probably going to be dealing with some restless spirits actually so if there's anything to deal with some of these phantasmagorical creatures will-o'-wisps that sort of thing yeah inevitably perfect that's exactly what i was looking for was two vials of holy water probably need some healing potions or something we'll make some money i think we're pretty well taken care of at this point i've never seen you blush before we should probably go to the blacksmith at some point has she punched you in the face yet i think she likes you i'll take that money it'll be no problem we can to be fair get all 20 of those throwing darts for one gold yeah it was worth it i am going to turn around and immediately head towards the other bar the evening nip i'm going to let you know tell them i'm hiding at the bar and i'll meet them there when it's time that's a good call i'll go behind yasha yeah that's a good order hey beau i pull out one of the holy water flasks think you know what to do with this just in case who do you think the other one should go to maybe nott might be safer you're not in a boat with us this one you throw know how to throw stuff if there was a basket for trash and you threw it-- wow that's exciting that doesn't count that's cocked way less i'll take that so when we get into the boat together i'm going to give you the other holy water flask and you have a holy water now please feel better
