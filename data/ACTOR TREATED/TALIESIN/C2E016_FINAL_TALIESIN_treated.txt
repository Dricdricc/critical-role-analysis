i feel like i got that though was there something else that does that i feel like there was a thing i'll have to keep reading what does the mantle look like does it look familiar i was hoping what else did you get out of there that is a good idea everything's in the pile including the stuff in the second chest the stuff in the second chest i heard two traps go off anything you take on your own time is yours we're on the clock we're not stealthy doing this greener than normal or fill in the blanks he did have feet they were just somewhere else i'm taking a ring how many are there that's fair that was not a good deed that is literally baseline of what's expected i'm taking an extra one for helping you remember that you're supposed to share you can put it in your ear let's keep it all together then for now except for the books got to do business advantage or no no that's a one a one tie it up and bundle it i wonder if you'll come out in one of the nine hells but only a third of you you're welcome there are literally going to be rock monsters if we go back the other way not far we're only going an hour down tops are we taking a cat that's fair let's just-- good to know i'll join this is there a place to tie it off perception that would have been ten again i'm already taking off my jacket i'm taking off everything that i don't want to get wet keeping just one sword and i'm going to go for it weirdly there are no nipple rings those things are dangerous they catch on shit 16 i'm going in i'm crawling up into it man no because it's going to have a flow because the water is coming down we have to tie it off on something i'll let you know when i get there yeah where is it i'm so excited i want to hear your white noise (laughter) i've always wanted to do this we seem to keep finding these i am going to examine this thing seven magic i will pick up the skull and take a look at it it is human all these checks where's my medicine there 12 very true well on your way yorick i set it adrift i'm going to also keep my eyes open i'm going to try to get a little bit down into this to see if there's any bits and pieces underwater do a little pat down 18 all right i'm going to kick my way back up to the boat a lot of bad decisions several boats someone who didn't quite get away i think i should find that gross but i'm kind of into it we did find one interesting thing a place to stash things if we don't want them to be found well if we come out the other way then we know how to get back down here good to know wet somewhere in the world right now someone's laughing that was fun long rest that's a bit deep in there i think at the top personally oh that's a whole different show you did great do i believe him one i'm rolling so well if you kill them then they're not really your friends are they exactly it's probably time 21 there was a lot in there though we could have strapped them both to your back quite a few will-o'-wisps quite a few traps was there a gelatinous cube at one point i smack her on the back of the head that's right you're up i swat once we've figured out that the will-o'-wisps were coming from pots we just broke anything that looked like it might contain one a lot of images on the wall weird magic stuff possibly a probing question would remind some things i'm trying to remember it was a bit daunting we'll do our humble best let's go pawn some things let's clear some things out we didn't actually tell him about the manacles a very dead guy i don't see why not you've been waiting for that for too long several specifically their feet she's not a verbal learner i could tell unless there's an opal in there i'm getting rid of the ring oh that's fine they're probably fake then anything you took from the circus was not real it was trade commit to it there's literally a cadaver that just went into the building not to give you ideas i would like to try some chemical altered states it's time to have a good night yeah probably the celebratory first night oh just before dusk i have no idea matt sam and there's only enough for two other people to take it well it's a little late because i already took mine
