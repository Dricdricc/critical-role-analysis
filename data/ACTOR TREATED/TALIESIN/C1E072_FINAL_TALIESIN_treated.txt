and some yenk i imagine i may lend my cut-dragon-like-butter blade to this whole process we'll find something things went well no all good good no i'm going to point at all-- you all sun goes down all of us drink back there go back everything's fine oh why didn't you say something you're standing there making us very nervous i'm fair with that all right harvest gently we're trying to keep as much of it-- and we are interested in scale tooth and claw and maybe some eyeballs so that works out very well mind the tree mind the tree they're boots of taste that you have they're uggs lava lamp i'm so hoping it talks to you now i'm so hoping it starts talking to you let's build a condominium 150 pounds we're going to have to fill the whitestone coffers with some of this stuff when we get back i was saving that empty vials i'm out of vials in theory then i have three empty vials because i did have three healing potions that i've used thank you i'm going to go sit down for a little while and breathe i've got to try and fix my guns is this a misfire check or a tinkering check since i'm not in combat okay so it's proficiency bonus dex roll ooh 28 yep that's fine yup 26 yeah retort's fine wow that would be a thing wouldn't it do i recognize the text on it celestial i was a very lonely child this is some sort of paladin sword it's a holy weapon of some kind anything else interesting how were the dragonborn about us taking some of their-- anything else we should go back for as well there was a what there's a ship in the dragon's collection i think this would be a really good idea before we left if a dragon grabbed a ship it was probably filled with something interesting it got his attention and he kept it the ice is already melting it's not like anyone can get in here it's as guarded as it's going to be right now she was doing something previously i don't think that anything awful is going to happen they are interesting and i'm indifferent to such things is there other things does this actually look like a special gem that requires somebody who knows things there's some bracelets and such i thought i'd take a look ah i'll take a look at the back-blades i think i can only handle one of these but we'll find out what happens so many things yay that's a magic all its own paper faces on parad√© would you like me to attach the mask to your fine hat all right bring it downstairs yeah let's just do this your what oh yes of course we're all going downstairs that's not a spell attack is it no it does nothing else yeah grabbing the helmets and here i'm going to borrow you there's actually a drink called cock ale which is brewed in a dead chicken i say we pack up all of our things and raid a ship i say we-- well some of us yes i say we take a night we hit the ship and then head home put some ice in it keep it cold we had a little bit of metallurgy to do regular dex-based all right all right that's a 26 i've also carved in elven in the inside kick me yeah so it's there i think so yes let's i know i don't know did you say that before turning into an elephant for god's sake vax stop aerating more wine we've had enough you've had enough no never am i aware of this happening at all i don't see them at all i'm thankfully wearing a helmet (deadpan) oh help help please that's not bad that's 18 you're an elephant in the cloak of displacement it's not hard to hit an elephant i can't imagine it i legitimately cannot imagine it it is it's dr fredrickstein please it's clean it's perfectly reasonable it is engraved in elven on the inside it's lovely it's your title sir it's meant to be secret did you oh dear you sound very intimidating oh my god it'd be good to have a list of things to ignore i agree i propose that we have an evening's rest in the morning-- no i think we need an evening's rest you did her fun buns oh okay that's good-- i didn't think anything i'm going up let's pack our things head down and take a look at that pirate ship then head home well that ship i don't know if it has pirate symbols but i'm very excited probably a bit having the ability to melt some ice would probably be helpful also you're going to have to do the tree teleport and possibly we want to deal with reforestation of some kind we have to go out like captain eo it's a thing no not a bad idea it's all in the same place if there's a problem we can call the others we won't be that far away thank you oh i may need a ringtone later certainly adds something doesn't it to the whole valley it's quite nice if you could let them know that we're going to make one last venture into the ship and then we'll be on our way well i speak a couple of languages i read a couple does it look familiar celestial elven common 19 but i burned a resolve let's burrow straight into the side i think to be on the safe side let's stop melting ice i don't know i'm irritated by it why would he we left one the ice was going to collapse eventually anyway if you find something-- if you find an ice weapon in that ship beneath the throne-- anything magical some sort of ice power we may need it that may be useful yeah god i want to get in that ship no you're going to win sure yeah i'm going to do nothing but stare at that bloody ship if i don't so sure i'm trying really hard not to think about it actually i don't know honestly there hasn't been a lot of time to process i would say it would be nice to be going home except i know what we're going home to so there's going to be no relief that creature hanging around yeah death was not pleasant all right i don't actually i would've eventually looked it up it's the sort of terribly boring thing i would do i tend to think that many people tend to exalt the exact opposite of what they are i recently-- i will say before death-- had a bit of an epiphany and have been trying-- not always succeeding but trying-- not to dwell on such things yes yes yes how common is that word i would know the word oh i think so i'm trying it's the only thing i've tried that's made any sense so far and it felt very liberating it felt good it felt perfect and it wasn't about her it was just about me honestly that was really the thing that i noticed was i didn't say it to make her feel better i didn't say it to give her any peace i came to that feeling before running into her i didn't know if it would be true when i saw her but i feel like so much of my energy had been such a waste and worse than a waste it had been twisted in the wrong direction and it's too late for a lot of things there are things i cannot take back and things that i have done that will forever be terrible but that's not the point i suppose thank you i would like to think we're all better than we think we are except maybe your brother i think he's just a mess is he in here shouldn't have given him that ring thank you i know i have to forgive myself i'm not quite there yet but i can see a path i like where we are and what we're doing i think that we're the right people in the right place and the right time i would be horrified if you were taking yourself too seriously it was quite lovely i don't know if the tree is quite as happy with it but i was quite impressed thank you what room are we in out of curiosity oh no room we're in the woods yeah all right as i walk away i walk up i kiss her so we'll talk later and i walk away bless you bam motherfuckers bam there was pissing there was kissing there was everything pissing and kissing is the title you're welcome internet
