i can see action figures busting through walls being held by hands (explosion sound effects) it's all about the back oh there's no getting away from this (laughter) (oohs and ahs) i think i saw that did you see that on the count of three yay 16 that's very adequate this is going to be the thing for the entire campaign this is going to be the joke that never goes away nein no don't joke don't ever i'm going to run straight in take a look around is the undead one the closest one to me push me a little more against the wall yeah over there i'm going to hit that undead one with vicious mockery actually i'm going to hit the one that has the kid with vicious mockery not the undead one oh that's right i don't have to roll to hit just a wisdom saving throw that's three points of damage yes (rasping) drop the child get used to it yep i'm holding waiting for them oh yeah some would say seven i'm going to rush the undead one spinning swords at bloody high speed and take two shots ooh can i do the higher ground i'll do the higher ground that's exciting that sucks i'm taking your-- nope that's a 15 okay yep no that's at least eight points of damage that's okay that's okay i'm now engaged in combat with him so that's fine i am whirling dervish that hits nothing at this point i'm a hippie with poi right now might as well be a pair of pois wah wah that hits i'm taking a roll at the big guy first strike that's fine because that's a 19 to hit 15 this is with the good sword so this-- ooh so this is (counting) 13 points of damage that's adding my wisdom with my off-hand i'm going to take a swipe for the hyena over there come on there we go 20 to hit that's nine points of damage i would love to just kick that fucker right into the-- i'm going to move to the other side i'm going to start running towards the stranger just to the left of-- yeah i'm going to move towards that cover right there no the other way towards me right there yeah we've got to get you glasses i was saying if i'm not near the other door i'm going to start looking and unlatching it nonchalantly this is a personal question is there anyone alive in here right now oh well we'll take it i'm swinging the door open and coming in if you wait a second it's only getting better oh that is a question we're here to help come on out you got hit on the way to the city not in the raid on the city let's get you out here for a second so many new friends lately do we need to escort them or can we send them up to the surface if you leave your alarm up here-- that's fair then yeah that's a good plan we start kicking them right up to the edge kicking them right in the hole oh people die all the time i like this plan i'll take a couple as well we're going to look around see if there's anything of interest 18 learn how to see in the bloody dark i'm not getting over that it's everything i could've wanted it's really clever plus a d4 oh dear i was watching this i was going to head down this direction anyway i'm opening up the jar there you are both of us 13 20 fun fact matt's house is actually made of dwarven forge every wall the kitchen it's just dwarven forge all the way through i know this has to end i'm going to use my bonus action just before this happens and i'm going to activate the second sword i've got both of those sticks going i'm ready for this let's take a line of the three of us at least original run a real initiative roll that's something 13 wow really i slice it catch it in the spin goddamn it i'm going to hop up and move to the left i'm not even going to use the real stairs i'm going to get to the side up on that barrel over there yeah and use vicious mockery on the one closest to us so he's fine (devilish voice) ack fuck can't finish it (laughter) i'm going to get to the-- no i'm going to stay back because i'm a little-- yeah i'm going to let other people come up first always i'm going to use blood maledict i do not have visual damn it fine welcome to the game all right i'm going to try and run up the stairs toward the undead guy i'm going to take a swing at him that's 14 to hit okay wow let's see what we do that's (counting) 11 points of damage i'm going to keep running and to get to the other side of that other gnoll yeah actually if there's any way can i get all the way around him yeah i don't know if this is helpful but i'm going to take my second swing that's 18 to hit that's ten points of damage that ends my turn so engaged that's okay you've engaged them which means they're less likely to use their bows take that attack of opportunity-- oh no blood maledict to all fuck oh look at that oh man you don't want my energy it's been bad travis and you can make this go away at any time yeah we're not good at anything let's stop pretending that we're good at anything could have been worse although you are our tank yeah it halved the fall damage that's so mean it hits i'm going to rush around to the left of the big guy his left i'm sorry right over here right in there i'm going to take two shots and see what happens do i have advantage or anything because he's not moving or-- all right that hits that's a 23 i'll roll damage on that he doesn't get the bonus does he none of that special power against him ooh that's nice 13 points of damage shot number two is 21 to hit that's seven points of damage i'm going to try and see what happens if i disengage i'm going to back away towards me does he try and make his strike i was just curious i was going to hit him if he's going to try and hit me i'm going to hit him right back with blood maledict i'm going to use the full blood maledict so i'm going to take a little damage yep oh i take my three points of damage i start bleeding again from the neck i'm going to back up a little further to get-- right up here if that's okay he doesn't have a reaction so you can back away now i did not know that did not know that we're also going to go through the pockets of the big one obviously nice [break] i'm here more than you these days you better hide that thing so happy for you i'll give advantage advantage yeah that's not good that's cocked well never say no to gold you can do any of us notice this yep 13 how flammable is that nest (singing) too many maps too many maps no we hit the nest set the nest on fire and it'll run oh yeah good point yep it's fair to draw a line at human sacrifice yeah let's-- sealing the cave would be one thing i think stealing the baby is going to be a bit of a-- we make our way stealthy walk i'm pretty iffy we're going to make a bunch of noise we're going to throw some dynamite we're going to get the kids to run and we're going to keep them distracted by threatening the baby yes it is a plan we will throw the sticks well we have two sticks if we run then we'll drop the sticks yeah anywhere that-- i don't want to be in the front front but i'll be in the middle you could do two spiritual weapons if you're feeling it nine i'm the only problem he's got a distance weapon anyway there's really no such thing as a bad-- i'm really at this point only useful for a couple things i'm going to keep in the back there i got my vicious mockery rolling i did okay 22 travis 20 are we going to redo the initiative flags vicious mockery vicious mockery on the manticore i don't actually know what it's rolling against what is it against my wisdom modifier i believe it's three all right that's one point of psychic damage and it has disadvantage on the next attack (rasping) you should leave and protect the child trying to-- i'm going to back up i'm backing up a little bit i'm going to step back ten feet yeah backing up yeah bonus action anything there's also another dude first one's disadvantage we're at our best when we're losing (singing) take to the sky oh man again there's not much i can do-- i'm going to step in front of caleb in an attempt to be another target and i'm going to try again with vicious mockery yeah (rasping) you are going to be buried here i hit him again four points of psychic damage first attack has disadvantage i'm going to be in front of caleb that's ten you still have movement too you could go get your sickle this is why you don't plan sam this is why we don't plan because plans go wrong are you going to go for it oh no i take it back plan disadvantage are you all right oh fuck oh my god fuck fuck fuck oh thank god fuck there is so little i can do i'm going to move forward a bit i'm going to move close enough that i can-- i'm just going to keep trying to-- put me next to caleb shite i'm just going to keep trying to give disadvantage to the first attack on the manticore 60 feet yeah it saves fuck fuck fuck fuck not even in infernal fuck fuck fuck doesn't matter never mind leave him behind oh god run how long does hideous laughter last can you also take your bonus action to run too not too good i'm going to douse the flames i'm going to run down to the priest and douse the flames
