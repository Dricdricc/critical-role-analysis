you want to see one on the 405 one day don't you they get out and they see laura and go ah it is a very disturbed fish yeah i am going to just sit at the front of the ship wet and i'm not in any of this right you keep leaving i think you might have the right idea yeah i'm just going to sit i don't know it's been a day it's hard to gauge yeah i'm going to be okay i'll get up and go down see what's down there it's probably good you didn't pull it out yeah i'm going to tap him on the head and cast healing word at 3rd-level that's 11 points right there well he'll be dead eventually i'm going to head back upstairs too real there's at least five jokes in there oh no i'm not just me enjoying a head wound hey i think it's been a day miss jester do you have a plan i did i do-- i did-- i don't know (sighs) i had a mission a holy purpose a thing that defined me and i thought that i was honoring it and now-- what if i was wrong this is not what i thought it was going to be my home is dying and i thought this was what i was supposed to do i waited for a sign and i thought you were the sign and now maybe there wasn't any sign maybe i just left and i'm on a ship in an ocean that doesn't want me here it's been so quiet and-- i always hear things what if i made a mistake and one day will be the last time what then no although dying was-- i've been hurt before and i've-- almost drowning was a lot (laugh) that was a lot and the ocean is a lot and this is a lot (deep breathing) i think i needed to hear that breathing's hard (breathing) (deep breathing) it smells really weird in here it's very salty are you hungry i'm really hungry i like cooking i think i need to cook let's go cook really i feel better that was actually really nice i'm going to go cook i live for that shit i've got plans how well stocked is this kitchen is it stocked at all okay i've got the stuff in my set as well so i'm going to just-- we're doing some shit this is on you know that spicy fruit you can buy on the side of the road we're doing spicy fruit that sounds so good right now i'm genuinely fiending for it i think we can bring the bowls up it doesn't take that long there's bowls mine mine mine good night i think i'm embracing the chaos do you have a plan i don't get it but okay that's an answer that'll do yesterday was-- oh god what's the word heavy heavy's good yeah well i've fought animals a few bandits no no that was a first is life always this directionless the one with the hair i think she's going to take off again yeah oh you know how it is some rocks don't sit right i mean yeah well my job for most of my life was to talk to people well it wasn't to talk to people it was to listen to people i've listened to a lot of people yeah it's a graveyard people come and they talk a lot yeah and you listen a lot i don't know much but i know people and i know things that aren't people there's a lot more apparently you have to i like that you're looking for something that's good well i hope we find it because then you'd get to figure out what to do next and then there'll be two of us who would be wondering i'm definitely looking out on the ocean to see if-- i'll do the double yeah yeah that's not bad 21 is that a sign that maybe we should really leave sometimes it's worth owning a mistake and i think yesterday was a big mistake well by owning it i mean stop trying to necessarily fix it and let it be a mistake and maybe just-- admit that there might be no fixing this going to have some thoughts about that flag too but that's for tomorrow is the flag going to be a problem but will they know what the flag looks like will that be part of the information that exists about the ship which is why i'm asking you and hoping you make eye contact with the game-- but the flag is it possible someone might recognize the flag i could dye it this is going to go so poorly that's an impressive roll and yet somehow there's a dick in the signature nothing like a bar with withered in the name we're going to need food and supplies so anything that you think that we might need i'll go pick that up i'll even go so far as to say good food for a month i'm going to bake some shit fuck it i also know that i can create food if i have to so i can do a lot of like base-- i do not have 300 gold what's adequate food i'll do 50 gold plus i'll up my spice to make do i am a cook i look like shaggy from the special episode of scooby doo where he's pretending to be a pirate it's been awhile i don't know sorry that was totally what i was thinking about we also make them fight and try to kill each other thank god that's how we do it at home is you raise your hand i see what you're doing and i like it i like a good ghost story maybe-- maybe they saw everybody knows the legend of the little devil girl who drowned a hundred years ago every now and then someone reports about seeing-- everyone loves a good dock tour like a haunted dock tour liam and well i like a haunted tour i've never actually been to a dock now that i think about it oh really that was all me that wasn't caduceus ugh if there's money involved job opportunity (singing) how are you i'm fine everybody else is too i want to hear you do that voice forever why do they call it the inky claw as the crow swims literally can't tell what that is i mean i guess i don't know i hadn't really thought about it i guess i don't know i'm trying to reevaluate my expectations i suppose but we have a direction we have a place to go and stories are stories i didn't really think it through i hadn't really-- i thought it would be easier to figure out a sign yeah well when you say it out loud-- i did i-- yeah yes well that's fair i hadn't really thought about that we're heading towards an island i've heard stories let's go to the island there are vegetarian options as well that's all i wanted i can die happy now perfect no please thank you i'm very proud of this family recipe completely crazy bonkers oh yeah i mean probably i don't know i mean i'm just barely attached on to this at this point but i think you're fine worst comes to worst i'll make sure you can cut and run i think i'm stuck here for a while but i'll make sure you can bugger out if you need to yeah i have no idea what just happened you didn't download the app though didn't you so you didn't hire him i'm good in my head i'm going to start probably talking to fish at some point in the near future i'll take it 15 i don't drink not at all out of idle curiosity why have you been trying to butter me up well i do and for the record i'm on board for now i'll keep your boy safe that's okay i'm not an only child i'm aware of how this works oh yeah they're somewhere i suppose it's just the temple ground that's all there is to it that's why they left yeah that was the thought no i was the last one left well i've resigned myself to the thought that it's entirely possible that someone will what kind of sign wow i thought i had you figured out never mind all right npcs before i go to sleep i'm going to politely ask any of the fish and things that are in the ocean to let us know if there's trouble up ahead if they would be so kind i'm a lunatic aren't i there's just no-- okay because i have a roll for this but i'm okay i don't know that are we doing 25 to 20 still travis and 17 there we are 17 that was exciting first thing i'm going to do is i'm going to cast-- i'm going to get myself into a reasonable position and i'm going to cast-- where did it go there it is calm emotions in theory if this is a charm spell and this counts as a charm if i'm correct you can just fail a charisma save if you'd like i'm going to use calm emotions to negate the charmed effect on nott and anybody within 20 feet of me actually anyone within 20 feet of it i'm going to run a few feet away from you i'm going to take my staff and i'm going to pull piece of silverware and bang that crystal it's going to make a dissonant sound and wakey-wakey charisma saving throw a creatures can choose to fail this saving throw if it wishes we've got work to do yeah so i'm just basically disrupting that song as long as it's within a certain range for about a minute i'm also going to use my bonus action to wake up the bugs the one that's singing i'm going to roll it towards the lollipop snack time 17 i got to fix this at some point i know we just haven't had time to fix anything that's right that's ooh 15 points of damage i don't even know what just happened yep yeah teamwork indoor kid it should be right above sure yeah there's one that's trying to get away with one of our deckhands okay i'm just going to nuts and bolts this i don't suppose my insect swarm can attack for a bonus action well then i guess i'll do a guiding bolt at level three i just saw you that i'm like ah yeah that's 19 so that's 6d6 16 points of damage i think so yeah but you also have advantage because it's got guiding bolt i don't understand anything that just-- i'm going to go down and let the crew know that everything seems to be copacetic upstairs hey everything seems to have calmed down upstairs everything seems fine i think i'm going to try blintzes for breakfast tomorrow i feel like we could all use a treat they don't know what i'm making them out of but yeah not anymore i now have the song every little piece from pete's dragon going through my head do we have an empty barrel whatever is left over if you could put in there and i'm going to start something and hopefully something-- i don't know what i'm going to get i've never tried harpy before it could be mushrooms could be anything i'm going to give it a little zing and see what i get sure i'll take that ooh that's terrible 13 i just was going to put anything that was dead now and i was just going to see if i could maybe start either-- i don't know what they're going to make but i'm curious if it's going to be anything i can either eat or use as a spice i'm using the decompose and ferment and maybe hopefully getting some mushrooms or something i don't know what harpies make we'll find out yeah if it's good i keep it if it's bad i toss it such captaining do we have a mattress or something like that do we have anything i'm going to join you and tie ourselves off and i'm going to also cast water walk if you're into it on-- i'm going to give you water walk for the moment because you're probably stronger than i am i should probably not do this you've got water walk there's a suction i'm going to run down below and-- all right fix it fix it now got to get it up i start trying to pull the barrels apart-- i'm also going to cast light in there to make it super super light is there anywhere that looks like a dock or anywhere that looks like it's appropriate to-- yeah i am i think that's right 26 how do you want to play this that's another boat are we making ourselves known or are we not making ourselves known how far away is the other boat is it possible they haven't seen us yet would it be reasonable to think they've seen us by this point all right i'm going to raise the flag the blue flag i rose it it's been risen it is risen it's tough being the smart one eh be bold you could technically stand and offer i might add since you can actually stand on water you can stand on water right now we do have his flag up though just the tip oh man we've been having that discussion about what to wear it can't be hard-- i was going to say we could also get some blue bell bottoms and some japanese school tops and fake it i don't know what video very specifically-- it's the pilot-- i know exactly what you're talking about
