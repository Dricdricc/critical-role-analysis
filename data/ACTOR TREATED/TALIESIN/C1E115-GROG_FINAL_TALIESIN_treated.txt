going to be tales from the loop with amy dallen vorpahl sax rachel gina and kelly del angelo is going to be gming and it's going to be nuts that'll be friday while we're partying at blizzcon like cards then too real not in the least none of this makes any sense these numbers seem completely arbitrary i think he might have eaten something in the back this is not normal is the baby also covered in vomit i feel like we have warned you about eating cheese before bed i grab the spear yes they didn't take it so i will take it now it's my spear i wish to examine the spear is it a special spear is it an interesting spear does it do anything does it require batteries it's a muscle reaction it's inevitable did you not take any drama classes as a child i'll go talk to the barkeep another round for everyone your finest (shouting) another round for everyone your finest to drink another round of drinks for everyone why would i do-- your finest what's your name why do i care about his name but his name is grog all right i'll admit that is quite charming bobaline i feel really is quite appropriate i don't understand how a bar runs out of alcohol after one round for five of us what's your son's name bobaline and timothy that's excellent i should write that down to make sure that you don't forget it or screw it up later this cellar has better food than your mansion 23 dex proficiency for god's sake were you never in school have you never done this before this is everything i did in school i remember this game we should try it oh shelves there's a leathery book i'm taking the leathery book my god i want to read the title there should be a title on the cover books have titles on covers it says ledger i'm going to open up the book vex why are you making a keyleth face well i've got to try this really quickly i take a sip sip sip i know you have to be very careful because there's broken glass the best kind no i rolled a four oh my we speak of this never again we should open the book though are they in a particular order using my deftness of wit can i start to put together some meaning to the numbers and words within this ledger goddamn it for a while you're imagining wrong can't tell them you're not there don't forget the pig 300 xylophone players my god you could retire on that in fact you could retire quite well on that that may have happened extremely intelligent i was assuming it was actually his hand you were manifesting like he was a large purple-- was his name bigby oh so it was an applause hand timothy is that you what strange intelligence would have gone through this hall and lit torches that were eight to ten feet off the ground that's very particular flagon sense 19 why not add ten have you been at the arts and crafts let's not look he's setting something up i'm not going to look close your eyes that looks nothing like me it's totally off this is very impressive 17 for me gently checking for traps that's not how the game works no oh no i'm going to carefully examine the floor matt's going to get his-- that mat is permanently scarred 22 initiative what we're rolling yes you roll your initiative die 16 16 i rolled very poorly yes well i'm going to back up and take a shot at this-- no away from the ghost away from the ghost a bit and i'm going to take a shot i'll just take one since it seems we're being sporting about it so i'm going to use my magical psychic shot and that's not bad that's a 24 all right well then i'm going to do that plus this and i'm also going to hit him with a bit of electricity as well ooh that's lovely that's ten points of damage plus six points of psychic damage plus four points of electricity i'm going to peruse the rest of the-- if i get too close to the tip i might experience a burning sensation from the torch 20 really all right i'm pushing on it oh this will go well pushing push it oh no that would be a-- that is indeed the lowest number you can get (lisping) i could use some assistance with this please he's going to have to cross the thingy again cavern you're not doing the voice anymore oh so this is the narrative the narrative voice is different is the dog over there by bigby's hand i think it's just a myth although i had a neighbor with a chihuahua once they're all bite-y that means something this has never happened before switch tracks my friend oh no i'm going to take a run at the first one and i'm going to throw my spear i am i pick up that tavern spear and i'm going to throw it 16 yet again a four from your hit points your hit points are your hit points i mean i would hope so i've really been excited about the spear so i'm going to run forward and throw my spear i can move 30 one two three four five six well i was going to angle out my little walk a bit to the outskirts yeah out that way more right there yeah like there and i think i can throw it-- yeah like a javelin yes why disadvantage what is my attack with the spear all right a seven then if it's plus two well fine then i'm going to just sit there and be disappointed then okay what can i do with a bonus action can i just do whatever i like i let you cook this is your mansion and my grits are best burnt makes them a little crispy look at that that's brilliant you still have another 200 to give you're welcome yeah the xb is it hard water or soft water i think is what he's asking i'm going to roll an intelligence check on that i'm inspecting scanlan's fountain ooh is this investigation intelligence all right then that's a 24 you know you can make a very nice vegan creme brulee that's a very good trinket that's very impressive what madness is this nothing happened when we opened the door are you sure you're doing it right it's designed for that it's a door i'm going to watch everyone else go through the doorway i'm going to go through once they've started to go through i'm going to make sure everything's good i rolled a 21 oh that's right we didn't go through the door this is why you never trust a door i'm curious to hear how this sensation will be narrated i was curious what kind of hardware is attaching this door to the wall is it standard brass brackets triple bracket does it have a two-way turn can you describe this can you describe me seeing it for myself there is lumber and stone that's quite nice well if you'd said that i'm letting go and i'm going through the door i don't think i can go prone i don't think i can prone let me double-check this i don't think i can there's no pwning here yep i cannot be knocked prone that's really mysterious there's a potted plant under the rug i want to take a look at the square if that's all right it could be money for me because i have it that is fair we actually both have it at this point i'm going to try my door the square what sort of five inlaid gems he may have been we don't know we've all got a grog we don't know about i want to start running towards where this commotion is did you call out yes right there i'm just going to walk up and slap him with the glove i'm just going to do a slap oh no with my fancy glove i'm going to use the fancy glove let's see where is that oh no there's actually a thing for this yeah oh yeah i have numbers 23 to hit and that's 14 points of damage and then he has to make a constitution save or he's stunned that's very very pleasing is there none on trinket is trinket-- oh god scanlan's another doppleganger quick kill him i think it was pomegranate sherbet i think all of us have to be touching one of the doors at the same time we should surround the tower yes let's all go and touch doors i'm going to touch a door well since you're already touching a door i'm going to touch the next door well then i'll go touch-- all right i'm going to go back to my square (scanlan voice) go to the triangle scanlan that's you that's what you sound like all the time your character in the game talks a bit stupid not on four i'll switch with you that's fine i do have circle glasses oh my god i've never heard that before no one has never made that joke i can't imagine i've been going my entire life i will go into my room check for traps check underneath the carpet check the desk for anything interesting and then i'm going to open my chest i will that's terrible eight i'm going to turn around and start slashing at it with my sword yes that's fair that hits yeah 21 hits yes five points of piercing damage all right i'm going to make three quick slashes with my sword oh my god two natural 20s travis and and a 21 i'm attempting to carve it into a shape so i'm going to slowly carve it into a lovely standing statuary of keyleth may she rest in peace quite nice quite fitting now i'll open my chest mimics are the worst just made of promises-- also grappled i don't know if you can actually move your hands either you're getting murdered by the touring company of aladdin can i hear any of this is there anything-- is there anything else is there anything in the ceiling is there anything on the floor i'm going to back up to the same corner that vex is in and i'm going to take a couple shots at the hatch see what happens three in quick succession two of them crit it does i just rolled six times and four times have been critical i think i'm starting to open this hatch which is in my room can everybody hear me oh i've got a hatch in my room and i've got it a bit open at this point i wonder if there's five hatches be rude that's fine so rude my hatch is a bit-- have you loosened your hatch yet union break how are you doing right now scanlan not that i know i shouldn't know is that a yummy sound i've got mine kind of open if you want to come here what does any of that mean it was like you started to say four and said five it turned into an accent mine had a mildly irritated house plant are you going to cut a rug then 150 xp for the terrible pun huzzah good to know i'll take another shot at mine hello hello mine as well i'm going to activate my spider boots and head on up there natural 20 that resembles the shape of the previous map i'm going to examine it it's probably still there i ignore them i'm not going to put my hands or feet in any of those holes don't touch it it's evil i have been waiting for gibbon versus t-rex my entire life 23 that potion was 4d4 you're going to have to kill it we have to murder and eat our opponents it's the only way out i am going to throw manners at this creature manners not mana let's see that's a ranged attack roll that's 30 to hit my target is restrained on its turn it can make a dc 20 strength check to try and get out at the moment it's restrained and while he's restrained i'm going to walk over and i'm going to burn an action surge i'm going to stab him with my sword three times and since he's restrained i think i get a bonus on that don't i let's not waste bullets on anything like this i'll take three swipes is it an auto-crit if they're restrained i have advantage okay so i'll go with that i don't actually remember that's one normal hit 25 to hit and the last one is 24 to hit so that's 36 points of piercing damage and i'm going to breathe deep i may use my bonus action to take a healing potion so much math (squawks) i don't think they make that noise but-- they are very bird-like friendship is magic could be worse i actually should be right in the face of this terrible-- i'm just going to keep stabby stabby stabby with advantage so stabby yes that hits stabby ooh that's nice that's crit-- oh it's not crit because it's not a gun it's just a sword and that's really hard to read because that's scanlan's dice my lowest number is 28 to hit 36 points of damage is he still just doing that just there i'm just going to add a little bit of extra damage on there with my hex so let's just add five points of lightning damage as well for fun 14 points of lightning damage on top of that try and mental me or anything all right i can do that intelligence saving throw that's 23 oh no he's not he's restrained i'm just going to keep stabbing him in the face over and over again i'm just going to stab him three more times three more attacks that's 21 to hit they all hit oh that's terrible 28 points of piercing damage for my bonus action i'm going to retract my little manners ball and then i'm going to walk and attempt to tap the wall to see if it's still standing i'm actually in the far corner put me behind the unicorn please all right good that's the end of my turn this is everything i've ever wanted there's a tyrannosaurus rex and a unicorn that still need to be dealt with quite proper i'm going to go take a look at that body that was sitting in the-- that's not great 14 how big is this body approximately i don't know take a look well he's unconscious i think he goes back into the necklace who betrayed this grizzly murder that is peculiar isn't it the deception was against her i think you have to roll separately for us i'm climbing up the tower a seven i mean it's just walking i regret nothing six oh yeah that whole thing 28 that hits that hits let me do this i'm still very reasonable let's do a few things we're right next to each other you get an attack of opportunity if-- actually i'm going to use the cinture of the stone king to do a shockwave of thunderous energy i'm going to cast shockwave at level five which is a dc 16 thunderwave let me find out all right then failed save is 2d8 thunder damage and is pushed ten feet away 2d8 plus five i hope i'm doing this right that's 6d8 boy this is so much math hold on sorry two four six and one more 38 points of damage and you're pushed ten feet away so there we are the next thing that's going to happen is i'm going to burn an action surge and i'm going to shoot you several times first shot oh i will there'll be plenty first shot i'm going to shoot you in the head god fucking damn it my gun jams and i take five points of psychic damage so that's funny my gun jams and i'm going to back off to the right about 30 feet for my bonus i'm going to heal a little bit and then that's the end of me here's 3d8 i thought we had an arrangement oh my god what is that behind you i turn and i run and i attack him that's 26 that's fine quick what was his son's name oh my god there's a half-conscious pike we could wake up and we're willing to do it that's amazing i have 150 xp six i've always known you that's why i will be the one to end you soy chicken but at least it's something i missed percy that was really fun you did very well it's panic-inducing back there it's a lot do you have anything taped to the screen it felt good from this end
