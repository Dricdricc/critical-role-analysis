i'll bless them laura will curse them it'll be great and i will be at amazing arizona comic con that weekend the amazing arizona comic con saturday and sunday that's crazy the internet has the best sense of humor about everything thank you that's very aerodynamic jerky it's like garlic as long as everybody's had the garlic everything's cool check the harbor maybe we don't know well that's another place to check i'm thinking of where i would go if i didn't know what to do-- that's not a bad idea either there's a lot of assumptions here what of whitestone was there any mention any-- did you learn anything of the anomaly beneath the castle that might be useful interesting thank you that was definitely what i was thinking well it's part of a plan the thought would be to actually remove it from the chamber maybe both actually but he wouldn't have known this was coming though it does open the door to some definite possibilities the timing was perfect let's go find this tunnel that we paid for what time is it when was the last time we actually took a nap and dragons don't care about night they can see perfectly fine it'll at least give everybody time to go to ground ouch i didn't know it went that low i'm sorry yes sleep and then go quick question where is the skull either you have it or i have it i don't remember was vex okay excellent i have a perfectly reasonable hiding place or if you like you can take it excellent that will do not half of what's missing but-- i'm ready with a flair right there with you how do you do that red panda that's cool you have your map stealthy 39 wait 29 sorry i forgot you can do that thieves can't speak ooh my thetan level's at 16 right now well if we're heading that way anyway we stop by gilmore's and we do need to check in with the clasp anyway they're going to be helpful that's true we can save that for an emergency he's played some assassin's creed it's a band they're very good i pull out my gun you heard the man this is everything i wanted this is going to feel really good we literally just walked to where we were going he lead us precisely where we wanted to go there's nothing clever about that trap i suppose we'd be hanging back a bit well you got up in their face so you're-- i was hanging back a bit gart-garthluk garthok garthok i'm close i'm getting it garthok 25 all right i'm going to hex the one that she hunter's marked and i'm going to-- where am i oh there i am i'm going to run towards that other wall to the left yep all the while taking a few shots at that bastard who i just hexed oh and sharpshooter shots because that's funnier so that's ugh-- yeah so that's not-- that's 14 to hit should i just roll all three shots that's 20 that hits and 18 that hits oh yeah that's ten 26 27 points 26 points plus one necrotic that's on the other end of things irony 17 points plus six necrotic and for my final roll 17 18 19 20 25 points plus six necrotic i move my hex to the next guy and point at him as i'm running my armor class is 18 i was about to say can i take that first 18 and make it-- nah you know what i'll take the hit never mind okay fire damage is that crossbow asshole still standing the guy who just laughed at our little gnome okay i've just noticed that my guy was going to hit me and then started acting weird so taking a second to look around i'm going to see that little laugh with the crossbow coming up and indiana jones that shit i'm putting my hex on him first sharpshooter shot to that guy i'm not going to hit pike out of curiosity i'm trying to remember what's my fuck-up number my misfire number for that gun yeah it's higher than one i thought i did oh okay thank you i was just checking because i could've just rolled really poorly ten all right i'm taking another-- oh so i'm going to roll it again i don't know what happened okay ten so that-- i know so now i'm going to reload and fire again i have advantage though right oh oh yay yeah that hit then that hits this is such a confused gun okay that's not bad that's 20 plus five necrotic and i'm going to start walking my way towards keyleth's special friend yeah about there i'm not running i'm walking make him shave i know nobody calls him the gangster of love that's dark that's dark bow tie him in a little bow we're glad you came here we're trying to collect people at our keep we were hard to find it's the beginning of something something to start thinking about i propose a plan let's get them back to the secret passage i think we should-- [no audio] so we have a group of people who are well-organized with everything to gain by this dragon leaving they're ready they're prepared they're probably more prepared than anybody else would be and they might be willing to help us they have tunnels they have men they have spies they have everything we need please tell me if i'm wrong here they might be the friends that we need at this moment so a small group goes and gets the gold and the rest of us get gilmore and the family to the secret passage i would agree with getting the gold she's got a point i'll come-- wait no i should probably go we've got you yeah we wanted to get the family and gilmore back to the keep first let's hold that off this was my thought is we take everybody who's down here we get them back to the castle in the meantime-- keep in the meantime you get the treasure once the treasure is gotten and they're back in the keep we get together and find the clasp 31 and we grab him no one's noticing us at this point there's too much going on let the kids ride trinket we don't know whose they are yeah we'll put them up i can sleep in my workshop sorry you can watch a bunch of music videos too and maybe see some of us
