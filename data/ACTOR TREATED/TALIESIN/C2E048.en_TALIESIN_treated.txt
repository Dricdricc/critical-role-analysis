you're giving people a peek behind the curtain right now i know fair thank you next sure i'll go for my standard shaggy red-headed mess who are you my god what happened to beau baller move i've had a thing i've been wanting to do for a while and i figure now is possibly the time to take care of this i want to find a blacksmith well it's not often that i have a pet project i haven't had one in a while and that was the way i used to keep myself excited and busy back when i was home so i've got a pet project it's been a while i pull out the broken sword hilt that i have i'd love to see about getting this fixed maybe as a token of appreciation for mr fjord for doing such a good job taking care of himself on his own quest and not getting sidelined into some bad thoughts i also don't know how to find a blacksmith metal box i don't know i've never had a metal box before what do you do with it oh we're getting so afar you just mimed a metal box that's amazing you're very talented there's a joke in there if the people looking for a bookstore find a blacksmith they can send a little message and if the people looking for a blacksmith find a bookshop i assume we should buy everything we see yes i was looking to have a sword repaired a very unusual sword uthudurnian no that's good to know would you know of anyone who could point us in the right direction or would we have to probably venture that direction north of the empire well now that's barely two-and-a-half three feet i mean what's the scale on that it's like one-half scale double wow we may be sitting on this for a little while that's good to know thank you friend thank you here's a couple coin for your trouble anyway i throw three gold at him you would call that the beau bo would be beau's bo you could put a bow on the bo on beau's bo you too as well that's interesting we have to take care of that at some point great nicodranas bake off we'll meet you there and maybe talk about tomorrow's thing i think we're probably going to want to take a look at that tower while we're in town i said it anyway (laughter) i'm so excited for our next campaign you've already created a backstory for your next character little boy with a knife he flew the coop that was bad i don't feel good about that yeah no if we're all here two rooms ought to cover it for us how long are we going to be-- maybe just a couple nights maybe at best there's a few things we should do in town before we head-- i would definitely prefer to wait as well i'm a fan of taking a minute to take a look around and have a plan probably not probably it wore off if anything you're mocking her anything interesting on the wall just for fun detect magic anything sparkly that's fair anything behind the counter look particularly interesting yeah i mean-- as long as i can-- i'm not going to break a rule or anything but yeah all right i'll chip in for this yeah i mean we should distribute them to other people i'll chip in for-- how many do we have now three basic healing potions i'll chip in for one miss sheila i had a question i was curious about any magical items you might have for sale i got a vibe that you might have something here that might be interesting do you have anything that's not for sale that's just for show is that a yes or no on the-- what is casing that's nonsense we're very likeable is there something in your eyes do you have a problem i can-- this is why you did the talking have a nice day finally calmed down everything's fine this is a holdup empty your wallets i don't even (laughter) am i there i was trying to remember if we'd split for the two-- i do have a magic tree i drop it on the ground and a 60-foot tree immediately appears yep it's a five foot thick tall tree while he does that i'm going to just walk the tower with my hand on the tower and see if i feel any change at all we were hoping to make an appointment with-- is it possible to maybe move that up into a very quick emergency meeting we have to leave town and will not back for quite a while it's time sensitive i have genuine questions for this person for the things i want okay i'm boasting a little deception right all right that's fair eight does the blooming grove mean anything with an axe in your hand going who are you to be fair you probably haven't had meat in quite a while because i haven't been cooking it yep really yep i don't know i liked it ride it i approve of this this is great i think also since you seem to be leaning towards honesty i'm always a big fan of honesty being the best way to approach these or as much of the truth as is possible at any moment i'm always happier to omit than lie if we have to lying's weird huh i don't know what that means but i agree too much has been happening here potion i bought is for caleb so caleb gets the healing potion we're going to the tower tomorrow i have some legitimate questions about things that i am curious about and we do actually own some objects that maybe we should have a learned man take a look at mine is yeah there seems to be a lot of weird things happening you can be a lot lower we were hoping for an audience if you have time this morning we came by yesterday and we were told it might be best to come back in the morning we brought tea yes he said to come back in the morning we don't have earl grey i don't think we don't i'm a fine tea-maker we feel a bit exposed i would admit mr deep lore i'm going to pull a pouch of my better tea and i'm not really sure what to do with it have you ever heard of the blooming grove this tea is made from a flower that only grows there in the north from one of the original families it's very rare you're making a big assumption that word can leave sam and let's not it's either probably you or me i suppose i don't know let's get all the things we might want to show him together really quickly i want the dodecahedron we'll talk about it we have the-- do you trust me okay you keep it but-- yes please yes please and i may with your permission mention what we have thank you only if it leads to something better try and be good i feel like between beau and i we cover everything very well no i don't need it no we're going in brewed or unbrewed just ready to be brewed i'm going to check to see if there's tea brewed and if there isn't i'll brew tea i will brew some tea the tea is indeed ready stick to what we know for now thank you i'll leave some extra for later that family was one of the first four-- i think it may have been the graves actually which is ironic the more i think about it each tea is made mystically from a family that is buried within our graveyard i didn't i was told-- there are a lot of strange things all happening in congruence start with the least interesting and work your way up i suppose i actually have it if i recall i grabbed it from you i'm going to put it on the table odd things keep stumbling upon us things that should not be things are becoming misplaced that should not be misplaced i feel like that fact that we have this means that a powerful magic user is no longer available people of great power going missing and getting attacked the tower all these things apparently if i recall is no longer with us now there's more i'm going to show the sword just because this is odd and there was also-- the grove is dying i don't know perhaps i asked the wildmother for guidance and it brought me to this that certainly sparks my interest yes do you know anything of its sister temples of whether they hold or not if there is no reason for this magic to be diminishing it's very odd why would it be diminishing that would be odd in itself the last thing-- well i don't know i'm not going to say it because you're the smart one but i think perhaps it is worth mentioning the thing you saw when the tower fell the thing that was being ferretted the thing you saw i don't know how to best describe it i think that would be a longer conversation for when you have time if you feel like investing in what we're doing and how we're moving about the world we need people who are better than ourselves to the wildmother she has allegiances to us as i've spent some time with these people they are people of the world but i've found ms beau and the rest of them to be loyal to each other which i find to be a very admirable trait ms beau is not as used to speaking plainly as some of us are it's okay one of your better attributes is your ability to talk around something we need friends we need assurances we would like to know that you are a good and trustworthy person and we would respectfully like to trade perhaps some information and have a friendly face on the coast we would be most grateful for yes the others do not know i believe how things may change soon and i think it would be good and i think they're going to turn well i think they're going to turn out very well but i think it would be good to have the right people in the corner when it is time information for the moment about the things in our possession powers that we are tapping into the people we may come across our host is aware of our positions and otherwise i would ask that everyone try and be respectful of the space try not to break anything steal anything or otherwise try not to i stood up and waved everybody in oh and i'm caduceus again it's a pleasure i would ask just so that it doesn't get me into trouble with my compatriots that i convinced that honesty and forthrightness was the best policy-- i was hoping for perhaps a trade so that they felt that they got something back in return it doesn't have to obviously be so dangerous if you have something that at least they can feel like they can hold something in the meantime i'm by the way already putting the ball on the table and leaving it by the tea tray as we have this discussion i have definitely moved it to the center of the room we can let you know what we saw inside did we ever get confirmation on the owner's death or did we not that we-- i think we feel also would be something that we would be interested in doing once we feel even more comfortable with this arrangement and once trust is built obviously you are so much more powerful than we are that it would behoove us to be a little careful i mean really he probably could i have a-- would it be possible to get an assurance that we could leave this place with it and that no harm would come to us it does i'm willing to take a certain person at their word no matter what also we would appreciate it if you would not speak of who owns this artifact with anyone if you have to discuss the artifact that's one thing but we would prefer us to be anonymous it's a dangerous world and it would show great trust bring more the next time i go home if there's a home to go to it's time to trust somebody it's the iron safe and then-- yeah i got banishment on hold just in case that's very good to know i hope that now that you understand how much we appreciate your gesture of trust and how much-- jester of trust and how much we are putting our faith that you are on the side of good and right if-- that'll do we would appreciate any information that you may glean about this uk'otoa traveler the blooming grove i am of the belief that these things are connected that these chaotic forces are moving towards something unsettling and unbalancing i saved you a biscuit a lobster biscuit that a thing lobster biscuit is a thing he said we were foolish he said we were foolish i don't believe you it's true we are lucky we're not dead but we are also lucky that going forward we're going to get you access to learn more and to grow in an avenue you didn't have open to you before i think he's going to be a-- if he isn't the death of us i think he's going to be a good ally but something's going to be the death of us and it's better just to trust a few people we didn't bullshit i will actually-- i watched beau tell the truth it was very impressive you're not very good at it but it was very impressive yeah i could tell you were struggling you were honest without oversharing we're going to need a day to get ourselves together anyway we don't have-- we're going to have to put everything together so why don't you just-- why don't you just spend some time with your family and we'll get the cart together and get the supplies together-- set off you made a good call oh that's-- no yeah that's the-- okay why are you saying hyah yeah i've got them right here but-- roll for initiative well it ought to be on a day that-- you should use the mote no this is the invisible cart but we told them how it worked last time and we'll do the same thing this time oh yeah it's to ward off bandits makes it a little easier to-- feel free though it's just an illusion on the cart on a fast one i want to take a moment on the first night also to let fjord know i just want to let you know that while we're on the sea i had a talk with my goddess and that friend of yours is still out there yeah that old friend of yours that you haven't seen in a while what's his name yeah that's the one i asked the wildmother i feel like i would be speaking to things i didn't necessarily know about i don't entirely know the traveler nor entirely understand what the traveler is but i know the wildmother yeah making amends whatever that means one way or another it's a very particular flavor of goodness that come from those who are offered so much temptation i have some faith in you back to the horses what oh god this is everything i liked about both those characters happening all at once it was amazing just amazing is gustav still in the town or has he left town just out of idle curiosity just while we're there mm-hmm 14 that'll do greatest show on earth cool they stole whatever it was they were trying to steal i guess hi by the way good to see you again actually would a letter of good note get us any further in case we run into anybody i don't know it's worth asking i suppose be safe hyah let's go guys the horses are going to go if i ask them to-- yeah thank you aww that's so nice aww that's so exciting wow it never even occurred to me that you get a book about cooking that's so great yeah the illustrations are amazing yeah oh this is cool aww thank you i'm going to do my best to make it through this mushroom cookbook i've often wondered i'll human up for a second you've got a lot of reading to do this weekend fuck man percy's in my head dissecting that title so hard right now i can't though i don't know as long as you're in the back they can't see we're moving on anyway i'm going to do a general look around to see if i can get a sign of life coming from anywhere in the rubble lighting it up in here huh you know what that makes me think of i mean that seems-- that's weird i figured you would know because i'm guessing well what's your opinion that's way better than mine never mind i was thinking that maybe there was an invisible person tied to the chair i really appreciate that i was a little spooked you're tearing me apart no hidden ones nothing yeah i'll help that chest it's probably trapped we should be very careful later somewhere else somewhere else anything else in the chest is there any way to cover our tracks here i got that come on i'm going to pick up caleb you're not at fault here you're the solution here you know that right we're here to fix this don't let her anger-- it's not about you this is not about you can we re-lock the chest i think we should try and lock everything up and maybe break the chair right now i want to try and-- there's no way to-- actually i'm going to try and lock the chest again when we leave i'm going to use-- not magically obviously but thaumaturgy to close it and lock it or will that not work with thaumaturgy let's have this conversation elsewhere this place is creeping me out i think we're-- i think we should-- we need to go now i have cleaned it up i have beetles they eat things we took everything we're going lock it as well sure let's get away from here lead the way we're going to move the cart you need to not panic not right around here no cart i don't want the cart parked in front of the creepy rubble house i'm going to move it we're going to get in the cart and move now i was looking forward to a shopping episode this was really good this was good guys yeah no this was nice and gentle i was waiting for the riegel shoe to drop man (laughter) hey we're going to use a chair that's so exciting wow dude wow as beau might say wow wow liam and (shouting) wow
