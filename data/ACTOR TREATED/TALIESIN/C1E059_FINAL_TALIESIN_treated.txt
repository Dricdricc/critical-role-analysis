boy and little chiko i'm going to put it on my head most useful alchemist ever we may be miming something while the picture's up and that'll be exclusive content trust scanlan it's that extra inch that makes all the difference oh cool opening credits [dramatic music] this is fantastic oh it's everything i could have hoped for well is there any sign of any bit of civilization or construction oh lord ah yay 26 i think i see a thing i'm heading in that direction we are already going wait don't touch don't touch we're going to head towards the stone can i add into that too i learned elven i was a bit of a nerd oh yeah i'm aware my head's full of bullshit too now don't touch we'll stay 11 paces away and a 12 and we're keeping about 11 feet so at least inner corner or outer corner go ahead i'm going to sit and quietly sketch for a moment i'm taking everything down it may or may not be so there's no carvings that i can see on this outer wall nothing and the vines that are climbing on it are they flowering anything at all be very careful nothing here is exactly what it appears to be oh i wouldn't do that i'm trying to very gently back her up i bow and i push her down natural one hello oh dear we're going to have to find her no i think she blinded me no she blinded me yes i'm blinded i'm blind one (laughter) i'm going to curl up in a little ball for a minute and rock i'm going to take out my dragonslayer longsword and stand up and start using it as a cane find my way to grog and poke him with it better that's 18 just a tap going to give it a good little whack oh i'm sorry it's so hard to see i'll take them off and put them in my pocket no i've got a thing it'll be all right actually if you don't mind can i borrow a bear yes i'm willing to try and make this work for a moment do you mind i'm going to try and hop on top i'm going to make a leap to get on top of the bear which direction was this pool i'll go with you trinket i think it's probably mystical or what passes for west like don't pick the flowers i'm sorry were you talking to me i'm a bit useless at the moment you know i know what you're doing right now thank you i'm still angry with you but thank you i put the pistol slowly in the direction of his voice my lady i do appreciate your gift and i do apologize for my friend and for startling you earlier it is my deepest regret that i cannot take in the majesty of your realm for the moment does she go for the wet willie are you trying to give me a wet willie i use missile snare still angry at you missile snare with disadvantage okay 26 my kung-fu is far stronger than yours i have dreamed about coming here since i was a little child i'm going to see this i'm on a bear you're all wearing your earrings it's dangerous as it is but-- be a shame if your broom breaks i'm just reminding the dear what side her bread is buttered on wow okay what am i a reckless human so when i say you shouldn't probably touch anything there's probably a really good reason right i'll have my revenge but i love you oh yes much better hi it's so good to see you (yelps) i'll make you a deal come here 11 now we're even good maybe we're in the dusklands well not necessarily it could be that we are either stuck in a loop or that we simply in an area of the feywild that is eternal dusk so we have to pass a dusk at least it could no but you might as well nothing's safe critters everywhere and if we don't then we know that there's a problem and remember in theory from what little i know the prettier it is the more dangerous it probably is and the older it is the more dangerous it probably is i'm going to sit backwards on the bear while we move forward it occurs to me i don't actually have to ride the bear anymore she's done me up i'm imagining the genie bottle that you saw vex do you feel like getting a little bit of a bird's-eye view really quickly perhaps we can't there's no trees i'm feeling pretty confident about this i'm not having a lot of stress about this until it's time that we all think it's time to take a rest and we'll take a nap it's a party we press on until it's time to rest i say we camp here i think it's a lovely idea it suits you it's lovely i'm going to use my optics to try and sketch what i can of the city for the moment and get a general idea of it sitting down and starting to get an idea of it don't try and super saiyan me oh not quite i love this place i do quite a bit let's see your work i'm going to very gently put my hand on the book and take it may i i've been taking notes myself do we have that hunk of-- not that that's going to help here is the book safe to open i'm asking is it safe to open for me what's at the bookmark may i ask and i slowly start to open it at the bookmark i'm gently opening it he's brilliant he captured everything i turn it i'm going to start gently flipping through some of the pages like six flags magic mountain caricature vibe this is an awfully expensive book to be this shitty in i'm going much earlier in the book to see what's there dinner and to sweeten the offer after you've had dinner with us and we send you on your way perhaps we will consider giving you your book back perhaps give me the bits shocking otters let's have some food let's put two guards on him 20 guards that's a lot of guards there's tables i understand honest opinion what is the disposition of the people in that city over on the hill you can be frank we're not from around here you can't offend us with your opinion of them they have an army building up why is that you just pinch small things though like little gold trinkets this is not really a talent of yours is it flip flip flip let us add an addendum then if we are going to steal things from you you will not only take us to the bog-- are we killing people no this is interesting 17 interesting i've got an idea we broke your ocarina correct why don't i try and fix the ocarina we give him his book back we take a couple things from those people and get on our way we could just get on our way no let's make the deal and get this moving this is a place where deals happen let's do it we agree to the deal we present it and then we're there it's kismet in my opinion we're in the feywild we're going to make a deal with something this is what the feywild is i want to go there too i can't wait give me your ocarina let me see if i can get to work on it you can help with a mending spell so i'm going to attempt to glue it together and then i'm going to need something to hold the whole thing together while the glue sets that was a natural 20 your instrument sir it's quite nice no he hasn't every time i've seen anything attractive and naked it's gone very poorly today i'm walking away i'm going to start gathering the servants to pick the boy up and put him in his room everything would disappear anyway i make sure everything's fine i will leave him his book lock the door and head up to my room and lock the door behind me as well a week is it what i think it is okay goddamn it and as i'm going to bed or as i wake up okay fuck no you don't know anything yet i'm not quite going to go to sleep yet i'm going to go see who else is still awake the little fucker charmed me i don't know what we can do we made a bloody deal with him well no we can't really (sputtering) i don't know exactly how it works it's just in any book you read about the feywild you make a deal and it's a deal and you have to deal with it i don't think that would work maybe probably you would look lovely in eyeliner it was inevitable could be right now i'm going to have to tell the others in the morning i'm going to go see if anybody else is awake oh god sleep well oh you're reading never mind don't sleep no finish your bloody book vex little shit put a charm on me i felt it wear off about 45 minutes ago yes well i-- well at least we know that he definitely can't be trusted i know we've got to make sure that pike doesn't give him back his whistle just yet he was so nice he was just so nice i did it's sadly what i knew was he's a little shit i just didn't know until about half an hour ago i hate magic in what sense yes does she look like she comes from money (laughs) honestly dear you're too happy to look like you come from money no it's a sure sign of it is an abject misery believe me i can speak to it you look too much like you and you don't look enough like something you're supposed to be if you feel the urge to deeply bullshit i'd be happy to help you it's not hard no it is easy to pretend you come from money you just have to be a bit of a shit and wear what everybody else is wearing does this have something to do with that city it does doesn't it who's there (sighs) well oh i disagree dear i think that if you're worried about them knowing whether or not you've made your money and made your fortune-- i don't think that's going to be the thing to earn their respect i think you're better off a with the company that you keep and b with the fact that you're probably just better than most of them i've known a lot of people with money and they are definitely not worth you and besides if they have something nice that makes you feel inferior we can just take it well and then they're just shit without anything and then you're you with their stuff you're welcome i know it doesn't really help yes and the outfit works don't change it keep the hat good night sleep well i'm sorry for my part in it charming no that is awful i sit down right in front and across the table i like it no not yet not yet just so all cards are on the table we know that we agreed to a deal last night despite your charm spell on me which was-- fair play well the deal stands as it is at the moment i suppose yeah no he charmed me he put a charm on me last night well a little late friend i applaud your cleverness i am excited by this deal and i want to let you know that god forbid something comes up where i come from the world i come from i am possibly the worst person you have ever met and i think i hope not necessarily to hurt you or harm you but i hope that one day you can know just how awful i can be 17 let's hope i love the art piece actually since we're on the subject have you ever drawn yourself before i'd be curious to see one of your self portraits are they in the book i didn't think so self-reflection is not one of my favorite pastimes either anyway what are you looking for in the city where did what bless the small print i think it's just a deal i think deals may be a big deal here i don't know i think if it comes to it it's a possibility that's a thing you're clever i'm sure you'll be fine i think it's time to make our way in can't believe i wasted a natural 20 on his-- sorry i'm good it's from the mansion so it'll stay in the mansion we do have nice cloaks we could wear am i still made of wood by the way it's raining it's not like hawaii rain it's rain i would assume it's not chilly but cold oh yes i've read things about those that's just a thing just read it interesting i wouldn't expect one i am so excited
