really blitzed on that stuff it was pretty fun let's just start on grain alcohol also that was a good call on my part i got some shit to do people pew pew we're making our way there is everybody okay by the way do we have every-- oh god i'm going to cast turn undead dc on turn undead let me find it again-- spell dc is 16 all right let's-- i'm going to start a ten minute-- at some point there's going to be a healing spell does anybody not need healing oh i'm getting in on this that was what i've been doing a prayer of healing all right so i'm doing everybody except nott and i'm adding algar to this that's 14 points to everybody 14 what were you doing down here what is your job exactly especially i imagine if they start looking into everything you did with that kind of power i mean having access to that kind of creature i can't imagine that you were on the up-and-up about everything you did people have got to have to start asking questions serious questions i'm going to pick up the severed hand and start casting decompose on it too they're over-investing in genie-based power systems i'm going to grab the ink too go ahead no i'm looking for anywhere where there might be a secret stash or something that looks off-kilter or a little odd in here somewhere where he might be hiding something six no that seems nice no you let him live that's really nice oh god i turn undead yes it's turn undead i'm not quite at the pop-it it's too strong for me to pop right well i have a thought what if he accidentally lost control of the creature and then ran-- ah turn undead (laughter) i might be out i was about to say-- don't i have-- i might be out oh yeah no i'm out thank you maybe he ran away because doesn't want to be held accountable for his actions he strikes me as the sort of person who doesn't want to be held responsible-- that might be his attempt to say i did this i'm sorry bye kind of thing well they're not there are people dead down there oh god sacred flame three points i like that just takes responsibility for everything that happened down there oh that's fair too that's very fair yeah i'm impressed by the dicks actually with his dagger oh he had a quill didn't he i think i should go get the boat i'm going to head towards where we anchored the boat i'm going to cast calm emotions on myself and go swim to the boat it's no problem i think i've had enough ocean for a while that was-- have a good day i'll admit i'm a little tired that was a lot i'm going to pull one of the beetles out of my staff and say professor you want a snack i hold it up yeah 12 mm-hmm we can get you a tree costume you'll fit right in i'll do that that's a 26 hmm i mean it's pretty quiet other than that guy hiding over there by the shipping crates there's really nothing to see it's really dark i don't know other than that there's nothing really happening are we playing darts that's really useful information yeah i wonder how much he paid to bribe the guard huh well that's a thing you guys see that i think something's happening they look like pirates yeah it's as if he knew that this would go horribly wrong all worth it now this is so badass were we down over there or-- do we have an ipad for that i will roll (shouting) no no you roll for laura because i shouldn't three i was about to say we don't have her ipad this is going great that's 90 nautical feet there's more of them oh boy that is a lot happening all right let's-- yeah this'll be fun that's all taken care of i'm going to cast a-- guiding bolt i guess towards the guy standing next to-- the guy standing next to marius first level yeah that's a-- what is the ranged attack on that yeah no it's very far just a ranged attack 23 to hit 25 i'm at 51 hit points i'm fine oh yeah so that's-- where is that 4d6 okay ooh 15 points of damage thank you i'm going to vanish i can do that i believe so i'm double-checking i can do hidden step as a bonus action i'm going to move off in that direction if that's okay let's go full movement 25 30 i'm within 30 feet of-- none of them i've got to be them not fjord right okay never mind i'll double-check suffers a critical hit everyone has to pull their weight man there's so many things that could be going horribly wrong right now yeah i'm going to throw a healing word at beau and i'm going to start getting out of here i want to cast healing word it's not a lot no it's 60 feet that's nice it's eight points yeah i'm going to start booking out of here i'm heading back around the way i assume everyone else is going yeah that way guys we're going to have problems soon we should probably get out of here oh no that's right i'm not there yet it's a shame they never roll that way when they're attacking oh that's mean you've got me too i'm still spelled up to all hell whoa he'll save every one of us i'm going to ponder i'm going to make the sound of a bunch of people panicking and saying hide everything hide everything with thaumaturgy no i thought you can create an instantaneous sound that originates from a point of your choice within range that's fair that's fair it is listed i'm going to make one of the doors on that boat over there slam shut really loudly i'm going to run and hide behind the map i'm going off the map around there yep i'm going to just be going-- that'll just be 30 feet and i'm not running i'm walking am i going to be the only survivor in this this'll be funny i'm going to cast disguise self i'm going to look like a-- i seem to recall-- i'm going to make a composite of the most pirate-y-- i've decided everyone who's on a boat is a pirate so i'm going to make the most pirate-y drunken old man i possibly can i'm going to give myself a big white beard crazy hair very unthreatening buggy eyes i'm going to continue to circle around the-- i'm figuring i'm going to have to find you guys at some point but yeah this is it's the only way i know how to get to the water so i don't have a better way around-- unless there's a window unless there's an open passage on the back of one of those houses oh no that's too-- that's the best i got right now aw man this is a disaster no although they haven't technically attacked oh no no there's another guy a wacky waver freestyle i'm going to npc my ass right across the street i'm going to see if i can take my action and keep going quietly oh no i'm not going that-- i'm going to go behind those i'm getting in the water yeah i'm getting in the water yeah i'm going to gently get in yeah i'm sitting in oh is it a ten-foot drop all right i am very tiny looking right now come on oh my god that was almost terrible nine there's a lot happening i'm going to slowly start making my way underneath everything quietly and with-- yeah does she know boats why would you say that out loud what's wrong with you that's pretty good i'm swimming full speed directly out into the ocean oh yeah no i'm not having a good-- --this is not going well for me i'm not a happy camper no and i assume that there's some kind of light on the-- would i have noticed that before swimming 30 feet out this could not be more fucked little help here i'm not doing a voice not having a good day do i have a bonus action i'm going to do a healing word on fjord before i start doing another-- yeah before i start doing another prayer i'm going to cast healing word on fjord really quickly so that's seven points of hit points i'm sitting and starting a prayer of healing oh yeah that or the ac of wood from it wasn't my intention by this point by the way everyone has 16 hit points added to their-- a ship a dog an owl a ferret wow i want to say it so bad i'm not going to say it oh man that was a lot that's fair
