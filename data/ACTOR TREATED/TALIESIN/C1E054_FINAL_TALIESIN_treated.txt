i think i hit my microphone where am i right now i'm in my hotel room somewhere-- which island are we on oahu we're on oahu for amazing comic-con i have a thought i have a thought in that direction when we're ready i was thinking of basically building what is essentially a giant pressurized mousetrap do i have access to some people to help build it and some perhaps broken homes and chunks of wood and chain this would be a blacksmith just to make a couple springs this is not a complicated-- this is literally something you could make in the woods it's a slightly more complex version of something you could make in the woods to catch birds i'm just building a really big version it's a whole bunch of systems like this that will have chains and weights on them that when you disrupt the weight at the center the whole thing goes clunk throws a whole bunch of-- it's basically a netting system it's an entanglement and will be an entanglement thank god yeah no not very good i rolled a six laura and yes okay i'm just going to take them and i'm going to start building one and see if they can follow suit then three springs will be more than enough for this design i would say how tall is this dragon about a two-to-three-foot spring then three two-to-three-foot springs made of solid iron just enough to lift the system and toss and it's just you make them like chainmail it's a process that exists i'm not going nuts that'll be perfect that'll do yeah yes hello bit busy what oh yes this is quite a project ah that's my hope is to be honestly as far away from this as humanly possible oh the dragonslayer longsword yes of course of course i pull it off my belt and hand it off could help i'm a little terrified that you're getting that close to it but here it is it's quite a piece thank you i am down to my normal sword now hi yes i don't recall this person was i oh yes no he was quite lovely i can't even see you guys are you like hi that's intelligence modifier plus proficiency bonus plus tinkering yeah 24 (cheering) oh yeah baby 22 that's 23 yeah it's the dexterity right so yeah that's right 23 okay what does a point of exhaustion do just double-checking because i have no brain currently dice roll dex modifier proficiency bonus just because i have no brain dex modifier proficiency bonus dice roll okay good like a tron lightbike in theory it has to be laid down underneath all the treasure so that it just is nothing and then we put everything on top and then basically it's set and then pins get pulled so that it's set and you don't disturb shit again yes let's do that gentlemen let's move it good work ladies and gentlemen in theory he should be able to fit right at the sides of it because it's got an armature spring system as long as you're not in the way of the armatures you should be fine the trigger mechanism is any weight shift it's the same as a mousetrap it's like you put pressure on it you take pressure off of it doesn't matter as long as there's immediate weight shift in the platform where the booty is it just goes snap as long as i'm within range for my guns i'm going to hide way off in the treeline in theory if the trap is sprung it'll make enough ruckus that anyone in those trenches should hear it no wait this longsword was being used as a finesse weapon we had this discussion at one point we decided that this longsword was a finesse weapon or it could be used as a finesse weapon aloha there's a beautiful view out this window this happened when we were doing sword tricks we were discussing whether or not i could actually use a sword and what that would be like because we were having the conversation about whether you should take strength with the sword i've obviously been using it as a dex-based sword but-- i don't remember if that was specifically for me or-- what do your boots of haste do and what does your cloak do out of curiosity i could definitely if you could take the haste potion then i might take the boots because speed would not be a terrible thing for me to have because then i get to shoot more what does the cloak do again 19 okay i'm going to cast hex on the dragon with a disadvantage to all strength checks i'm going to hold my turn until the dragon's turn i'm going to hold until it does something and if it does nothing i'm taking my attacks and if it gets away i'm taking my attacks i'm just taking my attacks after him oh no that's my turn now i'm going to take just a standard shot with bad news ooh 28 to hit 18 points of damage with four necrotic 18 points of damage and i'll take another shot with bad news 20 to hit all right all right turn's up holding my action until its action with disadvantage can i take my action i'm taking a shot at him at the joint at his wing and i'm going to attempt to ground him natural fucking 20 (cheering) photo taken ha natural 20 it still doesn't necessarily mean he's grounded it means he has to make a strength saving throw or he's prone roll damage oh yeah that's double dice so that's-- 23 points doubled is 46 plus-- 46 yeah plus the modifier now is 52 points of damage total i rolled really well wait i was going to pop off a couple more shots i was going to blow an action surge okay no it's okay go ahead an extra 3d6 not just 3d6 okay my first shot taking a wing shot that's 20 that does not hit all right that's one grit taking another shot that hits 30 15 points of damage and he has to make a strength saving throw dc is 19 it succeeds on the 19 okay i'm going to burn an action surge to take a third shot 21 does not hit yeah and then i'm going to just hide behind that tree and wait for my next round isn't he having plummeting issues if he's not moving okay no i'm good all right i'm taking two shots that's all i got left here we go 23 ah hm ah okay that's eee (broken audio) 20 24 points of damage six of which are necrotic i'm taking my second shot reload fire fuck my life that's m--(audio glitches) putting it away pulling out the other gun that's the end of my turn this is chaos i will see you guys later i can't hear anything
