i got something next weekend september 26 and 27 i'm going to be at a con in anchorage alaska that means moose i'm so excited senshi con in anchorage i'll be there i know we at least have like three fans at the very least in alaska come on by i'd love to see you it'll be awesome with more of us than are even here i'm terrified personally but-- you were right it is awful no we shouldn't tell them that we have kit here let's hold that back i've been curious precisely how long the lag is because-- i feel like we have do we have an address address do we have that it's up and in the chat the bag of disagreeable dice dagger dagger hug traditionally the head of the house does dispense out the stipends anyway that would be appropriate i'm not even in the room am i never mind sorry i'm a bit busy i am making more ammo i'm working on a few projects that have been rolling around in my head for quite some time now the bolt is on the list yes i've got a lot to do how many of you are down here right now grog don't touch that ugh i know you're right (sighs) a bit i've never had to say this out loud before i've never actually had this discussion with anyone do i get an inspiration die for that the briarwoods lord and lady briarwood are responsible for the death of my entire family whitestone was my home many years ago-- i don't want to get into the details i came from a big family i came from a proud family one night they were invited into our home and over the course of that night they slaughtered everybody they are evil they are corrupting the few survivors of castle whitestone who did survive only survived through deceit and by working for the briarwoods turning on their masters thankfully the de rolo family still has standing elsewhere and there's other branches of the family other than my father's (sighs) i was lost for quite a while after that happened i had nothing else in my life other than my family i was never really going to inherit anything i was not going to run anything i was idle and at some point i made the decision that if nothing else i survived to maybe extract some vengeance maybe set something right maybe stop whatever it was that they were doing i don't know there was one of their party dr ripley she was in charge of something during the murder i don't know what i chased her i chased her down it took a year and i had my gun and i discovered where she was and where she was working on some ruins and i approached her i never even saw her face her guards captured me beat me up didn't even bother taking my things they just threw me in that dungeon i never even got close enough to see her face i saw her when she was interrogating me in my home oh yes my sister cassandra my younger sister she somehow evaded capture i don't know how she set me free i don't know what became of her i don't know what became of any of my siblings probably nothing reasonable nothing good i saw bodies of a few of them it's all a bit shady it's all a bit of a blur (sighs) four now five now i don't know (sighs) i could have gone home i could have gone home at any point at this point i'm scared i discovered approximately a week ago that they're still at whitestone i don't know (sighs) i don't know what to do i'm preparing for anything when i got thrown into that dungeon i came to the realization that maybe i wasn't doing this the right way i wasn't being responsible and i prayed to whatever it is i pray to that maybe i would have a sign of what i should be doing and then there you were i've been trusting that vox machina will take me where i need to go and maybe what i need to do is confront this but i don't know what this is and i'm terrified i don't know there was an interrogation dr ripley was asking questions i assumed for all these years that that's what became of my family asking questions about the castle about things about the castle it was a long time ago and i was not equipped for torture i don't remember much i think so i put down my gun and i turn the barrel and of the six barrels five of them have names and lord and lady briarwood are two of those names dr ripley is another sir stonefell is the other and professor anders is the other and then there's one blank one i don't know he was the captain of their guard professor anders was my teacher he was my tutor and he was in collusion with them and he was the one that i believe allowed them to take the castle in the night they were traveling they were on the road it was my brother julius and my sister vesper who handled matters of court i was studying i didn't think i had six it's all very much a blur (sighs) there's things you just forget you don't have to get involved in this there's only one way to find out i think so which is why i was planning on-- i know we have a cap of disguise i don't even know if they would recognize me my hair was different i don't think i wear one as well as you do no this could be funny let this happen out of curiosity what did you pick up what did it look like a big thing of tongs what would i have to roll to find out if it was covered in some basic sulfuric acid if it was one of the things i was using for casting that'll take about ten minutes to take effect all right (gasping) i can find out i can forge paperwork as well no in a week how about the giant eagle flies i agree we should send someone for the money i agree people get married in my family for money i think it's perfectly reasonable there's four days we can each do our part five days can you leave me an earpiece so that i can keep in contact i'm not leaving my workshop leave me an earpiece and i'll call if i need anything else not yet thank you grog how many minutes has it been i'm wondering if his hands are starting to itch yet there's a bucket of water in the corner you can try that it'll make it worse i hand him a small bag of powder now you've learned not to touch things if you don't know what they are i pour the powder on his hands you're a good friend bring me another accent aye he is the source of a lot of phantom liquids i was about to say make her do a persuasion roll it'd be funny i'm sorry (laughter) oh look a real roll that's a pretty good deal that dagger's so sharp it could cut the sexual tension and me ten how many batches of bullets are you going to let me attempt to make maybe signed by kit have we checked to make sure it's not a stain you may have taken the wrong lesson away from that he does breathe fire methinks the dm doth speak from experience i'm staying home anyway i come up for lunch keyleth can i borrow you for a-- what in good god is trinket comfortable with this keyleth can i borrow you when you have a moment i feel like we're playing out some real-world psychodrama here say it staffie just say staffie i'd like to finish my morning crafting before moving into the evening crafting i'm going to have help i'm working on project number three if i have a little help this is something i've been tinkering with for quite a while now do you think i'll have time to finish everything that's on my list if i roll well because i was going to have keyleth lightning spell to help set the battery for the-- if it just uses it to start a charge okay yeah i was going to frankenstein this all right that's better 20 you can help me in the workshop oh yes see if allura will come here because i want to keep working and i'll also say we should send word to uriel that i will not be myself at the-- the less we say the better it would not be the first time i will be with you and if we can let uriel know that i am coming under a false pretense he knows that i don't trust them he does so let's let asum know burt reynolds will the hat let me choose who i look like how much of a shape-change can i-- could i look like grog well i was actually thinking of pike but you'll stick to the shadows and i'll be you no that's actually a pretty good plan that's okay it's a good plan i think this plan is a good plan i don't know what i want i want to see them i want to look at them i want to see them no i want to listen to them i want to see them i don't know the best i can give you is we'll just have to see what happens i do laura and i saw things all right (singing) why yes i really do 28 i got a d6 from the last one you did d10 so i'll roll a d10 with the next one that one was 20 28 23 i was going to try to sneak in a few bullets during that time touch cock-a-dooed (yelps) 19 are you all right tiberius i call it diplomacy 23 i want to see him roll an athletics check for that yes i look like vax that will work just fine thank you yes i'll stay with the dinner party i wish to observe i wish to observe the briarwoods myself (gritty voice) i wish to observe yes nasal five it's all right asum it's me vax is here he's being quiet no let's do this she's vegan of course she told them let's go be social i also want to scan their entourage to see if i recognize any faces 19 two and they could not be in attendance lord briarwood i am not familiar with whitestone how did you become caretaker of such a place a toast then to gracious hosts lady briarwood it is such an act of compassion to take on such responsibility as a house such as whitestone that's such a spectacular act of kindness and generosity would perhaps vox machina also be of service to you and we killed an illithid once as well can you can you make an insight check i don't think you can you know you could roll lower if you tried i think we did did we befriend an illithid or kill it i think we did both i'm just fine (yells and groans) you're making it so much worse than i ever imagined i swear if the briarwoods are responsible for a party kill i'm going to feel like such an asshole trying to convince an entire army of illithid to follow you or you could become a vampire you can be a vampire half-elf
