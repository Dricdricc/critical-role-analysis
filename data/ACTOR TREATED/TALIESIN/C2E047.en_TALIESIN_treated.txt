every time you do one it's a brand new surprise tiny violin 11 we saw them we don't know how many there were a lot of them moving around i was going to say it's been a while i thought the plan was to draw things out through the door okay you guys get an extra d4 get a d4 13 wow i see how this is going i'm going to cast bless and hit caleb nott and jester so i'm blessing that and then i'm going to move out of the way i'm going to go around that rock and over to the side there yeah anywhere i can get over there get a little bit of distance yeah probably go up a little bit i want to be able to keep an eye on things no not cool a d4 attached to each attack roll one down we'll talk about that other thing later it's been a few weeks oh wait it's an attack you get an extra d4 oh you did roll your d4 never mind i'm going to use my bonus action to throw a quick healing word at beau that's just six hit points sorry then i'm going to get a little bit away from the tower i'm going to try and stay in range of that one but circle around away from these fuckers yeah around like that the one that has beau i'm going to hold a path to the grave until yasha attacks i'm going to hold my thing for yasha to hit it yeah yeah i love bless man i'm not 30 feet away from that am i damn it okay never mind is that with the d4 i see her attacking and i'm-- this is fine i'm fine either way i'm fine man yeah i'm fine man things are happening yeah i'm going to turn invisible that's only for a round then i'm going to back away from this thing i'm actually going to head around behind jester basically that misses i also might add that i have the shield of retribution i'm going to activate the shield of retribution yep it's the first time i'm using it when a creature misses with a melee attack you may react to the blast with arcane force you have to succeed on a strength saving throw but that's something else okay eh 14 points of damage it must succeed on a strength saving throw-- is a six i don't know what against must succeed on a strength saving throw against something then i think that's fine yeah you get pushed back 20 feet i dart around the side i'm coming as far back as i can towards that wall and i'm going to hold my actual action to do the same thing with yasha again to give her the bonus kick to her first attack that will be my action yeah will it bump into me how did it get so far what's their speed oh fuck okay do i have a reaction or did-- that is my reaction is to hold my attack okay sorry first one doubles all the damage the first one is doubled i also like that you're bleeding so there's a perfect red corkscrew happening hey i'm going to sacred flame this guy i'm going to step back a little bit 15 feet yeah get rid of your stuff oh that hits okay i still get my attack though 14 points of damage and constitution saving throw nine sorry make a dex saving throw all right that's nice take seven points of radiant damage i'm all right i think everybody could take a few minutes ugh that's true i can take ten minutes and give everyone a little bit of a boost i'll look in the door before we sit down is this thing giving me a vibe nature check oh no my nature check weirdly sucks yeah i know it's funny how my nature check is terrible 13 it doesn't seem to be a problem we're just going to be here for a minute and then we'll be on our way let me know if you've got any issue and we'll do our best to stay out of your business 15 i do plant life needs love man aw see now i feel better about the whole-- thank you anybody who needs a heal i'm going to do the ten-minute-- i'm going to start in the interior of this the prayer of healing so anybody who needs-- can we afford a short rest i will not say no to a short rest nothing's looking for us never mind i'm not casting the spell no if we're taking a short rest that's if you don't want a short rest but you want to roll out we are not paying attention to things is there something in the middle of all that tendril in the center of this tower is it obscuring something oh i suppose we're going to be heading down we're going to be having to head down below we're going to try not to disturb your root structure but if there's another way down that you might happen to know of we would appreciate any clue as to what that may be no shift in the water nothing no little twitch i apologize to the interruption of your very calm day we did a short rest so everybody thumped are you all right with where you are i mean we don't have the best history but sure yeah that's fair i don't know if-- well i mean place it next to the seaweed see if it has any-- i don't think this is carnivorous but it's worth checking no it's not that kind how's that door that we found in the middle of the seaweed looking i'll go right after you too just in case something goes wrong i don't think so i think that they're pretty friendly fjord i think-- sorry i'm casting light i can cast water walk if we have to i'm taking a long look around during this ten i'm going to point out i'd be careful whatever this armor is it didn't seem to help this fellow much i didn't think to put that in my bag for this particular run here's the question do you do this alone or do we stay here with you we're at a disadvantage let's maybe keep a friend with mister fjord we can keep eyes on him in the chamber yeah which i think it'll be fine with just fjord and frumpkin-- we could be outside up in the top layer of the temple and wait for you whether or not you need help or whether or not it's time to run do you want to be in the room we'll see through frumpkin anyway we'll be waiting for you upstairs if anything starts to go wrong we'll try to get to you if you're encumbered we'll try to clear a path and once you're up with us i'll bring everybody to the surface no i feel like that signal happens a lot though we hear it a lot i go last and on the way out i tap fjord on the shoulder good luck and i'm looking forward to seeing you upstairs i cast protection from good and evil protection from evil you know what that does though just in case why don't we all get outside and be here right now what's your-- plus dex no you're not i think we're pretty tight-knit are we all going up let's go up i'm casting water walk on everybody including you let's head to the ship let's walk that way that was very nice we really got to do something about that at some point don't open it it's an acquired taste do you want me to give them fair warning i would say close enough far and i still have a control water so once they're within 300 feet i can make their life very unpleasant i'm the boatswain we're all the boatswain yeah what do you need so i can deal with the top two i still have some good spells oh that's nice 17 we usually get durian pastries after blizzcon can we put them between us and land so that maybe if we can ground them how clear is the-- you'll show us (gasp) i like that it's got little rivets you can have mine i only do this to myself once a year captain let's hug the coast to our right a little hard maybe i can once they get close enough shove them yeah i can shove them into the rocks maybe get around that little piece of i can't do anything until they're 300 feet away anyway because i would be doing this as well can i give advantage to that or can i roll as well on that no he has to roll on that are they close enough now 300 now i am going to cast control water and i'm going to shove all the water i'm going to push them right into the island i can't quite tidal wave i can do redirect flow or i can do whirlpool i think are my two-- it's a wave i'm throwing them on the island thank you percentile i got them so the-- yep 15 it's just water i'm going to sit down that was really tiring we can also see what they have on board i'm so sorry oh i am so sorry you're not shooting that great anyway i think probably this was for the best not anymore they're not yep i'm here to fuck your shit up i will make sure you will never get to shoot a cannon oh no that i can help with we should maybe-- who can tie we can do that it would take a day though i can't really do anything until the morning it could also give you a second to go and take a look at the wreck of that ship maybe i mean you can swim you not feeling it yeah we've got some stuff oh boy food and water never stops if you need it too whoa that's a lot pay the crew wow jesus i wouldn't say no to that vandran hm perhaps the tower the strange tower that grows perhaps there's answers in there or someone who might know well i know the wildmother knows everything (stuttering) sure now i'm thinking about that does it are you sure oh that's nice thinking about this i think you smell fantastic thank you but no really i actually do think you smell better than nice we've got a tree until we need it that's a lot of tree do you need above average are you already bumped i'm in a breastplate either of you would get a bonus to that either of you would be hilarious owning this it's one fight just become a beast yeah yeah you'll get disqualified from a lot of sports for taking that that's for horses not yet one day i'm going to gather some of my stuff and go to the crow's nest get everybody-- yeah i'm not going to be reading up there but-- i'll admit i'm not the best reader but i've read a couple books i would be curious if you could leave it in my quarters that would be most agreeable thank you me too i've never felt so helpful i'm going to climb up and set up a little ritual circle in the crow's nest and i'm going to light some incense and i'm going to pull out a piece of that weird fruit that i've been slowly growing some mushrooms on getting a little weird eat a little bit of it i'm going to meditate and then i'm going to cast divination i'm going to feel out into the universe and i'm going to wait for whatever sign whether it be verbal or otherwise wonder what vandran's doing right now that'll do i head back down i'm good i'm going to read that book too but yeah we'll talk about it later on the balleater like a badass it's really cool and it's going to happen
