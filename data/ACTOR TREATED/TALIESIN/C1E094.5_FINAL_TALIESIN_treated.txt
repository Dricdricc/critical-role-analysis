enjoying this way too much six which is about what i could get hired to play at that age natural 20 damn it 19 because of negative one i'm going to peek around and see all this and take a look at what's going down here and the one that's closest to matt and marisha i have some vague memories of where we just came from i'm going to see if any of this still works do i have any of that weird-- i mean i was already-- i want to reach down into the ground and see if i can just-- i'm just going to try and reach out at that first cat and see if i can hit it with a little bit of the chill touch i want to see if i can make those tendrils form again chill touch on the closest cat to the two kids yep that one yep i don't actually know how to do this anymore where's my spell-- 18 (heavy breathing) cool ooh i see this one that's threatening i'm going to try and get a little more fancy with this i'm just going to see if i can manifest the power inside the cat yeah shooting going for inside the cat it's already gross that's right i've got to learn this 22 ooh okay we're good we got this there was an old man when we got here before yeah that was pretty cool he went that way that way now that's come up so many times today because warner bros is your favored terrain sure i'm going to make a wild guess i'm going to see if there's a little boxhouse nearby where it would be physically i'm getting a sneaky suspicion-- investigation nine yeah we're still on the wb lot just several miles down the 405 ought to do it do you want to say it you thought it you might as well say it we're in the bw (laughter) i'm going to join you just rummaging through 20 no just 20 does it feel like some of the buildings might still be there hidden in this forest structure or is it just too dense don't wander too far we're going down hollywood way i follow travis oh god 13 yeah that's gremlins gremlins won't come into the water (laughter) that just makes more of them better than a chlorinated pool man it'd be a little green i'm going to join marisha on the beach because i hate the water and it's cold and this has kind of happened to me before this whole thing has kind of happened and this is true i'm going to say what i said last time this is true and you might know this mister satan dude we are totally ready to serve you (laughter) this is literally what i said last time this happened oh boy that's not great that's why i got out eight i'm going to hold my full action until something happens until they start moving within ten feet of me we could have so hung out i am not pleased i am going to start wishing that we had some help with this somehow and i'm going to start i suppose casting unseen servant and i'm going to attempt to create something to catch travis when he lands and otherwise i think i'm just staring at the ground for the moment because that was a lot that just happened thank you for making that as awkward as humanly possible yeah if you try and kill him with a rock you'll kill him so just go for it died like she lived i get the sneaking suspicion that we're screwed i'm feeling a little like this might be the end i'm not feeling pretty good about this so-- i'm just going to flick it off and the one the little creature on the right-- yeah chill touch just going to crush that fucker as just a fuck-you yeah 15 i probably have to roll for damage on that one because he's not tiny where's my d8s two that's two points of necrotic damage it's just a 1d8 right yeah i'm going to move my unseen servant underneath laura just in case to try and pull her to shore if she goes back down you killed it in theory you'd be caught by my unseen servant oh that vanished when i died oh no fuck commander bettany-- commander bettany fenton he's hurt bad all over the place commander bettany fenton he's hurt bad oh no oh no two this is still a dream so i'm going to see if this thing still works is the one that laura attacked still looking dangerous or is it just looking irritated okay i'm going to go to the one that no one's messed with and just hope that this is still gonna work that's a 23 i was going for the other one no the one in the far corner four liam are you okay and i'm going to run just to the edge of the volume that's okay he would've wanted it that way wait without breaking eye contact with marisha i send another tendril at the one that won't stay down 11 it doesn't match the color of my hair all right and i'm going to back off a bit and i'm gonna also keep looking at those screens to see if they say anything plus a d6 plus a d6 they're always out of health potions by the time i get there no that was a-- there is so much that is unpleasant happening in here i'm gonna free up some people there's just too much happening the one that laura's-- yeah i'm right there (sighs) yeah yeah travis is gonna keep him busy for a second i'm gonna deal with the one that laura is-- i'm gonna keep rolling around just trying to-- i'm gonna run away from that one and try and stab the one up by-- yeah that one over there both i'm not getting within-- i'm getting further from that-- oh am i up face-up to that one oh i didn't know i was face-up to that one i thought i was the guy below yeah i'm gonna shove tentacles in it and hopefully start to wrangle it apart yeah that's not good nine travis help no i'll remember this he'll never break nda again it's time for crafty i was so marketable two down yeah we're too close to clearing this i'm going to try and circle around this thing and get a better shot at it the one that's got me stuck here yeah i'm going to circle around him i am going to tentacle kancho kancho yeah we are kancho-ing here big purple concho i'm going to add 11 it's because matt's sitting in my chair just like real life i did i knew it i knew it oh it's me i'm going to circle around and try one more time i think i've been trying to get too fancy with this thing so i'm going to try to hit it through the ground try and line it up and give the slap attack yeah no i don't have my hair you've done this to me the hair is where the power comes from it's really tough to get an eldritch god to listen to you when you have this haircut there's a reason it's gone i'm going to break and run i run to the green sure did we reset hit points at the top of this okay cool wow that came out weird liam's in the cloud it's dark sam do you have another resume and picture you only had one resume i'm going to play with my crazy powers i really haven't had a chance to play with my crazy powers my special purpose i'm going to try and make a purple glow happen behind the glass i want to try and see what's behind i'm going to touch the glass and try and force a psychic light behind it so i can see a gothy psychic light guys guys guys look i'm going to try and keep enough light and keep projecting a tiny bit of light in this tunnel let's walk i mean ten minutes is-- just a minute more liam and i'm not available (laughter) i put my hand on the glass please just try i think there are so many more adventures to have and i think there's a better future to be written for all of us i always knew i'd die young it's really uncomfortable you've been holding onto that speak and spell thing for so long you've been showing that off for so fucking long that was so amazing
