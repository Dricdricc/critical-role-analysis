i want a fanta-core right now what flavors does the fanta-core come in i say we sleep upstairs pull the rope up that way we'll have plenty of time if we hear them coming back up with the warning system we'll have plenty of time to get away if there's too many of them and they'll have no way up if we pull the rope up people will keep watch that way we'll have an early warning before they even manage to crawl their way up kitten kebab i'm going to activate one sword hold it behind my back sit at the edge and wait to give a swing see if anything is going to pop up just a standard attack or standard and bonus two strikes or one strike that's awful 11 and an eight someone hit something yay i'm staying on guard in case anything else comes through instead of putting another wire down there you could leave frumpkin down there and he can alert us if there's any problem if we hear anything we're going to charge down there they'll be fine mention that they should clean up the bodies this i can confirm on the way down i smack caleb a bit on the back and say well done she likes you and head down amvivious are you going to be all right with caleb going without you we're going to be one down then is that the sound of pass without a trace like ed wynn getting tickled oh my super fast in the water i bet they're really fast in the water but probably not as fast as they are i'm of the opinion that the problem with this bottleneck is we don't know what they are doing on the other side it would be easier to assess what's coming and make sure that they can't-- if we take care of everything there then we can assess what's there and they can't prepare or get more together have time to-- i feel like over there is the way to go we'll stay together in a group i'll leave my coat here i'm not dragging that into the water that's a very nice sling thing it'd be a shame if anything happened to it are you sure you're not coming one quick attack or do we try and take them out quietly i assume-- well we'll take a look at what it is if they don't see us then we get the sneak attack and if they do-- we'll see what we see 16 i am so excited i didn't think i'd enjoy this quite so soon do we want to try and do a clockwise attack knock them out as we go seven molly caleb marshmallow in the center oh my god and then it was like nope i feel your pain okay i'm going to run i'm going to use my bonus action to activate one of my swords technically that would have still been activated so shit that's right yeah i'm going to use my bonus action to activate the other one too i'm going to see if i can make it to that little hill over there i'm going to attack the one that's right in front of fjord yes so i'm going to do two attacks plus a hasted attack that's 17 that hits one does not and then my third attack is a 16 that also hits that's eight points of damage and nine points of damage i am using the d6's that's the end of my turn sam and that was three attacks one missed she rolled a natural 20 for her other roll murder it wait no it's a saving throw right oh it's a dex saving throw never mind sorry that makes me sad that hits 17 that is with the plus two i'm an ac of 15 i am easy target the other person i'm casting curse of the eyeless on the second that does not hit curse of the eyeless and i take my three points of damage with disadvantage okay that hits the eyeless i am yelling fjord i am going to take a swing at the one that's looking a little rough i believe it's that one yeah oh my fucking god 11 24 nine points of damage still standing i'll swing again 23 ten points of damage i'm literally just a windmill at this point then spinning around i go right to face the other one and i'm going to take my last attack against it nope i don't even know why i'm bothering you fucking arsehole oh god that looked like a one for a moment sevens are scary no it was a seven i was just staring at it going oh no yeah you did you're right nah i don't even know why i bother shite yeah i suppose we're doing-- yeah running to the yasha creature i'm going to run through the water speed's doubled that doesn't matter then actually here's an interesting thing is-- oh god yeah i don't want to be in the water so i'm going to stay on that little patch of land so i don't get-- all right first two rounds that's a 14 and a natural 20 so the natural 20 is double the dice all right eh that's nine and the other one is 11 third and fourth that's-- one of them misses but the other one's 19 the other one hits the other one is ten that's better 11 points of damage i'm going to use my bonus action-- oh i did for the attack never mind never mind that's literally everything i can do so irritating two two hit points that's two kittens man oh god does that mean i-- oh shit i'm out for a round aren't i i'm pleased holy cow i'm going to (retching) and throw up for a second because i got vertigo because i lost haste and that's my turn can you move while you're not blinked by the way yeah there was a “whoa” there we will all get yelled at on the internet if we're wrong yes i do is it possible to make a leap across some of water at the very least to try and get back to land that's a ten i'm going to also then use my action to dash and i'm within range i'm going to use my bonus action-- okay that's fine wait double check because i thought that's just using my off-hand that's okay i've got options sort of okay that’s fine i'm going to try something weird hold on since that's not going to work can i take enthrall i'm going to take enthrall i'm going to try and use enthrall yeah that's true i'm trying to see it might be it yeah it's an action never mind vicious mockery oh my god everything is an action i have no bonus actions or anything reasonable that i can do i'm in melee that's fine that alone very shallow really hot instagram account though take ten feet to the right i can't-- well it depends where the cube goes if he wants to escape he's got to knock us all back it's going to be the two of us i think yeah that's my money so it gets an attack of opportunity from-- i'll join you oh wow oh god no is the staff that the-- we grabbed it before it sank i'll take a look in there i'll walk towards the pool at the very least i'm going to pick up any of the moonweaver pieces i'm not entirely sure but they're very very nice also 11 it looks like a door his symbol is a door i would say so what do i find for the moonweaver you did check for traps right i'm going to sit back and watch again that looks very exciting i'm going to run over-- yeah nope no-- i'm pushing aside i'm going to try the weight perhaps i give it a swing it's worth more as it is archeart in general is there one more box we haven't opened you should check for traps and open it in theory we've moved it aside oh let's put that in the pile let's put that in the pile too roll initiative it was in a case so i suppose it would be unlikely or if it was on its way somewhere it was probably on the way to the other end of it mr caleb (maniacal laughter) you're going to get yours oh yes i'll be living the dream yeah check to see if there's a scar or anything yes laura and roll for initiative i'm going to walk up and take a look at this pool one more time i want to taste the water is it fresh or salt it's sea water why were they bringing religious iconography to this thing what were they trying to do with it i'm going to push his head underneath the water anything tap three times when you're done push him under we're even for the teleport now of course it's possible it hasn't actually had an effect on you yet either that doesn't make any sense is this about whales this place is definitely making me nervous we should do our best to cut off this particular flow-through i think they were trying to activate it they were trying to please it let's leave it exactly where they're supposed to be so we did our job we're working for the smugglers we'll put it back in the safe house you know yeah he wants to do this see if it does anything that's fair if it's possible i would love to cave this thing in i don't think they're going to come up once we're out of here they'd have to dig through mind like a steel trap i don't have any no i don't have any we did we did check them there's lots you can do with manacles and to rifle through their pockets i imagine matt sam and you want swamp things this is how you get swamp things been a while we're done we're heading out that was a great roll
