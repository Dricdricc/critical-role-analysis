i'm feeling it wait you need to turn it back this way more oh okay bold decisions i see a sailboat what are you is it my imagination that all of the half-elves kind of have the same weird chin thing going on i will also say that i definitely get ashley as the joker threatening the city sam and millions will die she's like if the joker had a daughter with krondor what's that hashtag again yes i missed this week because i realized once again that i'm supposed to be doing things other than playing d&d and actually working in the real world so i missed this wednesday club but i'll be back next week i don't actually know what the subject is yet because i've done nothing other than this all week actually probably not we did marvel last week maybe no marvel this week we've got to let dc and image and independent books may give a thing x-o manowar you are a nerd dude whoa are you coming on i was going to say will you come on our x-o manowar show if we do one okay i love you so yeah there will be a wednesday club check out twitter for updates but i'll be back and it will be fun and i'll be catching up on all my books maybe probably not it's the gothiest one since me i think well no jason charles is pretty gothy she's so cool yeah that happened oh good plates i'll have a plate grog please there is food but no plates a fortune we have books there were books we kept books it's quite all right that was a long time ago really glad so many of us survived oh no did we fight his undead body in the crypt is that-- oh i would feel better about that but probably not i just like the notion that maybe if we just checked one more of those cells in the dungeon of whitestone-- you know i'll say just because i'm curious where this particular rabbit hole leads-- it's not like we're going to go wherever-- this is our version of looking at our phones this is vox machina going-- yes but the frame rate is only 120 frames per second what this is really sad in the weirdest way i know i can't pre-stream it's been since pre-stream that this has come up okay wow is that this version of he's in the feywild everything's fine right now keep your eyes open we trust your judgment we've got a trip to take so perhaps when we get back we can audition some new candidates that'll be fun you'll enjoy that oh it's quite fun it's quite nice now i remember why we hired her in the first place we need to do a bit of shopping but then we do have-- you're not quite done are you i'm putting it out there wow i watched that work its way from your ear all the way to your brain there it got lost on the way it was amazing they decorate it like a winter's festival was i at that one please i'm sure you're having all sorts of reservations and thoughts and processes about this notion but i will admit i have yet to introduce your sister to the best part of being titled which is dressing up and it would be a coronation we could get some clothes we could wear something lovely it's a sign of respect yes i am heavy is the head that wears the crown i'm sure we can work out something without pants just get him boots that go all the way up to the neck activate number one or number two has your life been leading up to this moment or has your life been leading up to everything that happens after this moment i'm just saying as somebody who spent several years of their life avoiding the one thing that would make them even remotely happy maybe just barreling through it is the way to go we'll be there i was going to say is that theoretical or experiential okay just checking she still reads a lot lots of things no you don't that's why i was so excited that you pried he took his time pencil or pen you're going to be very good at this i know wow okay that's less disappointing whitestone's the boulder it's boulder colorado there's nothing happening in theory they'll have your crest on file that's one of those things any dressmaker would actually know how to assemble something appropriate for any house of any nobility that exists ooh a work vacation not as cold as my home but it'll do we also probably need a few healing potions and such and we'll probably have better luck somewhere else yes we probably need to stock up a bit it's like a four-pack of medieval five-hour energy drink that's like a 1st-level healing potion you might want to keep a low profile or a ghost it is sadly not hallow's eve we can put him in some armor or some fake cloth of some sort well let's go full cinderella on this let's get all the mice involved let's make him look like a goliath that wears a lot of robes because he was horribly scarred grog how do you feel about this i feel like you have the look-- oh you're upstairs you're not actually here never mind i know we could put him in a suit of armor is doty strong enough to wear a suit of armor yes decorative because this is funny i'm having a wonderful time groucho marx nose and glasses (all laugh) we can make him a mask at the very least all right no it's just a man with no arms legs heads limbs and chest no we're doing it everyone else can get their little run-around of westruun done while we sit making a robot it is important for him to express himself oh no you own a cardboard box with a bunch of stuff i need some clay i gave him a list well the first thing that we're going to need is we're going to need a way of connecting this to him without limiting his movement so i'm making so it's a very accessible easy harness to get this on and off and starting to design and put together how we're going to-- what i'd like to make is a couple-- a porcelain cover for the hands and face so that it actually looks like perhaps-- it won't draw immediate suspicion but if it does it will look like somebody with an artificial limb maybe they've been hurt i am i've got the kiln instead of porcelain i'm going for the ceramics that i use for some of my build it's more practical i've been working on some jewelry shit i could genuinely learn how to do this i'm willing to have this-- can i roll to see because i have a kiln so i might have it but i don't know if i have it-- it's more of a metal-use forge if prototype one fails i'll make it out of pewter i'm trusting in gil because he also can't make a pot mecca lecca high mecca hiney ho don't fuck me gil and those pottery tools are-- 22 thank you for helping me ghost by the way never mind that's fine hands and face is what i was hoping for okay and we're just figuring out a little easy armature that won't get in his way and i'm peeking at him seeing how he works-- you can assist i'd be happy for an assist unless you're doing something oh go ahead okay that's fine i'll just work on your robot by myself then 21 i'm not saying you want a-- no nope i'm not helping never mind don't want to help critical role ladies and gentlemen eric stoltz google it all right i've got the-- oh good god no it's-- i mean like it's-- we're going to put a little wrap it'll be fine oh yes that too yes yes thank god no no in case we're in combat and it comes out maybe we'll get like a momentary element of surprise as they go 'my god what is that' what is this episode what-- it looks like lincoln from disneyland (all laugh) boys i'm so proud of both of you i'm quite pleased i'm quite pleased good work everybody good work everybody grog grog it's all right it's all right it's very expensive don't break it yes he did oh all of us wow well done where did you get the hair what is it that's the stealth robe oh you put a magical item on the robot (laughs) now there's a robot with sentimental value i think it blends into the texture actually quite nice makes it look like he's seen some shit i'll buy you a new robe this is everything i've ever wanted we have the book but we have the book yeah library it's where i'd put the ark of the covenant certainly always go with the twins they're more inclined to violence and buying things you like buying things i can't look away thank you tary good luck grog keep an eye on him make sure that everything's-- archive i'm tired-- okay this is awkward now we'll just keep-- jif i'll do it that's funny okay it's in the-- wait no the book's in the bag yes i rolled a 16 don't agree with him that's not fair 16 investigation we thought we did we were not paying attention i thought we took the book too it occurs to me it was actually in the bag that grog was holding papier-mâché of evil no we didn't have a box that's exactly what i was looking for thank you so much we were hoping for access to some of the deep research archives we've been looking around we have several complicated matters that we need to research and we heard that you had a wonderful collection and we were hoping to gain access to some materials preferably of the histories of orcus the nine hells a few various things who could we talk to about special access i'm sure that there must be somebody in charge close enough (creepy voice) who wants to talk to the librarian we would also possibly like to make a donation and i pull out the manual of quickness of action place it upon the table thank you for ruining that one for me for all time well we'll see what happens now hold on to that one yes well we are in a bit of a bind we are members of a traveling group of adventurers known as vox machina we recently helped defeat the chroma conclave well the deeds and those things that must be done have not yet been fulfilled we have just a few last treacherous events that we must complete before the chroma conclave is completely put to rest one of which has to do with orcus and the other with the nine hells and we are desperate for knowledge that may keep us safe in our travels prepare us for our enemies worth it yeah use that one that's weird there that's better what is that oh-- that's disconcerting there's quite a bustle today this is impressive not with my toes no no i'm committed books that want to get out i just try and see if i can discern what the other two books are just from looking in and being a nerd oh nothing all right fascinating thank you i suppose we'll sit and get to it and i sit down and i open the book before i touch it this doesn't react poorly to people handling it does it there's no-- excellent i open the first one just to look into-- i do not speak abyssal do you speak abyssal and the other book-- -- i open up the nine hells take a look okay i'm going to show you a really weird birthmark don't panic who is my father i don't know i'm going to take a moment also before this happens open the common book take a moment and gently ask the good sir if they have a reading glass around because i still don't have any reading glasses perfect i'm going to let you deal with this other end of things because i'm going to sit and read phil what about the basement way back when yeah remember but you could ask me well i'm not-- all right maybe i'm reading the book do you know the dewey decimal system i'm skipping specifically through orcus and also since she mentions what she's-- oh i'm so sorry hierarchies i'm trying to get a general overlay of some of the information if there's a natural enemy for the rakshasas any weaknesses where we can find them i'm also seeing what the book also specializes in so anyone lower would be an enemy anyone higher would probably-- are there stories of anybody defeating a rakshasa before lemures are infernal pokemon is basically what you're getting to so like the scream there's a few that have crawled their way up he's probably going to have centuries getting his shit back together he's probably really pissed do they talk about anything like the children that we saved the effect of angelic angelic why those little angel children-- there's no talk about using celestial power as some sort of weapon against these creatures okay so within evil there is chaos versus order is kind of the internal conflict of evil all right this is all very useful flipping i'm just going to keep skimming actually i'm happy to time-pass and we'll revamp that can we direct people to the benny hill steampunk theme song i thought you said that we were taking the book no we are not we have it we have not unveiled it i'm going to keep reading while they head you guys if you want to-- ah yeah okay they're not that clever so probably safer okay i'm marking that-- i'm putting a pin on my pinterest board atlas obscura the hell out of the city of dis i don't want to kill travis city of dis seems to be the winner i'm very excited inter-planar travel i'll sketch a little bit of it out of the book as well dagger dagger you get to experience this as a normal person now i'm so excited please a four yes that was amazing i don't feel good i would also like to definitely talk about maybe having access later to come back at some point just on our way out thank you so much and i hope that that book finds a proper home and is worthwhile thank you for your time of our group of course we do it actually went quite well don't they all speaking of fathers forcing you to do things we have to deal with you we have a starting point for the rakshasa so soon when it's time step one will be the city of dis dis city not this city but the city of dis did you build dis city oh yes hi yes this is-- yes are you going to hold on-- do we have a bag to put that in it's in los angeles we're going to drop it off i think you think can we destroy this book the fear i have with the book is of course if we keep it we keep it out of the hands of everyone save those who are finally strong enough to best us no no oh oh that's a terrible idea i kind of like it that's not a good thing i think it's a good idea that may not be a good thing yes find a bar yes i feel the same i like that most things are better now not everything but it's a brighter world even for us i do too i'll do my best to keep him in the forefront and as for you i like the version of you that's not afraid so let's go meet this terrible thing drop off the book get you feeling a bit better fuck (clears throat) i was envious of you once god so sorry (sighs) just so you know it is your duty to have some joy in the meantime you do know that right you're no use to her a wreck she needs a man have a fucking beer and i slap him on the ass as we walk towards the pub i shove keyleth at him fix that good god ahh couture that's sweat yes yeah ah where are grog and taryon grog taryon we're at a bar where are you no we're just starting you-- is that taryon tell him we say hello i need to talk to taryon tell taryon to take you where we all are right now just have him bring us to us-- i'll give you directions it'll be fine why don't you two come join us yes are you sure we're drinking you can join all right i'm going to send you the psychic information of where we are right now can't you just bullshit you have to actually look up the real name yeah it's-- the other bar would actually be enough isn't that amazing i've gone beyond the veil i've gained such power no i want you to come straight to the bar straight to the bar i was thinking about something else no you just heard me thinking about something else you'll get there i have every faith get him-- get him a giant glass of half guinness half whatever cider they have rich people get drunk oh do you want something fancy okay i take the black and tan and i get him a tiny glass of creme de menthe (laughs) i don't know how to feel a little awkward in saying i'm not sure i want to waste it on you but-- i wait for her to nod okay that's enough oh dear i pull up-- i tip the barman because i'm showing him that i'm pulling something out for some glassware because i'm not an asshole well-- and then i pour a little bit of the tear whiskey of the green tear it's mean it's minty you'll love it we have it every year okay do you actually want me to answer you can say yes it's all right it's not going to get weird that's all right i'm going to tell you anyway see this belt it's got a series of these little-- -- things on those are mostly filled with little bits of gunpowder i have wrapped up in the thing these last four are liquor sh that's how i can just stand everywhere among their being idiots is i'm really trashed yeah oh yeah no i'm-- well i like to-- -- drink what we-- the locals what oh-- this is so-- oh hm for those of you at home this thing has been just driving us nuts half full he'll have a glass of something half full thank-- leave that there no wait doty doty did you actually expire two soldiers you ask and he listens to you ask him if he actually just hurt or if they're-- maybe he just punched them a couple times ah that's close enough did you i'm joining in on this insight check i call bullshit 13 fuck i'm feeling slightly better but slightly worse we let the bear come into bars that's fair are we still buying this is this blood on the-- yep-- oh that's good whose vomit was this this game is a nightmare oh no did you go to that guy natural 20 whose vomit is this i still feel like i would like an answer to the mystery of the vomit how can you tell i pour him a little bit of the tear whiskey all right keep drinking a toast to mistakes-- -- and to terrible consequences to failure ooh bravo we'll cover that at the next drink i think it's time to turn in i'm going to run-- i'm going to get a little bit of the hardest alcohol that they have preferably a clear alcohol and ask them if they have any chicken like-- or some sort of meat that they're about to throw away stop it i pop it and i'm just going to try and start solventing away the glue with grease with fatty grease and alcohol yeah i'm just going to try and get this thing off let me try and remove the hair too we'll have it cleaned dear it looks like the kindergarten class attacked it fucker sam and arsehole where did you go fuck they're huge sorry that was really inappropriate i know no we got this it's okay but part of being-- don't think of it as a thing that evens out think of it as an ever-increasing debt that doesn't really ever get paid cheers no lavender white blue gold silver i might add you do-- part of taking a crest is that you actually do get to build something of your own we do i was-- i feel like i've been negligent that we've not been-- yes we should get to that i only know because we've talked about that ooh oh no (groans) so i believe you just set up a lifetime of unreasonable expectations i was wondering about that well that works well done whoa ow i came up with great formal wear for you too it's a shame we didn't get a chance i figured you out all right i'm very proud i came up with an idea how long have you been working on that speech man that was nuts
