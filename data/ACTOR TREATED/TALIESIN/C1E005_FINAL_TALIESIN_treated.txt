15 okay i have another gift explosive arrow it's a bit iffy it's a bit iffy it'll get better it'll get better i don't think you want an explosive axe it's very unlikely to explode on by itself 'cause it needs to be moving at a high speed but it's just not the best thing ever yeah no not straight behind the next one will be better yep you were just going all inception on us spin the top spin the top (whistles in the hall of the mountain king) doo-agar we should probably be quiet oh god i'll be out of the hole commune in a commune oh god bats it's humid in here for god's sake oh or just melted

right a bit just sort of joining this little-- like getting right in here and i'm going to try and shoot and this is gonna sound weird but as i'm running i'm going to-- actually back me up to about there i'm going to try and shoot about right here i'm gonna try and unleash the lava to send the lava-- to see if i can get it to start flowing towards does that make sense oh it's just down okay well-- -- i've come forward enough i'm gonna take a shot at one of these guys then that one i'm gonna try something else i'm gonna try an ice shot 15 oh my god all right and that's a-- -- that's 15 points of damage plus six points of ice damage fuck that's right oh good god yeah no that's-- okay i'm going to attempt to-- is there any loose-looking rocks that are up above or is there anything that looks like if i gave it a push would fall down from up above i'm gonna take another shot at the same one and see what happens 20 that hits not a lot that's seven points of damage that's nice wow flame on (all laugh) if you rolled zero you rolled a ten what coffee jello oh god jesus christ where's the laser laser oh never mind yeah you had it aha i wanna move just slightly to my right just over there so i can get a clear shot at the oozes yeah about right there so i'm not going to hit anybody i'm gonna take two shots at the little oozes at the-- yeah that right little ooze first shot 27 to hit and that does ten points of damage and then i'm gonna take another shot at him i'm going to take a fire shot and i'm gonna take a negative five to hit and that's 14 so that's 15 plus-- that's 23 points of damage plus three points of fire damage plus fire okay my name in high school iceberg lobsterface it's what all the kids called me long story damn it get it nice all right i'm just taking the shot taking a shot with the bonus so that's 14 to hit that hits so that's 18 points of damage and i'm gonna take the other shot yeah yeah sorry the ooze and that's 13 to hit and that's 11 points of damage so i'm going to back up against the wall i'm going to back to the wall of the-- yeah nice try yes grog you killed it good i'm fine i feel fine seems that there's one table where everyone is perfectly reasonable i reload it's probably for the best i'm gonna be the person who actually examines the cart at this point you know i just figured someone ought to and it should be me put it back on an investigation check what is that eight i think-- well no that's the only heat source that's the only lava there was and now it's cool okay never mind then it's all right i think it's worth it i
