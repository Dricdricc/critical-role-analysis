will blot out the light percy was the third of seven children born to a noble family who lived far to the north in the ancient castle of whitestone with so many siblings to share the burdens of lordship percy turned his attentions to the sciences engineering and naturalism one day a mysterious couple named lord and lady briarwood came to court during a feast held in their honor the briarwoods violently took control of the castle killing or imprisoning everyone who would stand in their way percy awoke chained in the dungeon only to be freed by his younger sister together they fled chased by the briarwoods' men as they ran percy's sister took several arrows to the chest and fell percy kept running eventually jumping into a freezing river and floating unconscious to freedom he did not remember waking up on a fishing boat he barely remembered the next two years as he slowly made his way as far south as possible then one night percy had a dream a roaring cloud of smoke offered him vengeance against those who destroyed his family when he awoke percy began to design his first gun (gunshot) under-indian we follow k'varn the god in darkness i want to wrack my brain to

what okay that's good to know that's very good to know thank you we're having a discussion of how best to go about this missed our little flower girl i want to just put something out on the headsets really quickly when we get into the city i need everyone to promise that we're not going to enter the temple no one rush in no one be brash no one make a poor decision we're going to wait no matter what happens don't enter the temple until we've all had a moment to figure out what's happening if there's going to be a trap it's going to be getting us into the temple he literally invited us into the temple we walk to the temple we don't enter the temple understood excellent dick move actually let's grab a few chunks i may have an idea for later throw a few into the bag of holding i'll take a few thank you a fancy bundle of crystals we should investigate i'm going to make my way as well right they played arm punch until one caved that's never good what kind of liquid is this lake made of
