i may have hit a couple people in the face for which i greatly apologize yeah i like split someone's lip and we played golf it was quite nice yeah i think his exact words is is this for us (all laugh)

sea galveston texas i'll be wearing a costume it'll be great we have gnome oh god i blank out in the booth any time they mention his name wait wait wait dun dun dun dun [opening credits] did the creature look like that okay just checking oh that's right 21 it's bigger than sin isn't it okay so i'm going to alert everybody get down and i'm going to take three shots-- hmm i'm just going to-- look at that thing why doesn't it reason with me is what i'm asking it could reason with me i'm aiming i'm going to use the sharpshooter for extra damage three pepperbox shots yeah so that's 17 hmm okay second one it hits 18 plus seven for the third one i'm going to go for a head shot instead of a sharpshooter and that's 21 17 better 25 that went really well the last one-- do i do any damage when i hit the head normal damage so last one is seven points of damage plus he's got-- yeah disadvantage on attacks am i touching a wall all right i'm going to brace against a wall and i'm going to mark all this off we're outdoors taco with advantage oh that's right this is a magic save i probably should spend grit unconscious say your soul is forfeit for once you're not the one doing damage to the bear brought another sign roll like your bear depends on it you guilted her up to another level that's not bad ack oh wow we're going there (sing) well i guess we're gonna have to take control i love that die you hurt feelings i'm going to scoot a little bit forward just into that little crevice i'm going to take three more shots just to see what i can do with the sharpshooter feat i have sharpshooter so i can ignore cover yeah so but i'm going to be taking a negative for these hits still three attacks per-- okay just making sure i'm doing this right yeah misfire (all groan) this normally doesn't happen to me i don't quite know what-- (all laugh) so can i at least use my bonus to pick up the pieces and-- okay i'm going to pick up the pieces and-- i'm just going to leave that as an open target for a little while ain't nothing yeah but you are behind me it totally works putting glass for the dog-- kicking myself this is a repair die i'm up next ugh all right i'm going to try and fix this broken piece of gosa i hit a 12 which is just barely enough to fix it and i'm going to burn an action surge so i'm just-- i finally get it and it just starts going and i'm just going to empty out the chamber ho nelly i don't have to reload yet i've got six shots so we're still three in the chamber unless you actually-- i have two in the chamber okay so i'll do two and then use the third one to reload all right so-- ooh this'll be fun sharpshooter shot that's 22 i'll just take the second shot right now that's-- really really really are we going there misfired again i rolled a two i got one shot off yeah to a misfire no so that's okay at least this is a badass as i at least did some damage 16 17 18 19 20 24 damage plus four points of fire damage oh i was about to say and-- yeah i wanna get a little further back i wanna roll to the other side of the cave again if possible yeah like see that little outcropping of rock further back like that over there that thing scares me the beast that's not good what i'll take that i'll take that (all laugh) but you never said he looked a little rough i kept waiting for you to say it's looking a little rough damn it well yes i would like to fix my gun just a giant pile of tools behir i'd like that lick it parkour parkour we have jars i'm going to put that into the jar and put it away i may have something i can do with this actually yes you're very clever yes we'll work on that yes back in the bag of holding i'm going to try and fix this mess for a minute 18 it wasn't a dual fail yes we should still get out of the taco yes honestly i've never taken this road before this is further east than i've ever come the geology starting to look familiar it's starting to look like home though i grab lockheed and we hold him hostage (all laugh) or more mirrors or an army with mirrors yeah no i'm walking i'm keeping an eye open for anything familiar do you have to do the hands that's the most complicated sentence i think i've ever heard you speak nothing buying it dinner wow well we're not heading north westish we're heading westish oh we came up on the western side of the mountains western side of the mountains so whitestone's to the east oh okay i thought we went up the eastern side of the mountains i'm so confused you wouldn't think i'd lived here before no that's very true oh god in two or three miles we'll take another check do i know what this is history check i kind of want grog to speak truth right here no we don't no wow holy cow should we observe this encampment for a bit just to see what's happening as we slowly make our way around it that would also allow us a good view of it as well or very cold if they came out oh yes that's true i like the plan of going up the other side of the chasm i don't know if i have climbing gear 19 that's an intimidation check bears climb they can get up a tree you could've it just would've been adorable 20 it could've been the briarwoods we should see everything that's up here i can't believe i'm about to say this now you're not going to be able to see anything because they have terrible eyesight i'm kidding they really don't that's a myth that's actually a myth they have actually very reasonable eyesight that's a myth you can look it up on wikipedia it's true oh yeah like a ramp we turn on him you are the night what is the sound of a bat coughing thank you it's the simple things let's check it out i'm going to look around a bit more anyway i'm looking around i'm trying to find out what happened to the bodies i know apparently from this roll that i'm in the mountains i got a six vex is making happy noises it's been so long since you've killed something innocent let's bring it we should probably leave i think they might it's a chalkboard well yes so i can now recognize where we are this is the most exciting map i've ever been handed whoa it won't fit in my folder what's this little outcropping does it that graveyard does not-- -- it is a surface graveyard there is a mausoleum-- -- but that-- -- is actually contained beneath the castle (all laugh) i was wondering that myself yes there is one i say we scope out the hidden entrance see if it's guarded see if they've discovered it the hidden entrance to the castle instead of using it i think we should possibly spend the night and get a view of the town see if there's anything unusual we could send a bird in or an invisible gnome or both an invisible bird-gnome if it's all vampires it'll be empty right now sam and yes i say we hide in the trees well it's about to be nighttime so we'll send a scout now that just got weird make sure you bring an earpiece let's roll again there was no way to get a good look at who it was actually i would love to natural 20 this is an 'i love you' for those awful rolls earlier that may be its name now i don't recognize her though she'll take that 14 leave the mug you say that out loud you'll hear a thump we have to wait it's basically a taser good good sticky thank you can i go with this unless you have a particular reason to-- legends say that before the castle was built that the journey into the valley was treacherous and stormy and the original builders of whitecastle feared they would die and this one great tree stood in the valley and it was underneath it that they took shelter and as they began to take shelter the storm broke and the storm did not return until the castle was completed we hold our festivals there every year as a gallow yes a very serious god tablet of apple i say in the morning we take a look at the passage see how well-guarded it is and if it looks dangerous sneak our way into the town if people are not enthralled if they are being forced to work then maybe we can find some allies i don't think they're happy i really wanted to ask what does peeing on a lemon tree have to do with anything thank you for bringing the text chat all the way back around i do in theory if i'm from-- a which 16 what rally the townsfolk this is something i think-- i don't think that sneaking in is necessarily the answer i'm not saying go in guns blazing but i say we let them know-- i want to build a rebellion i have a plan it does my plan is we do our best to sneak in we find cover obviously you said there's abandoned buildings we find cover we heal the tree i have some other ideas we take those zombie giants out one by one quietly okay let's start finding our friends and we start making friends we let them know we're back i have some parchment i have the thing i want to build while i'm in the tree it's very simple and i want to show you what it is i want to take some gunpowder and basically-- basically attach it to a piece of parchment i want to wet it into a piece of parchment and let it dry so that when i set fire to that piece of parchment i get a burn scar i'd like to create a burn scar thank you no it'll scar anything it just creates a very high heat like a mark not our mark the resistance i rolled a 23 does it change color when it loses its power damn it i want to know god damn it your poo power may come in very handy this is good to know a scat grenade scatlan so you can get a beret which is why i'm going to be wearing-- i haven't been seen in years and when i was seen i was much younger and honestly-- i had different hair yes they do they did which was disorienting i already have the hat i've been trying to think of what sorts of buildings would be the most defensible and the least likely to arouse suspicion things with basements that's too obvious i would almost say a shopping district if there's an abandoned storefront might be too close we're not going to be there for long we have food rations we have options i have a plan let's make our way in we find a place to at least set up our operation we don't let's get in and set up no we're going to stealth into the city isn't that dope do we have pass without a trace i'm wearing my hat too that's really good because i rolled a one 11 trinket looks like a donkey a milk cow donkeys can move more quickly this is true (goat bleat) thank you for the double 20 coming in from the west i wanna head through the city possibly in the direction of the cemetery yeah i wanna head in that direction what's changed they want it to be really dark i'm also thinking about that cemetery everything here is super creepy let's get east of the center square and set up camp actually i would say let's get a good look at the tree let's walk by it 23 i am walking the fuck away i'm a little curious-- is there anything around the tree other than us is there something at the base of the tree is there anything i should know what it is anyway we can't go anywhere near those buildings we have to stay as far away as humanly possible can i help oh never mind they invited us sticking with the plan going to go find something that's a decent distance away from the three noble households that has a reasonable view of the tree something with a second-floor view but with some distance meh six dust of tracelessness yeah this is where we're going to hole up yeah we're all going in not yet that's going to be the saddest brothel muscle relaxers is there a view of the tree it's a bit of a ways just so light doesn't leak out i'm going to tinker a little thing can i borrow an arrow thank you i'm going to tinker a very little easy thing i want to be able to fire and ignite one of the parchments on an arrow so that i can-- -- set a burn mark at a distance it would be a spark as opposed to actual flame it would just be concussive force it would be coiled hit release 16 there might be but just in case there's not i want to make sure this works i've got three of them so i've got options but i just want to make sure-- the only superpower more pathetic than aquaman's sorry had to hi aquaman hi aquaman hi aquaman hi aquaman it's what fish say hi aquaman hi aquaman put your hand in it yes let's eat you have at least one damn it you also get other bonuses or any of the other terrible people who live in this town because there are terrible people in this town i love you all so much i love you so much i have stuff to give you too 'cause yeah thank you for letting me roll with that by the way i had a funny feeling it would that was some mean shit man yeah no so that was it there was no banhammer guys thank you oh my god i'm so happy to be sharing this yeah we do thank you we're very sorry you dropped whitestone i wanna say we had a studio audience for this show as well which
