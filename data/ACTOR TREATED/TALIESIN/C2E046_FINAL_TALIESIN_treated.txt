(high-pitched voice) hey hey guys oh god let her never see that but then you'd have so much time to come up with a new character what no that's crazy i could use some solid land that'd be nice well at the very least maybe you should have nott try and open some of those funny locks on the books before we go so that you have an easier time getting into them i don't think we opened the individual locks on the books i think you just grabbed locked books oh and i grab this one too there was one more that you didn't get to see i don't know what it is i just picked it up seemed like the thing to do yeah anytime angry furniture a lot happened there was a doll too if i recall there was a doll there were some marbles dust a lot of books ooh did you get the marbles and the ink that's nice honestly we were trying to figure out what had happened my mother was a big believer in the buddy system growing up in the woods buddy system always should have a buddy we know oh yeah okay oh i see this yeah i was in a wall yeah i think that everybody here thinks that this is their fault raise your hand if you think what happened yesterday was your fault what do i roll 18 i usually find that if everybody thinks that they're the ones that did something wrong it's because nobody did everything wrong you just had a string of luck i think everybody did really good i think that we all got out of there i think that we all tried our best and we're going to do better next time i'm feeling very positive you survived a dragon you took a risk risks are okay got to be careful what risks you take but without risks we're never going to get what we want well i think we want breakfast then we can have a talk about that excellent i don't actually even know how to get off this boat we haven't done it properly in so long roll for first mate we're going to need to wash some dishes aren't we i'm walking towards where i think breakfast is natural 20 i was really looking forward to having no idea but apparently-- hold on i got yelp i cast yelp oh that's better i was like mm okay i can pick around the boar that shouldn't be a problem i don't eat boar i don't eat meat have you not noticed oh yeah no i mean we've barely cooked with any of it in the last month it's mostly seitan there's a few different things i use you can really get an effect it's-- making me call my vegan cooking not legit my god i'm mad right now there's a lot of paprika pasta burgers a lot of beets i'm excited for this pocket boar i'm going to try some mead not meat but i am going to try some mead it smells really sweet what's the sweetest thing you've got right now sure i think that sounds like a great idea this is going to go so well do you have anything that's more-- less meat i'll throw a little in on this that seems very fair back out back out insects supplies no sense reading two-thirds of a book let's finish this up see what it has to say (whispering) uk'otoa i think some bees would suit you you can talk to them i've talked to many bees in my time yeah i mean you just hey bees how're you doing yeah thank you for looking everywhere in that room that's really nice yeah it was crazy in there i mean that actually would have covered everybody the more you think about it wait was alive or not a joke i always get confused when people use the word not in a sentence was that supposed to be a-- though every time we did a little thing a little of that loot comes out caleb is actually not over here everyone was a little thrown by what happened it's worth a lot and probably we'll be a little more careful about poking things separately no it's the buddy system no blame going around we're doing the bee tour i'm going to try and find a blacksmith there may not be much time for such things but i was-- keisha possibly not seems like you have your hands full right now i was hoping to at the very least get a professional opinion about something that's what they tell me well i've recently taken to travelling which very new experience for someone of my disposition and i came across something interesting and i was curious if you had an opinion on what this is and how one might fix it i pull out a broken sword i was really hoping to be doing something with this at some point and giving it as a gift to a friend who could use a pick-me-up sadly i don't it may not exist oh that's all right they're definitely trying hard to get us to leave a little sooner than we'd necessarily like to has everything been all right by the way this seems like a lot of commotion well thank you so much for your time i don't know what i could possibly do in return other than offer my gratitude yeah i go in you want the spine lift all right oh thank you it was a pleasure i look forward to coming your way again one of these days this is awfully nice caduceus keisha it's a pleasure i will wander back to the bees i think i come wandering in about the point where they're saying hello bees because this is really all i want what do you want me to say to them i don't know hold on hold on let me do a thing i'm going to take a little bit of the tea out of my pocket i'm going to try and get a bloom going on my staff to try and get a flower to start going on if i can get something to start going a little bit it may not be temporary using the decompose i don't know if you'll let me do that well i can ask hey guys i don't have any flowers but i have some mushrooms i don't know if you'd be interested but you're welcome to come over and take a look it's probably going to rain pretty soon it's looking a little iffy they're working really hard right now you've never seen bees before wow we should fix that one of these days i got what i needed is it possible to put some basic supplies-- is the ship already well-supplied for a trip i'd say a little bit of spice so that the food that we're creating doesn't taste too bland would not be a bad idea because the magically-created food is spongy this is his favorite thing to do to hold a card and watch all of us wait for him to show it to us was is das das ist gut your body is a road map of pain (whispering) we're going to find the lost island of teddy ruxpin i'm ready for this shit let's bring it we're going off the map man probably need a special boat for that oh cool i didn't know that people don't tell me those sorts of things oh they might i just might forget you may have already told me i don't know i think that's a very good idea you made caduceus laugh oh no it's not even me laughing well i can think of worse plans than a nice bottle of wine with a card that says please don't stab me in the middle of the night you know i actually think that maybe not giving them the idea in the first place might be a better-- well yeah i think the big deal will be when we finally do find a little money making sure it spreads around a bit but bringing back some of the mead and dispersing it amongst the crew is definitely a sign that we're probably going to do that when we do that is very astute of you i have a confession i don't know what astute means i heard one of the crew use it so i'm hoping it means a good thing i was mirroring something somebody else said okay yeah you're looking for a sign me too well the skies were turning the wind was coming in and i honestly have to mention my knee hurts a little bit on the left side usually about an hour beforehand it was a thing my sister did it was 25 seasons ago give or take she's a piece of work she's great a piece of work yeah usually half a day before it rains yeah that's an amazing list of things that you are not i definitely could use some sleep way to grab that first not coreythall6 or you know he got right in there well done that's the nicest way anyone has ever put that thank you i think you're-- because the other one missed so i think you're at-- oh my god (snoring) (grunting awake) (sniffing) did you get hit by lightning wow hold on oh man no that's nice it's fresh hold on let's do something about that i'm going to do another quick cure wounds at a ridiculous level let's do it at third let's give you another 3d8 plus five to get that going what happened 21 you got a sign i mean (sniffs) yeah that's a sign you got hit you're pretty fried i don't know how to make this sound normal did it know you did it feel like it was there for you well somebody's paying attention congratulations you probably need some food where's your sword that's amazing well now that you seem to have the stormlord's attention now what now what i'll go to the kitchen and put the kettle on i think sometimes you're running toward something so fast that you don't remember why you were running in the first place i've had some moments like that with these people a couple times where i felt distant from what's important recently i've been thinking about this river in the northern forest it's not a big river you watch the river and every year it's a little different we used to make little leaf boats and put them down and watch them and every year it was a different path but it's all going to end up in the ocean eventually i think that you're going to be ending up in your destination real soon i think we're barreling toward it congratulations i'm going to go make tea (sighs) and i go make tea zoinks let's get some lemon juice and a candle the ship's name makes sense now the eater of balls everybody now i feel better about the whole-- it's a good name it works out been saving it oh that-- no although i did think about it no this is from home this is the cadence family if i recall it's very minty travis and i mean technically yeah it's true to surviving the mintiest we'll work on it eater of balls and now you have as well you just bested a ball we spent six days in that happy fun ball that's a lot of balls this is practically a ball pit yeah nice lightning strike as you said that by the way it was like-- i was enjoying it i'm not sure that elder gods work in baker's dozens you're welcome to stay although there might be a conversation about how much of the cut of whatever we find you get to keep yep take a look perception rolls perception with advantage that's awful that's terrible 14 nothing so far mr caleb i know this is not your favorite thing to do but we may require the use of your friend for a little while well i was hoping that maybe the cat would get uncomfortable in either a bird or an octopus form and do a little reconnaissance we're looking for signs of civilization on land or in the sea at the moment what are you-- your mind pictures are you hoping for that ladyhawke moment where you have a furry octopus one pat of just (growling noise) (yowling then slurping) there you go bud oh man well we may need a nap before we go down there but since the yasha thing oh in that case i'm going to manage my spells then yeah let's do it separately oh my god ten seems pretty clear maybe if you washed it every now and then it would have a slightly different-- i'll leave my tea kettle on board should be fine we'll find them we're all going to stare at you while you do this the book was about debate and then you were going to argue about-- it's a look no fear no straight roll six i'm going to do a little ping of eyes of the grave just to make sure there's no more of them in this other than the ones we can see 60 feet i know that we're heading-- once i feel like or maybe i should hit it again-- come on ah better 20 16 yeah i would have gotten an undead ping from any of them i didn't get an undead ping i'm relaying that to everybody very quietly it looks dangerous i think it's worth-- i'll stick with you just for fun i'll add into this with a sacred flame see if we can knock one out mine is a save against dex of 16 11 points of radiant damage is that with advantage oh cricket 13 can you get down there and hold an action well done you've already helped whoa good to know very low armor class easy to hit which is usually dangerous they're going to be trouble when they get in there do you want to have an action held though i'm going to move just behind yasha are any of them within range at this point 30 or 60 then i'm going to hold a spell until they're within range i'm going to hold bane underwater i'm going to hit three of them with bane three of them with bane it's a charisma saving throw i'm hitting the ones that have not been hit charisma yeah attacks and savings throws 1d4 just the first one negative d4 oh wait no not that one i'm so sorry not that one that one doesn't have the d4 i'm going to keep my distance i'm going to back up a little bit and i'm going to use sacred flame on the one that is in combat with yasha it's dex save do i want to do this yeah five points of radiant damage thank you 11 points of radiant damage thank you my brain is burnt is that with a negative d4 ruin everything i love bane so much where has it been all my life oh it's so hateful reduced to half does he get a bonus for that natural 20 does he get some sort of bonus to that natural 20 does that make something better about that i mean because i'm going to cancel it if it does anything i'm canceling it jesus yeah no i'm pretty uncomfortable about all of this yeah this is definitely getting very after-school special for me and the kid just brought out the bag of weed in the after-school special and i'm like oh oh the police officer came to our school and talked about this okay no (sighs) yeah all right let's do this i think that was the end of your ghost friend no that was the end i mean they already know we're here you want heavy in combat so you would want-- right as it begins hey look at that well not next week the 10th bless oh i love bless bless and bane man yeah yeah are we going to talk about the riegel in the room how do you have a dimple-- you have a movie star chin dimple it's right there the tongue is saving a woman tied to a railroad track we missed you so much still littered with candy canes
