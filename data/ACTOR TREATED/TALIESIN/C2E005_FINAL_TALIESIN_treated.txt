this is true i got bribed i'm purchasable putting that out there that got weird we're one episode in wednesday night don't send your gum significant improvement yes i'll have a donut thank you please i was just going there damn it bangarang what does not that old mean does it mean they're young is it good and do we gain or lose hit points it's change but travel is travel so oh yes we traveled forever it was constantly on the road once we left home we stayed moving oh things i'm not really much of a performer i'm more of-- help set up help run the shows help make illusions that sort of thing i guess you could say a techie i show off a little bit of the sword juggling i've got some things i was working on like this yeah little roll well it's a curved sword so not the curved ones but i could probably do a straight sword i'm not going to swallow a curved sword that would be very complicated to pull off i'm flexible but not that flexible i'm pretty flexible yeah i never nailed anything down for a really good act not my incense i'd like to see that i didn't know that i try do they look like they're unicorns 20 i'm fine with that hmm do these people look like they're in the mood to stop what's insight oh where do you see that oh there it is thank you 19 i'll balance one of the swords on my head and flash the cards and see if anybody bites they didn't poke the parents ah it's very good yes it means that you're on a cart can you get away with something like that and stealing is wrong but if you did it could you get away with it careful those fingers are loaded interesting i was going to say yeah i'll take a round i'm used to keeping an eye out on the road i'll sit with the cart for the first roll that would be actually extremely-- she's starting to believe i'd say let's get a bit off the road if possible it'll do set a tent start a fire they take an awful lot of time to put up you do know this there's a process oh it would be amazing i've done it it's great but this is nice too we can chop it up a single tear pours down a porcelain cheek i'm still sleeping welcome to human i'll take it turd watch six i literally don't know that's actually the problem travis it's been nice playing with you i thoroughly enjoyed your accent everybody back yeah you look it was it a lot of water i'm going to do something very weird i'm going to walk over and dampen my hand on the water on his chest really quickly and (sniffing) huh you don't know that only one way to find out he's not wrong though it actually is a pickle you can taste it yeah it's not bad level three where is the sword right now that's a great trick 23 this whole story i've been watching that's so disappointing all right unless he runs away he's fine i remember all of mine i don't know if you're going to vomit something salt water's pretty decent it could have been way worse oh it's far superior already you're proving to be an asset you can't drink-- the salt water makes you thirstier it feels like you should be able to but you can't does the horse have a name if it did i'll make one up try not to name them we're just going to end up eating them his name was winter's crest if he lived that long that was when we were going to butcher him and eat him you can rename him it's fine that was the plan it means you're going to eat meat and then you're going to make some jerky and then you're going to buy another horse with the money you make we celebrate everything just glögg lots and lots of glögg if you're on the road long enough you eat a lot of animals you eat a lot of beasts of burden i'll keep ugh i did until it bounced five i might be distracted looking for things that i can pluck out of the fields all right most of us can see in the dark it's not a big deal (singing) must be nice natural 20 so you go to your hp that's weird let's head that direction and start yelling at people travis and i'm going to stop one and ask what happened what has happened that's weird is this making my spider sense tingle can i track them okay okay all right i start one of my swords on the back of my neck liam  we are sitting ducks here what do we do fjord 21 i'm preparing how close am i to this thing does it see us i'm going to use vicious mockery at it really quickly i'm going to use vicious mockery i'm going to look at him with my eyes glowing and my sword glowing and in infernal say (rasping) the light comes to blind your eyes and burn your flesh yeah 1d4 yeah it's a wisdom saving throw yup so he takes three psychic damage and he has disadvantage on his next attack roll i'm going to use my bonus action-- yeah fuck it let's go for it-- i'm going to activate both swords should i yeah he may have licked a couple of them it's a very pretty die nine oh nope never mind yeah nine i want them to get a little closer anyway they're all far it's going to go great yeah this is what was coming i'm going to take a run am i going to do this am i going to be this idiot yeah let's be an idiot i'm going to take a run to try to get cover at the other house i'm going to try to run across the alleyway yeah dashy-dash yeah that's my round i just (zooming) there's one on the roof still too you get bonus actions all the time is this-- the damage may have-- yeah i don't know what the crown is concentration's gone you could even make it to get into his face hey i'm not used to melee combat this is so terrifying i don't want to get up in that i'm going to stab this thing that just fell right in front of me just going to stab it question about rite of the dawn is it just plus three or is it just my wisdom or is it also a-- okay this is not an undead creature so it's just an extra 1d4 okay just checking that's how that works okay cool see if i hit thank you 13 oh my god i hit it with the other one come on oh thank god 21 so that's nine points of damage yeah that's right i can break combat with it it doesn't matter right at this point or does it get an attack of opportunity there's no way i can circle up onto the wall is there yeah get a little vantage on him i want to be able to hop on because i want to head that direction afterwards all right and that way if he tries to run or do anything i can futz with him this is becoming a thing that's new dice man you made lemonade way to make some lemonade it will move slower if we kill them man i hate level three this is fine i know i'm being an asshole man i'm normally the one with shaky hands we can take out people pushing it does he have a spear i thought he had a bow oh he's got both no it does not hit i'm taking a slice at this guy again i don't have advantage anymore slice number one oh for fuck's sake ten slice number two that hits thank you 23 that's five points of damage and two points of extra damage i'm going to try and circle around it to get out of the way of the archers i'm going to hop back off and get behind him i like the theory that he doesn't burst into laughter he just holds the groan pain two and i've got one i'm going to snap at him i'm going to use blood maledict yeah no he ain't that is my armor class nope oh come on wait is it his turn already because i was going to run that way too i thought we were still-- okay so i will-- i was going to run to see where the cart was going full dash no i wouldn't is he triggering my spider sense at all okay i know but you know that's why it's like a bear this was just our little patch our gnoll patch now's not the time he is so down you got to be fucking kidding me really oh i'm down thank you what were you thinking that's literally the only thing that's been happening i'm going to put out these fires oh i'm not getting up i'm going to crawl back towards the-- that was weird there were what turns them like that is there something in the water word came word came that they were in the south where did word come from petting zoo well and we're going to need some lodging anyway so perhaps some trade could be worked out it's literally glowing like a candle right now i feel really bad for saying that out loud i'm fine with the floor was there beer downstairs was there ale i'm going to drop my things and run downstairs is there drink is there smoke i'll take something interesting fast or slow how much nonsense what's top-shelf price i put a gold on the table consider it an advance it's been a rough night for everybody and i'm going to sip this mother that sounds nice i'm going to sit and sip this and grin and very silently have a mild nervous breakdown about what just went down this is working out weirdly i'm excited we now need to have a stephen chow night that was some crazy shit
