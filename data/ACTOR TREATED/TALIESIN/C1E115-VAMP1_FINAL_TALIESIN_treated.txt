finish it finish it i dare you (cheering) this is syrinscape i hit a random button in their creepy asylum set it's rocking we have some announcements that in theory i was supposed to have but i don't i know some of them off the top of my head you can start there with backblaze you and me fucking both wow it's only uphill from here that's good that was beautiful oh yeah i was about to be nerdy enough to say that all vampires in the white wolf universe are picked up by electronics yeah there's only one clan that even is not reflected in the mirror i know some of this i don't know all of it i remember some of this from high school got to be able to larp this stuff do we have anything new in merch putting it out there for anyone watching that i don't have the rest of the announcements so if there's anything that anybody wanted me to say they should put it on here with a piece of paper at some point we're going to be doing slave labor graphics on wednesday club it's going to be johnny the homicidal maniac and all sorts of gothy comic books for halloween we're going to be doing gather your ghost tomorrow because it's funny when i do a show three days in a row four days in a row here you had free time you could have pulled that together trying to think if there was anything else off the top of my head i feel like i'm missing something for the record this is intimidating holy cow i feel like i want to adjust my desktop settings this is a lot you should be this is evil and terrible this is a brand-new game system so we're going to be taking it slow for those of you at home who know vampire the masquerade this is going to be a very barebones thing we've cut a lot of fat we've cut a lot of something we've cut a lot of limbs from this baby but it is going to be dark there are going to be hints of what's going on in the real world but we're keeping this very insulated so it's not going to be a lot of world-building ah thank you no don't forget to submit your gif and fanart of the week to submit@talksmachinacom you're still in batman which is great i don't know if we're talking about thrashtopia yet but eventually we're talking about thrashtopia because thrashtopia's cool cr podcast is now available through amazon alexa apparently which i did not know it's available on amazon echo echo dot echo plus and other alexa-enabled devices just say alexa how do you want to do this and it plays i don't know how things work i think that's what ben wanted me to say ben this'll be a d10 system so everyone remembers it's going to be a six and above is a win i'll explain the red dice we're going to take this through and it's going to be really weird i am so sorry for everything that's about to happen i'm going to try to maintain my cool ladies and gentlemen boys and girls hopefully people who are not too young to be scarred for life prepare for critical role goth vampire edition [dramatic music] (laughter) it's not going to save you all right when we last left off we were finishing up a very emotional very heavy and intense episode of critical role we're going meta people it was a tough time everyone went home we packed up our stuff made our way out to our cars in the parking lot and that's the last thing you remember before it all went black you have been away for some time you don't know how long it's been you don't know where you are you don't feel quite right you feel disconnected something's a little off you're hungry you're thirsty you're not entirely sure but you're waking up and it is pitch black can you see anything take a look it's very dark and there's nothing around you're lying on your back each of you alone yes you are in a coffin (yelling) you're a voice actor you call that shouting the sound is deadened by the thick wood and the fabric yeah give me a strength plus melee a ten and a six that's two successes oh no liam something's wrong you go up to touch your face and it doesn't feel right it feels like papier-mache there's something weird laura you rolled how many how many did you get strength plus melee you have to always use at least two of the red whatever red you have you have to use you give a sharp push and the top of the coffin cracks a bit it snaps you're welcome you're feeling a little queasy you're not feeling good you got to hold on one success all right you give it a push and it moves a little bit got a little shove the coffin cover cracks in half that's as far as you've gotten yours got a good little shove if there was something to see outside you would see something but there's not yet you start to hear a little bit of a squeak you feel something wriggling around inside the box with you if a mouse were bigger that's a good guess it could be something rat-ish i don't know do you you're definitely feeling hungry and it does strangely smell appetizing give me a dex roll give me dex athletics just to be fun see what that does yeah top of physical these are complicated it's going to take a second two failures are the two failures on red dice okay you grab the rat and it bites you but you're holding on you're still not feeling very well you can't react yet not yet but soon you're still a little weirded out by your face you're still in your coffin you feel wood i suppose there's another layer of wood above you no light not yet do you want to do something with that rat take a big bite of that rat all right so give me one of your red dice no that's good mark your hunger if you have a pencil to just one x just one i love that show you're feeling a little better you're feeling a little more clear-headed this is not a good situation you did just eat a rat i'm going to point out it's not that you're not hungry any more you're still hungry you're just feeling a little better no you're good now give a good push give me either yeah fun strength brawl or strength athletics to see if you can push it off you got the coffin lid about halfway off now you can almost make out a layer of wood above you yeah strength brawl or strength melee i'll give you options now two failures on the red ooh that's interesting i'm learning how this works one second things can happen man i'm not going to say i'm so sorry i'm trying to find my one hunger yeah you don't feel well at all you start scratching at your wrists you start digging in a little bit you're going to take one damage and you're going to start sucking your own blood because things are getting weird you're going to take one damage and sadly you're getting a little weird i'm going to give charisma animal ken that's a good idea it thinks that you are the nicest sweetest most wonderful person and is so excited that it may get to play with you and be a part of the game it comes over and it's really-- you're two dice worth of hungry right now man that's pretty hungry it's not that cute a pescatarian would probably eat it all right good for you your hunger's at one give me one of your die you actually just knocked-- poor guy it's okay he's going to sleep i'll get him his coffin later you snap that in half and now you've just got wood one failure with the red you crack through but some of the wood splinters and gets lodged and you're going to spend a minute trying to pull some chunks of wood out of your fist that was a good shot though you've got to catch the rat how are you going to catch the rat how are you going to catch it gotta catch 'em all they like disney films cheese amazon gift cards you're going to do pirates of the caribbean let's give you manipulation animal ken one failure on red you grab it you take a bite you're going to lose one of those red die but you are going to feel a little nauseous about this whole process you are in a coffin i'm amused by the throwing of the dice all right yeah you got a second you hear someone claiming to be an internet celebrity i feel like i should be able to bleed you for that there's no lock no it was just sealed you're starting to hear that you're obviously in a small group together rocky you've managed to make your way out you can crawl out you take a look and you're on a set you don't see their fingers but you do see you're on a set it looks pretty familiar it might be the nerdist set hasn't it turned us all into vampires we'll get to that the little light wall is sparking and flickering this place is even more trashed than normal someone went through here there's already a giant hole in the floor that's been blown through and there are red x's in a circle and you've come out of one of them you can see some of the wood has started to give a little bit and you can hear the tapping coming from the ground yeah sure give me a strength brawl all right yeah practically like bruce lee you punch down and the floor splinters open and there's laura bailey with blood all over her face it's rat butt man even a vampire has some standards you're making a lot of assumptions give me either strength brawl or strength melee as long as there's no failure on the red it doesn't matter you punch through quite easily it goes all right yep that does it it doesn't go well but you get it open actually five/two that's fine liam does not look healthy he looks almost like everything froze and cracked like he was wearing a plaster mask that started to go i would recommend leaving sam but yeah you can roll together and we can add all of your successes together there's also a thing i'm going to remind you you can do if you really don't like your roll although i would save this for later you can spend a willpower and reroll all the dice you don't like but then your willpower goes down two tens you hop over to matt's little x oh failures so you walk over to matt's little x and you kick down real hard and you go straight through all the way down to the bottom he's fine was it a real failure as long as it's not a one it doesn't matter a failure is a one on a red die six and above yeah you don't have to worry about anything other than-- he looks all right you guys look like maybe you've been clubbing you're a little pale yeah was going to say yeah pick which baby but yeah no that'll work you do not have your phones on you you want to actually take a look around maybe why don't you do a perception awareness roll man you heard another rat rolling around and you're eyeing it not everyone has eaten a rat yet i think there's one more rat around you should go looking for that a ten and a seven yeah that'll do it this is the most wb vampire since the wb vampires so there's no one here and it's kind of messed up oh plus three something is wrong including a giant sign on the wall painted in blood that says something is wrong no to be fair with the size of the palette it looks a little bit like fingerpainting it's way too good-looking to be part of the thrashtopia set how would you know it's a little dark liam does not look okay a bunch of them are broken and it looks like they've been smashed all of the furniture the table and the two chairs in that section have been completely thrashed up and broken up there's damage everywhere it looks like a riot came through here yeah it's maple syrup it doesn't quite taste like maple syrup how much do you taste try again give me one of your blood tokens it's not maple syrup but it tastes better than anything that you've ever experienced in your entire life you feel great just one that's all you're getting but you're hungry you're all hungry so are you going to push towards the twitch studio or push towards the hallway towards the twitch studio you sadly can't quite get to it because there are piles of film memorabilia there's a power ranger helmet there's a foosball table it is just-- not in the condition it's in you can snap off a chair leg that's okay give me a strength athletics i suppose i'm still getting used to-- yeah give me a perception awareness oh well a perception investigation oh yeah it snaps right off you've got a broken chair leg you don't even have to roll for that it's everywhere that'll work great oh yeah three and three including one crit boy do you find that rat suddenly-- rats are made of paper which one did i hand you again boy you really saw that rat and you got it you catch it and are you going to give it a bite give me a die and you're at one hunger by the way your hunger level's however many red dice you have right now not on the nerdist set they're not that cool sorry i'm going to be throwing so much shade it's going to be really bad there are but that door is not opening you're going to have to maybe-- you can check to see if it'll open are you going to be-- are you going to try and be stealthy about it super stealthy how quietly are you going to open the door yeah give me a dex stealth you start to vanish as you're pushing the door you're get a little-- you let me know when you want to want to use it and i'll tell you what roll to make but there are rules to it right now you can try and get fancy with it later and it might get fancy but play around see what works and what doesn't you don't know how this shit works you can open the door very quietly the lights in the hallway are flickering they're not working well they've got that weird fluorescent crackle when things are left to go to rot you can hear the hum of the server room right across from you and some sort of squishy sound coming from the server room there's some sort of awful (squishy noises) i literally have their location written in my notes that makes me so happy really they're at least at the table and there's something happening in the server room it's dark in the kitchen but you can't quite tell what's happening everyone roll a dex stealth since you did so well i'm going to let you walk one through although that's not quite how it works no i'll let you go two tens all right you guys make a little bit of noise and-- --there's noise there are things you don't see anybody but you can hear stuff moving around so the big door the big door for the twitch studio i mean yes as long as you're not pointing in the game because then you're pointing at the front but if you're pointing at the table then yeah that's the door i'm trying to find my points (creepy ambient sound repeating where are you) yeah there's some weird sounds coming from everywhere but there's a big bloody sign written on the main door to the twitch stage it says i was born in a box how do i end with a question mark and below it is a circle that's been drawn in blood and set into four corners in one corner is a heart in another corner there's a face in the other corner is a glowing sun and in the other corner is a cross with a circle it's a circle cut in four with a heart a head a sun and a cross right does anybody actually have a card key that gives them access to the prop closet where is it the foosball table is missing the couch has been overturned there are in fact for some strange reason lucky charms in the cabinet you can go ahead and have a handful they taste like rat droppings you can still taste them it's the worst thing ever the marshmallows are like fuzzy bits of lint inside of rat droppings i'm so sorry it doesn't taste right reroll stealth before you do dex stealth oh no what's your current hunger yeah your forehead starts to elongate a little bit and your eyes begin to glow you start to kind of have a little bit of a twitch and you're getting a little feral you do see your reflection in the server room window are you looking in the server room window that's not a server whatever's in the server room it doesn't quite look like a server if they made them out of meat matt taliesin and normally i wouldn't do this on this but it's amusing me so even though this was a failure i figure i may as well hit that now since you started to change the server is pulsating and thwapping against the window like it's trying to get out how close to the window-- make a perception roll into the window you can do perception investigation if you like or perception awareness one failure on the red die you are suddenly panicked when you realize-- you get distracted for looking in the room when you realize that you can see marisha's reflection but you don't see yours suddenly the door to the server room bursts open it flies open as you stop you see dani carr with a big smile on her face a very big smile on the face and a tea set and she ignores you and takes the tea over into the geek & sundry bullpen humming a little tune as the door shuts behind her with whatever's writhing and wriggling in there she didn't seem to acknowledge you she looked a little gaunt definitely but her eyes had sunken in a little bit and her skin was a little too tight for her skull everything looked a little thinned and darkened to the bullpen to the geek & sundry bullpen to marisha and sean's office in the back how close are you going to get she's ignoring she takes the tea set if you can look around into sean's office humming the whole time the door shuts behind her you couldn't get a good look at what's going on the lights again are all a little iffy if you're crawling in that direction you can definitely start taking a look around and see what's up there as i find my bullpen other than a commemorative chun li statue the foam one are you going into the geek & sundry bullpen chris is in the bullpen chris is ignoring you chris is sitting at his desk and his eyes have sunken all the way almost into the back of his head his mouth is very terse and he's wearing a sign and he's working on the socials you also see that the window has been blocked and covered they look like people wearing some weird makeup who are very dehydrated and they're all wearing signs around their neck and really trying hard-- are you going in enough to see it as far as you can see so far between chris sax arcade and audrey they are all occasionally making eye contact with you but not really keeping it and they're all wearing signs that say drink me sam and they are terrified is anybody above a hunger three right now three or above do you have three red dice or is everybody at least at two matt laura and they smell weirdly good there's an almost candied sensation they smell like the first bowl of lucky charms you ever had in your life they are all sitting at their desks either working or pretending to work it's hard to tell dani comes bursting out of the office without a tea tray sits down at her desk and meets your gaze yeah oh you're all awake that's great sean doesn't drink tea that's true no no sean's working on the server who can say that's just a matter of opinion that could be anything i'd have to ask upstairs i could write an email of course of course i know what's going on that's my job i know what's going on i don't understand the question that's odd oh they're having a creative meeting right now the creative team this is most assuredly an ldn thing (laughter) yeah yeah yeah give me a perception investigation because you don't have an awareness issue that thing in there is definitely meat and it's some sort of weird-- it's built out of a lot of different things and it seems to be interconnected to something that goes up higher into the building it's part of some sort of machine it smells kind of good not great but it smells pretty good but it's locked not that you can tell how well and intimately do you know sean could you recognize him by just parts you don't see his head anywhere i'll go that far man i warned y'all yeah if you look really closely you tell that there's parts that were not ground up appropriately and are definitely-- chris is frozen with fear there is a foam sword by his-- he almost tells you not to take it and then thinks better of it when dani looks at him we won't know what's going on until the creative meeting is over you would have to talk to them yay you go into the creative meeting you walk in inside are eric and i think it's matt key eric's sitting on the little green grass carpet they've got the tea set out there's a couple different tea cups and he's sitting there having a sip of tea weirdly whitney moore is sitting there with him they look normal except their eyes there's large black circles around their eyes and their mouths are blackened over in this very weird gray puffy mold it's almost like there's a mold around their mouths and eyes in the corner is matt key who is working on an ipad but it's only the arm and the head of matt key he seems to have sprouted spores there's an old flowering pile of gray mushrooms that still have matt key's face and hand as he's working in the corner that has crawled up and covered the window eric and whitney see you come in and go oh thank god marisha we've been waiting it has been very weird come down have some tea it's just what you need as they sit and drink tea have you ever seen a telephone in this place there was an extra hole in the ground and i was already broken open that's all i'm going to say they're giggling a lot and they're talking about dad dad's coming back any second now dad has plans have some tea we'll explain everything taliesin was here taliesin left he went to go deal with something but taliesin was here out you're going to walk towards the front door laura and you don't know you actually haven't seen a working window yet so far eric and whitney see you do this and laugh their ass off and then key key put that in put that in that's great that's great aw matt matt genius no we're going to use that key has a smile and he's writing everything down he's just ipad-ing key key buddy you doing all right roll a straight dexterity roll dexterity dodge let's get weird all successes except for one he's been writing down everything the two of them have said oh yeah it's all there he's taken down every note of everything he can hear no it's a creative meeting he writes i voice doctor strange i love doctor strange key it's gray and weird looking all right roll stanima laura marisha and stamina roll stanima what am i going to add to that just roll stanima-- i can't say it right i know so just a failure on the one-- okay but a success on the reds nothing this is going to sound weird roll charisma persuasion there's still tea it doesn't matter where a failure is just tell me the number of successes okay and the other red didn't hit a one it doesn't matter failures it's just successes so it's fine so two successes actually hold on that's right i can do this i've got a thing for this key actually twitches and you hear this snap of a whole bunch of mushrooms and spores as his neck (clicks) there's a little puff were you close enough to sniff it we're going to add that in it's going to be great oh yeah we have alpha money we've never had this kind of money before they're letting us do so much did you sniff the snorts spores (mispronouncing) sniff the spores sniff the s'mores there were s'mores but-- roll stanima just tell me what happens feels good to be on the other end of this doesn't it fuck off yes (laughter) yeah you're fine nothing weird you do notice that the tea they're pouring is red and it smells pretty good no arwen probably for the best because i'm not that you know so as you sip the tea eric and whitney giggle talk and make notes there's a big thing happening tonight there's going to be a big new change to the show and as soon as we get that little lock problem off of the twitch stage everything will be great we've been trying to figure out how to open the twitch stage and there's a little lock and he's very excited for you to figure out his little puzzle he says it shouldn't be too hard for people like you to figure out we've been talking to father father has been helping us redesign the show it's going to be really good no (giggling) no he's very excited though he's very excited for you to figure out his little riddle it's going to be good you should figure out his riddle can we help you i mean i know you're not supposed to be in this meeting we're really thankful that you're here but-- sure but we kind of had the room it tastes good it tastes a little weird it tastes really good tastes like blood it's a little bitter it's good we'll find out won't we you want to hustle as you turn the corner to the front door-- yeah of course it is as you turn the corner lego hardwick has been propped up in front of a red velvet curtain with a sign that's blocking off the whole front it says your funeral somehow he looks less creepy i'm not entirely sure how they pulled that off matt really quickly roll a wits and willpower hold on you felt a weird push towards that curtain that you can't quite identify that was very odd that's very strange he gets just far enough to grab his hand onto the curtain and a beam of daylight comes streaking right through and hits you square in the head he doesn't cry out no nothing happens slowly the two halves of you separate at the head and matt mercer drops into a pile of ash (shouting) just ash marisha there is nothing funny about this you shouldn't be laughing you're not there oh shit well you certainly are hearing screaming now you are having the best creative meeting ever by the way it's not going to help you you can you hear thunderous sounds of something being tossed around really violently upstairs like somebody is doing demolition up there and then it suddenly stops you can see from your vantage point everyone in the front office of geek & sundry looks up and then goes right back to work like trying to pretend that nothing happened you do not get that far do you try and stand up yeah what did we learn about drinking the tea i will also say while it is not sun tea it is sean tea it is made of sean with a hint of mushroom for flavor as you go to stand up from the grass you notice that-- your legs have turned into little mushrooms in the grass and they're starting to push through your abdomen as well and come up through your throat make a stanima-- a stanima roll just kind of a simple one ones are the only fail there's a big x when you go wrong the stuff starts sticking to you in a way that you don't like and it burns a little bit you probably want to wipe your hands off and while you were wiping her off it was starting to go straight through the skin like there was nothing under there other than mushrooms and that's the last thing marisha ever said (shouting) she leans right over and you've got powder on your hand (shouting) suddenly christian bursts into the room he is covered in blood and says can you keep it down he does you guys are making a lot of noise and people are trying to work god and he goes back out actually dani's one of the few who isn't he said i had to i'm sorry i can't-- he's not in a mood to talk he does smell-- well no you're at one you're fine suddenly the creative room stops all eyes turn to liam and they slowly start to get up you have hamilton tickets whitney and eric slowly move towards you and as they open their mouths a little wider you see that there is nothing in there it's just a void in their mouths let's do dexterity with brawl three successes you get her right in the face she falls down with a big cut right across her face this black dust comes poofing out of it like soot she's giggling on the floor rolling around in laughter the whole room starts to bend glitter and shift everything's getting a little soft in there maybe you've been breathing too many of the spores how do you feel like you're seeing things you're either seeing something or you're not if you're seeing it it's either real or it isn't it doesn't feel good it feels like things are going to turn on you at any second it's up to you if you backed up with everybody strength brawl strength brawl get weird what's your power again okay never mind i know what your power is six successes no fails your foot goes right through the center of him in a big poof of soot when you pull out he is again on the ground hiccuping in a laugh and the shoe you were wearing is now a different shoe than you have on your other foot it's not a nice shoe it's definitely a ross men's for less shoe dani's looking at all of you she is i agree yes i know jazz hands not at the moment her eyes do have the weird little mold there's a little bit of the mold the closer you look the lips and eyes little bit of the gray mold going on no dani goes into her desk and she pulls out a key card for you all and a little wooden stake she's like you should probably get going there's a lot of work to do if you're going to make it to the twitch show on time she goes back to working on her unpowered laptop everybody's is black screens everybody's typing on nothing they don't have as much of the-- they're still there they're not giggling no arcade's trying to not even look at you guys there's another huge thump above from the offices above and the sounds of knives scraping into walls and glass what power do you have right now something feels weird but it doesn't quite work right you don't know what you felt but you felt a little vibration good vibration yeah you felt a little twitch he looks afraid but he's cowering a little bit what am i going to do roll a d10 how many red do you have right now roll a d10 you have a moment when you touch him where you really think about tearing right into that throat your fangs start to grow bit of both you don't want to go upstairs you can try and drag him i want to stay here what's the roll for that to be fair i'm going to let you have this you can hear all of this travis i have a gift for you not until the sun sets dust and mushrooms we are marrying dust and mushrooms in a little while when we come back we will be going to the twitch area you guys are adorable i'm having fun torturing you all i've got so many worse things to happen guys thank you for enjoying my attempt to hang onto these rules that i've written down things are going to get a little weirder because i'm going to inform of them of a couple new rules that they can now play with since they're starting to vamp out a bit more sadly two of our party are dead and are going to have to not come back to the table you rolled really high i was going to shove you out there because you are what you are it's in an inside joke that probably 100 people watching our stream right now are like oh i know what matt was it was kind of cute nothing you need to know about until maybe next week we'll talk about it guys thank you so much i think we're going to have a giveaway for something in the chat and i believe we're going with bloodbath i hope you're enjoying this madness it's going to get weirder and i hope you enjoy where we're going with all this we'll be back in a few minutes once we've watered or had other things to drink we'll see you soon dude i get the theming i'm kind of-- two nasty little children gone four sweet little children left the winner of our in-chat giveaway is cloaked_roamer won a wyrmwood set of ill-repute that i'm not entirely sure of what it is or what it does but it is a thing and i'm far too nervous trying to run this game with all of these papers that i'm so glad you can't see-- it does apparently cloaked roamer and then i'm doing a little thing to help you guys out really quickly before we come back to the game so that i know what i'm doing because this is crazy i hope you all are having a good time and just to remind you what's painted on the floor when we get there no you've heard that no a foam sword i think she may have given you a keycard also because she was just-- i'm having fun in the most terrifying way possible oh man this is intense i don't even know if this is a high i'm not sure what this is this is jumping out of an airplane without a parachute but knowing that it's foam underneath so yeah let's pick back up for some reason my volume is-- so you make your way back quietly through the mess there we are jesus i'm going to switch to another one see what happens i don't know what any of these audio buttons do so it's fun for everybody i'm reeling it in it's good you know you could probably hear that from somewhere we'll deal with that only i know don't think i don't have plans so you make your way do you want to go through the hallway or through the nerdist office i have the blueprints to the whole building right here i know where every window is i know where every office is yeah make a perception investigation roll yeah anybody who wants to make perception investigation roll perception plus investigation which is right below it that will do what's your hunger level just the only one not for one you get distracted going through people's stuff and you're going to get left a little behind you'll be at the back of the line by the time this is done three successes no you didn't find anything you've found it i'll tell you what you did find you found a playstation vr system but very used it was already a little iffy but it's definitely not been happy for the past however long it has been like lucky charms he was wandering-- he went into the corner to elise's desk and he found underneath her desk something that will do it's a replica knife that seems to be pretty solid it's a lord of the rings replica elf knife it's not exactly sharp but it will do the trick oh you're going for that all right roll a d10 we're doing that next roll a d10 okay so what's your roll i mean what's your-- and it's just straight-up let me double check just because i'm learning how these powers work i know i'll find it and what's your roll for that four make a intelligence versus willpower roll oh just intelligence and willpower yeah you roll that charisma plus persuasion i'm making this a versus because normally it's not but this is weird two success do you want to burn a willpower to reroll reroll everything you don't like and burn a willpower he's your bro man and also take an extra die you're here to keep everybody safe but you're-- on the vr i think i was going to have you roll to see if you get pink eye but never mind i feel so bad i'm so mean to nerdist nothing of event walking through here nothing weird you're at the door there's the big circle you're in the kitchen again there's the big circle on the floor and there's the bloody sign on the big door no it's-- the funniest thing of course is there's prob-- well no i guess there would be a little power to it it's probably pretty glitchy so yeah you get to the stage again and big red letters that says i was born in a box how do i end something is wrong make an intelligence test no just sam straight intelligence test no straight intelligence test you fucker i have your stats here okay you know me i've been busy all week this is not a word scramble i don't have time for that shit thank you and there is a circle on the floor or a head or a face i followed you nothing happens they were born from a tube sorry how much you overestimate me no when you put the stake on the ground by the heart there's this low bassy thud the blood that the heart was drawn with start to turn black and crackle and it boils there gently this is a big building you don't see anybody the keycard does in fact open the prop closet it's a very good keycard that's better than my keycard yeah the prop closet opens you can hit the switch doesn't turn on to be fair you can see okay you don't see-- especially if you want to burn a little blood you can see really well if you're looking for something in particular but it's the prop closet it's a ruined dishevelled mess of ephemera toys prop weapons costumes it's exactly the way you remember it yes but it is the same smell it's always had which has been very iffy i don't know it's whatever you really imagine the wonderful-- there's obviously some rats living in here if you went diving for them it was pretty good all right do a perception investigation you can take a look you find a rubber rat and you bite it i'm personally a fan of the taste of rubber rats i think it's nice and the texture's pretty positive but your tooth gets a little weird it doesn't feel right three successes ooh that's pretty solid you do in fact find a rat hiding behind one of the costume bins and if you want to tear for it you got to give me a dex melee or dex brawl roll for it all right punch that rat where are you guys going audrey was there max was there a couple of people it's a rat i'll let you have it for one no how many red dice do you have it doesn't go away drink me he's going to try and fight you off he starts to panic and as it is happening he's going to fight you off what's the roll on that all right give me charisma intimidation and my charisma willpower for my humans there we are he's not frozen he's hiding in the corner which t-shirts thank you for being respectful there's a single tear no i get the distinct impression this has already happened they know what's going down are you going to go for a bite give me a strength brawl let me double-check hold on actually strength brawl plus two one on the red he manages to just barely fight you off he's hidden under the desk now he's trying to crawl away give me a strength brawl plus two all right you get one point back you lose one do you want to go any further keep drinking or do you want to-- i'm sure there's a way to do it he's now bleeding from the neck as he goes back to his-- not pouring but bleeding are you backing out of the room now to join the rest not that you can see you've seen that office everything's ridiculous perception investigation you can combine your roll if you like good call perception investigation as you walk by you see dani come walking through the office she smiles walks by you see her go into the office and she says chris we need you to help update the server come on and then she walks by carrying the bleeding chris over to the server room sam do you-- no i'm just waving this two tens that's a critical that is a critical you have found some world of warcraft prop swords see i did know where they were i did there were right here i know you're not watching marisha i knew where they were you found some prop stakes but to be fair a prop stake is still a piece of wood that's still stake-y you found two stakes and you found a very weird silver chalice it's interesting-looking could be something could be nothing no idea ren-faire style it's made out of a metal actually what's your strength that's pretty good that's a 110 pound-- that's a normal human you're not quite supernatural but you could be fine with it it's a good dagger it's the s-curled one it's got the nice little-- i know you know there's still time things can still get weird we'll see it's slightly smaller than a children's four-square court it's bled up into the door it feels like it's some sort of seal against the door itself that's really fascinating the ashes start to mix with-- can't believe you did that so frustrated the ashes start to mix with the sun symbol and it starts to boil well you didn't bring any of the mushrooms because they looked a little-- he doesn't he wiped them off my god we've finally found a part of-- the recording booth door is locked yeah you don't have anything fancy for that do a strength athletics just for fun that's a tough door though (sighs) man i was really hoping-- well it's okay i honestly wanted that door to survive because it's the most obnoxious door in the entire building it's the most obnoxious door in the entire building it's the only one the keycard won't open i don't know why but that door comes off its hinges and pops open it goes flying off oh yeah in the darkened room you can see in the corner there's two twitch hosts cuddled up hiding they've been down there-- no it's not erika it appears to be amy dallen and jody houser hiding in the corner jody has been furiously scribbling because she's afraid she still actually has a deadline if she ever gets out of here amy dallen has been slowly building a little fort out of the computers to stave off whatever it is that's been-- jody amy and jody it's okay i've been doing a lot of josie lately travis it's not safe shut the-- oh there's things out there you don't-- oh there's bad things out there yeah of course you don't need to be invited in really i'm glad you asked though it's very polite yeah they saw it but-- they're hip to what's going on and you do not look like what they're afraid of they're not afraid of you yet yeah just food and drinks that's all we've just-- mm-hmm nothing no i mean food and drink they've got a stash of-- they obviously raided a terrible nerdist shoot for cheetos and whatever and weirdly yet another box of lucky charms i don't know why we have so many of them does anybody-- so depending on how loud you were they probably couldn't hear you yeah it opens just fine man you are nervous as far as you can tell it's just food and drink what's the roll for that or a perception against people i believe so who are you running it against and you can use it to figure out things like what kind of creature someone is you can get a notion of how they're feeling yeah jody may have snapped a little it's tough to tell sure make the roll and i'm going to use my fancy rolls now because things are going to get weird have a blood die that one after i think you get it next roll three successes no failures and what's it versus for her that is something you do hear but it's coming from somewhere oh yeah she's scared but she's been here for a while and it's tough to tell how long and has gone into full fight-or-flight mode and has definitely gone fight and you definitely get the sense that and you can read this from her aura she is human and she has killed something within the last 72 hours you don't know what (sighs) there was a man he was older i didn't recognize him and he came with people there was some creature and something's wrong with ivan and-- there was these things with these large eyes and these vacant mouths and i fought one and then we've been hiding in here i don't know how long yeah they do that it is i would say it's been a long couple days except i don't know how long it's been how about you put the door back and we'll reinforce it and then knock seven times when the coast is clear because no one will knock seven times because that's ridiculous yeah it's pretty bare there's just the desks and a decent rough cut of thrashtopia rolling on one of the monitors that's flickering good man wow that's a nice vampire that's good where are you at three all right we'll see how we feel in a minute cool that's a great question because you have a second-level version right you're going to be super sneaky you're going to burn a blood for that roll a d10 what did you get oh yeah you get-- actually this is not the normal rolls this is me doing terrible things because this is a short game you turned practically invisible but it cost you so you're going all the way back past the library things start to get very weird back there so as you turn the corner the ground starts to slowly get dark and strangely inky that whole office that you're used to seeing has been cleared and is empty there's a table in the middle of the room and in the darkness you can't quite see the walls it's like you turned the corner and there's a table almost in a void and at the table are four people playing cards it's ivan ivan van norman is playing cards with amy vorpahl and damion poitier and sam they're all sitting playing cards ivan-- no the other sam and sam are playing cards it's not a game you recognize ivan's having a great time everybody else looks a little nervous they do ivan smells pretty good but ivan smells a little burnt and his hair is-- what is the most terrifying thing i can say about hair it's like yahoo serious hair that is the most terrifying thank you it's standing up like he's been shocked like he's been putting his tongue in a socket oh yeah they're all the way out they don't and it would be-- damion's back is to you although sam has just pulled a card they're showing the card and they're showing the card to ivan you can't quite make out what ivan's saying but sam's not having a good time about it and is arguing with the rules for some strange reason and out of nowhere a large spider comes out and pulls very quickly sam entirely away from the table whatever is back there and then a chair floats into view and rolls up to where sam was you just heard screams and a spider clack of (muffled sounds) ivan turns amy you're up yeah ivan's running a game and it's amy's turn that might be difficult but you can give it a try there's no roll for that second obfuscate you just burn and you do it right roll a wits stealth it's okay this will work just fine oh yeah yeah you do two failures on the red all right this is fun how hungry are you here's the deal you're going to get seen but we'll deal with that because i want you to make a note you are hangry as in life no i have options here and i'm going hangry you are down three on any persuasion or subterfuge rolls because you are not going to be subtle or cunning about anything until you feed you're going to be really on edge amy vorpahl frighteningly pulls a card puts it down closes her eyes ivan pulls the card looks at it smiles not yet and then ivan turns to amy and amy it's like every piece of her rotates 45 degrees against itself not like meat but like glass and then she shatters like a mirror and then a new chair pops right up no it's just glass no she smelled pretty good ivan turns to you but damion has not seen you okay you have surprise on him but not ivan ivan's going to allow it roll-- actually since this is surprise roll wits this is going to be weird roll wits and stealth i'm going to make this a weird one yeah try it again how much are you going to eat him are you going to eat him a little some or a lot okay not all of it one success that didn't count because that hit paper ignore me boy he did not see you coming nope yeah but only one point worth because that was not a lot of success he's very conscious and aware that something is on his neck right now and he's freaking out he's going to take a swipe at you yeah he's a big guy he's currently wearing my jacket too so if you get any blood on my jacket i'm going to be very upset no he's wearing my jacket because i lent it to him at the end of wednesday club last week and i haven't gotten it back yet that got weird thank you so i'm figuring out how to do this he's going to try and kick you off roll dex dodge because he's going to try and take a swipe at you dex dodge and if you want you can burn willpower to roll the ones you don't like over again anything over a six burn a will do you see those little will dots you burn one and you can reroll any of the dice you like you can reroll as many dice as you like on one roll for one willpower that's all you needed there's a rule that i forgot but that's okay i'll do it next time i'll remember that succeed at a cost i keep forgetting about succeed at a cost it's really cool yeah you slap him down and you're right back in his neck if you want to do a strength plus two for your vampire fangs yeah strength plus two dice one success you get one more out of him why do you keep hitting my mouse man do you want to keep draining or do you want to back off are you going to back off or you just let go are you going to push him forward against the table (snorts) yeah fuck it that's funny i'm going to let that happen he slips as you push him towards the table and he leaves his seat and falls off into the darkness he falls like he fell off a building down he was on the table and you pushed off and pushed him off his seat and there's no floor apparently because he just dropped you seem to be standing on it fine but it didn't work for him hey laura it's so good to see you this is great i've been really excited i've been wanting to get you in one of my games for a while this is the best one i've put together in quite a while that was fun my whole game has gone to another level i've had a really-- this has been a good year you want to play i think it could be worth your while i do i know a lot about what's going on i have talked to so many people oh yes i have it's been fascinating (sighs) i feel you haven't earned that kind of information yet honestly i feel that this whole sneaking-up-on-my-game and trying to like-- honestly costing damion his turn that's just tacky there's no sides we're all friends and it's just a game you want to play the game i'll make it worth your while you win a little bit and maybe there'll be some answers in here for you well here's what i'll say i have so many cards that could be pulled and the cards they pulled are already gone-- see if you think about it though travis is really the reason this is happening right now the whole theory for this game is because of travis you should pull a card he really likes it when you pull cards pulling cards makes the father happy sit down it entirely depends on the question you feel heavy as you sit down marisha drank the tea oh he's not going to be happy why would she-- that's not smart yeah that'll happen oh that's really complicated that's a very complicated question there's a lot happening and i'm going to be honest with you not all of this was the plan i specifically get the feeling that a lot of this has gone a little off-track it does doesn't it i'm doing what i can but really what can we do other than trying to make some good content you know that's a cute clever puzzle how are you doing on that what have you solved so far electricity crackles from the back of his spine and seems to make an arcing pattern through the darkness that's almost a circuit breaker oh heart and sun not bad i'm running a game here i got to be on top of it if you're not on top of it that's how you lose (sighs) it's just crazy the sorts of people you work with here isn't it yeah he'll be very happy if you take a card you can yell for people by the way there's no problem this is a game for everybody and you do have-- how loud no (laughs) yeah no that's fair i mean we can call everybody over if you like all right pick a card make a pull yes there is no void card in this set because this is not a deck of many things you pulled the two of swords oh dear two of swords is two bleeds suddenly blood gets sucked straight out of your fingertips through the card into the base two more that was a rough pull but everything has a price and so for that swords swords are about knowledge so what do you want to know if i can answer it i will i'll find something i can answer that's too broad well let me find out on my sheet (laughter) no you did okay so there are-- swords are about-- it's taken it they've closed up the card itself gave you paper cuts and sucked everything out and then they-- right on the fingertips too heads are knowledge they're the base of consciousness you need to make an offering of understanding you need to find a symbol of understanding what's happening and what you are you need to find something that expresses that understanding yes and you have to prove it now so you have to find something that proves that you know that you're vampires something of intellectual proof of it now i might know where something is but that's another question things have gotten weird it made father very happy i think you should pull a card too that card's only one pull so that's fine the other sam have you sat down by the way hopefully i'll be here when you get back but fine no i need a player i don't care who you send in i just need a player the bathrooms are sadly the bathrooms except more so you found some toilet paper you found some toilet paper you found the weird little ghost that hides in the-- have you ever seen the ghost on the pipe you can pull that lever and see what happens you guys are going to go check out the library wall so are you guys going as far as the bookcase are you guys going deeper in you want to take a look at the bookcase there was a map that you guys could find but you're never going to find it which makes me laugh really hard but yes there's a-- all right you can do a perception investigation or you can use occult if that's a better number for you as well you got a one on a red you both failed on a red but what was your score total you guys you talk about looking at the bookshelf but you're just talking to each other and going back and forth talking about how foolish laura was to trust you yeah you're just doing a bit you just keep doing a bit yuck nope nevermind that didn't happen she can't stand up until i say so and i need a player you can try and stand up okay you now see what's in front of you once you're-- i feel like i'm the only one who's explored this entire building there are some nooks and crannies man spend enough time back there and it's a real void it's kind of intense come sit three two two empty chairs along with her or once i have somebody else sitting down somebody else can get up is anything safe i mean come on people are you going to walk or are you going to jog all right well done you you go really fast you go really fast i was really hoping you were going to try and hit arcade at some point and there was just going to be a fwap but no you were so nice if we burn that blood you are back in seconds with max he doesn't even really quite register what happened you just have an extra blood die now he is at the point where he is just going to do what he's told so he sits down yeah you can get up this is my best max face i don't know how well it's coming out (laughter) it's this creature it's just teeth and claws and i'm not going to say wolf but there's something up there that's big and-- it's been a lot there's been a lot that's happened after the last game that's the last thing you-- (sighs) it's been a long week i haven't seen the sun in three days four days i don't know what-- no one knows what's going on things have gotten very weird but you've got to get us out of here he's waiting for another player i can't get up i and i'll say if you wanted to see if you can figure out a little bit more about what's happening can't win if you don't play max you want to pick another card as long as max doesn't get up sit down draw a card yeah what are you at you stand up actually i'm not even going to bother with this ooh yeah that's-- okay you at a speed that no one can even grasp you stand up there's a blur and before anyone can notice you are at zero health you are fine give me all your blood dice your blood is at zero you're not hungry at all you're not hungry max is very pale and he's not moving the only reason max isn't slumping over is he's still glued to the seat max is dead you go in and try and stab ivan all right let's do dex plus-- you still get a question we'll see how it goes dex plus melee yeah no you have a weapon yeah take it i'll tell you what what's your level two power oh that's right you're obfuscate never mind no you can take a stab see how it goes i'm letting you do dex melee i love it three successes and crit two successes and a crit okay so i'm going to give you success with point you pin him with the blade to the table that's uncalled for this is really-- this is a lot this is a lot no no he's stuck to the chair though i feel like there's things that need to be addressed before we get to a question i want to play the game as much as anybody but-- no can you help with this this is a lot these prop replicas are really well made this is not-- weirdly the corpse is making it possible at the moment i understand this has been a very stressful time for everybody but let's-- yeah you did that wasn't cool that was really uncalled for like it's all fun and games sure and we poke you a little bit here i'm going to poke you but come on jeez what's the roll for that this is going to be interesting is it versus anything okay charisma persuasion oh yeah he's going to take a hunger die old habits man oh yeah he critted against you that didn't work but you're still going to take your hunger die come on that's just not necessary what do you need to know let's just deal with this it's a sign of faith any kind of sign of faith god that one should be obvious you need some sort of sign of faith there's a dozen answers to that one that one's the easy one i mean oh god okay that's wow what do you think does it look like-- i'm upset i'm angry i didn't mean to take it out on you actually you stabbed me i think you get a little bit of this i mean i think of myself as a very good roleplayer so i'd like to think that no just me i'm just clever and i want the best game possible that's a pull he's not carrying anything cool it pops out there's a little electric flash a few spiders crawl out (groaning) you guys have everything you need let's be serious here if you really want to know another clue i'd tell you that you've got a cross you've got the head you need something cerebral something grand and you need something of faith and i'd do it soon if i were you the sun's setting yeah and also means other things can come in let's remind you that if you see anybody the table's open and i'd really like some new players it happens thank you for playing you come out you pass the war room the meeting room you pass the bookshelf did you look in the bookshelf take a perception investigation or perception occult yeah whichever one strikes your fancy there's some cool shit in the cage man four successes there's some cool shit in the cage what's in the cage where's my cage there's some stakes there's a cross in the cage you on the other hand with four successes-- five well four was the-- there's a very old-looking book on the top shelf that you don't recall seeing there before it's a small black leather book with a little bit of silver on it and you can't make it out but there's something about it they've got a bunch of props from the last run-- it's sagas of sundry and it's us so it's much cheaper for us to use real stakes a rubber stake a rubber chicken liam and there's a cross yes you can clever interesting you can't tell if it felt weird because it felt weird or felt weird because you expected it to feel weird no more than normal that body glitter it's nuts there's a book and it's a small black leather book on the cover is a skull with fangs you open it up and it is entitled the telling of the book of nod it's prose and it's long and it's hard to read because it's been hand-inked but there seems to be a lot of interesting information here about vampires and about what they can do and who they are you can peruse it for a second actually let's do a fun one roll wits linguistics just because i'm a jerk yeah because it's a little weird and it's in old english it's all left see you're getting it thank you that mouse skeleton is very fetching by the way i like sitting here how much hunger are you at right now okay oh good you keep hitting three hunger yeah you read it and there was something about your power but you couldn't absorb any of the information you actually are having a hard time reading thinking you are not hungry right now by the way at the moment you're down three on academics occult or lore that's gone until you eat there's no minus it's just nothing not for that one because she did okay good for checking you got the book and you got a couple of things you hear a little bit of noise and chattering from out in the front but you don't know where from wits linguistics yeah this is telling the story of several brothers and it's telling the story of people disavowed by god whose souls left their body and several brothers who went out upon their own and various families it's a lot to take in it's going to be tough but you're starting to get the notion that this is an old story about the origins of vampires that's weird isn't it you can listen really hard and see if you hear anything let's say perception awareness i would start looking i would think about willpower at some point that's really good there's a scuttling sound upstairs in the smart girls offices in amy poehler's smart girls offices you hear a scuttling a small scuttling it bubbles and blackens and the whole thing is humming even more and that was all i needed from this game thank you everybody it boils and bubbles and all the blood burns off the door and you hear a clank the door may be open it may not be wow he turned so hard so quick there is the scuttling upstairs still from the smart girls office probably not blizzard's awesome but-- it bends a little bit because it's steel it's a wall-hanger it's beautiful that one you have to be still you're going to have to keep cover roll a d10 and tell me what you get roll any d10 you're fine for the moment there are two people hiding underneath desks up there they smell amazing they smell really good they peek out around the desk it's a guy and a girl i've been waiting for this joke all night it's the smart girls office you have no idea who these people are (laughter) make a-- yeah give me charisma performance she books more than me man i ain't going to say shit i know this is my favorite part of this game one red fail is fine yeah the one red fail is if you're thinking about eating them it's going to take you a second to get your composure you're really distracted and you're having a hard time focusing but they bring you in no they're both underneath the same desk neither of us have ever seen either of you before in our lives you're going to have to make conversation for a minute because of that one red die we do actually it's real interesting what we do-- it's really complicated to explain but we do a lot of stuff-- okay thank you (laughter) give me dex plus two for this one dex brawl oh yeah you hear thumping one red fail it works it takes a second you're not having an easy time with this but you're in there how much are you draining are you going to try to get rid of all three hunger roll a d10 yeah give me all of your hunger die you killed someone who worked for amy poehler and i want you to think about that (strangled) it's a dude give me strength athletics on that one for rolling around unless you want to burn some blood oh yeah you're dragging him down give me dex two dex plus two dice yeah sorry i'm still figuring some of this out i have way too many pieces of paper one red fail and-- yeah you go for it but you somehow slip and you don't quite get it together to get a good grab suddenly you start hearing a growling coming from the other end of the building (snarling) from the front of the building (snarling) as you walk there's two probably ten-foot tall wolves slowly making their way into the kitchen they're quadripedic at the moment but it seems like there might be the option and one of them has some brilliant tattoo work up the front arms the two of them are starting to make their way toward you you guys better go quick okay you're going to run into the twitch room everybody roll because i've been wanting to try this where did it go there it is roll wits plus where did it go roll this is going to be weird roll wits plus i'm trying to find the thing to do with this this is going to be weird wits plus athletics i'm trying something interesting honestly except for sam sam doesn't have to roll anything because you are fast as fuck okay the rest of you make your way into the room travis is for some reason still staring at that boy on the ground the two wolves make a jump and grab the boy and start tearing into him make a wits roll to get yourself out of there what the fuck okay yeah the door is jamming on you a little bit i mean you're there you're on the door it's jamming a little bit they're having a bit of an argument over who gets to eat the kid and there's a bit of a back and forth it's like a meet-cute yeah with the shaved sides and they're having a bit of a run yeah your success and your failure yeah give me a boy you can add wits athletics or wits survival and i would recommend burning either some blood or some will or doing something i keep rolling like shit you knock off a will you can add athletics or-- that's good enough i'm going to say you get to the other side of the door but man you're not even going to look for a minute you're going to sit at the other side of that door and listen as the two of them tear this poor kid to shreds he is jerky we're all kids once we're in the jaws of a werewolf man everybody's a kid once you're a vampire and you can hear the werewolves clawing at the door all right roll it he gets a hunger dice if it works yeah ah wow that's a good plan it was good enough that let me double check yeah actually roll perception willpower yeah you're a vampire you've probably burned one of them already it's at the bottom left how many were you at liam i flipped a coin anyway because that's how i enjoy the moment i've got these great coins and i'm glad i get to use them yeah he makes sense meanwhile travis comes back i'll say you can-- wait i get to say it you can certainly try it's that bottom left all right i mean i would say make a strength check but you guys probably together are going to have no problem finding things to move three successes four you can read his aura yeah so what insight would you like why are you asking everyone to protect you there you go i had a funny feeling it would work out that way yeah we're about 30 feet away yeah that's smart let's give you a little bit of red yeah you're going to get one right there you get one there oh wow yeah there are no people in here but all of the equipment is running and there are some lights on back at the critical role stage that's good to know are you going to look around at all other than like as you walk over there's little nooks and crannies you're going to be sneaky which direction are you going to come from you do see a pile of corpses back there they look like very competent corpses the corpses of extremely competent people who make things work they're kind of piled in the shoebox at the moment also make a perception check really quickly a base perception check everything's been manhandled everything's changed things have been moved around everything's a little shifted the wednesday club table is leaning against the door back here people have been moved around that's my weird music the talks set has been folded away and is in a little package everything's been strewn through and there's some new-- go ahead you know where to find it so you go look for it as you open up the cabinet there seems to be some sort of i don't know it looks like maybe it's a pyrotechnic device it looks like something designed to explode in the cabinet do you touch things that look like they're going to explode it's near it but i would not make you roll to miss it because it's far enough away it's on a different shelf but there's a little glowing light in there connected to things that definitely resemble some sort of dynamite or c4 there's some sort of explosive device in here you're liam'ed man no one can see you you're the shade you guys where are you heading and she saw the giant pile of chief and courtney i mean it depends on how-- yeah probably it's a good pile they're all running there's somebody sitting at the head of the table but you can't quite see it's no one you recognize and you can't quite figure out who it is there's a little off-kilter everything's a little off you see painted in blood across the outside of the set-- this set life needs things to live you see hair there's a little tuft of white hair and someone furiously writing notes you made it oh that's super there in front of you is a pale older gentleman with a bit of a beard and thin at the hair but he's an older gentleman quite pale and porcelain skin like he's definitely i don't want to say jolly vampire but there's something so charming about him make an intelligence oh what would i call this either academics or occult yeah no i'm so glad to meet you this is great i mean there have been some problems i admit it there were some things that didn't really go the way i wanted them to but hey hey you're here where's everybody else yeah i mean we're supposed to do a thing and i really enjoy these kind of things ivan was really happy to help so we sort of-- actually ivan really helped put it together he's a smart kid oh yeah i know hi it's a pleasure my name's gary it's a pleasure gary gygax i'm a big fan it's really nice to meet you in person this is great i mean that's fair to say yeah and i've been looking forward to you guys figuring out my puzzle and coming on in this is great i'm so excited about the next stage of everything this is really super exciting probably not at the moment i've got some people outside we're ready to load the trucks everything's up to go everything is more or less set up i've got some people we've got some things coming in and out there's a lot of commotion this is a big process for a minute longer and then of course ivan can take care of that he's very clever that way but we have people i mean you'll know this someday you get to a certain point and you have people who can do these things for you it's really nice thank you see the riddle was a double thing because you know vampires come from a box and dungeons & dragons comes from a box it's a double pun i was really it was actually ivan who came up with it but i signed off it's smart to have make an investigation check he's sitting right here make a perception investigation i'm excited to see if you find this oh happily he is into it there is a breeze coming from under the wednesday club table yeah if you look behind the wednesday club table there is a tunnel going down somewhere so it's maybe a minute before the sun goes down but i'm saying someone's been getting in or out of here no matter what the sun says good find well i was waiting till everybody was going to be here but everybody i'm sure is still having a time it's a mess out there i really apologize i mean he's going to be fine though he's going to be fine  what no what wait where's matt i mean i was aware that one of you might-- something bad might happen but we need him i mean you guys ended everything we worked really hard to make sure you can keep doing this for as long as we need and you let your dungeon master walk into the sun you guys are great you're the best god ugh what are you doing now that matt's gone that one-shot was let's be fair that was mostly math and you were riding on the talent of your players let's be fair is liam dead too or not he's undead apparently we went to all this trouble oh for god's sakes well apparently you had some people working here who weren't entirely human and apparently we did our thing and things got weird you have some weird people here you know that god you know you should never meet your heroes this is very disappointing i was happy for a while i don't even like-- i'm enjoying the fact that this is everything i ever wanted right there this is what it's like to be next to you by the way stealthy we had a plan we had an underground bunker for you guys to shoot from we were putting together a new crew we had every-- oh my god the money and-- this was expensive and i mean there are rules about what you can do and i have done some things to make this happen that are a little questionable this is nothing personal sam i just really wanted to play with matt (laughter) he clicks a button on a remote well regardless it was really nice to meet you i have something i'd love for you to sign well you've got about 60 seconds so i figure we might as well get this done before everything goes well i mean we've got to clean up everything so you're welcome to go outside if you like but otherwise we're taking care of this right now you're not trying to-- i mean there's nowhere to go is there he starts to get up and he starts to grow claws he's starting to get a little baba yaga-y there's claws coming out he slowly reaches in and pulls out matt mercer's vecna statue you'll sign that and i'll be taking it let's flip oh as he reaches for a pen suddenly at great speed there's a blur that comes and smashes him against the side of the wall he is briefly dazed as you see there's another vampire teeth out eyes blazing holding him against the wall and he turns and looks at you all and matt colville says this is your moment run run and goes in and holds gary gygax against the wall they're starting to wrestle with each other you run man just as you run down the tunnel gary gygax breaks his hold on matt colville they break apart and gary makes a run for the tunnel gary matt's against the wall it's enough to distract just in a second if you all get underneath the wednesday club table-- and you hear the flames as the air above you lights as geek & sundry goes up in flames and we'll be back next week with your subterranean adventures now that you've killed two of the greatest dms-- three of the greatest dms that have ever lived two matts dead and a gygax well done i feel like gary was quite clear on that you know what you get for that hungry fucker what are you at oh yeah next time you see one it's going hey guys i hope you enjoyed my-- i'm going to be a little bit more together next time this was a little bit ramshackle thank you i had fun it's going to be a little different i'm going to play a little bit more we're going to have more fun with the social and maybe get into a little bit of the world of darkness now that i feel like they've got a hang on things i'm going to give everyone a little more power and a little more idea of what they can do shift things around we may have a special guest maybe maybe not since it's only four of you i may get one more for fun we'll see i haven't reached out yet because we have so much shit to do over the next 48 hours all of us it's nuts thank you all for tuning in to this we are doing one more week of this insane run and it's going to get weirder probably less evil maybe i don't know i'm so pleased thank you guys so much this system is a lot of fun to play and if you do get a chance there's either the classic or the new edition or both wonderful treats there's an alpha available to play with there's all of the old books and they used to do every city every clan i'd be very curious to see if anybody could start guessing what clans i've pushed everybody gently towards not that they know anything yet and if anybody figured out what ivan was and if anybody figured out what was happening at the front of the geek & sundry offices and anybody figured out what-- i think everybody figured out what happened with ed and rachel they might have survived i don't know werewolves are tough man anyway thank you guys so much
