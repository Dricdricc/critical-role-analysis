well like so many good things we can do it back when we get to the hotel you can sneak up take a look rob it and then throw a stick of dynamite in just because if we're going to be those people what happens if he's actually there yeah i feel like that's pretty obvious at this point i just like having a game plan then we should rob it first there'll be a body curing if it is his house we'll know because there'll be a body curing and getting nice and ripe i feel that as well we'll give you the dynamite and if anything seems like it goes wrong you can immediately signal caleb and we'll bring the cavalry in i'll go behind yasha that's not bad do we recognize these vines and what kind of plant this is we'll see how this goes no i've got a weird idea everybody back up a bit i'm going to take a little bit of my jerky i'm going to wrap it around a ball bearing make a little baseball out of it i'm going to chuck it right into the middle of the vines i love camping that's entirely possible we remember what not to do right which is-- you're going to take everything that you can grab in there and then blow it up and run but it's only up to 30 feet away from her you have full running speed though i'm going to get behind that tree and activate my swords oh dear that was a bottle rocket he's harder to hit from a distance at the moment 19 i'm going to come out from behind my tree right there just a little bit so i can see him i'm going to try and enthrall him because i don't have any good stuff that i can do from a distance laura and is it charisma-based that's right because it says wisdom i get so-- it does not succeed it does succeed i'm actually going to sort of stand out in the-- i'm going to move a couple feet out-- there and just start yelling at him hey-- hey you fucker you got-- we got more than that where we-- come on bring it i don't know what i'm doing too much caffeine that all happened in there that all happened good thing nobody in the world saw that but you can save against that right every turn are we seeing sprays when he gets hit by these things by the way how far can i move in one okay i'm going to head in the direction of this creature i'm going to stay about-- actually let's try something ridiculous you took a lot of damage from that spray right this'll be fun let's run up to it see how close i can get i'm going to try to leap at that just north of me to see if i can get over here then by that spiritual weapon if i can leap there that's fine at least it'll hopefully give everybody some flanking that's a four that's as far as i can move i'm going to hold my action in case he comes within fighting distance yeah i'm holding my attack can i do anything with my bonus i can't do anything with my bonus yeah i think that ends my turn you're just going to take damage we healed up we got a long rest there is a tiny burning fire there now it would have been there's a lot of threes in this game right now does it get close enough for me to take a swing swing swing i just get two attacks right actually i'm going to use the good sword it doesn't matter that's awful and that's pretty good that's 11 that misses and 19 that hits that's 1d6 plus 1d4 2d6 now that's right that's not bad that's ten points of damage i will take my reaction 13 points of damage that's fine this is what i'm good for i'm taking it 100 gold natural 20 (cheering) it's a pretty gold die so it's 4d6 plus a little ooh that pretty much does the same thing (counting) 21 points of damage he's also going to of course curse of the eyeless oh that was my reaction never mind that's all right nobody else hit it i'm going to walk up and i'm going to flank it so i get advantage i'm going to take a hit that's 20 that's nine points of damage i want to get the new sword push let it bend and pop into it i've got a bonus action i'm going to give him an auto-cure just in case the snake tattoo on my hand the eye on the back of my hand bursts and blood comes pouring out of it i take two points of damage i didn't need the amplify oh actually that's right i don't have to take damage for that never mind i've never done that before that-- just to be sure i'm going to dig around and make sure this is true death on this thing and it's not going to start regenerating or anything does it look like it's regenerating at all 12 don't poke it okay let's like i'm going to gently-- i feel like i should have had a-- oh well that's fine ah six seconds can go quick no fjord so now we have our full turn and it can't react so hold the-- i can move i'll be fine we all get a full turn before anything happens wait one second hold until we're clear i obviously can't hit it so-- i mean-- i'm going to get his attention peace out i'm going to misty step i can go 30 feet yep yep i'm going to head to the shinies i'm going to misty step next to-- yeah there we are i just need visual and just no there's nothing i can do he has no reaction oh yeah we've got to wake him up now cause he's almost dead yes no i'm not going to do that what are you going to do with that you don't want that i'm going to go through the skulls do you want to join me going through the skulls right now let's not crowd the boy ten there's no sense repeating especially since we're now a 100 gold richer i guess get it out of your system then that's fine are you done yet unless you're really out of anything to eat then i suppose you know desperate times it's just getting awkward did you just say bougie ugh god never mind i don't like you again it's a word that people use when they want to sound ostentatious about how ostentatious something is it's collect when we get back and his agent is dead his person out here is dead or trying to send an email how does this work all caps just ruin everything there we are except of course that they're making ready for war so thirsty where would we sell such a thing like this is that an apothecary do you have an apothecary here my god i miss shopping i'm going to give him three gold for his trouble you're brilliant and i'm heading in that direction it's quaint and rustic shut up what kind of font is it written in i go to knock you're not buying today already what time do you open tomorrow are you sure you don't want to perhaps buy a fresh troll heart very wet not a bad die there we found a troll and we killed it let him prod it's fine or could we also talk about trade possibly if you have some interesting stuff if you've got stuff to trade you seem like a clever fellow i'm sure you got something around here that's interesting and unique we'll see what you put together and we'll definitely talk about what this is worth in the morning and if you have anything unusual that you put together if you have a signature blend of any kind i'm always interested in people who are excited to experiment yes that too we'll see you bright and early do you think it would be better to leave this here so he can contain it i mean we killed a troll it's not like we can't kill him if it goes wrong why must you sully everything good and pure in this world sam this is where all those manacles have been coming from oh no perfect we'll be back in the morning let's go take a rest i really liked him whatever you think that we shouldn't leave town without trying you got it to be fair he's saved our lives dozens of times all gone all dead any surprise you have you can't drink in real life and you still won't drink on graph paper i've got cards i'm going to play and i'm going to drink and we've got to discuss what's happening tomorrow can i see the cover when she grabs the book yeah i'm ready we'll do that on the way out as soon as we put the cart together we've done what we needed this is a one troll town i think not a great time to be had here they may not give them to us unless he's there i missed this oh why not another round please and i'll put a gold for everyone down no i'm finishing this and i'll be right up i go last i leave two gold on the counter before i leave for you no matter what but if you tell me what it is i promise i won't tell the rest of them i just want to lord it over them enjoy your evening cheers and i head upstairs for the record i tell none of you three of those tweets will be from me oh yes please this seems like a bad idea sure does it look like anything does it remind me of a mystic symbol of any kind just an arcana check let's see what happens natural 20 i'm back baby what happened to you on that boat something might have followed you you're going to forgive me for this later i cast friends actually i'm so sorry not friends it's charm person i'm so sorry it's charm person thank you there's something in you that you either don't want to talk about or don't remember properly i think no i don't think i could've i know which is why i didn't ask i trust that you'll tell me everything you know but i'm not sure you even know everything you know i don't think it matters where the sword is at all perhaps i think may i something from the deep is in that i don't know it reminds me of something i'll keep an eye and no matter what keeping each other safe it's what we do it's what you do when you got a group of people we'll keep you safe i'll probably be up for an hour then i'll turn in let's go to the shop everybody anybody wants to go shopping can go shopping anybody else wants to wrangle up the cart we need a valet ticket as much as i'm kind of into this-- why don't you all meet us at the-- get the cart and you'll meet us at the apothecary meet us at the apothecary i've been thinking about that in front of you but we have a map and maybe she can show us on the map where she thinks she needs to go no i didn't say that i said if we know which direction she needs to head we can figure out possibly if we can get her there no one should live here she does drink a lot and occasionally seem interested in eating human flesh i'm not entirely-- well that's a subject for another day birds you know there's a bird in a bonnet and another one smoking a pipe that's all i really-- (coos) just think about that yeah if we knew the name of everything we put down our gullet there would be no fun ever any time i'm very excited i'm all right with this i'm into it yeah so if we were to take that 50 and possibly spend it on something in this shop is there anything that we should take a look at i'm curious about the sleeping thing you have and again anything you're particularly proud of i'm always excited for a surprise i'll take some sleep aids and whatever helps you sleep some sleepy tea or whatever anything like that you buy your own issue whatever you've got a problem with you can buy it yourself this is not where my coin is going and anything that smells nice just whatever how much for the whole deal can you do change one gold thank you (whispering and giggling) i'm aware i'm ignoring it i'm fine i'm going to put it in my additional notes right now all right all right what are you going to do with that heart anyway that's a seven is everything relatively all right on the cart doesn't look like it's been-- i trust you it's the only way to be sure we have some weights to put down but there seems to be the crossroads up there there seems to be a path through the forest-- i think we go rexxentrum just because there's an army marching that direction i don't believe you've ever heard a crazy story about anything happening anywhere i'm challenging you for details what's the traveler doing up there could someone keep their eyes on the road as we're moving forward you have died of dysentery at some point we want to pull out the map and show it to kiri and see if she can point to anything on the map do you want advantage individually 20 have you ever actually tried rubbing his ankles when he says that some tents would be a great idea i generally don't actually care about the theme of any city that i'm in because i've never bothered to learn does any of this look familiar before do i recognize any of these people i think we're going to need some general goods i've got some ideas of some stuff we could use on the road we should have some tents i want to hit the general store actually i am how fascinating that you caught me right in the moment where i'm ready to spend money well i've got a couple problems i've got a cart that keeps breaking down on me if you've got a kit for something like that also i was thinking about maybe putting some canvas on top of it giving it a little bit of safety from the elements i think i'm going to need at least four tents i've recently come into a bunch of new companions and they really didn't have what's necessary to make our way through these wonderful wonderful roads four'll do it actually i'll get five tents that's perfect you wouldn't happen to have any raw canvas i could use to possibly put a bit of a pup tent i'll take the repair kit and however much basic supplies to put this together and i'll figure out how handy i am on the road will that do hmm i'm used to yards if nothing goes wrong it should work is it waxed and reasonable all right we'll just have to make a little-- we're trying to do a covered wagon so we're at 30 gold now 40 gold all right we've got the tents we've got the canvas and then just a little bit of lumber to put this whole thing together and that ought to do it yeah covered wagon-worth do you have bamboo whatever you have all right at the very least we can fake something for now that's fair what's my total right now i could do 35 that's a nine that's nice can't argue 40 gold two i got two one more and i get a free sandwich is that 40 total that was a savage burn ugh or really itchy wool i think we're probably fine we're killing it we're basically gods we've got tents (whispers) how when have you ever met a chent can't handle natural one oh yeah that hits whoa whoa whoa whoa how's new management working out now now is that apology accepted at this point i'm going to put this out here that we just received an apology this sort of behavior should be rewarded we appreciate the courtesy it's rough out here they should take their crossbows that is very fair let's take a look i feel bad i've got to admit no i have to deal with this i'm going to walk to my cart i'm going to pull out that armor that i got at the orc's place i'm handing it to the kid you're going to get shot at again it's breaking my heart thank you for recognizing and for being gracious about our previous deal i appreciate someone who stands up and holds to their word that's really nice and that should be rewarded in this world well i wasn't really holding them to that one respect management so true oh god why it's not technically a corpse yet he'll only find better people that went well there's nothing better than waking up in the morning with no pants and flowers in your hair i add a drop of lavender oil and i think we're done and this is why you buy the lavender oil so we can remove it and attach it to ours is theirs better than ours it's all about the dysentery the volvo of wagons (clopping sounds) i like it i like a good waterfall i'd like sleep somewhere comfortable idleworks shelf pink hearts yellow moons blue diamonds there'll probably be something siding closer to the waterfall maybe does that seems safe to you looking for lodgings for the night i don't need that ride travelers passing through to somewhere else we need to find a place to store our stuff and hopefully find an inn for the night first private contractors drinks is a great idea have we seen another tiefling since hitting the city wait for it you've brought us to florida
