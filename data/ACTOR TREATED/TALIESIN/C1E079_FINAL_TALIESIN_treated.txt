and they're gone that's true except one that will do pretty good for pike laura and 25 fast fast and extra hit points okay it's coming is there room can i get even vaguely a shot in that room i'll move a little bit i have spider climb on right now so actually i'll climb up on the wall and then climb back down when i'm done i'm going to-- ignore that i've been drinking first of all i'm going to cast hex on him because that's really going to make a difference what kind of checks should i-- i'm going to down him for-- i'm going to give him a disadvantage on dexterity checks because fuck it all right i'm going to take out bad news and i'm going to take two shots which is my way with hex and bad news and hopefully everything's going to go just fine i'm going to use sharpshooter and i'm going to use deadeye on the first one i'm going to drop a point on deadeye so deadeye roll-- that should have counted damn it i shouldn't have picked it up oh thank god that's-- sorry i'm blanking 26 to hit yeah let's not start saying that now and that's-- wow i'm nervous that's actually really good first shot is 21 37 points of damage plus five points of necrotic damage that's really nice i rolled really high and i have sharpshooter running next one i'm going to shoot sharpshooter but no deadshot is an 18 to hit okay second one misses i'm going to crawl back and hide again and get a little bit of-- yeah i got up on top took two shots and crawled back down to hide i'm regretting so many things right now not you oh god i shouldn't avoid my family it leads to dragons i would get back behind the wall if i were you the wall will at least take some damage at this point most things he's going to do are going to be a giant area effect anyway that you're not going to be able to outrun you might as well have cover-- that will be our next t-shirt yay 8th-level spell but he is picked up for 50 feet though i would say also just because pike was going to do a thing so come back for pike's thing that she was going to do does partial cover help at all i'm rerolling that that's a little better i just had to use a resolve a one so i had to burn a resolve which i have done it'll help does the five get subtracted before we halve it or after 24 is a just made it 18 they're technically not temporary it's actually your max increases so they can come back you can heal into them you're 17 up you can go 17 up even if you lose them your max is now much higher ten good that's really good go nuts with it yeah so if it's 3d4 you just get 12 that's amazing you can do it at any level you like one of the two of us i would say oh i'll take it how much do i get back 13 all right d12 is awesome we're just going to spray-paint matt's hand purple and he's going to sit there punch things lair actions are the worst oh good fine my dragon gun i'm going to take a deep breath and shoot directly north or i suppose to you it would be south down the map towards that building on the far corner i'm just going to run in that direction that's as far as i can get with my full movement and he has to recharge his fire probably before he can do that again okay that's fine i'm going to take two shots while i'm running i'm going to just because i'm not feeling lucky right now i'm going to burn another deadeye on my first run so let's do that no no i am really not so less so that i'm not even going to do sharpshooter that's awesome i take that back it's okay actually that doesn't affect the crit at all sharpshooter isn't affected by a crit i critted by the way sorry that's nice so hey i get that deadeye back that's cool this is like bad college theater no one knows when to applaud excellent that's-- oh my god that's kind of nice 1d12 2d12 3d12 4d12 pretty good that's not great but it'll do 24 points of damage and i'm going to take another shot you know what screw it let's put a sharpshooter on this actually no never mind yes i'm going to put a sharpshooter on this i am so nervous i'm putting a sharpshooter on it which is good because i rolled-- 17 18 19 26 yay and that's 2d12 yay boo but that's okay 30 points of damage (high-pitched noises) okay of course you did yeah and now he's got four thordak he's got like 12 don't make him look things up it's always going to be worse is there a little hole in the ground where the magma came out or no gets max healing because he was in the spell you beat the scottish into him good to know we're learning 22 misses who is not immune to fear there's a lot of alcohol on the set right now a lot of it's hiding there's a mini fridge built into trinket 12 fucking teddy ruxpin yeah way too many emotions happening there no he's not that's so clutch we should do that every time from now on every die vax it might be worth taking a peek in that crater when you get a second if we die today he's going to get the flu later in his life he has disadvantage i pray for a single-digit number man you are a tank we're working on it no no but what happens if you do it at a higher level well i mean like next round though if she does that at a 5th-level just the damage it'll add will be more than double the damage it'll do now which is like another attack you absorb that's great it's like one more attack to absorb that's seven so you want one more though yeah okay that's fine i am in trouble i have a whole bunch of your d8s over here by the way feel free to pull them out whenever you like i'm going to try a couple things i'm going to do a piercing shot on the fire elemental which i think i can do i'm going to start moving in a northerly direction so i guess i'll take like one or two steps southwest i suppose it would be to you yeah there you go yeah that'll do it and i'm going to do a piercing shot that burns a grit okay that'll do that's 25 to hit the elemental and now i have to roll again for thordak really kima's not short enough that it'll go right over her head okay that's happening apparently it's either kima or grog although grog takes half damage you take half damage it's in the rules 20 and no i can't have a misfire once i've already hit the first okay that's 15 that doesn't hit i only hit grog no i also hit the fire elemental yeah i hit the fire elemental though maybe i will maybe it's maybelline where are my d12s they seem to have all vanished that's awful 13 points of damage sorry and the bullet gets lodged in you sorry and then is the fire elemental still standing i'm irritated i'm burning another grit and i'm going to do a pushback on the elemental that's actually no save that's just a pushback i just have to hit and that hits i should have done a-- that's a 29 32 to hit no i'm saving you 14 i want you to be able to get up without that thing on you 20 points of damage and it gets pushed back ten feet thank you i'm going to use my bonus action for a healing surge to add 22 points to my hit points then i'm going to keep running use spider to run over that wall into that little house beneath the green dragon there we go you're having way too much fun oh no grog's down so there's no attack of opportunity yeah you got to see if you can get up and walk away i am just-- i am regretting so many things right now neither do i i should have saved him-- (half-hearted wilhelm scream) he's not going to take a shot at the elemental while he's running away once i hear a number i'll be excited i'm not saying anything until i hear a number it's going to be like 11 points of damage now we're on board no are you using the sword yes you are love it that's cool i had an environmental attack that does not hit that hits yeah not mine yeah oh does stop drop and roll work in-- could be both now actually (laughter) she can take a death remember she can actually take a death but yeah it's so great that you did that 11 points i'm going to spider-climb-- i'm going to stay within striking distance i'm not going to disengage from the jerk but i'm going to climb up on the wall above him if that's okay like oh i'm shooting at the television here yeah like climb up there and be sideways i'm going to pull out bad news i'm going to try something new i'm seeing that big spike there's a big metal spike stuck in his chest right now is there still not a metal pole i thought he got hit by a thing okay i thought he also got hit by a thing but that's okay i'm going to try something weird i'm going to spend a grit for advantage on this shot because-- i'm going to add two points of cabal's ruin to this i'm going to spend two points of cabal's ruin i have a thing oh i can wait until after well that's even better so first shot is a 27 to hit so i'm going to drop two-- i've got the little thing running through my glove i've got the wire i'm just going to let go of the little grounding wire and see what happens i'll hold onto the barrel and pray let's add 2d6 to that is that right yeah i know i'm digging this-- augh it's okay yeah this is okay 22 points of damage plus two points of electrical damage i did yeah i did i'm going to do that again i'm going to burn two more points-- well i'm going to wait that's really cool that i can wait i hate it when that happens i know that was the worst roll i've ever done that's okay it's 22 just hits 22 misses that's fine i'm not going to burn any cabal so that's fine that was very cool though once i set it up i can arc a charge to the bullet that ends my turn i may drop back behind-- no i'm good i'm good that was a terrible roll terrible roll snake eyes was not cool walls hate npcs halved somebody's going to dive into that hole i was going to say if i'm caught in the corner of this will this extinguish me can i autofail if i just want to be-- oh that's right for half damage all right dex saving throw that's an 11 i just fall on the ground i assume no you could go in the hole just saying i care about the hole with advantage cut in half in combat range of a dragon poison immunity oh that just hits that also just hits so that's 28 times two 56 all right that's fine i blame you for all of this i'll be hearing about it from the kitchen it'll be great i'll be working on my new character which you then double don't you like slap the charred skin off his face get back in there and whatever's in that pit and whatever's in that pit here's 4d8 5d8 6d8 okay i'm going to for my bonus action i'm going to down a greater which is 4d4 i believe i'm dying less i'm going to stand up i'm technically engaged with this bloody thing aren't i okay i'm just going to-- there's little i can do other than just say please somebody fix this and i'm going to take two shots at the red dragon first shot with bad news 23 i'm going to just throw-- forget it i'll throw four charges of cabal's ruin there let's just do it technically speaking no the way that this works-- it's like a tesla arc so it wouldn't technically-- you'll feel tingly bloody fanart okay and let's see what kind of damage we do with this eh that sucks stop it stop it i can't count when-- that's (counting) 21 points of damage stop saying that it's 21 you don't know it's 21 second shot can i reroll that 'cause he yeah it misses and now i'm

dozen people on their phones behind us 23 this doesn't feel good on the other end does it oh 4d4 plus six i'm going to put bad news away pull out animus and take three shots at this asshole i'm getting up pulling out the gun putting three sharpshooter shots in this guy that's a 26 that hits i'm going to roll that one until he drops so that i can-- 1d8 plus 1d6 1d10 plus 1d6 that's 18 19 20
