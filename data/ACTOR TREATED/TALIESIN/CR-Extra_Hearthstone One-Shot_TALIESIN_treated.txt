my breath okay my name is bundle i'm a dwarf i've got a very very nice lime green robe thank you i'm very proud i'm a priest and i've been studying for quite some time learning my trade perfecting it i'm a bit behind i mean i've got some younger brothers that are doing much better than i am and certainly they're succeeding more and going further and that's fine i'm doing my best i'm taking my own pace going a bit bald and i'm trying to do my best to bring it over and it's going into a-- it's not a great beard but i use the ham hocks to liven it up a bit and i feel like i'm making my way at my own pace very well more beer all ten of them oh doesn't have to match as long as it's lime green there was a fisherman who did like 25 of those little red plants but this sounds better there's your trouble you left it unlocked you're making assumptions i feel that's a lot to just assume just taking your first look i take a look at the lock oh boy oh wow seven lock appears to have been broken by blunt force i don't know this is why we pay him big gold bucks right there or they're prone to crawling they could be crawlers that's some mean crawlers grease it up and he'll squeeze right in there

get one attack in 14 14 eight everything hurts one second i'm finding a thing-- i know this is so difficult i'm going to quickly cast mass healing word on everybody while i not even get up i'm going to sit up and cast mass healing word on the group oh that's right it's auto so d4 plus wisdom modifier that's six and i'm going to use my bonus action to create a spiritual weapon a giant hammer that looks a little bit like an anvil that's bigger than his hammer it's going to manifest right above the main kobold's head ten feet up does it get to take one hit yeah i'll go for it that's 15 i'm getting up and i use my movement to stand up and shake off yeah yeah no what's the check again god why am i rolling so bad ten i'm going to maybe do a prayer of healing also technically speaking i have disciple of light which means-- would everyone have gained an extra five points i can't do prayer of healing while we're walking though can i it's just verbal ten minutes to heal everybody up a bit so that's 2d8 plus my spellcasting ability modifier oh my god really yep so that's nine points of healing to everybody we've got rope what did you roll well she rolled a 20 oh i can do it so i pick up a rock and light it up and toss it in front of us just keep kicking it down could make a glowing salad of some kind well-- let's not look a gift horse in the mouth a gift rat orange and the other two were-- what's the third you only live once orange i take the orange oh 20 how about mine i have the orange down the hatch oh that helps because my constitution's really low eight i heal six

going to use thaumaturgy to make us all look really fuzzy in and out if i can do that ooh i hadn't thought this through can i make the staff look like it's made of snakes or something can i thaumaturgy oh slowly okay slowly making our way around the existential crisis now i want to do russian now yeah you dragged me onto silverhand totes fake well i'm cool how did we agree that you get the epic loot drop see this would have been an appropriate place to build bridges that are kind of iffy two of them even i want to take a quick insight check and give him an eye i don't trust this one that's not bad that's a 16 with darkvision could i see them all right i'm going to try and go for the central platform could you fly over to the-- yeah lead the creature over to that section i'm going to try and cast hold person on the creature god it won't work on him will it i got 20 you can land wherever we need to be oh that's a 24 not you not even a little you're so soft and squishy no well you only live once i'm going to make a run for it fuck it my strength is 16 i'm going to cast sacred flame which i know will do very little on him but it might temporarily irritate him i'm going to run the opposite direction oh it's an action to do that should i burn my action running oh my god yeah that hits i can live with that i can live with that too god if i have to do an action i hope i can get an action before this happens acrobatics check oh god because i'm an idiot 20 so where am i now i did a quick cure wounds back to 41 they're not bad well i mean i hear they're not bad no no i mean well no well no you're a fun guy i'm going to start making my way that direction no matter what sure that's all right 19 i'm going to throw a cure wounds at that to help with that you get 11 points back to help power word shield it means add 16 that you're about to probably lose seven seven thank you for that cold resistance by the way that's really cool of you to put on this character i know bring it ten i'm out i've got a healing potion yeah i'm cool 4d4 plus four (coughs) i'm running no i'm out i'm so excited not a natural 20 but 20 20 that's mean worth it i'll do a mass healing word we could use our hit dice or i could do yeah actually i can do a thing that might help where's the thing where i can make it so we all get max healing no matter what beacon of hope it's beacon of hope so i'm going to cast beacon of hope on everybody so for the next minute i suppose it's just-- will this work for hit dice never mind we'll just do the hit dice it's been so long wow that was awful boy i'm not and i'll sacred flame as well 21 it finally happened just for fun let's do-- where is it i keep losing everything i'm doing i'm going to do a very standard guiding bolt and a sacred flame attack i'm going to go for a two-fer on the big kahuna oh they're both actions i thought it was a bonus never mind this is so hard to do it's been so long since i've done this i'll do a standard guiding bolt at this guy and see what happens here we go guiding bolt that's a 19 guiding bolt is a 25 that's 4d6 radiant ooh 16 points of radiant damage yeah the next hit against him has advantage and yeah i'm going to give myself a quick healing word as a bonus action because i'm really low all right i am at 29 points of health that's okay yeah (groans) it's going to take an action to put myself out i assume i would like to put myself out okay do i get a bonus action so for a bonus action i'm going to cast spiritual weapon at 4th-level because i think that gives me an extra d8 for spiritual weapon all right so i'm going to cast spiritual weapon i basically want to summon what is basically a big chomping mouse trap i'm going to take a whack at the king's head with a giant-- i'm going to smack it right into him does it auto-crit if it hits oh it's also advantage on the attack i rolled a 17 plus-- yeah 23 but it's an auto-crit anyway he's still stunned so that's 26 points of damage (snapping) i'm going to back up a bit with my movement and get a little bit of cover i'm going to channel divinity and quickly throw seven points of healing at everybody and myself every little bit helps i'm going to just for fun take a swing with the mousetrap at the giant flame beast to see what happens that's a 14 i'm going to turn and run to the latrine aye then i'm going to turn around and run first thing i'm going to do is attack with the spiritual weapon as my bonus action so that's-- oh that probably hit 23 23 with the spiritual weapon to hit all right that's fine let's hit this thing with the mousetrap again plus my spell attack bonus so it's 16 points of damage then i'm going to use my second channel divinity preserve life and put 30 points of health into you to keep you awake and i'm going to take five for myself then i'm going to run into the latrine as well live by the candle die by the candle i'm going to cast spirit guardians at level three spirit guardians is different you're thinking of spiritual weapon this is spirit guardians so if he's within 15 feet of me that's going to be a thing on his turn if he's within 15 feet also he's slowed by half but i'm also going to hit him with my spiritual weapon mousetrap goddamn it i miss can i have my die back is he within 15 feet of me now he has to do a wisdom saving throw that's 3d8 12 so six points of radiant damage take 2d4 plus two good things we're running yes we're running 19 14 is she floating to the surface i'm going to follow her up then healing word level two healing word level three if i use my healing word not knowing that she was dead-- did i use my healing word not knowing she was dead because i'm out of magic at that point if i've used two healing words all right that'll do oh 24
