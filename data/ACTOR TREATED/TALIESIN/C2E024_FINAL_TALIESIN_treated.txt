enough you won't remember either way no that's entirely something you can do it's more common than you'd think there was some pub i don't remember what town i was in but i do remember the pub because it was actually called the swinging chandelier i don't remember what town it was though but it was a great pub it had the best chandelier i'm going to walk right into the middle of this gentle persons

two at the same time yeah i'm into it especially if it fails please yeah i'm very excited to find out want to do a little runaround i think we're going to do that because hupperdook it's family friendly did they i have done some ridiculous things in my life that might take the top of it though i've got an idea i've got an idea there is one member of our party who is probably not going to want to go out and see this ridiculousness yasha i know you're not into this i know that you want to have a night out do you just want to sit and keep the young one out of trouble it's going to be fine that's a joke only one way to find out i'll bring you back something yash he's never going to dance again you can dance if you want to we're going outside to see what this place has to offer

super fancy if you see anything is that code for something i could see you as a waltzer that make sense no i'll take two then yep that seems like a bit much doesn't it i got what i needed i'm ready they kick someone in the face every time like bread papa yeah it's all beard papa ten gold ten gold i just don't know how to walk away from something like this oh for god's sake 30 gold so you'll all

excellent i'm ready for this you can also drink along since we'll have to buy your drinks for you i'll take this in i'm going to riker right over the chair and sit down molly dear ten oh 12 sorry ugh goddamn it eight 20 it's rough 19 i'm very drunk that's a roll that was an option eye contact never broken this is such a change of pace from last year it's so exciting i'll take 20 of that because i put in-- oh that will be perfect i can crash in another room it's perfectly fine you have a friend who's an herbalist nott i'm so proud of you i'm so proud of you so well done i'm in i'll lead i'm going to grab beau before we head up is it all right if i try something no nothing like that i just wanted-- oh god how is your hangover whatever team your on i'm not sure i play for that one it's team fuck off i'm well aware how are your hangovers normally i got a weird thought this may feel weird i'm going to try my blood maledict i'm going to do the purgation advanced to see if i can cure a hangover with it i don't know if it will work technically it's a poison and i'm willing to drop some hp into this it gets a little fancy and it's mostly to see if i can clean it up a little bit maybe it'll work maybe it won't oh yeah i want to see if it works i feel like this could be very useful i'm going to work on this i wouldn't touch that thank you for being part of my little experiment i was just curious if i could pull liquor out of people i'm going to go throw up on fjord excuse me i'm going to find fjord and make sure that however i throw up it makes it so it looks like he did it to himself (groaning) oh god no i bring him back in fuck off that's a lot of money i say we start the spell now in case they decide to throw away the coin purses unless somebody knows something that was in their purse that was of actually of value that they could recognize i need some bacon does anyone have money for bacon let's try not to escalate anything too quickly yet do i have masculine wiles i'm into it i'll take it why don't we save that for the moment that we have somebody we definitely want to interrogate instead of somebody who might tell us they don't know anything and get breakfast no if it was rissa what is she still doing here let's get some breakfast before anything happens it was strung up i'm sitting down to breakfast but if you were going to suspect somebody who would it be not with me i don't understand what you're trying to imply here this might be a goblin thing did those two gentlemen come back into the bar at any point i mean at the very least that'll be fun everybody's my type i'm really pretty easy whoever took our purses has our drink tokens too i'm just saying that if drink tokens come back to the bar-- but somebody's got them i would keep it though anytime i've stolen something i couldn't use later i've always kept it for sentimental reasons i'm not sure why i don't steal anymore much sometimes-- he had to flip a page for that one it was exciting yeah she said they lived by her pops' place i wanted to meet pops anyway he sounds interesting we feel that we'll go to your father's place first i think we'll maybe if we're in the mood pop into their place while they're not home perhaps we're going to put you on a cart and we're going to take the cart will we walk faster than the cart will go really all right how close are we to the other houses at this point to the boys i was excited to see what sort of stuff-- what's the thing you're most proud of oh absolutely what happened to the other 999 no at the moment that was what i was hoping for and it happened not yet we're here to talk to those two in the least i like that it was not even a question not yet now we hate to bother you also but we did actually get robbed and if you have any idea where we should start looking to actually-- i like weird folks bless you scissors we can keep asking has anyone had anything purchased-- with dicks on it how long have you been pickpocketing then mostly success at this point well this is good this is a very valuable lesson if you ever come across a purse like this again you just take a tiny bit of it and then leave the rest well then you just bring it back immediately obviously you take five percent how soft are you getting if i've learned anything you don't work with animals or children and we're rapidly getting both i see no problem with that let's make no promises but again-- you are so soft oh please i tend to find these sorts of jobs asking for a three-day extension does not go well you're given the time you do the job you finish it you don't ask questions you don't ask for special-- that's what i'm talking about when you're in a circus sometimes you get paid to do gigs things have happened i've run a couple things in my time i'm into it we're a circus of course we've robbed people my god we have robbed swindled we've been robbed we've gone back and found the people who've robbed them sometimes we don't oh my god yes you're asking if my cards are bullshit my cards are not bullshit i know you do but you won't say it we've got a day or two to spend on this but not a week didn't you almost open fire on these children not more than 30 seconds ago of course you would this is why i don't miss the circus i'm not saying no i'm just saying remember that we are hired hands i've done dumber shit have you ever eaten an orphan say no more i'm in that sounds like a terrible idea i'm also in it for a crossbow just remember you either get the nickname the gentleman because you are one or because you're really not i'm gonna give them-- nope never mind i'm not going to give them that because that would be a terrible idea i've got a good idea i'm going to give the older one one of my rings i've got these strange little rings that i left over keep that on you sell it if you have to but see if you can hold off for a while if things go wrong get within 1000 feet of the blushing tavern hide and wait and we'll find you hide it's a finger ring laura and it was one of the rings that we found in the cave she said it oh so weird
