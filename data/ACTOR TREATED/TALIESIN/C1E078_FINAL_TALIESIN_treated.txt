this is my plan while you guys are doing your stuff i'm going to be playing puzzle quest wow you nerfed me okay i'm just kidding i think you were giving me a little bit of this drunkenly during westworld if i recall how you never did a rhyme on snl is beyond me man i don't know how-- somewhere in topanga canyon right now dweezil zappa is bleeding from the nose going oh what what yeah no you were glowing that's a great tattoo gamer's choice awards it's the gamer's shorty awards you should totally check it out you can also-- they have web stores and you should go onto their web stores because there's a lot of really good christmas stuff that you can buy that's fun and arty and poetry-ish and kids poetry that you can buy books of that's actually really good and it's a great christmas gift and you're giving to a good cause it's amazing let's get some seltzer we'll get that right out just a click not a like who is the spotify playlist this week oh it's me oh that's great yeah i know i did it i did do it-- it's good it's good music do you phase out so you don't hear the terrible things we say i have some guns to repair because everything broke and many of these things cost money now we should probably get close to greyskull and see if we can enter through the tunnels i think scrying on the old keep and then letting everyone know-- we don't necessarily want everyone arriving at the same place as well as long as there's a coordinated movement towards the city we can call them if we need to and then maybe the 50 men coming into the sewers to fight we can go meet them if that's the next move yes somewhere we should also collect some other allies if we're going to head in this direction we're going to need a painter you know a painter we should bring a painter with us yes to paint our exploits you have that portrait-- is it small potatoes is it really though you might as well get it all done now because you're not going to be able to do it later but no stock up on what-- again whitestone doesn't necessarily have a lot for us to gather-- it does have weaponry it's designed to help keep him on the ground well no it's a giant crystal it's-- i know i keep saying-- i know please don't say that that's not funny i'd like to go to the-- i don't know wherever we go we can let everyone know what the plan and where we're going is easy to do we just send a message yeah easier just to send a message we can at least get into there and start communicating with the clasp i'm sure they'll be happy to see us regardless they're businessmen i doubt they hold grudges not until after the dragon's been taken care of yes it's not profitable to kill us before the dragon is dead when it's time i think once we're there or in the sewers for old time's sake (laughter) hopefully in the keep we have a plan for dinner you're going to be in front if anything you should scry on greyskull how do you feel that will affect our plan i can almost promise you they do not have an elite swat team task force some stealthy individuals can you scry on a plant there is a tree no i can't help yeah no mint in box let's not we are this loopy because we're genuinely terrified and we're doing everything we can not to go i'm going to talk to cassandra about one last dip into the vaults to see if there's any potions we know we have to leave them with something in case everything goes wrong but anything we can take with us will be helpful and then i have to fix this giant mess of parts that are currently in my bag i may need to spend a little money i do apologize okay just letting you know it might be a bit expensive to get everything working again i will not spend it all i promise that was brazen yes if anyone asks about the plan the plan is chaos if everyone agrees with this we want to break up their forces as much as possible we want them sending ten percent of their forces to every edge of the city they know where we're going they know we're eventually heading to the center and he's not going to leave anymore but we're going to make it very difficult for them they're either going to be fighting us in every corner or they're going to be letting the entire city fall back to us you had five jobs-- kiki what are you doing we're working on getting a bigger cup that's a myth for the kids at home by the way just want to get that out there sorry can't fill their heads with bad ideas carry on are you a cop no i'd like to think that ha was passing that guy coming out of the pub and getting a second-- that went very well you did that here you go right there put a glove on if you're going to get high if you hold it for too long got to ride the dragon before you ride the dragon actually do i have to check even if i'm spending money how much do we have sorry i'll stop we'll find out i really try not to do that that's a dick move people are already iffy on these things i imagine wow that made five decisions and landed on a really good one that's 28 yeah bad news is the only one that is broken the rest survived oh okay feel better about that it is it's got a lot of moving parts and then i'm going to go and talk to cassandra quickly my lady we're preparing to leave we are preparing to have a small strike force go underneath the city and do what we can while the other armies hopefully distract thin the forces and give us a shot at taking care of this once and for all is there anything left in the vaults potion-wise especially healing potions we don't want to drain you obviously but i thought i would make one last push we will be grateful for you till the end of our days it may only be a day but you will have it (laughter) one hour will be all that is necessary or like a mixed drink that can get weird right water breathing before fire never been higher (laughter) i'd like to just grab cassandra really quickly and take her aside i will only take one moment of your time i've not had a moment to repay you for my part in all of this yet and if we survive i owe you much and if i don't seal off the city there is room underneath prepare for siege prepare to be a safe haven do not be-- do what you can to save the city do not get involved in the aftermath of this if we fail i will do my best we've-- for centuries you must know we have survived as realists and it is very hot down there and i do not like it good luck see you soon i shall and i go pack i was looking forward to a heroes' brunch personally capers of might there is an item and i'm currently holding it and i don't know if i'm the best person to be holding this but i'm just going to pass this down the line to see if anyone has an opinion it's a dex-based sword correct yeah or it can switch so it can be strength- or dex-based maybe this is the thing to hand to grog and one minute of invulnerability with that is possibly the cruellest thing that dragon will have ever experienced well it's an attuned weapon i don't know how many items you have attuned at the moment so you could go for a triple it's a one-handed sword so i'm not sure what is your-- which i do last time we went somewhere quick and bamfed in-- things went poorly but we could speak to her we could talk to her ditto my plan is to stay away from the fire but if i can't that would certainly help he's not going to leave his lair anymore he knows we're coming it doesn't serve them to lie to us it doesn't serve them in this moment no you know if you're always a liar and a scoundrel then no one will ever trust you to do anything they're only conveniently liars and scoundrels well he has his own army so we need to keep his army distracted so we're not fighting a dragon and an army so those armies will hopefully either distract the armies or if he chooses not to send the armies to fight the rest of the armies that we've brought all of our armies also converge on the dragon's nest and then we have everybody there no we have people that we can do for that although it's not just one army we have we have groups of them technically i was just-- oh no all around the city don't you laugh no no you don't get to laugh that scares us sadly the only weak point is-- i think this is a vague plan so that we don't all die if it's too specific then it's going to go wrong too quickly-- i'm actually very okay with this plan six months later where is everybody (laughter) there is no situation that anyone is going to come up with where we're looking good and this is going to work well there's just-- there's a dragon in the middle of the city with an evil army and we have to deal with it and there's just no positive way to deal with that it's not planning for defeat it's recognizing that no matter what ten minutes into it everything that we thought we knew is going to be wrong anyway no we're not we are going to surround the city he's all right we have communications fortified-ish well the hope is actually-- also we have the 50 men from fort daxio we can bring them in underground as well and just have them pop up-- --all sorts of places also open the gates he thinks there's a swat team i think you smile just the right amount meet or telepathically communicate also that way he'll have less time less effort defying us it's not written down it's all telepathic conversation or kima or trinket yeah he can stay back he has a crossbow far away we have a single battleship their fortified location also does not have siege engines just air force it could work the big fear there of course is that they work for a creature they already fear quite a bit i think a carrot would be easier than a stick i think it would be better to find a force for them to rush toward than to find something for them rush away from more carrot less stick and then meet the 50 men at greyskull keep a little bit do i have anything possibly still leftover at greyskull any of my supplies i make it myself half the time it could do you still have that siege arrow or is that gone now so we do have a siege arrow which will basically do the damage of-- it's a wall-shatterer it's designed to bring down stone yes but it is weirdly weighted and she's probably the one you want firing it yes it could i'd forgotten about that ground to air it can hold two dozen people on that ship right it's about three cannonade vox machina swearing that they're going to call you back for four years (laughter) we also have your friend it has cannonade as well and it is designed to hold sieges in the air so it will keep many of them busy and they're not that bright we can't count on anythingthat would be-- we were like back in school suddenly that was great that went so john hughes so quickly (laughter) i swear if you're aerating wine under there i'm going to be so upset (laughter) i can also say there's an easy way to do this-- just go downstairs cleaning the shotgun i have a quick thing i knock on vex's door i have a bag and i go to vex's door and knock on her door you're terrible it's me i have something to show you no i'm an evil green dragon let me in no this is a very-- open the door i have something to show you i don't remember but it was mostly to head in this direction can i come in i open the bag (laughter) we're going to start with the courage and not talk about dragons and i run in and shut the door you just stepped on the whole thing didn't you (laughter) i will be expecting labels for all of them no i can't it's beautiful it's like the kickstarter you didn't sign up for it's coming it's like that random final fantasy encounter just happened and you're like i only got ten feet it won't do a bonus to him he's not a dragon boy i did we still have that spare sword that was just that standard rapier that was just in the bag before from the general correct i think we have it we still have just a very standard nothing where it's barely a plus one-- just in case someone gets close enough to me that it's complicated it's probably better it's whatever stonefell had be pleased syldor the inevitably disappointed that's his full title oh that's fair it's okay we have plan b let's go deal with plan b or we can make allura do it do you have a sling ring are we supposed to get something from the-- oh god we were supposed to-- weren't we supposed to grab something earlier my brain is just turning to mush oh we got it already never mind that's right in fact if anything the less we speak to her at this point probably the better no most of these soldiers have at least night vision some form of darkvision i assume that is the plan we haven't really discussed it but-- or even breaching the south gate alone would be-- if all four gates are being-- it's also near greyskull keep they might be headed towards greyskull if i recall i believe they were heading there 50 men can move quietly we'll gather what we can we don't really know what's actually in there yet pretty far to be honest especially if we're-- well no that's-- it's the highest number he knows grog's not here i have to do something no not in an hour we go now i think nature itself is going to make some lightning strikes but it's still a real storm if the storm has taken the city there will be a break in the storm of a perfect circle where we are attacking-- the eye of a hurricane if it is not a force we can certainly look for it it will be a nice column that will-- chaos works very well back to greyskull i feel like i've had that awkward four minutes of like every con ever oh god natural 19 i haven't added yet 35 35 with the plus ten 35 i figured grabbing what's useful and maybe as a lark i might try and run a wire from my inert glove to cabal's ruin to see if i can actually get the charge to travel through it if i punch something yeah i'll use a charge-- i'll hold i'll find out in the moment won't i it's a keep not a castle oh i show kashaw the cask by the way i have some powdered death if you like this will explode very loudly you know i've honestly been too nervous to ever find out because everybody who plays with this loses a limb eventually that's my plan to the tunnels i'll take a greater i'd like to take a greater as well because i'm always far away i would love a fire resistance potion if one exists i'll take the fire resistance all right one fire resistance well grog already halves all of his damage quick rule point if he already takes a lot of half damage if he takes the potion it doesn't really affect it should go to vax because you're gonna get close so you should take the potion it doubles your hp double your hp where did you find a purple wood chip down here that's oh-- sweet bitter angry i hand the bottle to kash eating mayonnaise out of a jar mayonnaise i think that we will not act like lizard people and also anybody who can see through there are like-- they are idiots but they also-- they're used to seeing humans though and as long as we scatter and are fearful they'll-- we're still good i think mcfeast this is going to be over before that these things move quickly once we're down there they'll know we're here we need someone who can turn invisible and i gave it back that was a long time ago years how appropriate that we're going to be underground lizard people in the city of los angeles it is our best urban myth the lizard people of los angeles that's true i suppose the invisible people will lead the way we also know invisible person opens it and then somebody invisible keeps watch that may be the funniest that's ever been joke has been waiting for years we're friends of garthak garthok you should try and sell them drugs i think that would go well no he's got them he can sell them off absolutely twice a half a dozen there's no time to be honest two fire giants guarding the gates we have to get rid of them it's just a wall it's defensive we can get over the wall perhaps yeah you've got to go out the tunnel first spiderwalk we still have that-- 21 11 ten is on the good side of 3d6-- we're going to pass them you'd need a ten-foot radius to hit both of them smoke 'em if you got 'em i'm going to vape-- i'm going to vape my fire resistance oh yeah you can get that there merry deathmas we don't die i would watch the fuck out of that if anime has taught you anything-- i thought you were dead fred we need brian blessed we need brian blessed for everything he might be down
