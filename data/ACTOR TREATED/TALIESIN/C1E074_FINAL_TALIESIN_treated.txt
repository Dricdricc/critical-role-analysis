oh that thing and sticks cats scanlan cat just cats critical cats yeah it was kind of intense d& sparkle sparkle sparkle friendship [dramatic music] what let's scout first let's head there and then if everything seems copacetic by airship we do we do because your-- yeah your shit father oh shit hold on most of our friends are dead let's be fair they write notes i draw pictures wow travis and yes that is exactly what they call it when you have an establishment like a monty python animation back and forth that's what i'm talking about animal handling check we have done one no cover story we tell them who we are and what we're doing here it's a fort and they are at war as well this is specifically where you want things to attack as opposed to towns (deep and cool horn) piggy's got the conch laura and and no horns give us time it depends on who you ask really i'm going to take this moment to change out my attunement for my gloves from my sword i'm going to put my gloves on and unattune to my sword things are dire why not well that is true and that is the purpose for our visit oh i would say so we have to that will be job one oh yes and we'll have to sandwiches the airship will be heading here anyway we can load it with supplies as well to here everything will be coming here if things go the way that we hope they will i specifically looked left hoping we've actually already killed three of the five chroma conclave you can't just keep giving those away before we get ahead of ourselves our hope is that we think we can lure thordak out of the city and we think we can get him into a piece of terrain that gives us the advantage we were hoping this would be where we consolidate our forces and make a stand against him i hate you all we either face him in his home in his terrain with his guards everywhere with people we cannot trust everywhere or we lure him out and we bring him somewhere where we know the terrain where we have places to hide where we are prepared for him there's no guarantees but this is the best bet this is the best place for us at this point i'm sure you understand there are no guarantees we can work on that we can work on that well we can get to work we can get people in we can start making this place ready and we can start making a plan we have a lot of power and a lot of energy at our disposal well step one is food then actually they might already have a well here there's no food you can grow underground is there we have options that's like 5th level can this actually work can we use the spell this way we have to at least send word that's the first thing we have to-- i'm going to look at the battalions see if i can drudge up some people who actually know how these things function and start seeing how difficult it would be to get the ones that are broken working we do a lot of bunkers he gets that a lot ew seven all right we can make do we can make do i will definitely start making plans for the three that are functional to get them in tip-top working condition all right how many more of them were disheveled and broken and they each had their own spot okay that'll start at least i'm going to look for any improvements that can be made in defensive measures against flying creatures in any way if we use some stone shape we can make this even more defendable against flying creatures et cetera i'll start on one of the-- oh god my brain has completely turned to mush trebuchet thank you i love the word that'll do 25 around us especially we could still do work here here's what has to happen now we need to send word to as many people as possible that we are meeting here for the final confrontation we have to make sure that work continues here and then if there's time while our forces assemble and things prepare we have several things we can do in the meantime we have the stone as well we could that is absolutely on the table it's going to take us a week to get this place even remotely ready for this confrontation what happens in less than a week it's going to take a few days for that to happen to be set in motion let's see what we can do stop rolling that's really disconcerting when you sit there and roll at us we could ask for help from kraghammer as well we could write an awful lot of letters fassbender well dwell on that one well that would save us an enormous amount of energy that's possible let's put that on the possible list westruun they have the-- they have fassbender they could send a soldier with the fassbender you've saved us a trip to the feywild and back send word that if they can contact the werewolves the werewolves owe us a favor i suppose not that they would help with that as part of the message that if there's a pack with the werewolves--- and when you're back in whitestone send the airship our way loaded with food and supplies if you can and anybody who wishes to come fight yes staying in whitestone is the exact opposite of certain death that is the opposite of certain death i think that the clasp are going to be far more useful once they figure out the dragon has left the city and i don't even think they necessarily need to be notified of such a thing we could go to the fire plane really quickly yes there's an object it's from the fire plane we are facing a fire dragon which means it's something unbelievably useful or not useful at all we need ice weapons we need cold weapons and we don't have any either that or in that ship that we left behind so it doesn't matter then well at least that's a bonus in that means that anything will work as well as anything else raishan was going to feed him the information that he thought that we were here and then vanish i think raishan will be clever enough to give him just enough to get him here you'd have to ask raishan she might be willing to let me do such a thing it's all right we can head home from here someone has got to go home i can leave we've got one working if i stay i'll have two working if i stay longer i'll have three working but i'll go where we're most useful he's sent all of his dragons and nothing's worked and the more he sends the more we kill i don't believe he'll suffer that much indignity and that also means that the clasp will have an opportunity to take back the city if he leaves with his army yes if he leaves his army to actually manage the city-- either way it's stretching him thin they were there she's not going to come to the fire plane she's not going to come to the fire plane but you're right she does if i were her i wouldn't come we need agents on the ground right now things need to move forward here if opportunities present themselves to bring more people here or to gather more allies take them that works no it was a place to be looked at and they flew over and didn't see it i do that's not fair supplies are on the way soldiers are on the way do what you can-- cows eat hay neigh neigh hey so we say yes i love it we'll get as many of us on the carpet as possible you should feel bad we're going to blow it up again woo table flip we're going to take like 20 of them to the fight and they'll be fine this is the direst of situations extreme measures must be taken the stones don't work across planes do they but allura's ability to send messages does so if things start going very haywire we can let her know that she is to call us immediately and we will drop what we're doing plane shift we're gathering forces at fort daxio to fight this dragon and if you can lend any of your power or have any power you can send we'd be forever grateful soon that is where we will head immediately when we are done here all right i think we've done an enormous amount towards getting prepared for this wow okay i'm going to go with karin rindevall @karrey over in gothenburg for the amazing percy being very very busy and at work and reading and very upper crust very fancy the fanciest so fancy we're going to send a weird little halloween cornucopia of weird it'll be great (singing) city of brass city of brass-- thank you just one doors fan 15 15 i reach into the bag and i'm going to grab a little chunk of dragon and a chunk of the previous goristro that we still have some bits of and drop them in front of him on the ground i pick up the dragon scales and put them back in the bag that was a very good call always tip the doorman we are walking towards the door what do we know good sir one question before we enter your city since you are such a good friend and we look forward to possibly being friends again someday where would one find people who enjoy the sport of watching large creatures battle if you could think of such a thing i love your answer i think there's a lot of magic here well no let's-- six i'm going to use one of my resolves and slightly better 15 i think the city's huge that's the other question ten minutes-- and the other question is if you can change into a flying creature i'm looking for social gatherings pubs and otherwise ten minutes a fire elemental well here we go i'm all right with this this is a great way to die i am not hanging back i am right in the middle i'm trying to like be that middle point that keeps everything connected i'm keeping pace but i'm trying to be at the back end of it what's happening well all right (mccree voice) it's lunchtime oh yeah i follow suit yeah i'm running in there for god's sake you two tell them that you have to meet your owner yeah there are no good ideas anymore that's all the game is is getting lucky with bad ideas that's the angriest thing i've ever heard oh no run run yes they do no scanlan close the door well it's a little far away at the moment but we could do a bit of business because we have other business to attend to she know shit doctor strange is part of this one in about 15 years we're going to sit down and show you everything it's going to be great my word i'm certainly thinking of some plans how often can you cast it he's currently still linked to this realm we are trying to take care of as much of it as humanly possible as much as humanly possible perhaps a little bit more we are here for the little bit more we seek powers to help us defeat the dragon perhaps it is time to lay it on the line time is of the essence let's make a deal we seek a set of plate armor the plate of the dawnmartyr that is our belief depending on how things go we may even speak of perhaps commissioning some pieces your work is astounding possibly i would like to think so depending on how the next few weeks go there will be much to celebrate and your work is celebratory let me put forward a theory for you i hate those eyes i can't look at them i hate you whatever deal we make with you here for the record none of us will be staying we may be coming back to fulfill some service we may be coming back to fulfill some favor and we will if that is the deal we make but the deal we make will not include any of us is that understood is that agreeable only with him oh my god you people and i may have some things to excite you with as well stop it i know you've been doing it all game oh for god's sakes i put the chains on just for insanity's sake before i slip them on i'm going to take a little bit of gunpowder out of my pouch and sprinkle a little bit in the locks and have some on my hands oh it's going to be awful not enough to blow a hand off but yes not even his bare chest just nothing the void he's my new favorite the week after halloween the week after i'll never see victor again i have a new best friend
