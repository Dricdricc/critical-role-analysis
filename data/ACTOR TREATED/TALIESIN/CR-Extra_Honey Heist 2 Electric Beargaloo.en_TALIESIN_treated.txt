exactly what you are i also got a three i'll take the gray bowler yeah thank you there might be a backup plan maybe on the outskirts of town there's a place where about three or four nice beehives not too high up in the tree close enough to a running body of water that we throw it in there run away really quick and then we go in for a little bit of honey i fail i don't remember where it is but it was very-- yeah i was bear and it was criminal i didn't run into difficulty i attempted a flashback basically that was actually what i was trying to do yeah that was what i was trying to do if only we could find those beehives oh god bears can't-- can bears look up maybe that's part of the problem what he said they always leave something i want to rifle through the entire kitchen-- just through everything i want to go through every drawer empty it onto the floor and see what's there it's not searching i want to roll the place like a bear all right success do i find anything i was looking for
