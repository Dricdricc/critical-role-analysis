i will i will be at amazing comic con in hawaii next weekend actually i will be missing the game because i will be working on my pale in the moonlit shores of hawaii thank you this is as fresh as i can get because i've been sleeping in the studio you know i think i'm going to stick with the lavender for a while i think i'm slowly going to move it towards amethyst little green little blue yeah yeah no that's rockin' don't see why we can't do both i think we're going to have-- are we here i can't remember i think we're going to have to have a larger conversation about where everybody ends up in the very near future and while two people in and out of town is definitely agreeable i think there's a larger discussion to be had you do we have more appointments as well much to do today i think i know who to have that discussion with as well pike well i heard that he might not be home no he needs this he needs this it's all right absolutely needs this bugger all i say we give it a shove we're going to give a push to the front door we give a shove oh 18 is my strength i'm going to look around for personal effects papers 15 hello pike i've got good news he says he's not here i don't actually think we've met before hello ah percival frederickstein von musel klossowski de rolo iii it's a pleasure to meet you hello hi that took some doing well done i'll lean down for that they cry your name across the-- there's probably going to be a fight tomorrow there's no shame in prudence original recipe windex my favorite it's been a day i will we could bring him into the mansion we still have one more stop before the evening's done at dawn we quorum so we have two stops before the evening's done then there's a house we're supposed to plunder and we should plunder it yes we do master quall and i will admit i'm vaguely indifferent about whether or not he gets his property back but i am very keen to find out what that property is and what else he left if he left that --god forbid this is terrifying and this is proof that we should do it then who wants to fight the dragon tomorrow i would like to do three more days of research and planning-- i feel that that's not something we do spur of the moment come on no more of that talk no it is i assume at some point we're taking a short rest by the way oh lordy thank you we can all do it let's do it together talk before that happens first we're robbing an old man i think we have to convince kevdak to abandon this plan to attack the dragon-- oh no kevdak wrong one i'm sorry you all look vaguely the same to me i'm sorry no he's got the beard and the ability to kill me in my sleep i find you charming but no we have to convince them not to do this tomorrow i think that perhaps if it's possible to convince them to at least wait one more cycle to heal and prepare for the battle-- i genuinely don't understand the place you come from i feel much better about any decision to just leave then although we would have to do something about the city and everyone who's in it are they clever enough to attack the dragon at the point at which the drop is made or are they going to not make the drop and wait for the dragon to attack the city we also have to empty out the prisons if we get that chance of any of the citizens they may be holding will your cousin understand that we have a bigger battle to fight well we're walking while we're having it if i had time if i had a few days-- we could which is why we should get them to flee well the herd will leave i think i've seen it it's huge yes it'll be furious eventually yes how big is the black dragon if i-- if i had time i could build a machine that might be able to trap him on the ground for at least a little while i think-- i disagree with that i think we'll absolutely have opportunities to have an army and i think that if we call upon the herd later for something like this maybe we can get them-- i don't know as much time as it takes why don't we see how our favor holds let's take a moment i'm curious what the fates would say vax if you would be so kind check for traps well this is exactly what i was hoping for he's rich and paranoid so if anything is of value it'll be downstairs so i say we do upstairs first i don't know i certainly like him i could watch this all day i could try my dispel magic ability it's called a bullet i'll shoot it until it doesn't work anymore there were stairs there was no up we're learning so much tonight god they're working things out just let it happen check the chest check the chest double-check the bedroom for safes or things behind paintings or maybe some sort of carpet-- it's the voice of reason coming from downstairs (laughter) i know i'm just as depressed that it is as you are check paintings behind the paintings check the bed for any odd slidey bits trust paranoid rich people to know i hate investigation checks not touching anything just looking hm all right downstairs it is it's adorable isn't it do we have anybody who has telekinesis telekinesis of any kind make someone expendable it's a brilliant idea then at dawn we talk about things that's very unsettling okay let's everyone back up i want to touch everything in here i'm going to gingerly start looking to see if anything is useful because i have a lot of plans 14 celestial can i read any of it common celestial elven would i recognize any of the alchemical symbols i have no idea what you're talking about i feel like this is not the only room this is not enough i feel like there's-- i'm going to quickly take a look at the papers that were buried in-- failed attempts does he write his name anywhere damn it's installing windows i'm so sorry let's take all of this out of the house maybe the power of neil degrasse tyson is with you (laughter) because that's going to be great god i'm going to go diving to see if there's an instruction manual somewhere in this room i'm on my hands and knees going through the papers there's only one way to find out or cast a spell if only he had any spells keyleth has a pet giant robot i don't know what to make of this it's a thing i've been working on but apparently someone else has done it first so never mind never mind i'm not working on it anymore (laughter) it's pass√© and stupid i don't want to hear about it could we get him into the bag of holding yeah we don't have a big enough bag of holding yes it would be so mad max it would be beyond thunderdome perhaps let's try this somewhere that is not a basement filled with chemicals the dragon would find him a very uncomfortable horse pill to swallow we will tell him delicately to kneel and crawl not going to make them roll survival to get back she goes with the second thing that everybody shouts out literally i'm going to get in the way of this just for fun so once it's set in that motion it'll continue to kill that thing i want to check by the way liam are you imagining the eighties-era x-men danger room right now too with like the hoops and the bars ask a question all right this is good we're finding out its intelligence level it may not be smart enough to know that so it doesn't know anything that's good let's find out if it can does it have any magical properties beyond punching can it tell it to use magic and then i die and then you dye a blue streak in your hair and everything goes fine no no i'm with you i'm with you natural one no no no it's happening (slow-mo voice) this-- put-- (slow-mo voice) --the candle-- (slow-mo voice) --back wisdom where are we-- 16 you asked him a question as opposed to telling him to do it (slow-mo) hate-- you-- (laughter) (laughs) this is the most torturous thing ever no it's-- no it's good yes can it-- can it fly just try it how high did it jump all right out of idle curiosity two last important things that i would recommend perhaps fassbender go into recharge mode or sleep mode perhaps so that maybe it can regain some of its magic ability which it might burn through and two and i'm surprised that i'm the one to mention this but we should double-check to make sure that that thing isn't doing anything strange to your head i'm going to pick that up all right it's very nice take that off for a bit maybe it'll be your friend in the morning seems all right more than normal oh no you don't look different i know well you made a robot cast a spell on me an automaton i suppose that's fair how awful a person am i you wear armor i'll also weren't we at some point supposed to check the library for clues of the location of the next vestige yes that is a thing well we don't have to we know where she is she's in the prison we may just be able to get them to release her grog has to talk to them i don't feel comfortable fighting a dragon on 24 hours' notice after almost getting my arse handed to me that's not a lot of people we need to move a lot of people how many people are in theory still left in the city based on the size of the city and the number of people i've seen what would be my extrapolation i'm a reasonable human being triple digits four digits low four digits that'll do this is not a bad plan today we can save a town scanlan at least this could wait until after the danger's over only if we follow your example i was trying really hard here we can work on some sort of concoction if you need help sleeping after that information at this point that would keep me up for hours that's-- yeah i don't-- i don't think you're supposed to eat-- that's creative i'll have the soup other than take a rest i may run to try and quietly by myself grab a few things from the library that we may need for the next vestiges ah possibly in the morning oh all right then no that's fair something even in theory that we could convince it to take back to its lair if we still wanted to go with that we could load the next parcel with something-- a month would be better than a week-- yes three days would always be better than one have fun you guys i'll be on a beach next week but-- it's okay i'll be i'll try-- to hawaii i can skype in i'll try and skype in i'll see how much internet i can get on the island
