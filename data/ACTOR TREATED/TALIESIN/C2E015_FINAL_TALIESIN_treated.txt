sometimes when you jump the shark there's just more sharks there it's going to be in there isn't it everybody have their stuff together the back of the boat would actually be up a bit you've got your holy oil right i believe or was it-- you throw it at something that looks evil it's pretty simple it doesn't work that way sadly it's not-- water balloon with glass is the general feeling of supernatural unease coming from either of the-- or any signs of-- i know that we're going to be facing probably some will-o'-wisps or something like that any sound coming from either of them you could literally be walking along side of the boat i would assume i'm in the middle seventaliesin  eins zwei drei laura laura (muffled yelling) that's nice i'm going to take out my swords and just i'm going to try and cleave some of these tentacles off see if i can start to get it to lose its grip i'm going to take my first shot i'm going to stop saying that that's a 23 to hit thank you nine points of damage welcome we probably should head towards the other one that ends my turn but we can boat in there what are those things on the side okay that was an intense roll right now oh (laughter) sure i know are they within striking distance i'm going to hold my action until something's within striking distance i will also say i'm at least going to back up to the side of the boat where i'm far enough away from that thing as humanly possible oh well fine yeah didn't you cast a light spell let's park the boats does that sound like a will-o'-wisp does this ring any bells then more expensive things tend to be up but i'm happy to start with down i didn't even catch that i'm after jester or after fjord cats can see your soul i'm going for it it's classic really this is a great installation do i recognize any of these symbols does anything look familiar skills i got acrobatics insight deception sleight of hand investigation and survival also that's my thought you don't have a heal cantrip do you i hand nott a handful of ball bearings we can fix that is that including the bonus wow oh well done with-- oh my god your hand that's-- ugh did you just pocket a thumb i think let's all head up in that direction but put frumpkin first i think frumpkin ahead but let's-- we're also going to have to keep checking for traps and then we'll send people down when we need it well we've got to figure out what we-- i'll take third still 11 down i'm going to go check out the other alcove three red urns i'm going to take a look at the other one i'm going to start with one of my blades yeah i'm looking at the other urn is anything happening oh my god really i rolled the same initiative this is the worst initiative ever seven i'm trapped in that-- well never mind damn it oh that hits wow i know what these things are do i understand what's happening with why they're going back to the pots to whatever's in the pots i'm actively tracking these at this point i would imagine so i can't be surprised anymore all right can i scoot around the-- i assume the clay pot is on the other side of that will-o'-wisp right now i'm going to scoot around to that side i'm going to take my first shot at the will-o'-wisp as i'm dancing around it yeah let's see if this hits 17 my god really i'm going to take my bonus action and i'm going to break the pot yes i do 11 points all right that's eight points of damage other than that i'm going to take a look at it down below to see if there's anything in there that's weird the one on the roof i'm going to pick up the bottom half of that and i'm going to examine immediately what i've got i was going to say yasha maybe we should probably put a light in there this is how they clean the room we already have a rope down oh yeah short rest i believe in you this is fine how big are the bevels that have the relief of the 12-- and the bowls mm--hmm clean them off a bit i've got an idea i'm going to start rocking upstairs i'm walking upstairs i have the bowls i'm going to take a look at that purple-- is there only one of those little purple glowing rocks that seems to be creating light i'm going to open it and i will-- i'm going to poke at it to see if it seems trapped or anything all right 16 i'm going to open it and grab the stone out that's a six beau can you punch this is that your new nickname simple tool well you did do this i won't tell anyone come on we walk back down with it beau retrieved this maybe we've got a glowing rock i'm going to put it in the room see if anything happens we've got these bowls i'm going to put the bowls gingerly i'm going to put one of the bowls on one of the symbols to see what happens put it-- middle of the star i'm going to try and move the bowl to match the engravings in the ceiling what's the the top of the rod again the top of that little spiral i'm going to examine it anything interesting about it just a small metallic knob like a lightning rod let's do the other two crickets eight the radiant didn't seem to have an extra effect then are you staying next to it or you-- yeah you don't need to does that get halved because of raging i'm going to try just for shits and giggles i'm going to activate the ice damage on my sword i'm going to run up-- where am i over there i'm going to run up take a swing at that corner-- so that's 14 to hit i know it's like just in case i will be the one to miss and that's six plus one ice so that's seven damage it's my bonus to activate it i'm going to back off into the corner then yeah so i'm using that whoa is it racial features or class features it would be racial features class features at disadvantage advantage is over what no these things happen well we have to do it in the bowl there is a room outside this room where it seems like there was a room for maybe preparing the bowls i would say the one that i had i probably polished up i'll hold the bowl i'm resistant to fire look at this there we are we need-- transmutation-- that's-- and we need enchantment illusion and enchantment i don't think it turns i've got an idea i think i know how it works now this is great i think that this is a guide we know what we need to know because of these bowls i think we need all three of these versions of the spells placed in each of these points everybody stand at their point (sarcastically) are you sure we need transmutation and illusion if anything starts to happen i want you to run for the door that would be the three dots we need fighters just in case i'm going to light my other sword too i would stand in front of the symbols on the triangle personally check for traps i'm going to start heading in this direction too does one of them look like it was possibly holding a gelatinous cube at some point don't spoil it for her we'll find out in an hour or so anyway yay double digits i'll go take a look at the other cage 19 would i be insane for thinking this is how they make them this was a factory maybe i want to wait for caleb at this point i've got a light stone in my pocket if anyone wants to go for it here hold on-- careful this can't go wrong put it in the bag are those ceramic pots giving anything off character details under description is there an audiobook version of this what's in the urn i want to take a look at some of these cages with the urns i saw something happen in that cage
