throws and to your attacks 012516896 --> 012517980 all your saving throws and your attacks you add a d4 012521738 --> 012523515 no it's a concentration spell so a little something something 012528468 --> 012531250 does it look like he's going to make an attack because i'm going to start scooting towards-- 012536569 --> 012541758 how far away is caleb currently 012548413 --> 012550259 i'm going to point and start walking that way just going-- is he going to make a swing 012602186 --> 012604021 okay i can't use a bonus action to convince him to let me walk by can i 012609157 --> 012610423 oh yeah would i know that or would i not know that 012618507 --> 012619529 okay that's fair all right it's looking like he's going to hold-- 012622978 --> 012628359 i'm going to turn to the other side of him while not being very aggressive and i'm going to-- 012634011 --> 012636376 i know but he's-- 012638411 --> 012639372 he needs a little bit of healing-- 012640518 --> 012641501 while we're having that conversation i'm going to flip around to the other side of him 012644576 --> 012647159 so i'm a little further away from yasha the other way 012647159 --> 012648323 yeah keep going there not quite in contact with the other-- 012652116 --> 012653926 i'm not going to quite bump into them you know 012656138 --> 012658581 is there shit i can do with my bonus or is there nothing i can do with my bonus probably 012704608 --> 012717640 not that might be everything i can do yeah i'm going to cast a quick healing word on yasha who 012717640 --> 012719705 could probably use a quick healing word 012719705 --> 012721547 so take a little-- 012723537 --> 012725886 ooh that's nice take an extra nine points of healing 012729060 --> 012730463 they have an official sash 013027324 --> 013031917 is he

024049953 --> 024052505 yeah it's a lot different kind of game 024053990 --> 024059236 or an island where we-- 024154879 --> 024156953 we can use divination 024410368 --> 024411474 if it's been 24
