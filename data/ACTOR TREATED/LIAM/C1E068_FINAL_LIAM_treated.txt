were there people on the ship so probably dead a little creepy but a very good job have i got about 30 or 40 minutes left for the wings yeah i'm going to fly out over where the ship was and see if anybody is doing the dog paddle out there boats there's little boats (singing) hello my name is simon 17 wow i did that too except i went into the woods boogie board in character or out of character bye into your 5000 hit points hopefully you're close how far away did i get 60 feet yeah yes then i would like to fly straight at the maelstrom i would like to do that actually i hope so i hope so and is that trinket right next to it then i will get sneak attack damage and i would like to use oh good god divine smite on the attack right all right that's a 20 that's a 30 yeah it went one 19 all right so we start with a one and then we add these two three four nine 15 20 25 28 plus divine smite since this is the first time i've ever done it is 2d8 what did i just get up to shit travis and 28 thank you plus divine smite is 20 30 38 so i used movement to get there i'm going to swipe again because i've got the bonus action love it that is 24 yeah so excited by the divine smite there's that and that is a little bitty two plus six is eight and i forgot to add my bonus to the dagger before so you can make that 14 for total damage i'm a real paladin glass as well or-- air elementals

level up (laughter) oh let me see what my constitution bonus is oh it's nothing you're a bird i say i'm going to have to kill you dear boy i am so ready for this hit me subtracted from me instead he never gives me inspiration that often what is it i have a rules question dm normally when i attack one character one attack gets sneak attack but can i sneak attack the one behind me and attack the other one that's by keyleth i've got friends around both on one okay then i'm going to shank backwards to the one behind me and it's flanked there's four of us around it so advantage on this one okay 23 this one three plus (yelps) four equals seven 28 on that one i was hoping that would happen and then i'm going to dive and roll around keyleth and stab the next one no i meant to run that way can i run through it and attack and that was a 23 to hit which is a big seven strength damn it i'm going to use luck ugh screw you inspiration die i mean thank you for it but still screw you i'm going to use my inspiration on top of that oh yay 16 damn it gil how much damage was that six okay i'm dead who's missed is that all natural 20 i want to take a little run towards the water and then shoot out

that's right three times i can do it in a day fancy me oh okay good thing that i'm being quiet so i'm going to still creep toward the whispers what do they look like so goliath ripley and the third what does the third look like i go back and i go directly towards percival (quietly) she is there (whispering) shut the fuck up (quietly) she is there grog there's a big woman of your breed there and a third i don't know what i don't know if it's a he or a she i don't know who it is from my vantage point that i had how far away was i from them we can overtake her now if we go right now do we want to use these there's a big woman in there she's all yours eight point eight like a 1980s halloween mask shazbot mister belvedere the third figure is by ripley the goliath is off on her own with some sort of box i'd like to not go direct but slowly start creeping around through that green is that a he or she that i'm hearing is it a surprise at this point or no is it blown okay 24 on ripley i get sneak attack because i'm first to go it's not surprise all right fuck (counting) 34 34 and the second dagger will go as well for seven plus poison dc of 15 did the poison take effect can i hide again and circle around further 25 on stealth 22 i knew it i fucking knew it i'd like to throw at her again as well i rolled a 37 does evasion factor into this 28 vegetation is gone here right and everybody
