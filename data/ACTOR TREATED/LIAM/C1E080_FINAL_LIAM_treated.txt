i don't know what this-- ♪ whoo ♪♪ before we ran into the bigger chamber gilmore and jarret had caught up with us if i remember correctly i remember that they did that's what i mean spider percy's my favorite percy he's doing this and nothing's happening if anyone can make it it's you twenty-seven evasion keeps me at zero yeah but we saw where she was before she went into-- yeah your screen is flipped - there's a storm cloud two 13's not the mama three weeks to stew everybody i'm gonna take to the air i'm going to-- do i still feel hasted yet i'm going to fly past my sister and slap the one greater healing potion i have into her palm oh superior excuse me and then i'm going to curve around over keyleth and stab the egg there with the dragon slayer blade - yes - that is 29 twenty-six i'm gonna take whisper and take that further that is 28 to hit - that's a total of 15 fifteen - and i have--if i'm still hasted i have a lot of movement left so i'm going to fly and hover about 15 feet above the egg towards you towards your dm tape on the side there - yeah fifteen feet in the air ♪ i have 120 feet of movement total hasted no i'm all the way over there - that's not where i want to be i want to be-- i'm arguing with her not you cause that's what we do cause we love each other okay fifteen feet in the air that's not the egg that i'm talking about though i'm talking about the egg closer to matt there - this is where i want to go that's over there it's the--it's the flip screen is-- i don't want to go there i want to go across from everybody it's the flip i'm gonna kill you all there there the egg that's there literally in game the boots right oh wait she's with him - nice clerics are-- you know - you ruined the surprise i'll pretend like i suffer it myself - how high is it to these holes in the ceiling from-- good and they're all red they're all red shaun breaks in half welcome to hot pepper gaming no movement either yeah this is fucking-- (indistinct whispering) i'm still in the same position 15 feet up that i was i'm just a little nervous is all maybe pike pike it's your turn yeah let's buff everybody but she can move forward but she could get closer to--to vex right yeah if she gets near vex then she can get grog gilmore percy yeah yeah - closer to percy - keyleth as well why not gilmore stabs vax ceiling she's in the fucking ceiling man yeah i'm sorry alien ceiling true to form oh he's sticking to it yeah hanging off a wall first we'll all mash together yeah - oh thank god - okay she gets the meteor i hope it's good -it's a one - in the fire fort - yep yep yep - superior plus eight - okay just to clarify so looking at the minis the back side's to me but really her face is poking out of a hole right front half of her and she's-- and she's at the roof which is 70 feet up so maybe her head is down like five feet out ten feet out something like that alright i want to and i'm--i'm back right -after - i want to fly-- - go ahead - so if i'm 15 feet up and she's maybe 65 down i'm within range for sharpshooter already so and-- and last question when you do-- for duel wielding action-- bonus action but you told me once you can reverse that and do bonus action and action i think never mind then i'm gonna fly straight at her face and i'm gonna shove the dragon slayer sword into her mouth and i want to try to sever her fucking tongue out of her mouth - terrible whisper i'm gonna do the same thing with the bonus action that is 26 ten plus four psychic damage 14 i should have like 10 or 15 movement left with 60 for wings yeah if i was 15 feet up and she was a little less than 70 so am i at zero okay all done don't think that hits actually so i'll use uncanny dodge 10000 shit it just hits - okay aim it at-- - eighteen - yeah yep did you forget come on golden snitch do it find one thing and do it well watch this i'm gonna get turned into pulled pork right now eleven for pike can you say it in spanish that just hits uncanny dodge the first one is uncanny and then the rest are-- not from that-- so that our hero's feast does nothing is that the total-- vax is falling (gasps) is this a death save that sucks i don't-- i don't know have i got any automatic fails in a death save hitting the ground - the armor is set to flame resistance okay i'm rolling an advantage twelve succeed so we're good we're good i feel like in another dimension this didn't go so well no no no duvet duvall - vax wakes up for two seconds says you da man and then lies back down (laughter) probably not it was kind of like rainbows gilmore's wearing one right now he's a really good actor yes well we'll find out thank you she dead - oh shit okay so half my movement just to get to standing right okay i'm gonna throw whisper flame tongue raishan should be within 60 feet yeah - okay -seventeen for the first - second is 22 - ten - ten - and i'm going to use my remaining 15 of movement to go diagonally away from raishan away from-- diagonal - yeah um - matt my wings are toast right j'mon - nobody expects the marquette inquisition grog is within range - still in the game - eighteen - eighteen thirteen - no hey thank you death save - i made it - take your earrings off come on pike how close is she to-- - she's gonna run up kneel down wait kiss vex on the forehead and say not like this buddy and cast revivify for her last spell pike is unconscious who's she near she didn't know she had 'em so we didn't use 'em she's dead - so the sprinter's boots do nothing i mean i don't know so will she get there alright so revivify - it's instantaneous one action instantaneous my gosh she grabs a dagger out of vex's belt and cuts off a lock of her hair and presses it into vex's hand it's not time it's not time for you no ♪ geez i don't-- yeah we're talking about getting people back up at this point not healing cause any hit is lethal so getting someone on their feet who's on the ground by grog no i know i am but who else is that is someone up besides me go well i gotta go i've got one success yeah attack of opportunity j'mon i'm two failures - i can heal people if i get up get out get out are we out of combat now i stumble over to my sister and cast lay on hands and give her five to bring her back i haven't done anything with lay on hands or i might have done it once but i always do very small amounts i have a total of 15 hit points cause i'm a third level-- but i've never used more than five with that spell cause it's worthless to heal it's just good for bringing up so i have at least 10 hit points left - five hit points that's fine i'm gonna use the rest of my movement to stand everyone who's down who's down and i don't mean dead -pike just got-- - is kima conscious - so we've got dead scanlan and that's it i'm done wait where's that egg - it doesn't matter i'm done i'm done no no no let's start a youtube video on it you get a tunnel for all of us mate around or under destroying the last egg i'm just gonna move towards the gate put my hand out and see if i can go through or if i get stopped alright everybody quietly she just wanted to talk to it one last roll in the hay been nice if i'd cut out her tongue i mean you're gonna say you don't know but if j'mon had not nurked those three attacks that round might she have gone down he should have stretched before the fight -
