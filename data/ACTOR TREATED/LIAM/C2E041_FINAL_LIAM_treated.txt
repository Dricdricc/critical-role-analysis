science comic book he's fucking amazing and the cover is-- this is the standard this book is so beautiful show that thing off and i'm going to find a picture i'm going to show off a little ioun look at this while they're fucking i would try to locate caduceus on the boat actually i don't know if he's hiding or not i will go to where he is on the boat and-- (knocking) you look-- tired as i feel do you have a moment may i come in (clears throat) i feel a little poorly for the time you have been having traveling with us it was not a very good day it's been a string of bad ones in fact and i am grateful to have you along with this group because we get hurt a lot and stick our noses places maybe we shouldn't you have been very helpful is it your intention to continue on with us well sometimes acts of good faith deserve to be rewarded when they can i wanted to give you something that will make your time with us a little bit easier i suppose i start to pull the periapt out and untie it this-- you know i'm always so far back away from-- i hear you laura in my peripheral i hear you i'm always very far back anyway this isn't doing me much good and it's better that you stay up more than i stay up because if you go down that's it this is a little bit of extra protection-- anyway i don't know i would like to think not but i don't know that's a pretty big matzo ball if you have this-- this is magic by the way here you go i help you that makes it easier to help all of us welcome to the nein okay i feel like shit so i'm going to go to bed rolling them double ones periapt of wound closure it just feels right that it's with you makes it harder for him to die it was molly's where's my owl you have three or four more days if you want yeah i-- iowl you want to know if this is something do you have a moment okay i will cast identify on this ja that's a feather that's just a feather it's good looking though okay are you good it's pretty cute jesus christ dibs i know which direction is north at all times i don't forget anything i'm real smart in-game just in the game oh jeez what the fuck caleb runs up from under the deck with sulfur in one hand and bat shit in the other one what is going on what is this what are we doing aren't we--oh oh you're good i could fix it do you need that yeah okay she is intimidating i fire off a fire bolt straight up into the sky in an arc over and let it land in the ocean yeah a fire bolt you don't want us to be unhappy 11 also when you are down there you hear in the back of your skull books i start lobbing fire bolts into the sea like i'm skipping stones every ten or 15 seconds okay caduceus aired the fact that he is a little nervous so i place my hand on caduceus' shoulder and then look through frumpkin's eyes to see what's going on oh i wasn't trying to do a perception check i'm not searching for anything i'm just checking in that's exactly what i want to do i call out up there captain your quartermaster is under attack we'll see i actually want to ask frumpkin to do something from on deck okay frumpkin is going to fly over towards this gentleman and try to with talons rake across his head with advantage because he's stunned yeah that's a 15 or an 18 i cast vampiric touch through frumpkin's touch and he takes 3d6 necrotic damage through me me through her him damn it that is eight points of necrotic damage to him mm-hmm frumpkin lands on his head as soon as caleb felt caduceus walk away he dropped frumpkin's sight because he didn't want to be smacked in the face but frumpkin will listen to you i know that it is true because i think his thoughts and he thinks mine we are the best of friends he's the best cat that any man could ever have (pigeon cooing) magical traps (as nott) almost got it (parrot voice) captain cupcake i rolled a 12 on insight it's a seven yeah it's a seven no oh it is a one no i've been exactly where i was do you want to know more about my cat because you walked off before the funny thing about a cat is that they are very persnickety but with the right person they are not frumpkin with me we are just so no that would be-- i'm a very intelligent person that would be foolish i don't talk to thin air also some people say that they have nine lives which is funny because we-- did you find books it's a long shot we are on the-- you thought it too didn't you liam marisha and ja you're telling me your love of higher learning i understand did you need something because you clearly don't want to hear about cats so we could end this now that would have been so awesome i can talk now okay i will still help you i need a moment so i set it down and start scrawling on the floor around it and about ten minutes later i have-- no because-- well i guess i wasn't there no i mean if they put the box down in front of me that's a lucky find you shush now give me a moment (mechanical noises) ten minutes later after i transform into an autobot i cast identify through the ritual spellcasting feat (gasping) i need time it's a long piece of paper it's a lot of knowledge so you talk amongst yourselves for one minute it's endless but it takes ten minutes sit down this is your lucky day this is very dangerous to give to you but you are the perfect person to have it so of course well here it is it is yours this will allow you to paint things and they become real almost anything nothing too fancy this will allow her to paint a door and there to be a door this will allow her to paint a sword and there will be a sword all you can eat fjord i explain it all in about a minute so just don't create a penis on my head okay and we're square excellent no it cannot do that it cannot create fabulous jewels and it cannot create piles of gold you could in theory paint a small boat on the deck of the ship if no one was watching but that would be a difficult thing to do it would create a facsimile of that but it would be worthless what (see-n-spell voice) this is a formica table green is its color this is good this can blast an enemy with a bit of arcane oomph a little bit yeah you have a shield did we bring him down here yet go to hell let's get captain tusktooth down here because that was an interesting afternoon but it was not what i want to do with the rest of my life that's the go-to will hurt your enemies not just protect you i mean this is a matter of survival if we do not cooperate she's going to kill us i'm not opposed per se to what went down today but it's not what i want to do with my life i would prefer to break away from this woman but we're here for you right now you are trying to figure out you know your thing i think i'd like to hear from you what the long-term plan is are we on the ship in the sea is that what you're after what is the good scenario the good version of releasing a massive serpent onto the menagerie coast she's made her interest pretty clear of course i will follow how far away is she we're in broad daylight just dicks dropping into the ocean not far of course you can i scan around for avantika okay that is a 22 you are dealing with very large responsibilities right now i don't envy your position you know my father was a soldier and he expected a lot i learned a lot from him i've tried to live up to the man that he was and i've largely failed but i've picked up what i could used my wits understand my surroundings i wish i had half the courage he did i don't know you know i think traveling with all of you has emboldened me some i was alone for a long time and ran from everything i like this group and i enjoy traveling with you fjord i've always been like that i have a very good memory i remember everything i feel like a fool much of the time i'm glad you think so highly of me i start nervously twiddling a wire in my hand absentmindedly keep the group safe as always i will do my best i cough very hard into my hands and cast message to him and briefly quietly say i think that woman is going to try to kill you i really do (coughing) yeah do you have some i receive it there's not much left most of it spilled is this a custom it's good private conversation the wettest dream you've successfully secured deez nuts when life gives you pepper make pepper arrows 14 25 (whispering) uk'otoa yes muscle is obviously everywhere we're going to be following the people who have been here before following up on fjord's question or travis' question the muscle that we see around us does it look like it's-- are we in deadwood or is there a strong police force of sorts that is making sure that shit is not going down constantly yeah is there anyone in charge or is it just a saloon with cowboys everywhere probably the only rule here is talk shit get hit oh my name is philip oh is this required refugee from the empire looking for better life guys we're the heroes here
