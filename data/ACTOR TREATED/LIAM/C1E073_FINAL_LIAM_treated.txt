dragon yeah i don't want you to question your decision here all right there's no question but if you could i have two favors i want to ask first one is after i leave here today could you embrace these people yeah i know and i know you have reservations and i know that you've got guilt when i walk out of here i want you to work on letting go of that for real leap of faith kind of shit just let go of it i know scratch that three favors yeah i know i'm a handful the second one i don't even need for you to say anything about this but you know the white-haired guy i travel with yeah he's got a sister and i don't want you to do anything other than keep an eye on her and keep her safe we're going into the lion's den soon i think and we'll probably come out of it but just in case she's got a lot on her shoulders you know that so just keep an eye on her that's it all right and the last thing you've got those knives i gave you right yeah hold onto them i trust you i need you to watch after one last thing thing for me all right it's very important i wake up simon and i let him crawl down my arm do you see this guy he's been with me through a lot and i don't want him at the bottom of a ditch i have never been more sure of anything in my life i want you to have him and i want you to take care of him kynan i need you to believe in second chances i believe you i give a slap on his cheek remember everything i said all right you're a good kid (whack) i'll see you later all right she should really take one hit point of damage (laughter) vax is leaning against the door to this chamber by the way i am curious what the master of secrets thinks asum what do you propose we do cut off the head of the king you've got nothing anything that would piss him off so your prediction is that we have to slog our way through the outskirts of emon to fight him on his home turf is that about the size of it so are we talking about sending everyone we know and everything we have to the outskirts of town-- yeah we create a massive fucking clusterfuck on the edge of his periphery and we go for the center we've probably got a week or two well we take a day or two and we amass every heavy fucking hitter we have and we do this what other choice do we have a lot of us are going to die percy everywhere is at great risk right now we're going to take a day or two we're going to figure out how to get who we have to where we need we're not doing this tomorrow in a couple of days three days four days at the most it's not ideal but it's what we have to do it's at least as big as tal'dorei i mean it's another dimension well we know we don't have a lot of time but do we maybe want to table this and think on it they are a rarity yeah that's a big maybe that's a big maybe yeah it's too late he did it check out the brain on brad oh man he's not making you roll stealth motherfucker because i would and hotis did on me no it's not backpedal backpedal backpedal yes we know darling we know three seconds of costume that's all you get (laughter) do the frigging helmet i had my arm behind my back for two hours commitment you now look like one of your own bullets (laughter) what happens if we say no to that but no one make any mistake she's lying to our faces she is not telling us what she wants or what she wants to do you have a whole plan shut the fuck up you've been droning on for an hour shut the fuck up you're not telling us what you want you fucking shit bag fuck you does anyone really believe that this is all going to be fixed if we work with her yeah he's not going to leave his nest we're also not alone here allura how does this sit with you yeah i feel a little better here it would go a long way to earning some trust (whispers) good luck with that hi larkin yes you did percival yeah you shifted gears very quickly there uh-huh i mean i'm not the only one who thinks she's more dangerous than he is at this point we've got 24 hours is there anyone around right now 20 natural 20 for perception yeah i said is anyone around and i rolled a 20 i know but you know what i'm talking about you know what i'm talking about there it is it's right there invisible fucking larkin dwarf dragon all right that's a 20 i mean for science right let's go you look really good without a beard grog i've always thought so brush cleaning out the fingernails what's the benefit of working with her what if we tell her we're going to fake her death and then we kill her for real if we have to hope that she's actually going to fight with us she's done it once we don't know that she's going to do it again we don't know and you've been working on it for months and you are smarter than us something for pickle yeah it doesn't matter what percy says no you don't know what she's talking about it's esperanto anything alive so you're saying there's a chance that idea's not grrreat (laughter) nope just drunkenly popped in my head yes i mean that's basically what's going to happen yeah i think thordak's a fucking meathead and we should take care of raishan ahead of time yes revisionist history likely there's a master plan we understand that's the only thing we can count on allura any chance you know the gate spell syngorn kima allura slayer's take yeah what are we going to do with that money when we're dead nothing well we're talking about building an army to kill the general we can count on her to be duplicitous we gather forces we take out thordak we'll figure out how we're going to do it we're not saying throw every spaghetti at the wall we figure that out then we talk about the real enemy well i don't know how we're going to get the king out of the castle but yeah let's go buy some black powder this is the time and he's in 16-bit every time (laughter) dumbfuck ending you've got that gunslinger sneak attack times ten damage against a green dragon matt you've got a little something right-- just put him on melrose (singing) it's sergeant pepper's
