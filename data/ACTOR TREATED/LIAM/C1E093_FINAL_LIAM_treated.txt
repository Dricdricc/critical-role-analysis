goods already first blade goes and i'm going to smite him no i'm not i went already i have it because i'm going before because i'm smiting him first hit's for 55 total that's the first the second is a 20 to hit and the third is a 27 to hit the next one i will try-- so he has to save against a dc 15 for poison on the second attack yeah i figured i'd try the next is nine plus psychic damage damn it 12 so a total of 14 just for those two attacks and then i will use some more movement to move past grog still in the hole pressed against the outside of the door out of his sight moneybags what the hell it's hard to see the smaller ones the bear musk over here is palpable (laughter) (sings) you got the touch-- marisha and i'm totally into you (stammering) utugash gang sign gang sign everybody

there's a little space up top tary you got some kind of dispel magic over there all right i'm going to use my bonus action to cast vow of enmity on the bone devil then i'm going to use one of my two actions i'm using an action to disengage from the bone devil and dance back past doty and then i'm going to chuck a goddamn vestige at this motherfucker at advantage oh i rolled the same thing on both 24 to hit okay so he's going to get it right here we go two plus eight is ten plus-- 38 and i will smite him as well 52 that's it i'm done tova fire oh well i'm good i'm fine i'm at advantage
