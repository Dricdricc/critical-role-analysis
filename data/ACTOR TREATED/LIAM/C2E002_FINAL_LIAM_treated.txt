i am also going to bak-anime not to be confused with sacanime on february 3rd and 4th b-a-k that's real soon so i'll be there wait comic book next week issue four comic book with crownsguard if i could just contribute one word the 40 or so people who are outside and the rest of us will vouch for this one the colorful one he saved many people's lives don't take my word for it there's everyone outside i send frumpkin to follow i don't know i'm having second thoughts about being here at all yes and we're not going to leave without him why don't we just-- that's right dm is it possible for me if nott is holding my hand and leading me to go full third eye and walk blind and deaf here looking through frumpkin's senses right i can talk but i can't hear you i can talk and hold her hand so she can stop me from prat-falling all over myself but we've done this before so you know to squeeze my hand really hard if i should pipe down first of the show i'm going to call my cat back to me and i drop the telepathy and i just start tugging you back to the nestled nook come on we have to talk about this we have to decide what we're going to do my cat was in there but not i well we would've walked up to the building the cat would've scurried around if possible so i'd like to think that i heard all that which is why just i said all the things i did that's eight frumpkins we're not there yeah we're having a talk during all of that i would have dragged you back here brought you upstairs and i whip off my ratty coat throw it on the bed and sit down on the ground so that i'm eye level with you nott nott you and i have to make some decisions right now okay yes well i know why we said we were coming here yeah i didn't say i also had the idea-- you know you and i meeting and teaming up has been a good thing that's what i like about you i have been thinking and yesterday just furthers that thinking that i don't think you and i are enough i had the idea that we would come here maybe and find others that we could tag along with or meet up the way you and i did but now i think that is a terrible idea the people we spent the day with are lunatics i don't think that we can do this i've changed my mind entirely and i think we should go but we can't now because we are stuck here for the moment no you know i had not thought of it quite in that way and that is a good point but i am not convinced i'm not convinced and perhaps we're better off-- maybe i was too ambitious all right well we'll wait and see while we're here one thing okay no money pot no rat food none of those plays i have silver we don't need it right now we're sealed here and they are watching we're with a couple of tieflings a little person in a doll mask and a dirty ginger we've got people staring at us every second of the day we need to dial it back a little bit you just talk to me you hold frumpkin just keep your hands full with frumpkin okay hold my cat okay and then this is going to blow over because we didn't do anything we did something good that's right but it was a good show wasn't it i was going to suggest the same thing in fact i think we should go downstairs they're going to be coming back we don't want to cause a stir with them either we just want to leave if that's what we're going to do okay let's get a drink we head downstairs we did i did not come to trostenwald to go to jail we are tired we've been traveling a long time we've been saving wanted to take it easy for a few days i wander away from these two with their questions and i sit down with molly i would love to see something cool that's pretty good have you always been an artist so where do you two come from yes you two with the horns no you are very different it's very clear he's every color remember when we started the first campaign and all those places came in a split second and all that history i'm from shrev`nam chicago oh yes so you're a traveler then since childhood you have a lot of scars frumpkin scrabbles up onto nott's shoulder do you see many goblins walking around cities here well let me make it clear goblins are not typically welcome in any cities that is why the mask we don't have many of those at the moment it's like a nervous tick a little bit there is that one magic trick that you're able to do would you like to show them the magic trick that you can do i pull out a small red clay ceramic bowl then i pull out a copper piece here you know the trick right you're good fibulous that is a silver coin right there the magic is not that strong also you know they basically helped us out today you can do it for one for them it can be whatever you want it to be you have to agree upon it and you have to focus on that word for one full day while you are in possession of the pot skinky doodie that is unique i'm sure no one else has possession of that arcane power word i could consider it yours if you focused on it all day tomorrow but you really have to focus you want to see a trick i am well into my second trost at this point i can show you a trick young lady if you would assist me please step up onto the table adjust your minds i begin to weave one hand in a slow circle around the other and a globe of golden light poofs out a second little globule of light comes out then two more at the same time come out of my hand then they amass upon my little companion and form a similar sized little humanoid of light that then coincides with my little friend she is glowing golden on a table in the middle of the nestled nook the goblight ladies and gentlemen the goblight i could always do that a little bit as a kid i was always good with magic i had a knack for it that one's easy well thank you are you reading a lot well it could be helpful although i'm a bit of an amateur teacher i taught nott the one trick you saw but other things we've been working together i suppose i could try to help you oh i'm sorry do you two not know each other super well you seem like you do we've seen that window thing a couple times it's good gustav the person who runs the circus is he your friend he's family so what's your play tomorrow self destruct in 10 nine yeah we're already down there to change the way i look to leave the inn why would i do that to leave the inn why wouldn't i just walk out of the inn yeah we could but not town we were told to stay in town why shouldn't we just wait for it all to blow over we didn't do anything do you find yourself in situations like this often that's a girl everybody can tell is it like one of those old kids toys where you use the magnet to pull the little filings up herr woolly while they're doing all that i want to stroll outside and see if there's crownsguard outside or what i'm just going to get a breath of fresh air and see what's on the street outside of this place good there's only just the two at the door okay all right so i just take a minute or two i go back inside and-- on nott's shoulder and say we're good yeah i think we're good i'm going to squat down over with you privately i still think that this is a bad idea but i can tell that you want to it really is pretty nice isn't it still if this goes south we leave easily caleb and nott all right so we're doing this isn't it simpler for you to walk on yourself like a beautiful woman well we could find some public places and just gossip a bit see if anybody has heard of him if a friend has died at the circus last night grimjay so our war against the old continues how long of a snake are we talking about the wards border the lake yeah i would really love a drink and i sit down next to him what do you have i need something heavier than a trost i've had enough trosts to last me a lifetime i will take your liquor i have that i pull out eight silver oh wait silver did you say i do not have eight silver you do honestly it's been a terrible 24 hours we were at the circus last night and i did not know him well but old man brinjay fell did you know him it was a terrible way to go i'm sorry i heard he was sick too i'm sure his family will miss him very much subtle guys can i see what's on the spine of that book from where i am how's your trashy novel is it a good one no judgement oh no i'm fluent in zemnian i've read all of his works mutual fan i love the farthing's embrace it's an early one he actually did it under a pseudonym he did a whole series under that pseudonym short stories farthing's embrace you're a big reader or just samuel i read a lot but all i've been able to find in this town is that parchment place here in town burnished bibelots which ward is that in oglen that is good to know thank you those are hard to find the farthing's embrace he wasn't as proud of them early work and all that that would be the place my name is caleb this has been quite a day i sneak my undrunk whiskey to nott i do speak zemnian it means-- do i know it's been a while but osten means lake no it's not lake lake that's your work that's impressive you took it all by yourself but i saw your guns last night you probably took the lead we have been in the woods for too long i've forgotten how to talk to people you obviously have not heard the news from the traveling circus in town from last night that's correct is there anything out of the ordinary from the past week or two that comes to mind anything off about the run-of-the-mill stuff he just means out of the ordinary yeah what's up yeah we've done nothing wrong we're not sweating it i'm not sweating-- what are you talking about none of us did anything none of us we protected the people of this town it is true that's easy let's go solve a mystery nott we came up with bupkus about a minute hey kiddo do you want a piggy-back scramble up let's go talk to some people i'll wander down to where people are working where people are moving crates around okay so that's the plan is to look for people moving crap around the same way that enon is said to have so that's what we'll do all right not that great oh that didn't help 12 for me and there's no point even asking questions because we've asked them all for two hours yeah okay well that's a big zero you want to go book shopping with me okay i believe that gentleman said that the burnished bibliots was in the northward correct okay so i'll start asking questions to get us there all right well i will walk up to the door and knock on it is there any breaks in the door or the building or cracks that frumpkin could fit into are there any windows or anything or is it all a big dirty dingy mess how busy is the front of this place no one's around us though yes no [knocking] hello yes please you're open for business i take it all right frumpkin climbs back up onto nott's shoulder and nestles in i am scouting the city for books i am starved for books yes sir i'm sorry what is your name oglen hornsblower well i see you sell a great many things in here books included this is just things you've collected throughout your lifetime i don't know what you just said but i am interested in books particularly in the arcane realm but any kind of book do you have anything that you just outright know is out of the ordinary all right friend let's-- it's like winter's crest morning for me and i'm scanning the shelves yes you want to find some sort of tool that helps you do what you do best investigation check that is a 21 well off the bat i don't know where that is in d&d beyond yet but if i open up my binder i bet i have a paper version that i can verify with i speak sylvan common and celestial and i also can comprehend languages as a ritual spell but i think that takes some time ten minutes that's correct i'm so happy you have quite a shop here you have some real treasures i'm particularly interested in both of these books i don't know though i don't think that-- i mean i'm rather tight on coin at the moment so-- maybe my eyes are too big for my stomach how much would you part with these for which one is which the arcane weird one okay would you have any interest in a magic cat frumpkin disappears from on nott's shoulder reappears next to the little man i'll take that as a no that might be it i don't really know i didn't think that this would happen so quickly hold on i have to see if frumpkin is still here one hit point of damage he's still here so you don't like cats i understand that well i was trying to sample the merchandise for you because if it was just a cat it was just a cat but this one-- changes to my other shoulder-- he's a magic cat you can roll him in mud he comes back clean he disappears he reappears he brings you things gone here's what i propose i do not have ten gold at the moment but it doesn't feel like you get a lot of thoroughfare here so i'm going to come back to purchase this later that's it that's the end of my spiel that's all i've got i'm interested and thank you for giving me the time it's okay nott maybe we'll come back tomorrow piggyback within the week i promise i don't think he saw no just wait one moment okay wait for me here wait right here i cast detect magic just before i walk back into the store i look all around what are your hours here as i look to see if there is anything besides that book anything besides the book he put down middle of the night even all right business is business thank you bis später that guy does not speak zemnian let's go back to the hotel shall we we spent hours there no one knew anything about the old man i don't really understand what she's saying you were out that late are you asking for my cat to haul up our rope it's pretty limited they don't go that far what are you trying to do i can take care of that i have some magic for that that is correct yeah i will take a moment to do that and it will let me know that you know of one mile of the warded area i just need ten minutes and i pull out a little spool of silvered thread and stretch it out where did you want this over the window well i can do the entire room really i can go doorknob to-- the funny thing about this thread there's no end to it so i start looping it all the way around the room and tie it off and take out one of my books from the holster the one on the left side and i open it up you guys watch as i spend ten minutes referring to the book and tracing symbols on the floor along underneath the thread and about ten minutes of time nothing happens but that's taken care of yeah either that or i'm really bullshitting you and nothing happened forty-- 12 ten no i wouldn't have brought it up if something had happened that's an oval that's a triangle 15 disguise self and follow suit yeah can i start going (groans) oh get off you little beast to help with the illusion but roll with advantage i'm helping you you little-- oh no i take nott and slam her into a wall as hard as i can and say down you beast i have it and i punch nott right in the face i have this we're taking these people across to jail don't you fucking move you little green piece of filth this one is mine thank you beat her within an inch of her life natural 20 (cheering) the rest of you lot fall in line i drag the little one off have they cleared the way are you all right i am so very sorry i'm so sorry-- let me see your teeth okay you look all right okay who wants to go to the circus you you want to go with them i'll go with him frumpkin will go with you i'm a little jittery do you want to be a front man for a little while okay you are very good with voices yeah let's have a look around i take a rag out of my side satchel and i cast-- what the hell is it called because i've only been a wizard for a short time-- one dancing light underneath the rags so it's only dim yeah what the fuck are we looking for in here that's right yeah is there anything arcane from all my studies does anything here ring any bell i have a photographic memory all right that is a ten okay what about the perimeters of here where all the people were there was a swarm of people i spend five minutes seeing anything was dropped of interest i miss the twins big ten i have many pockets of course i have pockets he's just in the blue man group unitard and that's it so this dead thing is here in front of me i will take my dagger and i will slice a little bit off of the woman and it's going to get dark in here and i will snuff out the light and use the rag to roll it up and i'll put the little piece in my pack let's get out of here i'm going to be sick cleric shit yes this everything i have that ability it lets you know exactly where the fiend is which of those things is the fiend it could have easily been the little girl dm on a minor note i put my hand on fjord's shoulder and say i'm going to be blind for a second give me a little slap if anything goes wrong and i tune into frumpkin who should still be-- and then frumpkin takes off so i'm looking at myself after a moment oh (snarling noises) whispers there's no pencil smudges my cat is on patrol because we've been standing with our dicks in our hands for a long time no i'm not complaining but i would have sent the cat out i mean just because we're standing here so long i would have been nervous and again held on to this guy's big bicep and sent the cat out fjord something bad is happening do i know where in relation to fjord and i this is i can talk but i can't hear anything when i'm doing this the frog is on the move frog is on the move away from us but i don't know where the others are i come out of it and i-- zombies i start running towards the tent that i saw jester peek out from under
