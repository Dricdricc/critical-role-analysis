i am so nervous right now technically still awesome stuff though are they still our sponsor can we check on that the cruel what do you mean i've got one announcement tomorrow on netflix carmen sandiego the new cartoon starts mary elizabeth and i play bad guys it is a gorgeous cartoon i can't wait the whole thing's going to vomit onto netflix tomorrow check it out for some reason not as funny as just bobs we've been doing this for four years are we making any attempt to hide our persons disguise our persons six inches shorter brown hair no beard and brown robes like the simplest student jester what about a place that has writing materials paper and ink and that sort of thing are you going to come along that is exactly what we've done you've been to this place before but when you were a child maybe you've forgotten the way did you get out did your mother take you around or did you have maybe a babysitter before we go in you never went out or just rarely you mean just rarely went out what about just outside of the chateau did you go out to play well let's see what books they have inside here before i step forward i lean down to the ground snap my fingers and bring frumpkin the cat into existence telepathically say go say hello to that cat and he scuttles off russo you said rusan oh my apologies i am looking to buy a bit of paper quite a bit but whatever you might have also do you specialize in a kind of book here or is it a wide array what's your specialty what's your favorite that you have for sale history of the area of nicodranas itself i would be interested in reading anything you have of arcane nature i would be especially interested in even if it was just histories of well i will look through your fictional works and also history if you have it okay well priority one is i deal in prose and poetry quite a bit so i need a good amount of basic blank paper for my work i am working up the courage for that point i am almost ready i just have to take that first step-- i am pink i sometimes stink i need to think i want to get out of this store right now so just the paper i suppose ooh now dm question i have that ink from the library that can take basic-ass paper and have it serve the purpose of 500 gold worth of that high-quality paper okay i would like to buy that specific amount of paper i want to-- the equivalent of which would be much less i assume yeah we make that yeah while he is making those trips i will find one interesting fictional work and also any history book on nicodranas that i can find edubational please don't but i do want to have that oh what do i owe you for all the paper and these two books excellent okay so i hand that over where are we going to stay tonight do you think that would be helpful (paper sliding) well it was a little contentious when we left but i-- samesies ja nott do you want to contact the others and let them know where-- oh they're too far away jester are you going to pick any fights with anybody today did you want to stay for a while though a few days pardon me after tonight we could find another place give you a day or two with your mother we did not bring it back you two are very curious about that tower what have you heard about it for fjord and beau's benefit well that's true but i feel there's a difference ja the movement of it of course one is a building ja can i make out from the spine or the cover what book she was reading that she set down books books books 21 i don't think that is a good idea we need to dial it back a little bit we've been going at an 11 out of ten for a while we need to slow down what lazy roleplaying you know i'm going to stay here and do a little bit of reading so if you want me to watch your dog i will while i read i feel a little uncomfortable who are we talking about you no but go find out what you can about this place and get your shopping done ask about the tower subtly mm no watch the dog (poof) okay you want to do some spell research with me come on come on frumpkin you are in charge you are the guard cat don't let him push you around i start to read and write i'm not here but just out of curiosity the change in size is it slight that you just barely notice it or is it like whoa whoa so its impressiveness is in the extreme when you're right there with it okay oh my god (as jester) i will never come out again how long were roughly did all this mess last before they come back how long have i been in the room ugh okay i'm busy come back later i would have been in whatever chambers were given to us so if caduceus came in with that potion i barely nodded and just kept doing what i was doing frumpkin is bushed out the tail is bushed out it's all over and is just staring at nugget what kind of wood is it everyone besides quebec [break] what door what are you talking about no i didn't eat with you no before we go down that road may i ask what is our actual purpose that we are not telling him about why are we doing this ja so we are going to go in and case the joint to rob him blind i do too there is a war brewing in the empire it is going to spill south that is not a lie that is an inevitability so i feel that we can talk to him and trust me no one in this room is more curious about the inside of that tower than i am but to what end are we doing this like are we going to go to the hilt are we going to slay this mage and take his books or make nice conversation and steal a book it seems like-- caduceus is very soothing to listen to well i am curious and beauregard is correct that it is something we could legitimately talk about without spilling the beans about everything that everyone has got going on with themselves and i am of course curious i just want to make sure you know i've talked about calculated risks before and i don't want to run willy-nilly towards folly like we have done with the boat we are all standing here but that was foolish we just don't need to be too pushy yeah well potentially he could turn us over to people that we are not interested in turned over to but i'm not saying no let's just be careful that's all i don't think so like the early colonies here we had a walk-and-talk just now can we tell from where we are if he's human or elven or-- 21 did he just hear that entire conversation what for what oh god i need to stress eat get it open caleb puts away the romance novel that he has sped read halfway through it's the goblin at the door not this mage can we all see him from where we are total poker face caleb takes the rear i'm caleb widogast hmm hmm via circles of arc-- transportation you mean to jump from one city to another that sort of thing not as of yet here in your home you have some knowledge of where that leads you know him personally caleb extends his hand out slowly thank you once you have earned our trust this one has sentimental value it is not to be left here we have a better understanding of this one i take him at his word that he could kill us all if he wanted to if he wanted to take it against our will he would i am comfortable with you examining it but we don't wish to leave it here we wish to bring it with us when we leave very bad people want this thing i'll promptly follow ja one way oh dm question i don't know what level off the top of my head teleportation-- so how much time right no oh sorry yes i do have it but it would take me a lot of hours i mean he would look at it for a minute and have the rune in his head mostly on my own to be honest for years it was not my intention to bother you here my friends were very curious it was fairly obvious to me that this building was real estate owned by someone of great skill i actually thought it was a very bad idea to come here sometimes follow my friends places i shouldn't well my apologies on my group's presumptuousness i hope that we have not made a grave error here today and if we haven't i hope to earn that trust as you say that's good advice (sighs) i'm sure you have much to do today feel for the wall that eventually spills out down here cinnamon-a-mon-a-mon come on we are quitting while we're ahead let's go oh streusel we talked about you guys actually i didn't say anything i listened no i say you are foolish we are lucky that we are not dead we're very lucky the way it worked out you can't bullshit everyone in this world we got luck-- how did it go what kind of conversation did you have before we got in there what did you guys talk about but let's stay in one place for a few days first right before moving on that way we could stay a few days when we get there don't want to run off your mother misses you she wants to see you she wants to spend time with you one more day or you'll regret it just for future plans and operations a mage of that skill level will know if a familiar is-- if someone is staring at him he invited two in not three here's my cat (poof) out here that was not a good idea i'm sorry i didn't mean to hurt your feelings yeah it took four days to get here we've done it before we would have known this was going to happen not the amount of security but that there was security super specific so far ikithon i didn't meet him i walk over while she's training the dog he's getting very good at that you're doing a good job i really don't like dogs i'm sorry i finished this book i thought you might like it it's about romance at sea with a sailor did i get a name for it if i did liam does not remember it i was going to say the salty sea nuts but i was like i'm not going to say that out loud (laughter) that's it enjoy i got one too on a different night-- i assume we're camping every night ja just for setting may i borrow you for a word mm-hmm i was very brusque back in nicodranas with you (sighs) i'm sorry i felt very exposed with that man um-- i was just collecting my thoughts with a man like yussa if he wanted to find us-- maybe not me but the rest of you-- he will and i do not know his allegiances or his motives or anything neither did you none of us did there are people who would flay me like a cat if they could get their hands on me so-- no but he was hard to read (sighs) i don't know beauregard but i don't like to not know i like traveling with you people and i don't want to take unnecessary risks so i'm not telling you what to do-- i could not tell you what to do-- but if-- for me to stay with you all i can't keep poking my head up like a mole from a hole in the ground because someone is going to cave my skull in if i do it in the wrong place and if you all are with me you will die with me that man in rexxentrum he would spread my guts out onto the stone floor if he could get his hands on me now if he knew where i was so i factor that into all of my thinking everywhere we go everywhere i have been for five years i have been looking over my shoulder so it's not really fair to all of you because we are linked like this now he is arguably the most powerful man in the empire ikithon i just wanted you to understand me better as much as i am able to have friends i like you all right i don't people very well i am well aware it's been a long time since i had a lot of practice but i have to be careful and if we can't be careful enough i have to go that is beside the point yes it is very much beside the point because if i care for any of you at all and that man in the northern end of this empire knows where any one of you are he knows he can get to me if he finds us you all will just be thrown into the fire with me we're talking around each other that is not the point that i am arguing i am saying that if we are going to stay together we have to be careful careful just persons like that one in that tower you know in the abstract i am but the problem with friends is that you have to care about them and i wander away well i'm going to go stand in front of a tree for 20 seconds and do this (laughter) you passed we have grown since the last time we rolled through this town he's 7'5 she's 5'1 not a whole thing but i've gone through most of the paper purchased and read the history of nicodranas (goofy voice) the general knowledge of the history of nicodranas (goofy voice) their main export is oysters carry on i knew i should have gone with entertainment as the subject you get a piece of the pie do i recognize that person from my time at school sorry i didn't hear you there (gagging) i recognize them one more time please these are names i got on a list over a year ago that i'm remembering now i'm going to go fucking dig through my emails jesus we're fine we're just going into nott's backstory i don't need to review nothing if that is the case and we're in the wagon at this point caleb just fucking lies down in the cart yeah lies down in the cart where are the nearest guards at this moment they walked off i'm going to hop out of the cart go over to nott and trip fall face flat into the dirt wipe dirt on my face and into my beard stand up and pull my hood up yes i'm going to start searching through the rubble i'll helm it holy shit let's roll this die ooh two 14s that is a 23 i'm casting mage armor or blood or injury that's the mighty nein special she's will graham-ing it let's get out of here let's take it to-- have you ever seen this before may i how does your friend fit into all of this caleb absolutely pukes in the middle of the room the haversack is limited right that fjord is in possession of who has it i will gladly carry it is there anything in my time of torture and awful that would tell me what this chair is no i don't mean a magic chair i mean the setup in the room the mess around it (shouting) hey caleb liam marisha and
