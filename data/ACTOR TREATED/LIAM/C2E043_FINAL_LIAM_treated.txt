025345965 the three of us right we have our heads in the same game we are the three assholes in this 025345965 --> 025347531 group yeah 025347531 --> 025351869 that is correct 025355025 --> 025357782 i'm joking because this has been such a hard day but fjord is going to find this very difficult 025404541 --> 025407391 that is minimalizing what he is dealing with right now he is trying to find a father he has 025420755 --> 025426903 compromised himself with this woman for us for himself for all of our safety it is going to be 025426903 --> 025428181 difficult for him 025428181 --> 025435080 you have your pluses and your minuses 025437993 --> 025448302 it's mostly true 025458927 --> 025500628 she is too educated she is too in-the-know to talk the way she does to be interested in just

inch of her notes i have communicated them to you 025719490 --> 025725357 i would imagine the plank king would not know what to make of it it clearly damns her it 025738515 --> 025742562 does not give him enough information-- he wouldn't know what to do with it 025742562 --> 025744409 yeah he's not a big thinker he is formidable but not a big thinker i think we will 025750974 --> 025753851 have an

feet but i assume he goes beyond that because it's the 031710864 --> 031718525 ocean so he keeps going down and down and down i will tell him to look for this wreck for what we 031718525 --> 031721874 are looking for and when he finds it to come back and tell me about it 031721874 --> 031724324 13 031729244 --> 031737927 17 031742687 --> 031751523 if he's within 1000 we have a connection 031759606
