i guess the rest of us can't understand the pressure of coming up with a d&d beyond bit every week it's covered in gold no one's going to retain any of the things you just said in the wake of that we're also two weeks in and in a year there will be a library of content that will last forever or until civilization falls roll them if you got them do you have squibs of fake shit ready for this ja what is there to see no i have never seen the ocean what do you-- what does that mean that he would hire people to kill you or he would personally kill you but is wealthy and connected you locked him out what about besides your mother's place of employment do you know are there other things to see okay you want to go straight there right on the coast you saw that well sometimes-- okay point stands is there easy access to the water here caleb has just been staring for a while and is standing next to nott he takes off every stitch of clothing and everything except for one thing and hands it to nott and walks in yes i'm just going to walk out into it he would keep going and eventually start floating on my back i have a question right now where is the lavorregard menagerie where is the owl the weasel-- owl too owl's with you i need constant updates to where these animals are that's the weasel if she has ten gold pieces worth of incense she can bring it back to-- nope mr owl how many handling checks does it take-- scheisse (coughing) you can't just sneak up on a person (groaning) oh it's very quite nice i tuck down four feet well no i am just submerging my bits no it's expansive it just keeps going forever why did you leave it so it feels good to be back ja so maybe you stay this time 15 feet out i take a moment and scan the beach and call out nott the brave live up to your name and jump in the ocean who cares go swimming i don't know she doesn't like to swim i don't think but you'd imagine seeing something like this would give perspective is this one of those sea monsters they were talking about you have not seen the ocean-- it's pretty nice isn't it should we stay here for the night what about tomorrow do you want to go tomorrow does she know you're coming what are you doing who are you talking to get the map where's the map seems like it could be potentially hilarious the closest thing i've experienced to this is inside jester's backpack in the dodecahedron there was a lot of baked goods in there yeah now it's just-- no it's a good day that is how long again no idea how far is port damali from here roughly we were the only two people in that cell (coughing) that is correct ja that's on you buddy but under normal circumstances because you look this way but would everyone know you here before entering i would look for an alleyway in the last few minutes before getting here to make all of my clothes look-- i cast disguise self on myself and don't change my appearance other than to make my clothes look brand new and slightly more expensive than they are by all means don't insult my dignity just give me the muumuu yeah it's like a lap dog sprinkle and nugget and professor thaddeus excellent what's the name i'm a heathen what is dupioni silk okay i was just curious is it like the velour juicy sweatpants that i saw when i first moved here legitimately just curious that's dupioni silk i knew that dupioni bob dupioni is blue the predominant color here i buy the group a round are we in the front or the middle or the back okay how big an audience space is it roughly how many people are crammed in here at a guess okay i covered that whatever is expected here caleb covers but caleb does not not know that and does not tip he has no experience with any of it now coming to the stage whip it out how's it look so i got to look at it would she sing with you when you're alone did you sing with her when you first told us about your mother the night isn't over yet i would assume so yeah is there a time of the day or the week that you would have mother-daughter time it's mar-quiz you have a beautiful singing voice thank you very much for the performance you have a very charming daughter i am afraid so ja fish out of water yeah what was that last name again the clovis concord you are unable to speak to the law here just speaking hypothetically it would not upset you any if he were to disappear not be around well we will try our best to reach the optimum result dyomin what are these interests you are referring to her interests you said to our friend mr clay here well it is good that we have the world's two best detectives with us that should be an easy task to fulfill bob loblaw are we saying if or are we saying is your mother might know for sure i'd like to think the party is legitimately this excited that is the cartoon character daria that message probably interrupted a threesome i want to hear some 1988 phone voicemail message thrown on top of that in the ocean i'm 50 50 years old i kick-- definitely not definitely nott oh i was going to ask if she could recommend any bookstores but i was mistaken about what the topic was can you recommend any bookstores here in the city caleb for all of this for the last hour has been trying to figure out if she seems okay so in this moment does she seem okay but you know what i mean even prior to finding out that news i mean seeing her mother i'm saying for the entire evening here even before that yeah but i'm not asking i'm just wondering ask him what you're also not constantly perspiring or anything nott are you going to go swimming with her it's a question mark right now but there will be another chapter to that story why don't you give him a few days to ruminate on what you have just said and see if anything returns or maybe we will return it's your decision at the very least i think you should sleep on it i bet you'll go right to sleep ja it's good that you got to see your mother though you seem very happy to see her are they all kings you should probably be speaking to the people on the docks yeah in zemnian it's pronounced key you said quay hype man russian accent vague you cannot mix those two impressions together it's too dangerous (sean connery voice) i suddennly remembered my charlemagne (normal voice) doesn't work les paul maybe it's built into the architecture of the rooms within only one way to find out yeah and human hallo he's juggling a lot of plates please last week i was like how does this shit work what do i do here how long have you been presiding over it that is respectable oh man you just triple lutzed over purvan and flew beyond so it's past the boob it's a lot of steps i can see why you're in such good shape grandmother but it seemed like you were about to discuss-- you've seen his pattern in the city where he goes day to day the sluice weave perhaps you are talking about you said sluice weave oh they said it eh shit happens forget it banished from the game she is invaluable to us she is a capable woman we need her you're hardly ugly on the outside i think you could snap me like a twig that was a long walk though this is an awkward goodbye i was also going to say as they went down that caleb is going to make a big to-do and start saying you know we didn't have a chance to talk about when we're above i am in the market for some books and i was wondering if you knew of any bookstores did you call dibs on the dodeca but you know a full-on library or perhaps you know a smutty bookshop even because you never know what you're going to find in there or even a used a vintage book-- oh you're not even-- (shouting) are there any bookstores in the vicinity of this lighthouse yes but-- i don't think she liked most of us but she's pretty cool yussa renis we got a wizard's tower this is the world's largest mimic goosh yeah 1d6 per ten feet did you reach up as hard as you could right before you landed to split that speed is that how monks work why were you trying to get into this tower well okay i've seen all kinds of places many times that i didn't try to get into immediately what were you trying to accomplish sure so you saw it as a challenge you saw it as a mountain to climb that's interesting how does it pertain to what we are trying to do today travis and but we don't have to go we could keep working on this tower it is very interesting but i thought we were helping our friend here right that's an easy thing to go to so go to it that's our solution for everything sam yeah i will aid oh boy we were at a lighthouse that is even taller than this you we could go try to climb that if you'd like fjord 100% it is very interesting and i have checked the box in the back of my brain i do want to understand what that place is-- hmm i'm curious but let's shelve it i know that you're embarrassed for wasting your time here but you will get over it that's what i really want you know how little puppies they crash into things when they're they're walking every time he poofs out i just want-- i like turtles so exotic all the strudel and schnitzel are so far away now and we are in this exotic place yeah
