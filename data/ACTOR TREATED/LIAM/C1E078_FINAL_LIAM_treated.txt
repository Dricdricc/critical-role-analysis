you should totally play that during the thordak fight 12 hours of wings matt thank you you have chosen poorly no wonder you're in voiceover he's a good human being he said he said mark said he's got to die he's got to die matt he's got to die it was so good it was so good i did i liked it well that's part of it but the whole thing was pretty good you are on a show called critical role where a group of nerdy-ass voice actors-- oh i just got the christmas spirit all up in my heart nice sam will listen to it in five months this is a fine-ass baseball cap on the inside it says how do you want to do this oh and your head is so small and my head is so large how long is the trip did we say to get to emon from here then we're meeting with dad i think that's our way yeah i feel like we want to catch up with our father's army before they're anywhere near the walls of the city because well that'd be stupid we could find a jeweller right now if that's what you're into kynan kynan emon to emon that's a metaphor for vox machina dad creates a shit-storm at the wall and we take advantage of that chaos how long did we say before syldor reaches emon dusk the following day and you said afternoon right now so a little more than 24 hours they can hate us and we can deal with that afterward if there is even an afterward also somewhere in all this fracas we need you to take care of us with food right when is the time in the keep for old time's sake i mean underneath there's no guarantees scanlan we're going to hell where do you think we're going it's going to be fucking awful you're probably going to be dead in 48 hours you're adorable it was chaos when we left we fought vorugal and then high-tailed it out of there inside and gone still standing there wasn't anybody around it that's as close to a guarantee as we're going to get you are that guy is a badass motherfucker and we do want him well he's got those brown eyes it's called gallows humor i'll go find shaun after her scanlan do
