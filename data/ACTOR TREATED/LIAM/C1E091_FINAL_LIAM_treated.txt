watching his kids i don't know where he is it's a hard truth that only one of us is irreplaceable and marvel taliesin pulls out a curly blonde wig and-- next up also taliesin and i are going to fistfight until one of us is dead or unconscious got a lot of pent-up aggression tal rothfuss jacked that cloak rehearsal paid off (laughter) like right now that would be the best end to that ceremony peace you read lips what're they talking about i don't believe you why would they be talking about me you are full of shit yeah yeah i'm-- i'm so glad i confide in you i have you to lean on you are the rock in my life what would i do without you while she's talking i start to walk away quietly as possible well figuratively or literally go to hell i imagine yeah i mean what're we going to-- squad leader (laughter) no but we don't know exactly where we're going to land right man this is going to go great i mean when we went to the city of brass we did not shift into the city of brass we dumped quite a ways away yeah so we have no control over that so-- yeah so whatever plan we come up with one branch of the future is complete bullshit improvisation for if we fall into the shit so there's no planning for that so if we don't fall into the shit and we land somewhere relatively safe what're we going to do how're we going to play this this is hell shocking there's no point for sextuplets we can't do that that's not going to work what's a president he's really heavy we talked all night and we squared it away and we're going to hell so we're talking negotiation or bullshitting our way one or the other-- caste systems yes i agree no percy help me understand since you've read so much about this good on you so if the raven queen escorts souls-- if you're an absolute terrible shit of a person and the raven queen escorts you over to the other side we're going to be wandering amongst the souls of the damned people who die go to where we're going thank you i know they get escorted to the other side it just seems like an odd idea to be walking in a city full of the thrown-away i'm talking to the air right now it was the best thing you never heard (laughter) i miss scanlan shorthalt so badly no he's just my buddy phone a friend what do we do i mean hotis-- how long has it been dm since pike wasted his sorry ass a couple months i mean i don't think one more day is going to kill us if we want to go get her you know (laughter) i mean if the fates allow oh i was just trying to guilt matt into playing pike but-- it's not the thordak battle there's not 87 miniatures on the board all right well we're all going to die not prepared but we never are also didn't someone tell us that if they get trashed they are treated like shit there we've trashed his ass twice (sighs) i mean we thought it was getting us around but it clearly wasn't if you just think for a second we are so close to being able to semi-retire and take it easy we cannot cock this up we're going to hell we've no plan what if we went and were completely honest and were ourselves and explained that we were here to remove the shittiest devil in the city i am being serious we tried that we've tried that i mean maybe it'll work we just run willy-nilly that's what we do yeah i mean you could-- i mean i just feel like our-- certainly without scanman-- our chances of fooling anybody are lower than they've ever been so maybe having you as a tiefling escort gives a little credibility to the dummies there there's lots of people who're not dummies though and i feel like we should just quietly negotiate our way through because i don't think we can bullshit not without scanlan six regular three medium one superstar if you need gold i've got loads i do i'll take any-- i forget the sizes is it venti or grande ooh thank you tary how tough is that armor yeah but is it ceremonial or is it like shit-kicker that's a good idea that's like strapping a turkey baster to a tank that's what that is fred freddie do we know what languages are likely to be spoken there does that say in your books it's his name isn't it do you speak infernal well it is-- -- your name is it not you have 37 of them am i allowed to use any of ones between the first and the last you know we're years into being friends what do you prefer d-roll-- oh jeez i was just about to agree on it but-- i don't know d-roll's pretty good man d-roll's great i'm suddenly extremely jealous of grog for coming up with that name oh man yeah that's going to haunt you my friend y'all wanna stop and get a wing what about zahra and we're taking doty with us is that the plan i'm sure there's lots of robits in hell is he a protocol droid somewhere an aerator's going (raspberry) that's the other guys you get a whole other language are the spells in the brain though or in the body you've been gone a while maybe ask dear old dad let's find that six-year-old well we can't sit here and wait for him to come back we've just gotta fucking do it right but if we do this we're done we can take it easy to do what what is left the dragons are dead all that's left is hotis what is left yeah well i'm not going to run right back to the temple are you thank you what do you want to do after this grog say we get back from hell what's the next step for you i mean we're going to party that's a given but like are you done with the herd yeah you remember that time a sword killed you (laughter) you do yeah doesn't always work out sometimes it gets cocked up yeah not yet has it been built 'twill be this is the sweetest before-we-all-die yeah bust that out whoa whoa back it up bust it out d-roll well tell us the juicy bits of it he's making this up as he goes i am starting to regret that i asked what's the punchline you're so fucking transparent sometimes everything under the sun welcome to your yurt so drunk why does it smell like mayo it is mayo take that that is vile (laughter) i've tagged along by the way it's like klingon excuse me i'm sorry i'm lady keyleth's friend and-- aren't i though all right we-- you grew up here so i don't know if this means anything to you but we are searching for a rakshasa do you know what that is no no it's all right sorry yeah we're-- we're kind of grasping at straws so i hope we didn't offend (whispers) no ermahgerd he's god ermahgerd what's that mr disco who do you hate (laughter) you're welcome (laughter) speaking of which do you know-- what's the word for peace is there a word for peace do you know all right shit this was not very fruitful is it more or less forceful okay it's an inflection thing i feel like we've hassled this woman enough well that's a bit of a complicated phrase for someone who barely knows how to say 'hi' and 'bye' woman who's not here yeah we can be annoying sometimes we understand kuthrek i don't know if i said that right i just said tangerine in-- mordor inside baseball is cusack i'm not she wasn't very good on phrasing it was just words if a horrible devil is bearing down on you to kill you you just say 'ermahgerd ermahgerd ermahgerd ermahgerd ermahgerd ermahgerd' (laughter) get it out of your system now because when we get over there you should probably keep your voice down and if that means not talking that's what it's got to be all right seven yeah everybody's a kraken there more or less is that on the table the multi-verse is large and wide not in character who dis might have said it last game but i don't remember it this game no but then you have to follow through-- too bad so sad i'll do the same that's better than me 24 pat your hair pat your hair pat your hair pat your hair and remind us it's dim or it's not super bright here is it dark oh in the field of bone shards it's like a walking shit sack yeah yeah dis is two what level dis just walk with purpose aww poor baby curdled dairy at all times no i'm talking it out you can do that to how many more of us i feel like a handful of tieflings and grog is better than us as we are yeah we're in a back alley we gotta walk through this town so i can do this on my own then fuck it all white do you think everybody here dresses like the raven queen's butler i mean-- smartypants you can say you're sorry you're not you should be you're wrong though 10% what you say 90% how you say it i act like percy this should be easy so it's that way some people go both ways let's take a stroll and see a lay of the land why is our life so much like vaudeville that's true let's just own this take a walk percival strut and are there stores are there businesses are these all non-descript buildings or does it all just look like the same shit or is it-- so it's like a hellish financial district there's just nothing there purge hell yeah same we are in hell if it's going to come out anywhere-- if you lift up taliesin's mohawk you can see the little tiny little points little horns i want to go to bed oh for fuck's sake that is fucking disgusting we're walking and nothing's changing do we want to stay put for a while and see what happens hotis where the fuck are you did that devil who just left leave the door wide open or did it shut it i've done that actually that's true what if we walked for a while and looked back let's give it ten minutes and then we'll figure something out 27 that's better better well i don't like anybody going up this is stupid what if i think about being in front of the tower yeah that's it does it always feel like it's dead ahead of us all the time that was an ambassador i'm going to trail my sister by like ten feet and watch her back same ten feet behind you yep pretty much everything fucking looks the same nondescript bullshit hey man what about-- i want to get off the street i'm tired of walking we've been walking all-- we've been walking all day are you whispering that to me stove stove stove stove ahh those humans are both gone out of sight do we talk to this guy because i'm about to we're fucking dicking around here we can't pretend shit here let's just go talk to them perfectly healthy perfectly normal it's like fox and the hound how far is this tavern from us me specifically thank you for the heads-up i'm going to go in what a setup (laughter) out of curiosity these spined devils look like the thing we fought under krieg's house was that krieg's house it was wasn't it with the succubus is there a bar here is there the hellish equivalent of a bar here yeah it's airport prices she said with confidence give it to keyleth she'll try anything (laughter) you okay over there i'm quietly thinking about scanlan watching this happen are you okay welcome to hollywood let's get to the rooms shall we no it's just a bed in new york city in july yeah yeah is there any kind of bugs or any-- bugs 18 it's hard to tell sometimes just go with it don't make any sudden movements and let her get it out of her system what's the d&d equivalent of a glowstick i start giving keyleth-- ooh never mind i was going to give her a scalp massage but ugh i mean you were really up though when you were you know full there pours a soul in oh it's very in-character hey yeah tarytown can you have dotes lean on the door seems like a catholic school game (laughter) no you're going to be bottoming out just need another soul man here-- i'm sure it was somebody who murdered children you know it was probably a major arsehole son of a-- that's the plan that's the intention all topped off at the moment so whatever you do we'll make up i touch grog's shoulder and i give him four hit points ticklish boom ho-dis good times in a faberge egg yeah police academy that's the thing the do gotta find out-- i assume she's-- you've filled us all in on what you saw we have to find the prison-- and then get in get arrested get-- james spader right grog it's two different sets of problems here he's a wee wee bab in a chocolate egg but getting to him is difficult if we wait then he gets the jump on us when we're sleeping in our beds not in a chocolate egg then he looks like a guy in a mascot suit at a winter's crest fair so it's now or later it's just a different set of problems and now we know what we're doing at least i mean we know fucking nobody in this city and they all look like garbage so why don't we just start with the garbage downstairs extra hit points no fear lustrous hair shiny fingernails feel like you ate a soul well let's not get ahead of ourselves because it's in the spellbook and all this while vax has been staring at taryon and imagining him with exactly half a beard (laughter) what else is there to say about taryon darrington yeah we went to bed got up and then-- what was that it's like noon in our internal clock probably we need to talk to somebody just talk to somebody we can walk around for another two hours and wait until somebody gets the heebie-jeebies from us and fucks us up or we can talk to somebody i'm going to talk to somebody (laughter) i've already left the room yeah i do a quick u-turn you're god you can do anything yeah but i mean i haven't stepped in lava in a while doesn't mean that's something i should right now i feel like with scanlan gone our best talker is this one yeah but you know i feel like in so many situations we go what happens if i push this button let's just see what happens but that's not what i'm saying i'm actually arguing the opposite of that i'm saying for once maybe i mean you're a very good talker why don't we send the person who's good at talking down instead of on a lark sending down you know the brute to talk maybe you haven't been lucky maybe you need to give it another shot i mean your average is a little bit better than the big man's both of you you're both-- he can only do one person he's only got enough for one one person you go you go i just did percival you're going it's hell this is your game now sure as back-up yes he just-- (mimics snorting cocaine) steady as she goes percival i place my hands on grog's shoulder and percival's shoulder and cast bless as they walk out the door you dive in front of me to do that it's merlot two points for gryffindor your pancreas melts so we switch back to little elf boy little elf girl antlers greg what did you find out who do we kill the person you just spoke to someone else okay but you know it all right it's just evil versus evil here mm you're not going to throw a rock and hit an innocent person in this city right-- right berenstain bear is that i mean that kind of is your name is that all right d-roll's good also i'm not trying to prevent us from following this plan but we were warned not to make any deals with any creature-- so the first thing we do is-- i have a thing might be helpful while we're here it's a little vial of oil of etherealness the oil can cover someone of my size maybe scanlan's size and it lets you-- lets you walk through the ethereal plane for an hour so you can sort of bypass where you are little bit yeah yeah i mean you're walking on a whole parallel-- the way it was explained to me on this piece of paper is that you are parallel to where you are can't pick anything up i don't think can't-- yeah well it's the effect of the etherealness spell for one hour i was trying to sprinkle fairy dust on it but let's just go to the rules shall we this is like nazgűl ky yeah but it's a-- this is a slow-moving one-way ticket it's an hour so i could use it-- right or if we get trapped one of us could lather up and get out i mean i don't know what-- we don't really know what we're dealing with yet but it's just good to know that we have it in our back pocket then change into something bigger and squish the egg i mean it's not a bad idea lot of variables but it's a pretty good idea so you're saying you don't bring your 300 dragon hit points down into the fly body you switch to-- you switch to fly hit points whomp-whomp to doing the hit and then going to prison right no i'm not arguing wait a second wait a second when you peeked into hotis-- when she peeked-- i'm asking keyleth but you might need to come in here with detail when you peeked in at hotis what-- like how much security was around him what was around him didn't see just saw a cadbury egg dispater yeah yeah that's what we're doing so kill the thing get arrested possible bug keyleth possible ethereal keyleth as ways to get in and out possibly yeah i mean once we kill this thing which we will we're diving into the unknown not hotis the contract to get to hotis that's the owner's-- all right so he gets what he wants and then we see if we get what we want yeah i mean we had a fucking nanny who used to tell us nightmare stories about this it's way worse than she described it all of us get arrested yeah mm-hm well walk us through it again walk me through it again one more time but you two kerry are very loud is what you're saying i mean reality is two of us are stealthy everybody else is mediocre or worse okay wow probably listening to us see part of our problem is sometimes-- always we grab the first opportunity in front of our fucking faces so-- let's explore this opportunity 27 ho-dis i'll go with her i'm not what what am i not i know but she's a big fucking bird i mean-- all right do your thing hell is tearing this team apart and you said this is like the biggest city we've ever seen oh gosh be careful those are devils and we saw one under krieg's house ermahgerd do you need us out there it's not really lying
