are good-looking (laughter) well my mom and dad said i'm a real good speaker they paid for a tutor to teach me how to talk and it's worked out really well for me in my life so if you need an ambassador or a butler who talks i could do that for you well here's the thing you need to know about uriel and i take a step back no away well does he hold me if i turn well i just said that right here's the thing about uriel oh you don't want to know okay i'll just save that for later roll for what matt oh i'm going to use my last luck of the day last luck of the day okay this is persuasion that's 17 you could give me a-- never mind huh no yeah no that's why i said never mind can i roll for initiative yes my initiative can only be described as fecal wasn't a one six it was six it comes close should i check my iphone too 19 that hits he's holding me right okay as a bonus action i'm going to use rogue's cunning action to disengage which means nobody can swipe at me if i run okay there's a window last week you said there was a window to the courtyard okay i'm running straight at the window and as i run-- yeah past them and i don't go anywhere near her and i'm using dash and i'm leaping out the window and saying jenga that is a 32 do i even stop running i don't know am i able to talk further that's a 13 (muffled) fucking bitch my name is vax i failed it nine the universe is random and doesn't care about you and me i'm unconscious i haven't been knocked out in ages right so it's only if it exceeds my hit point maximum that i'm killed outright so i'm unconscious hey guys i'm unconscious wait as that happens and as my consciousness fades away i don't say anything but here's what i think in a split-second i think of my friends that i have spent so much time with i think of keyleth beautiful walking under the trees i think of my twin sister as a young girl folding up linens with our mother i think of my sister as an adolescent in lessons smarter than me i think of the woman she grew into hiking over many many many miles together my best friend my best friend vex'ahlia and before i can think no more i say a prayer to sarenrae to watch over my friends and keep them safe eight you can sit right here he eats at the table with us all the time she taught him to sit in a chair what's going on around here do i make a death saving throw 17 i succeeded wait i'm at one haggling she loves me does seeker asum get a save now that he's been hit to shake that charm carry the three i feel like i'm going insane they're looking at me she doesn't feel even a little bit horny as he reloaded weakly behind him i go hi percy and i have a question at some point i'm in the mix to do what to grapple check do i have to roll too so i roll as well yeah fuck that guy for hitting yeah because it's a hit point sponge you have to tell me what's possible i'm prone right this is what i'd like to do you tell me if it's possible i'd like to click my boots of haste together and then get up which takes my full movement what does it take half my movement this is what i want to do you tell me if it's possible click my boots of haste get up use disengage again and then run like a motherfuck straight towards-- that's what i want to do my sister and as i run past i share a very awkward glance with keyleth and keep going and just run and lock eyes with my sister and run at her but that's a lucky number are they superman and wonder woman what the heck please make it funny okay i'm going to throw one dagger at briarwood's face that's a one if i'm hasted can i do two potions instead of attack attack attack all right so i'm taking a potion of greater healing and walking backward walking distance and greater healing is 4d4 right what was it before that he's ragged
