fellow having a bad day yeah the cleric was nice he planted one on keyleth you want to explain it druid it's a funny story it's really funny well there was this acid pit right and we all got on top of the carpet like we do and there were these giant magical sigils that borked the carpet which was fine it was fine because the thing started to go down-- i grabbed the carpet and i jumped and put my own body up to my fucking head into the acid burned yeah you see this you see this little bit of gray i held the carpet up and then it's funny we both sank together and then the carpet went in the acid but it was still okay it wasn't completely destroyed just a little bit but only completely tiberius-- it's very comfortable to step upon but it doesn't fly we're still alive in our defense-- is there a tavern anywhere nearby let's go to kraghammer like holy shit a blessing from sarenrae or an employee discount ask merkin he can tell you look at these badass tattoos yeah look at that welcome to the critical role comedy hour folks make sure you hit the two-drink minimum before you leave keyleth will fly you back lickety-split just like that yeah oh vex broke the carpet i tried to save it six so what are we doing we're going to go shopping for potions and then we're going to go see kiki's family yeah you can't see it but if you rub your hand on his chin you can feel it a little bit make a wish wish on the carpet-- oh are you shopping for a little buddy you know how to use a blade tiberius i'm walking over just to watch you got a taste for the knocking-about fighting that thing didn't you i bought them for you that's more interesting than the bolts tell her to get in line what else do you need it's all on me if you hadn't stopped that shithead from leaving i wouldn't have put a dagger in the back of his head and we would've been looking over our shoulders for who knows how long so everything's on me whatever you want tell me not a carpet i can't afford it welcome to agrabah you drive a hard bargain one time one big time money well spent you've got no idea i fall in step next to vex and look at her for a second what's burning your arse we still have a keep she started before we got here just keep it coming thank you i lift up the cup and keep putting it in and say a round of the strongest on me i've got that as well you know he needed a little-- it was really rough going from what i hear anyway and he needed a little therapy we were also talking about visiting keyleth's family can you get away long enough to-- tell us again sorry explain it again whoa hey stubby wake up it's nappies time nappy time just give her an hour she'll be fine side note i'm two inches taller and i've always called you stubby come here stubby here's what i think lady

there any moonlight tibs i pull off and hand him my cloak of elvenkind which is one of the reasons i'm so hard to see maybe we could just use that as a shroud for it just for tonight i'll pass it to tibs 900 at night you said i think it's time to bed down i mean we're not in los angeles are you haggling with the fabric of time and space i pass the fuck out and you're on watch right before i passed out i handed him my cloak all wadded up in a ball around it and handed it to him that's tight right there yes thank you for introducing that to liam's vocabulary (gasps) i'll take the first watch next time everything's good no use crying over spilt milk let's keep going yoink thank you (whoosh) the lowest you can get is ten or 11 really is it safe to just approach this is maybe awkward but you and we share something in common our past is awkward i get the sense that yours is not as much your people are they a mix of many kinds but predominantly a melding of humans and elves friendly fire we just hit 7000 subs when orion set himself on fire yes so you're a silver-colored dragonborn now judging books by their cover yes i ride my horse around in a circle just to face everybody and say everyone maybe go a bit back go behind keyleth vex'ahlia and i will trail just behind as your retinue we need her clear tiberius 15 two paths percy let's choose the one less travelled then what do you see percival are there trees to tie them up yeah the one that keyleth's people or cousins or whatever they are have been taking i think we need light so we don't go over the edge how did trinket do mighty two oh right no 15 sorry 15 for stealth right (coughs loudly) can i clarify something am i giving scanlan a shoulder-ride right now or is he knocking boots back in vasselheim yes i call it a tiefling trio one take that game take that everybody stop keyleth we just wait or keyleth talks wait i kneel down toward keyleth we're doing it i look to my sister and grab her by the shoulder and

reality is malleable here oh yeah that's good yeah i'll take it natural 20 it could be your pubes don't jump to conclusions okay so cerkonos is still busy with keyleth so i'm going to take a split second to inhale exhale and then (dagger noises) right from where i am so 18 14 natural 20 for the third do i get to pick which one is the-- okay so the first one hit which is sneak attack so that is four plus seven is 11 plus-- 14 17 23 25-- 31 for the first hit second one which was a hit is-- which part gets doubled the dice roll four plus six is ten that's it yeah that's it i'll back up against
