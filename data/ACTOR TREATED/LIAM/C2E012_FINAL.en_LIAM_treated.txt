raving about it it's only been out for five seconds and everyone's gaga that made me uncomfortable so fast are you pre-rolling your goddamn dice now they might have some sort of edict written by prucine we will decide who goes in i also want to discuss what exactly we are going to forge before we go in because the plan that they laid out for us was not good scheisse is a word for it but they talked about making it look like sutan had broken into prucine's home and rolled it i don't know what effect that would have on her so i think maybe we hatch some sort of conspiracy between the two of them to assassinate orentha so we will go to sutan's house and we will leave-- follow me please for a moment we have to do our homework first but after we do homework we go to sutan's we find this seal we hold onto it we leave fake communication that you will write that is from the high-richter calling for a hit you have stolen mail you can do it again did not care about your buttons the goal to be that we leave something in sutan's house that would make it seem that the high-richter has ordered a hit on orentha and we leave something behind in sutan's house fake communications with the myriad so we tie sutan to the myriad we tie sutan to richter and then at richter's house we leave forged documents we have a letter from sutan with the seal and also we leave communication with the knights whatsit-- also they will put out of businesses if possible they have some sort of paperwork that would come from the desk of the high-richter that's another thing-- and we can table this-- but there is also the possibility that this is all just a honey trap and that we’re being drawn in for as big a fish than the knights are themselves well i think that they think they are looking for potentially big fish i'm not saying that we are big fish but we might be walking into a trap so eyes on a swivel is all i’m saying potentially or any of them ulog seems the shiftiest but that doesn't mean that he would necessarily be-- you two have been speaking to them the longest you are a good talker fjord no that's not it a peacock is a fancy pet what happens if a pigeon goes by (laughter) (spell noises) (drawl) you're just a little feller you oughtn’t talk like that yeah but actually do you think you could go back and say that you forgot to ask a question i understand that these two are really busting your balls and i commiserate with that but we do need in fact to ask okay well we checked that box off so now we have to get to work knotts berry farm i will go to sutan's no the elder i'm sorry not without you you'll come with me well how do you want to do it okay (shiftily) you need some some ball bearings man you die (coo) haversack (coo) crossfit t-shirt i don't think we want the group to be too big let these two handle this ren and you and i will wait at the leaky tap and lay low we don't want to create-- why do we want a group-- no we're going to break into houses together of course i'm willing to do this i just feel like for this-- what are you planning to do yeah okay no it's fine no i-- my head is not in the game we'll go along yeah well we could send frumpkin to have a look around i send frumpkin he will run around the entire building if he's able he's also able to climb things so i will get him up on top of window sills if he can to take a look inside is there the ability for frumpkin to move around to the exact opposite side of this building yeah he will jump up to any windowsill on the back of the house as well yeah did you say this was a one story building five to ten minutes of hopping from ground to window a bunch of times all i find are patient rooms no sort of office or anything else one last thing how high is the roof fjord come here scooch down for a second and i jump up onto-- i've taken my vision back-- i jump up onto his back now stand up okay i snap at frumpkin and he vanishes and i reach out and frumpkin appears i am now within ten feet i would assume of the top of the building so frumpkin is on the roof (teleportation noise) i want to send him to look-- then i hop down off of ford and put my hand and steady myself on fjord and have frumpkin look for any holes in the roof or if there's a skylight or anything probably not but it's worth a try okay i call him back then i (snaps fingers) and then he's on my shoulder yeah cats are the best i don't know there's a trap door up there but i mean we're not going in well done there yeah what do we want to do this place is full of sick people yeah and if we're going in what do we do we could have one of us be ill perhaps yeah a better idea perhaps is for one of-- you're able to disguise yourself right there's three of us that we can all disguise ourselves i can make myself look like like a sick person well you can make yourself look like you but with not green skin there is some sort of trapdoor in the center of that building that i don't think is mirrored by any of the rooms that i was able to see on the outside of the building so it's like a donut with a hole in the middle is where maybe what you're looking for yeah ruckus you and i go in couldn't you maybe act like-- could you be a sick tiefling when we go in we don't walk in just you and me we do mother's love just in case yeah show us the goods what did you do to yourself oh i will have jester sketch it out and we will have it forever we're going to hang back is there a nook or an alley within view of this can we go half a block away yeah that's fine for the moment for the moment yeah get ready we're going to do mother's love we're going to watch them at the door the ruckus is audible all the way down the block so i turn myself into a half-orc woman and pick up nott like my baby and put her head on my shoulder and start walking towards the building we peer in the door what is going on in this room at this point we are going to go between them like noah through the water oh that's the wrong -- moses yeah there's vomit and eggs everywhere i will take the left one if the clerk went down the right side (crying) frumpkin appears on the back of the guy's neck and starts tearing in oh my gosh for a cat i mean it's a 13 plus i don't know what starts clawing one is there enough chaos for us to step into one of these open rooms and shut the door behind us look for an empty room or is every room in the house full i go in and shut the door behind us a one yeah but he's in the office we don't know that's a no we're working together we're trying to work together with people no we have to get all of us out of here which is more important than finding this asshole in the building what do we do what do we do that seems extreme at this moment let's go out we go i wasn't saying that but i don't mind no but we'll go down the hall towards the front of the building to look for i would assume fjord and molly at this point is fjord alone in this room i turn and show him nott (soft voice) fever she has a fever wait so who’s where outside pointing at us okay (groans) that still seems extreme we should just book it only a ten for me i think i was imagining a small mom-and-pop place with two physicians but like 50 people in white coats came out-- i think it was more like 72 matt let’s be honest oh that only took five minutes to go that bad that’s true it came very close so you looked at the house and then you went shopping tight that’s tight not my face yeah agreed in hospitals you see all nature of people no there was not a lot of-- there was not a lot of talking in fact well it could add credibility to the tapestry that we’re trying to weave here the goal is still to get into sutan elder’s home and get this seal within the writings that we forge we could include some by the junior sutan so that would add some credibility to what we’re doing we still have to figure out what we are going to-- if we are starting at sutan’s house then… we don’t have any writing of the high-richter’s we are either trying to focus on finding that somehow or going on what you were discussing which is creating the appearance of an underling or a for-hire of the high-richter’s or some kind of code saying that they are communicating with sutan elder on behalf of the high-richter yeah experience as a what we want to put information in sutan’s house-- elder-- right we could have some sort of writing that is not from the high-richter but that says “h-r would prefer the plans to go into motion-- i propose that we make it seem like sutan and the high-richter were conspiring to have orentha killed so we have a note put into sutan’s house that says “on behalf--” from an intermediary “on behalf of hr wants the plan to go into motion immediately and that orentha will be out for the festival tonight the big o that is good then we plant that in sutan elder’s house when we successfully quietly break in well it’s an intermediary so does not have to look-- this letter perhaps on its own is not enough but with the seal if we have a matching letter planted in hr’s home-- keep your writing very plain not immensely charming-- no i mean not charming like the way you speak no no yeah that’s good “hr would like the plan to be moved forward” “the plan is moving up to tomorrow night at the festival” “the moment has come and it is time for us to seize it” to chase it away we don’t want a dead dog yeah frumpkin can do that very well also sausages are very inexpensive so we have that as a plan b are they private guards though or are they crownsguard marisha and do you know what nott if you want-- one idea if you want to help is you can also write a note in your thieves’ cant it should be vague on details but a message from the myriad or don’t even get that specific but write in thieves’ cant a note saying that everything is in place for the festival no but i think we should go back to the hospital one more time is he at the hospital where did you get these items under the leaky tap and you found you found a skeleton you found a dead person yeah but it's not really typical to keep a dead-- like a skeleton in your basement well that's a topic for the group we're staying in an inn where there was a dead person yeah that's worse that's not better that's worse okay well that's somewhat unsettling but show me these items that you have i place them down on the bed and go through the process of casting identify on them it takes about ten minutes you should sell these these are not little and adorable like buttons do you want to wear them well you could what-- are they huge for a goblin’s little wrists maybe your ankle or calf you could put them on or sell them and then you could put them to use i'm still a little disturbed that there's a dead person under this inn that we're in right now well i take your word for it that it's there i don't need to go poking about well it is a spell that i learned when i was-- you could potentially learn this as well of course if you apply yourself-- how do you mean-- i'm not very strong nott i do have things that i want to do with my life and i mean to apply myself and study and find knowledge ja that is the best way to do that for anyone that seems like an abstract question there are certainly very useful things that can be found in this world you never know are you okay well thank you friend well maybe we go to bed and tomorrow we don't tear the roof down off of every building we go into again yeah so i take out my silver thread and i start casting the alarm spell on our room before bed and then i go to bed mess with the bull get the horns yeah and if you are actually in the dark you can't tell the difference and if you're in the light you look like a ninja so i think we're good maybe yeah in a pinch a lot is riding on sutan and the high-richter going to this festival that's it that's all (laughter) no it's just pessimism well i worry that if we break into sutan's house and stuff a bunch of letters there but the high-richter stays in with a tummy ache then it all falls apart yeah lead the way i'll be the caboose i’ll pick up some sausages oh just the one string of them four or five two strings in case (laughter) okay put it down on the ground ah well then use a hearth fire or something because i will probably put that into flames also alternatively would we want maybe something instead that said that the knights are ready for this evening’s pursuits and they’re to support any endeavors as needed great high-richter it is time for change yes the two together but i worry that just the one piece she could have written it down on a list of things she does not like it's not very conclusive but the two together have you written your letter in your thieves’ thingy that you do that's in sutan's place good we want to tie sutan to the myriad and high-richter to the knights and high-richter and sutan together that's the plan yes to take that seat to enact the change that the people need did we get paid in advance by the way did we get half of it even we should also-- you're invisible we should also discuss who's going in who's outside how we are tackling each house how does it work then you're right you should go in nott you should go in because you're going to pick locks ja if anything is locked i strongly believe that i should go in as well because these are two very wealthy powerful people and there could be magical-- only if that is you know easy to do and the sausage just in case regardless even if this goes belly-up we just disappear you know we have no ties to this we walk away yeah we just get out with our skins even if things go as badly as they did at the hospital and then we go we just walk away oh also frumpkin is up here in my sort of scarf position and i bring him down in my lap and i take the sausages out and i sort of like knead one of the sausages in my hand a bit and i say you know i'm sorry but the next time that you go off to your pocket place and come back this will be gone and i start squishing sausage grease into his hair and rubbing it down his back so that he smells like sausage i love you very much so thank you for this okay some other time perhaps eight i send frumpkin screeching away from us up the street clattering into anything yeah out of the sewer yeah i pop him back up caleb appears at the sewer like pennywise the clown i held back two minutes to let frumpkin quietly come back can i insight check him just get a feel for that that is 17 guys it’s larkin may i also do the same thing no no good eight this is a lot of people i rolled well 17 i’m sorry can you set the scene two guards at one end and one at the other and it’s like corner-corner or front and back or… okay the guard with the dog is within this perimeter of fence to the front side of the home maybe temporary though yeah but what about our exit because we have to come back out no no we worry about that now i don’t like being stuck in there though also i have another question how far from the fence to the home five feet only i’m rethinking if frumpkin gets away from this dog in the beginning he can run outside the fence and he will not be far from me i can stay in touch with him so when it’s time to leave i can have frumpkin reenter the yard and create mayhem a second time we might not but if we have no other option and we’re trying to get out and there’s guards in both places frumpkin can come in and create mayhem again anyway just an option he's just a cat a natural sound how's the weather is it clear or grey well she's got to get up there first she didn't roll that good 17 frumpkin is pacing back and forth just outside the fence she is really cool only frumpkin is down at the bottom of the tree he runs around and-- yeah i think-- wait hold on is there entry through the roof we can't see from here a chimney stack we're not santa claus i'm sending frumpkin now okay where are they in relation to us too by the way i want to know if you're within view of the guard with the dog's initial position so what i would do is also once we're in position on the roof is i would tell frumpkin to back off away from that dog out of vision and wait a few minutes because he's within a hundred feet of me if so we're good tell him to find molly and sit with molly he'll always listen to me but i'm also sending him the command to listen to molly if need be you don't know that but still what were you saying i did not hear you yeah good we covered-- if we do the shingles how do we cover them up when we leave we're trying to leave no trace i have a dagger no get them get them look out giant red dragons i drop in after beauregard and i cast detect magic immediately 30 feet you know we want to be efficient here quick yes save more time to doing so let's start moving and you’re looking for bad physical things what's the light situation like in here yeah hells yes okay do i know the school of magic there's no magical aura from those at all those are separate you're not saying okay the spell says i know the school of magic for what's on these things you able to tell me that if you don’t know how to answer it's fine (singing) breaking the law breaking the law okay ja i'm an expert in edubation that's liam not caleb okay but i don't know exactly how these work but i have a strong suspicion that these things can start moving and try to cut us up both these suits of armor and that weapon maybe hopefully things will go very well but there's a chance that this thing that you are indicating is not connected to those so be ready to fight this is exciting i wish i was still a rogue it's the best class i walk up behind nott and scan the room with the spell i'm just walking up behind nott no further and looking in to see what glows what kind of magic is emanating from the carpet what school of magic i alert everyone the carpet is magical i do not i have a question the carpet reeks of abjuration or-- i would know that the carpet is magical transmutation if the carpet is magical i wouldn't-- right the carpet seems magical to me i wouldn't think that something under the carpet is magical do i see any change in the abjuration magic when she does that what you just did dispelled whatever ward was on the cabinet however the carpet i can't tell exactly what's going on but there is something-- it's an animated object my kids have fought a broom this happens i would be by beau because i clapped her on the shoulder (sarcastically) you are not prepared oh no well you know i rolled a nine (singing) you're the best around nothing's ever going to bring you down we damage it no i understand but we damage it no one knows who the fuck knows you learned it's badass next moving on oh ulog is a little girl yeah i pull the potion of healing i have out of my belt and i run over to nott and i jam it into her mouth and pour it in the whole time i'm going through my list of spells thinking of what could help there's nothing but i'm going dancing lights fire bolt friends alarm burning hands chromatic orb comprehend languages detect magic and i heal nott 14 points greater he's killing our nostalgia for the carpet he would have had to have told me that there was magic anywhere else in the room right was physical that's true come on you are a badass you can do it you're the best of all of us wait did you roll a 20 and an eight come on beau who wore it best no she's not out she's hanging on ja what am i doing i rush forward and i am going to try to pry the rug off of her ja come on roll big nope athletics nein next that's okay because if the plan goes according to plan yeah allow myself to introduce myself if everything goes well we get orentha to fall on both of these people at once so let's finish what we're doing ja ja doesn't matter no one is going to care about a rug or him screaming about a rug check that armoire or whatever it is check them both he's got a safe and a floor no more magic son of a gun motherfucker what about ulog because it's simultaneous what is in there with ulog all magical i assume i assume they're glowing yeah i haven't cast anything that breaks that nott just collapsed on the floor paralyzed i pull the chest free of nott's hands is this chest glowing we have that already we did it in advance i start rooting through nott's pockets to find the letter in thieves' cant yeah thieves' cant we're leaving here so we should leave them here from richter to sutan we did so we're leaving those and we're leaving a note-- nott's fake myriad note we're leaving here so i pull that out of nott's pockets while jester and caleb are arguing caleb grabs the little magical stone that's in that box and puts it in his pocket got to do it we've left the thieves’ cant note from the myriad and we've left the-- yeah everything that we've planned is anything glowing there though matthew okay yeah (angry meow) yeah athletics check for everybody right come on tal work that shit this is-- how far away is where the grapple is hooked from us right now i cast unseen servant schmidt lifts up the grapple and tosses it free wow we need to get to our next target immediately everybody's going to the same place what if she came home with some crazy outfit crazy cloak how high

going in with her kneel down i'm going to climb up on his back and start to try to climb 17 oh he leaps i was going to say seeing that argument that i dropped down to the ground on the other side and not help him i cast detect magic i grab both of her shoulders and peer in to see if anything glows what do we see what do we see where we are doors out of here no we move forward you ten feet in front
