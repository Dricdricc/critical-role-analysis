fun in your life all right well we'll be right back [dramatic music] welcome back i am very excited to share with you all what has cooked inside my head for two weeks before we go i think it would be cool to really quick to clarify for the audience could you all introduce yourselves your name your class your race that's racist we can start on this end sure i texted travis about five times over a period of a week saying hey man you know give me a name at some point so i can start crickets crickets crickets finally i'm like hey man i'm going to go with tarvis yeah sounds good (laughter) also an assassin and what's your intelligence what's it say on there happy to have you really i'm just procrastinating we should do this okay let's get it on there we go liam's nervous for liam too for the last 24 hours the city of emon has been blanketed in the heaviest rains in recent memory the streets have flooded with water and the few residents stubborn enough to brave the elements hurry as quickly as they can to their destinations drenched and chilled to the bone but not so for you four one of the clasp's countless hidden cells you've been keeping warm and cosy in the diamond nest tavern waiting for word from spireling shenn you already know the task that awaits you you've been over it all that is left is for the spireling to set you loose the diamond nest isn't horribly busy this evening but there are a few patrons scattered about trying to warm themselves by the fire trying to warm themselves with drink you've been here since the late afternoon hiding from the rain and tedium set in hours ago you've all been pretending to nurse the same drinks since the sun went down and after minutes of staring at the wall out of the corner of your eye delweth you notice the door to the kitchen swing quietly open and a familiar figure come strolling over towards your table in the corner it's garthok a lean looking half-orc you've run with a handful of times the rest of you finally notice him as well as he slides up to the table evening friends you all as bored as you look he looks towards the opaque windows facing out on the street the sound of heavy rain spattering against them i'd hate to be the poor schmucks wandering around out there tonight (chuckles) he looks back to you stares you dead in the eye he's waiting and with that the half-orc heads across the tavern and seats himself at the bar over the next few minutes starting with dren you leave one at a time slip through the kitchen down into the secret passageway that leads to the clasp's headquarters below the diamond nest and dren while you wait for the rest to catch up with you you make your way down a long hall nod at one of your brethren standing watching at a door he unlocks it for you past the door reveals your charge devan lying on a bed who sits up and looks at you should i pull up a chair for this and watch i could get some popcorn you know the spireling is waiting for you right bring the girl everybody else catches up you all gather outside of shen's chamber to wait four members of the clasp and this yutz after a while the door opens and another group of four files out heading down the hallway you all came from and inside you see shen looking down at some parchment spread out across his table his red monocle catching a bit of light from a lantern in the room yes yes come in i know you all must have been going a bit stir-crazy come right i had hoped to move on this last night but i'm afraid the elder bluebutton delayed her departure for a day however she has finally left for her little excursion in vasselheim we've had her trailed to the city limits and beyond her house staff is still on the premises but they largely keep in their separate lodgings for the night and even if one of them decides to poke about in the main house i'm sure they won't be much of a problem any last questions before i send you out all right i will it's hard to miss it's a gem the size of a skull-- an emerald as big as your head sir that you do tarvis do you have any real questions or are you good to go he walks up to you tarvis and-- right up close to you-- takes a little latch on your armor and tightens it and says now bring me my prize i know you won't disappoint he then walks over to you devan miss bluebutton i hope you will put your trust in our very capable hands i'm sure with your guidance your grandmother's precautions will pose little problem my people will keep you safe just do as your escorts say and there's no reason why things should go any differently than our little test runs over the last couple weeks once tagmut's eye sits on this table you will be free of your debt as promised i'm a good judge of character i've no doubt you'll do fine go you all leave the room make your way through the various halls of the clasp underneath the tavern and you find the entrance to the tunnels that connect to the sewers the drainage system underneath emon is vast and labrynthine but obby knows them well he's traveled through at least half of it at this point sleeping below the streets of the city as much as he has above bluebutton's home-- adelaide bluebutton your grandmother the shrew-- she's over in the central district it's a ways off from the graveyard district where you're starting and even though the rat hasn't been down this stretch of tunnelwork before with maps procured from city planning he's able to guide the party there without any trouble so most of you can see in the dark but the two halflings would be blind as a bat so devan and obby are carrying torches to light the way there's also a lot of icky shit in the sewers so better to be prepared and eventually you make your way to your destination which is a large runoff from adelaide's property you come up to a dead-end on a side path in the sewers two equal walkways on either side of a canal and there is a shawshank-size pipe coming out of the wall and water is rushing out of it at a steady pace because it is raining cats and dogs outside (whispers) i've got rain well initially it's one and then it splits okay it is not easily walked into it's about 15 feet above all your heads 17 feet above yours if you'd like you can make an acrobatics check to get up to the pipe yeah you are a spry-- you're skinny-mini for a dwarf you scrabble up parkour off of one corner and then leap out and manage to catch with your hand and hang from it and then you yank your butt up inside it is slick and slimy from plant matter that has gone through here and also there is water rushing in your face you're getting toileted on for the most part here i'd also make a quick strength check to make sure you don't get flushed out like a cat you go up on the ends of your fingers and the ends of your toes and all the water scoots out under you okay as he scrabbles up delweth you bored and not interested in the dwarf's ass are staring at the wall and you notice off to the side a single brick maybe an inch out of the wall it's nothing major but it bumps you a little because the rest of the tunnel is pretty level and clean sure yeah without touching it you get a bit closer and can see that it is loose that's going to slide right in and out we'll call that checking for traps as well you don't see anything hinky you pull and not one brick but four bricks all connected come out and uncover a flatter stone surface inside and you're right up against it now and you see a very familiar circular insignia there of a rodent curled in on itself in a little ball you know this this is your grandmother's sign this is a house seal it's a siggle it's the siggle of the shrew yes you remember how this works it doesn't happen instantly but you feel the blood seep from your hand into it it stings a little bit but it's not too bad and after like 20 seconds enough blood is pulled out and you hear a little (click) and the seal spins a quarter inch and the door-- because it's a door-- pushes a little bit in okay rolls into the canal goes out floats away down in the rainwater and four beautiful globes of light swirl around devan and light up and shadows sparkle all around you it's like a little disco-- --in the sewer no obby's got one i don't know sure you want to check it for danger sure make a danger check also known as perception it looks good i mean you'd know if there was something wrong with this seems fine i mean it's a door right doors open and close you can almost fit through it it catches on your armor a bit so you're through and it feels cool and it's dark in there you can't see shit in there okay it floats in past and you looking through can see the light-- the tunnel curves to the right and it goes around the corner and you see the light go (whoosh) also shimmying around like this the door goes a little bit further and opens it almost feels like it's on some sort of track or rollers and it slides back a little bit further and follows you in a bit and there's actually a way to step over to the right and go around and you're in a little gold ball dancing around the top of your head right now you can you don't see anything here it's a plain flat smooth not curved but goes straight and then angles and then angles again and you can't see around the corner okay despite being covered in-- it's not a lot of poo or anything sam and you land and do a nice little dwarven three-point landing on one of the pathways and now you three are standing there you're at the edge and you're inside yeah you know that scene in labyrinth where she's running down that long brick passage-- no the one where it keeps going forever and she can't find any doors it's like that i mean where the door was is uneven there's teeth of bricks sticking out the sides and the whole thing moved in straight yeah it doesn't come out it goes in and dren was able to go (whoop) i don't know let me re-jigger your memory tarvis she's not in the clasp-- okay would everyone like to make a stealth check i know nor do you have an intelligence of 18 but it's going really well 17 okay and yeah i would like a marching order so how are you guys going in okay you've got a very scary elf behind you yeah all right so very quietly even your gambling charge here slowly creep around the door and curve around the side and it is pitch black in here you guys are fine you can see in low light and pitch black it's pitch black in here or it was and you see the tunnel stretch on really far you can see maybe 40 or 50 or 60 feet ahead of you but it keeps going and goes (whoosh) into black it's a long tunnel and there's nothing it's very nondescript yeah yes all you want you can make it rain with cantrips a little ball swirls in a spiral down the hall and you watch this little circle like a firefly go further and further yeah it keeps going and then starts to dim and then you lose sight of it and you wanted to check for traps here right make a perception check okay from where you are it's a smooth flat tunnel it's plain you guys want to move forward okay all right so you move forward in a little conga line down this tunnel and it takes a while you're walking the sound of the rain once i adjust vanishes behind you come on buddy there you go sure in a rough-- like one of those plastic signs that's shaped like a person on the street saying like don't walk here because you'll slip yeah that's vague so yeah you've got a gingerbread-shaped light man okay he's standing there like this and goes-- and you can see him you moved far enough along you've probably gone about 100 feet at this point you can continue to walk on down or-- as you're having this little walk-and-talk down the hallway tarvis you feel a little (click) under your foot you see one tile pushed diagonally down about a half inch in in a real odd way everybody make a perception check devan you-- no who got the 18 you got the 18 okay you guys both look everywhere look all around look up and starting right above you tarvis and stretching about 20 feet along the roof of this tunnel are maybe 100 tiny holes in the ceiling it starts above tarvis right where tarvis is right where he has stepped make an investigation check that's true it might work and you can try it you don't see anything behind the holes stretch above tarvis for 15 or 20 feet the tunnel goes for another i don't know 100 150 feet but the holes that they noticed above tarvis and moving about stop after about 15 20 feet ahead okay and we're moving forward forward forward obby bolts to the side of tarvis and books it down the hall he makes it like 15 feet and you hear another little (click) and immediately acid starts spilling out of all the holes obby tarvis a little spew of acid both of you make a dexterity check both of you who picked you up tarvis did yes you make a dexterity check as well yeah was your dex check and you got what and you got 19 okay boy this is crazy obby hears like (hissing) and you do a dive and roll and you feel a little drop of something splattering against your butt and burning into the seat of your pants a little bit you immediately hear (hissing) and you wriggle free like a cat and scratch down along the side of tarvis and tarvis you take a big ol' dump of acid on your head and take seven points of acid damage yeah you're burned you've got holes burned into your armor and into your shoulder and it's still stinging no it was about a ten second pee of acid from the holes yes yeah you can hear under your shoe is going (sizzling) the raven queen so obby hobbles ahead shamefacedly okay go for it five well there's lots of tiles there's tiles from here all over great you're scanning the ceiling really hard now for little holes and you're looking for any of these tiles on the floor any marble tiles that look askew at all you don't see anything you do though as you're walking looking down notice the little leather pack with the three healing potions that you guys were allotted when you left and go oh good to know that's there you've got it don't need to use it now but you have it eventually you guys all make it to the end of this tunnel and obby you're the first one there you notice the same-- no you don't know what it is you point this out to you tarvis same little circular shrew symbol about three feet off the ground in a heavy wooden door okay going to do anything with it okay your hand slowly dribbles out on the door you feel a little dizzy hungry the others catch up with you you see the dwarf shoving his hand on it and you know that's not going to work no but you could keep trying all day maybe it'll collect yeah that's all you need to do is get your hand open 30 seconds and the way that it works it takes your grandma something like five or six hours to set one of these or make one of these it takes your grandma about three seconds you watched her do it you've never done this you've just watched her do it she cuts it and it's open it's taking longer for you it's taking like 20 or 30 seconds you're a weak-ass punk is the thing but eventually (clicking) you open it this spectral purple transparent hand pushes against the door and it goes (creak) and soft warm light spills from over on the right you're looking in at some sort of cool dry cellar it's not that bright in here but the light that's coming from off to the side here lets you see that there are shelves lining all the walls you see a lot of wooden boxes stacked next to each other something like 20 of them against the wall and in the middle of the room which you can see mostly from where you're standing are three pallets in a row of similar wooden crates but the ones on the pallets are wedged together very tightly very orderly all in a row for storage of some kind no it does not sure oh man this is one of those instances where i'm going to homebrew it because i don't know what the rule is yeah sure you do also don't tweet me because i don't care a six okay she seems nervous as fuck but she's not artfully carrying off any lie that you can tell i'm nervous because obby is so attractive you're entering okay as you step in you see where the light is coming from there is a small little writing desk in the corner and there's a little globe very similar to your dancing lights floating above the desk the desk is too small for the bigger folk in this group but it's about the right size for a halfling just a couple papers scattered on it yeah well whatever you roll you hold devan back as she presses forward and you eyeball the room for a good 15 seconds check the ceiling no holes look around the room seems okay you can or i could just tell you what you see there's a couple of pieces of paper on the desk there's a letter made out to a cousin about a wedding there's another letter about a disagreement over the price of fabric just a couple pieces of paper there is sure no there are more pieces of paper in there and you find bills of sale and amounts of coin changing hands records of hers you see the names of a couple of money lenders listed in emon that you're familiar with you randomly pull a contract for surveillance of general krieg tristan that's a name that raises your eyebrows everyone in emon knows him that's it it's a lot of business transactions but you can't really make out what or who i mean not what you can tell what's being changed hands for the most part but who knows who bought who knows who sold make a perception check tarvis you also notice there's a couple pieces of paper also lying helter-skelter on top of the pallets as well there's papers all over this room no you crack the lid off one of these boxes and it is full of paper and you pull it out you take a couple of minutes to look through this stuff what's weird is that again it is all about amounts of money being moved around and bills of sale but there's no names but there's weird words that pop up over and over again like you see the word shortstack like seven times whisperer appears several times you see on a bill of sales adelaide's signature and then next to it is the word overbite but you don't know what it means but it seems to have some sort of pattern make a straight-up intelligence check it's like carpets being sold some weapons being sold a loan sure make an investigation check oh go for it yeah you see a door the walls are really shitty down here and not smoothed out or pretty it's a rough room but there is a door straight across from where you entered yes another door there's a lot of really boring paperwork here listing a lot of sales though you did find a piece of paper that describes the sale of a wyrmling dragon that's cool that is true okay you grab it okay so you rattle it yeah checking for traps all right make a perception check this shit is clear you are golden okay it's wide open there's a set of stairs that winds away and goes up just from the light that's spilling out of the room you're in so it's dim but you can see fine yeah wood 12 okay sneaky little halfling skitters up the stairs there's another door at the top yeah they're down around a curve so you're doing that to no one poke poke poke poke okay everyone files up the stairs they're going up and there's a door standing in front of you yeah well you checked for traps you didn't see any doors i don't know (sliding) nothing (sliding) a dead rat breaks open and smears on the floor-- there is nothing under these pallets yes you may so in the interest of time you spend three or four minutes push push push lots of paper nothing you find that's hidden in the room or in the stairway yeah sure you two are the big ballers with perception yeah it's a well-made staircase oh you just open it seven okay yeah it's good okay it goes (creaking) and opens you see not much you still have your lights going yeah okay there's light flickering from behind the group all the way near the back and so you're seeing shadows and light flicker in this room and in this room you can't see the whole room yet but you see glimpses of rows of chests thick wooden chests solid locks on some of them not all of them but neatly done in little aisles each one about two feet tall big thick bastards you recognize this room peering through this is where you used to skim from grandma's stores although you're a little confused because there's only one door to this room you're disoriented this is not how you're used to entering it okay make a perception check okay devan's globes of light are floating lazily around the room close to you and again the shadows are shifting moving slowly but you have enough light to see you walk along one of the aisles and look around you don't see anything nothing in the ceiling nothing in the floor the chests look normal you open the nearest chest you open it up there is a fuck-ton of gold coin in this chest beyond counting yes there's no trap on the chest that she just opened seems okay perception is seeing and spotting things hearing things investigation is looking at stuff left behind and going how does that connect to that okay but as you dig your hand into this gold and pull and up and coins fall away you notice out of the corner of your eye the chest next to it swell bulge open and a mouth bigger than you've ever seen (horrible screeching noise) lunges to bite you and does in fact get you everybody roll for initiative okay hold on we have a map okay so this big massive chest opens its mouth and you see one big fat eyeball in the back of its misshapen mouth (growls) and it clamps down on your hand full of gold and you take eight points-- did i get it right yes eight points of piercing damage and then also you take one point of acid damage as its slobber drizzles all over your arm and it latches down and you feel what feels like crazy glue seep all around your arm and you yank oh shit you think okay everybody give me your initiatives please nine okay and big man struck out at bat okay obby the rat you are up okay you're coming around the side you're saying over here this is you this is it right here straight at it okay all right roll to attack okay you lunge forward with your dagger and it melts a little out of the way seeing you coming devan you are up and you are grappled you are in this thing's mouth you have plenty of movement here okay all right devan you're up holy shit yes you do okay 3d6 okay and what's your dc oh it's a dex save versus your-- okay but there's no dex save because your hand's in its mouth just roll for damage roll your 3d6 you do have that-- okay so what'd you get okay so your hand is stuck in there and out of rage you feel the fire charge up in your hand and you go (fire noise) and it goes (small explosion noise) delweth you're up you can go get it girl 20 okay you can do that well make an acrobatics check yeah sure 24 (swoosh) you are out of movement you don't clear it but you land on top of the chest next to it all right roll to attack yeah don't skewer devan's hand yeah it goes (growls) okay and now we're on to dren yeah oh you're out of movement yeah that flip cost you a lot of movement okay cool no yes you could but again since we've got so many rogues i'll remind you to get your sneak attack damage you don't need to be hidden if one of your friends is on it you get the same from that you can do it right now yeah all right go for it you can cut her hand off if you want to try to pry its mouth open or something you could oh also delweth your sword sticks it doesn't come out go for it okay that hits yeah roll the initial attack first do your damage without it yep 13 nice so your pint-sized charge here and the thing is slobbering all over her hand not paying too much attention to you and you're able to go (stabs) and shove it right under one of its teeth that's sticking out and it starts bleeding down the blade and you go (grunts) your dagger is adhered to the creature not coming off your hand is okay but the dagger is in it or what'd you say shortsword shortsword is sticking out of this thing and you cannot get it out wedging back and forth hey siri yeah you can jump back and it can't get a free swipe at you okay where do you want to go here delweth here yeah yes you can boop and you hop up on a chest all right and now we're on to you tarvis yes here yes your sword along the face yeah you go (scraping) you drag it across and this jagged line goes (scraping) all the way across you break the lock the thin old rusted lock on the fourth one nothing happens okay it's at that moment that obby behind you you hear (growling) and over your shoulder you see another one a smaller one but this one starts to pustulate and get little bubbles all over it and eyes go pop pop pop all over and it goes (screech) it takes a bite at you but you are so scared shitless from the sound that comes out behind you you juke to the left and it goes (screech) and didn't get you and now it's your turn 13 hits that's right you just julius caesar-ed it yeah oh ten total okay your dagger is stuck in its butt which one you're going to take your crowbar and try to ram it open okay make a strength check 15 you jam it in there and pull as hard as you can it does open your hand is exposed your crowbar is stuck that's where we'll end that devan we're on to you yeah you can make a strength check with advantage you see bits of halfling skin on the thing's tongue and you are free that is your action yeah nicely done you are now safe for the moment delweth you are up okay acid splash is just 1d6 yeah read that spell for me real quick so i don't have to flip a million pages there it is no i got it 1d6 succeed on a-- what's your spell dc oh you know what doesn't matter i know your hand extends out over it and glows a dark green and black swirl of color and acid goes (dripping) and runs down over its eyes and face and then washes off like water on a duck's back and knowing is half the battle you do have a bonus action sure okay which way do you want to go all right how about right there dren you're up say again it's at the very beginning of the fight if you get the jump on them big guy or little guy the big guy you got a 20 that hits plus sneak attack damage because obby's got its-- what was the weapon the thing's got its mouth open from where obby pried it open and devan got away and your bolt goes (impact) and gets it right in the eye (grunting) it's still going though tarvis you're up big guy you're going to go to him okay you're there okay all right roll to attack ten total yeah you really wanted to get at that anus so bad you went around and tried to get at it and it snapped right at your junk at the last second you went oh jeez and pulled back and did not get to the anus okay the mimic having a great shot at your junk right now bites your junk you feel teeth sink into your abdomen and into your junk a little bit you take 11 piercing damage and the acid leaks in after it for five (growling) yep that's the end of that now the little one (screech) it was almost a natural 20 but it wasn't it doesn't try to bite you but a little glob of its body goes (whipping noise) and you feel a little whip hit in the air right by your ear didn't hit you though and now it's your turn you take your dagger and in rage for your friend you bring it down and it sinks into the forearm of your friend you take two points of piercing damage things go wrong sometimes you can totally do that yep you're good it goes (yapping) as you leave now it is devan your turn the big one you probably need a clear line of sight-- go for it your bonus is six so 20 and add six what'd you get ten the frost totally freezes the chest next to it shut you still have a little bit of movement if you like over here okay and now we're on tarvis wait no sorry i'm out of order delweth all the frigging 'd' names on this list okay you can do that sure okay go for it oh it's a con save for my guy and it does not i don't think you can-- ooh stealth spell hmm curious no sneak attack damage on a spell but it does sputter and froth comes out of its mouth and it pivots towards you and now we're on dren you do sorry yes you're out of movement though to get there hopping on the barrels it's looking right at you you're not going to be able to hide it doesn't get it it's still slobbering-- (dying noise) all right so dren the big dude see you kind of it's got one eye with a crossbow bolt in it yeah it's surrounded this is julius caesar time here are you throwing something or are you moving over there how do you want to do this (cheering) what happened to the crossbow you pull a bolt out and go fuck it and ram it down into its protruding bulbous purplish gums and stab it and it goes (gurgling) and vomit spills out of it and goes all over tarvis' feet anything else you want to do yeah okay tarvis what would you like to do dropping blood as you go no his boots are already burned from acid i think they made a nice little crust on the bottom that's correct it's got to be within five feet of his friend what'd you get there ten oh man your guts are-- you're lucky they're not spilling out and you are in so much pain that you swing and cramp and burning pain up to the nipple up to the horse nipple and your sword goes into a regular chest next to the thing now it is the mimic's turn and it goes (snickering) and another gooey rubber band punches out at you-- yeah you can i'm going to say that's as far as you get and the little booger that came out and went (whiplash) but didn't reach you now it is obby the rat's turn yes that hits seven points okay and you use what weapon dagger okay you jam the dagger down into one of its 50 eyes and it goes in diagonal and this fucking knife is glued onto this creature's body keep track of your daggers guys jesus make a dexterity check at disadvantage no you go (grabbing noises) oh shit and that's it you are staying put now we're back to devan the one that he dragged his blade across what do you want to do they look like scarred chests yeah you do it's full of electrum coins okay no nothing's biting you you get i don't know 80 100 120 pieces of electrum into the hood of your cloak it's another currency all right do you want to move any more or are you going to stay here and drool on the coin cool okay delweth you are up you go so noxious gray-purple fume floats-- you don't need to do anything it needs to do something it just happens no it does terribly again so another poof of awful surrounds the thing roll for damage no but it looks really miserable the shape is changing and it looks more like a chest and then less like a chest and the eyes shrink back in and go bloodshot it looks disgusting it doesn't look happy and we are now onto dren it's sitting there sticking out of him 15 hits roll for damage plus sneak attack damage okay so you stand coolly looking at it you watch as delweth sends out this poof of noxious gas around it it sputters it shifts it changes you coolly go (crossbow bolt firing) (gurgling screams) i'd love to hear a haiku do you have one ready for us so the room falls quiet there are two slobbery disgusting messes with daggers and your shortsword is sticking out of it and you're surrounded by money yes why don't you roll against it let's do straight charisma i'm sure i'm fudging it but eh it's a different value than gold no less than gold yeah it takes like a minute and a half but without the thing trying to bite you you are able to plant your foot on it just the edge the corner of your boot and pull for a while and it does come free it's okay it smells bad yeah i mean it's not as pretty as when you got it at the shop but it's functional in here there are shelves lining these walls as well and there's clay pots with more coins in them and you see a tray with ingots it looks like gold there's bolts of very fine fabric you open one box that is full of precious stones box is about this big for traps okay make a perception check anyone who wants to check make a perception check there is another door in the interest of time you all fan out open everything you can find drag your hand through chests full of wealth there is a lot of money here there is no giant emerald make a stealth check coins are spilling around your feet going (clinking) three minutes later they come out she's wearing some above-average robes and a nice fur-lined cloak you'll win it back obviously okay biggest one in the box all right are we moving out make a perception check did you make a perception check already okay make a perception check this is a plain room full of money no it's been a while think about it above here is your grandmother's office the office leads to the rest of the first floor things spill off a couple of things break as they hit the ground just a plain wall behind it it is wood well you checked already you didn't find any okay the door goes (squeak) it is not locked it is not trapped that you can tell okay and you're in the lead dren did i hear that right yeah you're going up ahead okay so you creep up and you come up a stairway with little walls on each side and you start to see the insides of a nice office she's got a thing for these little globes of light you come up into a fairly well-lit room it's big you're on one end of a large office and the first thing you see over there seems to be desk tables stuff you associate with an office but right where you're coming out you see in the middle of the floor going up to the ceiling a weird looking brass column going from the floor all the way up to the ceiling and there are constellations that you are familiar with from books and from living in emon as long as you have spiraling beautifully all the way up this column up to the ceiling and then around that are dog beds five dog beds you also see a really large bone in the largest one you see a ragged hydra doll with a couple of heads ripped away and it looks like it's been whipped around ragged there's a crude leather ball made out of leather fabric wrapped up and that's this side of the room she didn't have dogs when you lived here are you up there doorway then stairs up out of this basement so you're going up to the top of the stairs polished wood and from where you can see you see a couple of dog beds you don't see them all yet because you aren't that far into the room aside from the dog beds it looks like a very beautiful room make a perception check 14 yeah on the dog beds you do see very short not a lot and not long hairs like short hair bristly almost oh it's like 20 feet up it's a very beautiful room there's a couple on this side of the room there's two of these floating globes okay coming around now you can see all the dog beds obviously this column and then you look over to the side and you see the office proper you see a large beautiful desk first thing you see are two double doors that enter here and then there is a very impressive full-sized desk facing that there is a little wooden chair like coming in for the interview yeah if it's a long room and coming up here is where the dog beds are and the column and then here's the middle with this desk and the entrance and then further over this way there's more but it's a beautiful desk and the chair it's like a miniature throne with little wooden steps up the side of it and you can see the seat is higher than you would think it would be for you at least and there's a beautiful globe in a brass fixture on one side of the desk on the other side is a bookstand like a bible stand if you've ever seen one with a huge book with red ink in it and a red ribbon hanging down the binding of it looks tan-colored maybe leather there's a huge table on the far end of the room with papers scattered all over it there are two windows to your right here the rain is still coming down in sheets they're like ship porthole windows circular two of them on the side you came up on the rain is (crashing) against the side of it all the way across the room same right behind you where you came up what did you roll you poke at them they're soft comfortable warm they smell mildly like pee make a nature check there's dog toys sitting around here it does smell like dog in the room the house is quiet other than the rain make a roll and add your charisma bonus great clobbered yeah i don't know sure you check out the column first it's beautifully made of brass it's very ornate no you fiddle with it for a minute it does seem strange in the middle of a room it doesn't look like it's supporting anything meets at the ceiling in fact it looks like it goes into the ceiling in this room not in this room okay you don't find dog doors you do find a wet bar hidden off to the side on the other side of where the-- yeah old lady don't play and there's paper you take a cursory glance at the papers scattered on the large long table chairs around it there's an invitation from a lord and lady caldouin for a literary salon plenty in the wet bar i don't know what that is but there's elven wine there's firewater yeah what languages do you speak you can't read it then it is beautiful but a little unsettling you don't remember that (hollow ringing) ashly and the metal felt thick to the hit you go through you find more paper in there more parchments there's more business in there there's more flapjack more whisper tiddlywink is a name that shows up no there's quills an empty journal the equivalent in emon of a farmer's almanac talking about the cycles of the moon and weather yes make a perception check big massive book on a bible stand you feel under knock on it you know what to do in these instances you know to look for hidden catches you're not finding anything the big book yeah okay what languages do you speak it's a planet globe and you can't read what's on that either you spin it around look at it for a while you do recognize the coast of emon anyone can try anything and someone could succeed where someone else failed you go i i i want the knife you know how big the house is you're on the back side of the house you know that through those double doors is the main hallway of the first floor there's other rooms in the house there's a kitchen dining room library and sitting room for guests out at the front of the house are where the twin sets of staircases are that lead up to the second floor to your old bedroom and to the hall are you going to go on a little march make a perception check you trace your fingers lightly along the edges of the door look for the telltale signs that you all have trained to find you don't see anything yes you're looking in the only light is coming from this room but a dark long hallway that stretches about 80 feet 60ish no you see some potted plants and a nice red carpet disappearing a little bit into the darkness so you guys slowly creep your way down everybody make a stealth check really you quietly move your way down this one bumps a potted plant on the way-- everybody holds still for a second nothing you continue on you eventually meet another set of doors just like the ones you went through you know this leads to the front of the house make a perception check tickle the door open with this spectral hand sticks its pinkie into the keyhole seems fine nothing's happening it's two you see the red carpet actually continues into the next room and you can barely see two sets of stairways coming down along the sides of this path and this carpet you can see a very beautiful set of large doors with circular windows one on each side and you see the rain coming down you also can make out a person at a distance walking by-- about ten or 15 feet yeah you see a coat tree right by the door and then a little table to the other side of it with a pair of white gloves sitting on it painting of some old halfling man with a curly little moustache- do you know why the call me obby the rat there's nothing there you were so fixated on the guy outside there's a door on the side of this room and on the other side as well there's stairs leading up to it there's a library on the right her bedroom is on the third floor your bedroom is on the second floor there's a guest bedroom up there too and the funtime hall is up there as well all right who's going to the library to the right okay all right you head in there first of all you tarvis look out the window it's not a man it's a woman it's a large woman with shock white hair and massive arms yeah well she's got a cloak with a hood and you can see the hair spilling out she looked right at the house a moment ago but she didn't look at you she just glanced over-- yeah and you can even see further in the distance like another 60 feet away is a gate to the rest of the city out of her grounds you can barely in this heavy rain see two more guys standing on the other side so you guys split off to the library you can see in here it's totally dark but bookshelves curve all the way around the entirety of this room there's one of those rolling ladders that slides along to reach the books on the top shelf there's a nice loveseat with a small side table next to it there's a book open upside down on the table you do notice wedged amongst all the books of history philosophy and arcana one erotic novel meanwhile in the tea room it is also really dark in here it's you two you can't see shit but you can see a beautiful little round table with a china set out white and blue plates it's hard to see that in the dark it looks more like white and black there's a little rolling tea table with sugar bowl and all the stuff there's also what's the word not an armoire-- that's what it is a buffet with a couple of silver platters placed neatly for presentational purpose looks like a presenting room or sitting room you hear a woman's voice sneeze outside the window yeah not right outside it a little ways away through the heavy sound of the rain the one in here sure sure there are there's silverware napkins really nice napkins and tablecloths you all have your weapons so i'm going to say you guys took a couple minutes earlier to yank them out of the monstrosity downstairs yes she's picking her nose quite vigorously right now they're identical they're twin stairs going to the same destination you can tell even from down here you head up those stairs i'll say you quietly move your way up roll it obby actually slips under tarvis' legs and then disappears through his cloak and everyone loses track for a second he's gone you move up those stairs directly in front of you guys you see doors that you recognize they're the doors to the hall you also know that right over here over your shoulder is your old room there's a guest bedroom across the hall coming up the stairs you see double doors right in front of you and then you look over your shoulders there's doors on the sides and behind you yeah and there's a curving stairway directly behind you guys that goes to the third floor are you taking them over to your room you open the door you can't see into the dark but you guys looking in in the dim light see nothing in this room except for furniture grouped together with sheets over it for storage there is a chaise lounge with two beautiful wooden chairs sitting on top of it not bedroom furniture at all under that sheet yeah two more oh my god a large table and on top of the table lying on its side is a little dresser drawer you lift one drawer up and it's empty you'd say it was shoved in here for storage it is another love seat like the one that you saw down in the library it's identical actually stuffing pops out do the roll it's empty the room the furniture wasn't even taking up that much space in here it looks like grandma cleared it out and started storing shit in here ghosts there's ghosts everywhere make a stealth check okay yeah you walk behind her and tie it i'll actually say it's slightly above medium tight because he couldn't see okay what's up guys you twiddle your hand your mage hand all over it you spend a minute doing it because you're feeling nervous seems okay you're thorough it's not locked no it's not a knob it's one of those-- the door swings open in front of you and that's where we'll take our break [break] i hope you're all having fun inside my house of horrors well let's get back into it as you open the doors before you you are met with quite a sight the hall is well-lit by the same amber baubles floating in space all down the hallway stretches out about 80 90 feet ahead of you the hallway is absolutely littered with countless strange extraordinary and occasionally off-putting objects this is taliesin jaffe's wet dream objects of beauty and horror are mixed together in a crazed jumble along each side of this hall there are paintings hanging all the way down each more unsettling than the one before a large fish skeleton hangs way down on the other end of the hall it looks about fifteen feet long things right nearby that you spot there are a crude pair of heavy black iron tongs a unicorn fetus in a very large jar pickled and curled in on itself a set of eerie looking dolls beautifully crafted but with no eyes the front plate smashed in stacks of books everywhere a large stuffed bear rearing back with a giant open snarl then all the way down the hall you see ornate gothic creepy as fuck looking chandeliers three of them evenly spaced down the hall and they look like cruel teeth pointed downward but they are gorgeous they're stunning to look at you almost don't know whether to shit or go blind you don't know where to look there's so much stuff and you've seen this before most of it there's new things here things you haven't seen and you're overwhelmed you're short-circuiting with all the things you're looking at around you you look over your shoulder and you see that there's two of them on the walls to the side of both doors they're black with a red barren tree in winter painted identically on each one hanging decoratively you place your hand and you have to reach pretty high but you get up on your tiptoes and reach and you push and you feel it go (clunk) you dig your nails onto the curve and (click) back to where it was left right left right (click) nope i'll also remind you that there were two doors that she opened using blood obby as she's rattling this off you're spacing out looking around the room checking out the artwork on the wall the one right above you is of a ship splitting open on the sea and the crews are plunging into the waves in the center of it you look across the hall over there is one of mourners at an open grave filled to the brim with blood you also look around and notice a gorgeous metallic egg studded with jewels all around it beautiful this big a little bit bigger than a regular egg a teapot made out of it looks like bone is there a what you remember where it was it's not there the wall is smooth there was a third step too you remember what it was you give a knock you can yeah is that what you're doing sure make a perception check no they were hanging up on the sides of the doors decoratively yeah the ones you came in the floor sure investigation check tarvis you see poking out of the edge of the carpet-- you know how downstairs there was a long red carpet there's one here as well you see a bit of scrawl something poking out of the edge of the rug about eight feet in front of you not off-hand no no bowl you do see a really cool little brass and wood clockwork owl that's cool walking forward going down the hall you do that before they walk off all right you peel it back there is some sort of arcane scrawl on the floor yeah like a ring written in a circle you tug the rug back a bit and you see it goes further under the carpet and you see the edge of a spiral pattern of writing that you can't-- it's not no no make an arcana check that is esperanto it's a long hallway and there's so much shit in here that it's like process a little bit as you go sure yeah you know what this is how do you think you know magic you had to study you don't know all of it you would never be able to make this on your own but you recognize some of the key glyphs in it this is a magic sigil this will turn gravity haywire here you look straight up at one of the iron gothic tooth-like chandeliers right above it no there is enough room on the sides to gingerly step around this so what are you saying someone's pulling carpet as you go or it's one carpet that goes all the way down the hall and tarvis went and under this part of the carpet was one area it's not wall to wall it's a very wide hall and it's down the center and all the eclectic craziness is piled up to the sides of it i mean some stuff spills over on the rug but it's pretty hodge podge no windows up here you can't do that because the wood all the way down is taken up by things like jars with pickled unicorns in them this one spot you can sneak around okay you pass by a portrait of a woman all in black stiff austere dress a cold white face and you double take and look at it again and realise that that woman is dead and there's a fly crawling in the side of her mouth on the other side there's a painting of a large still lake stretching away from the shore and there's a small boat drifting off in the middle and there's a piece of fabric draped into the water and things floating in the side of it it's a painting you see an assortment of bells covering the top of one table all different sizes and different colors of metal a platter with a series of bone needles lying on it you see a stuffed ostrich with a little skull cap metal pith helmet with a spike coming out of it on one armoire there's a shiny black stone wasp as big as a bird also gorgeous a wicker rabbit with antlers protruding from its head yes arcane jackalope pick up the wasp make a con save it is done make a con save my friend well you pick it up and look at it and it is gorgeous and shines it glints in the light it curls in on itself and the stinger goes into your wrist you take two points of damage poison resistant nice you take one point and you have a small red hole bleeding out in your hand you're still walking down the hall what's our order by the way devan's first there's also enough room to go side by side which is-- everyone going single-file yeah who's third so you continue to walk are you looking for traps further traps sure but also make a perception check this is a crowded-- this is not your normal room all right so you're still walking forward right okay so as you're walking-- devan (whoosh) is gone hold that thought devan you are instantly submerged in water it is pitch black you can't see anything you are underwater your hands are tied behind your back you hold your breath you immediately feel multiple bites all over your body make a constitution save please 19 okay whoops that's the wrong one you feel small sharp teeth biting on every inch of your body your neck your face your hands everywhere biting through your clothes you feel a burning sensation under your skin in your blood and you take five points of poison damage you can't see what's going on you kick and start to panic you can't tell which way is up you can't tell which way is down you guys she's been gone for 30 seconds nothing happens around you there were bone needles there were bells there were creepy as fuck paintings there's an ostrich with a little spike helmet on his head one was a lake 45 seconds have passed what's your constitution modifier laura what water there's no water okay make a perception check okay nothing you pull the painting off the wall and see a scrawl of arcane glyphs in a circle there no it's right parallel to where devan was yeah arcana check you are short-circuiting you're so discombobulated by this scenario-- just around this scrawl of arcana on the wall going gabba gabba gabba gabba 13 you don't know what the fuck that says (impact) ow that's when you hear at the end of the hall in this hall you're in in addition to all this shit there's six doors all the way down you've barely even paid attention to them because of all the stuff that's in here you've already passed a set of doors behind you and then there's another two and another two all the way at the end of the hall and at the end of the hall on the right behind the closed door you hear (impact) okay you two are bolting down the red carpet they all have the same turn-latch door handle that the original doors do and you get to the door and freeze for a second as soon as you touch the door handle electricity goes up your arm dexterity save on that you take only five points of electricity damage so you've just been electrocuted by the door handle but the door does open and you hold your hand you look in the room is somewhat lit from the lights behind you and you see a large 20-feet-tall cube of glass a fish tank and inside it you can see a form going-- okay everybody roll initiative 20 okay what about you gentlemen okay all right so devan the fish continue to bite in a second you can make another con save all right take eight more points of poison damage okay delweth you are up you guys are here this is so stupid there's a fish tank in here you guys are looking at delweth you're up what would you like to do do what against the fish tank acid sure you throw it you don't even have to do anything your hand goes and a globule goes (splash) and starts to sizzle down the sides of this glass roll 1d6 okay it seems to be very thick and now it is dren's turn go for it sure hit the shit out of that fish tank no ten okay devan you may try to do something good well done what about the hand motions though that's what one of the other ones is i see v s m next to chromatic orb verbal i forget what they stand for but one is-- components one is verbal and then one is doing this stuff you can make a dexterity check at disadvantage nope tarvis you're up okay you swim your way-- some light has shined through once that door opened out there although you can't really tell why the light's coming you swim towards light you get over there tarvis you're up roll don't roll a one all right you hit it yeah okay the glass goes (glass cracking) it holds no okay rat you're up you were so you're there okay actually nobody should have gotten there but it's okay it's all right she's half-fucked anyway what would you like to do no you're not because you were futzing with the painting so we'll say you were the last one in okay we're now back-- no we're not make a constitution save ten is not going to do it three points of poison damage all right now we're at the top delweth roll to attack i'm sure you'll hit it that hits it's got a very low armor class okay so you run up with your thin little sword and go ugh oh fuck this and you turn it around and go (impact) into the side of the glass (glass cracking) and a little bit of water starts spilling out near the bottom devan-- no dren-- you do sure if you have an idea yeah yes yes okay a piece breaks out and water starts spilling out it's very tall tarvis it's your turn oh sorry devan's turn devan's turn yes make a dex save you spent your whole action going-- so you get a bonus action okay there's a big (splash) as water slaps together and a drenched coughing pale-skinned veins going down her neck devan appears on the ground between you and you yeah you also take your hilt and (glass breaking) yeah all over her fish are hitting the ground flapping around on the ground yeah you've actually never been in this room in this room have a look around if you'd like perception check please okay you perception all the slowly dying beautiful but poisonous fish in here and look around the room is empty except for this fucking thing you don't see anything else roll and i'll tell you if you can yes oh you mean feed it to her oh yeah sure so what happens is dren crouches down and slowly pours it in and then when she feels like someone's looked she goes (slaps) across the face never again well it's all on your character sheets it depends on which one you gave her you guys have one superior and two greater the big hitter is 8d4 plus eight the two smaller are 4d4-- doesn't matter i like the idea of this elf and this half orc singing (laughter) and devan you've never been in the room you're in but looking out the door of the room you're in you see across the hall a circular siggle so you hold your hand there and blood someone else's blood smears on you wait and you wait and that ain't doing shit three feet do you cast the spell you can cast that cantrip okay so it takes a little bit of time 20-30 seconds held up hoisted in the air by an elf assassin with your hand bleeding out click the wooden door opens outward and you look in and see a very well-lit room a round room perfectly round the walls are made up of curved segments of dark burnished metal the walls go up about 30 feet before curving in and up very high it's almost like you're in the inside of a silo you guys cased this joint from the outside there is a bit of a tower on this side of it this has got to be that four of those golden orbs are hanging and lighting up this room you look up it goes very high you can see down here and it gets darker and darker the higher you go you can't see the peak across from where you entered made out of the same metal is a pair of flat doors with the same circle printed into the metal like a cabinet directly across nothing in here the floor is also metal in the center of the room is a smaller circle that's about a foot and a half wide and it's got a spiraling out flower shape there's the room that she took you to this is room where your grandmother showed you how to create illusions and how to pull moisture from the air to create shards of ice and use them roll for insight i'm going to call it for her she appears flustered and a bit of a doofus but she seems like she's telling the truth a foot and a half wide sure hold that thought are you willing to touch it at all it's not like an etching like that circular sigil of a shrew over there it does seem to be made out of more than one piece it's not a decoration but that's all you can tell what's your formation in here by the way who's where who's got the gambling addict where are you dren here the cabinet doors are right here dexterity check but you can still make a sleight of hand check oh sleight of hand yes sleight of hand at disadvantage got to roll it again okay i'm going to say delweth you were staring up trying to assess what was happening up top you get her hands free at that moment all of you hear the sound of some sort of clank very high high above you and behind you dren all of you but you especially hear (metal slamming) and you look over your shoulder and metal barriers or doors or something have suddenly slammed shut there's a thin seam between the two you guys are in here and that's when you hear not in your ears at the base of your skull inside your skull not supposed to be here dogs dogs dogs and then you hear way high at the apex of this tower a chime ding (multiple fwooshing sounds) puffs of sparkling white and purple smoke (fwoosh) to one side to the other side around you suddenly you're looking at four smoking misty almost-hairless dogs angry looking slobbering three of a certain size one much larger staring at you with glassy milky white eyes it's big it's muscular it's ropey and they bare their teeth okay okay roll for initiative everybody hold that thought everybody 13 is what you rolled dren okay okay 16 okay roll initiative for me too devan 18 all right then you are the first one to go ooh doo-loo-loo-loo okay the idea flashes into your mind what to do you start to move your hands the dogs lunge in on all of you the first one-- oh hey this music's too chill this dog comes running toward you and bites into your arm maybe what's your ac 11 yes its teeth sink into your arm as you start to cast and you take oh just two points of damage and the spell is gone yeah i'm going to say it was so close this is within six seconds of each other that's gone this dog rushes does the same thing for you obby what's your armor class you feel teeth sink into your thigh and you take five points of piercing damage this dog goes (whoosh noise) and is gone (whoosh noise) he is right behind you delweth and what's your armor class you feel teeth sink into your gut on the side you take three points of piercing damage and the big one (snarling noise) lunges in to attack you tarvis and you feel teeth sink into the back of your calf and take five hit points in piercing damage tears away and you feel part of your calf come away devan you may try something else sure i don't know if your grandmother qualifies as an object object within range i'll let you do something else okay all right where's it going this is your second level one right yeah yeah make a ranged spell attack okay go for it okay oh man it's on your sheet on page number two it is plus six on ranged attacks ten okay a ball of crackling energy goes (whoosh noise) misses the dog entirely goes (impact noise) ricochets like a pinball off the side of the wall and arcs up and then (impact noise) diffuses high up in the air you can still move if you want delweth yeah where you going to go over here you're going to walk there or run there dart under her legs okay you start to move under the dog behind you sees you go and-- what's your armor class 11 yeah bites into your back and you feel part of your robes rip away and you take five points of piercing damage and you get over here okay oh so you're sharing the space with her okay okay and now it is tarvis' turn what would you like to do you need boots of haste and the feat dual wielding to do that yeah okay all right roll to hit yes it does yes yeah from obby i mean this fixes that 18 you pull out the blade the curved blade and it sort of sings as you spin it in the air and bring it down in a slice and it cuts into the ribs of this dog and the dog yelps loud and sort of buckles down for a bit and has murder in its mouth and its blind eyes what was the total on that 18 looks like it all right now it is dren's turn you can do that plus your attack roll got to be six seconds of dialogue though you do have sneak attack on this one if you throw something yeah or use your crossbow sure six more seconds to decide it okay go for it ah yeah that hits ah yes it is because of the crowd here eight okay 14 math in my head all right great and that was which weapon your shortsword okay you squat down almost do a little ballerina split and then stick your sword up into its gut from underneath and the dog goes (yelp of pain) underneath and snarls through and now we're on to- yes you do you're going to go here you can do that you're tiny too yeah you can get through-- where do you want to go here yeah i'll say you can do that because of how small you are and how big he is okay so you start to run and this dog that you stabbed sees you running sees your back and lunges at it but you're too quick and it goes (noise of jaws snapping shut) as you slide underneath tarvis' legs pop out here at the end of your turn delweth you are up all right oh i do it what's your spell dc it's the numbers near the top of your-- fails 1d12 two okay plus nothing but that noxious odor-- no sneak attack but it floats into this old blind bastard's face and goes (choking and snarling) and it's blind but it looks in your direction and snarls did you want to do anything else you're going over this way all right as you go this dog who's biting people's backs today sees you go and a little tip to all you newer players-- oh you disengaged you're right yeah you go (blip noises) great thank you thank you thank you for that and now we are on to obby the rat yeah that hits and you have sneak attack damage on this i'm even going to say you have advantage on-- well you already hit though right oh my god you come in low with your knife and stick it in right under one of its legs and then slide all the way down the length of its body and you see one noodle of intestine go (splurting noise) out the side of it want to do anything else make a dexterity check it glances off of this thing it wasn't a natural 20 right it glances off of it that is the time when in the back of your brain you hear (gurgling noises) delweth you freaking out look up and see a bulbous green-- slowly down out of the tower in a fucking weird sight i don't know what the fuck this is something coming down (gurgling noises) and give me one moment please delweth i need you to make a constitution save right now okay you guys see a ray of blackish-gray light go (thrumming sound) down from the ceiling and cut along the floor right past you but you slide back against the wall and it misses you just in time and now it is time for the dogs so this one turns towards devan and snaps angrily but devan scared to death freaks out and does this and it misses because of it (laughter) what's your armor class dren i'm so sorry but you take five points of piercing damage as the teeth sink into the bottom of your sword arm obby this dog lunges right at you and you feel it get up under your neck and bite right here at your shoulder and you take five points of piercing damage-- that's your armor class i take it back you push its head up and it's going (biting sounds) and you shove it off it rolled a 15 thank you for that i didn't remember that your armor class was so high and this one rushes at our half-orc commander but it's so fucked up and so sad now it blindly misses you and now it is devan's turn which way do you want to go this way you can scoot under her legs or-- i'm going to do this one time i'm going to remind you that both of these dogs get an opportunity attack this is the last time i'm going to remind any of you motherfuckers what's your movement you want to go straight across no you won't make it all the way across i'd say you'd make it to about there or there i'll say you're here so you could get these two and i'll say you won't get tarvis what's your spell dc i have it it's 14 okay little guy makes his save big guy does not so what's your damage she puts her thumbs together and fans her fingers out

and you bring it up and you swing it and you're so short you push up and it's the smallest dog in the group and you spear it like a shish kabob and blood and guts spills down over your hands and it slumps down to the ground (gurgling) the hand pries and walks around like a little spider pulls and pulls and it's the saddest little thing and it turns around and goes yep it still exists your hand is still there your hand starts floating in that direction i'll say nah yeah but you did some stuff already you already cast a spell you know what you do you kick the ground in anger and go aww and now it is-- nope she's pressed against the wall she's right up against the wall you'll get yours obby you're up you didn't even have to rhyme but you still did you called that out as you ran to the center of the room at this moment you have the time to go oh fuck and that's what you accomplish go for it roll to attack the dagger goes (whooshing impact) and you hear (gurgling) roll for damage all right a little bit of ichor splatters back down on your face as you look up okay it rotates in space and looks down at you obby and please make a wisdom saving throw five a ray shoots straight down into your eyes and you go slack and think of colors and that is where you're at and now it is time for-- and now it is devan's turn you do you can so far it's taken about 20 to 30 seconds to do that and a round is six seconds that's your last-- two more okay all right make a ranged attack you did two burning hands so ranged attack with a plus six on your roll what kind was it sure go for it man that sounds pretty good you hit yeah 22 okay this crackling ball with little arcs of light spitting out of it flies up hits the thing (explosion) the thing spins out of kilter down lower-- shite aw shite i don't have the right boxes i'm going to say he's right there it spins end over end and starts to right himself and hover right about there nice okay okay yes you can do that roll for stealth okay i heard that question and i'm ignoring it tarvis it is your turn you could've done it but it would've been at disadvantage now i'll say it is not that's as close as you can get chuck it baby the blood from the whip cut is down in your eye and you can't see you see two of these things and you got the illusionary one you got that one but not the real one your dagger hits the ground and clatters and actually spins right down to the ground by you and now it is dren's turn you can get one two three where do you want to go here you could get (counting) that's as close as you can get you're teensy-weensy you hit man eight the crossbow bolt sinks into the side of its main eye and juice comes out you hear the most-- i'm not even going to try to do it because i had a rough warrior day today yelling for four hours-- the most high-pitched squeal in the side of your own mind and the thing lurches and stays up but is gushing out of its large eye in the front and now it is delweth's turn it's about 40 feet 50 you can throw 20 feet well and you can throw 60 feet at disadvantage so you could throw where you are at disadvantage or you could run closer that's not what that's for but you can do it at disadvantage or your dagger okay roll an attack with your dagger you pull a dagger out of your belt you take it by the blade and flick it and-- how do you want to do this (cheering) well it always had four one was limp and hanging and loosey-goosey-- it had one big eye in the front which dren gouged the side of most of it's there okay the thing has just gotten hit in the eye and bounced against the wall and starts to float back in the other direction and it slowly starts to float downward its ability to hold itself up weakening and weakening and it lands slowly on top of tarvis falling asleep on him almost dying lowers you down to the ground on the back slowly and you're okay you didn't get hurt but here you are on the ground with a beholder junior sitting on your junk yes yes he is he starts to shake his head while you guys are talking you hear down the hall-- (barking) oh the cabinet okay okay so you already cut your hand-- you break open your hand and place it and you wait and slowly blood pours into it gets absorbed in the cabinet doors swing open and you're looking in at a cabinet you've never seen this before you've seen the doors and your grandmother
