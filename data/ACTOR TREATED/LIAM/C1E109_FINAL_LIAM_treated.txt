sure so taliesin and i have been working on something for about a year with around 89 artists from our community it's been a glimmer in our eye for over a year and it is almost here we're going to be releasing in the fall from the geek & sundry store a critical role art book (cheering) you guys know what a crucial part of this community the artists have become and we have selected 89 artists from many more there wasn't enough-- pages are limited do i have a page number on here we've seen it and it is beautiful there's going to be a deluxe edition and a standard edition it will be available for sale in the geek & sundry store in the late fall published by hunters books yeah this is not your basic go the cvs store and get a photo book made a lot of love and care went into this we've been talking with artists for months and months a lot of blood sweat and tears have gone into this we're very grateful to the artists who are involved some of them are in this audience tonight thank you (cheering) why's this small man on the sistine chapel (laughter) vecna's amish taint (laughter) that's a great question are you still embiggened right now i did say that it's rather personal though i hope the rest of you can understand that i'm not going to be around for much longer so i wanted to say-- no we'll find a minute it's awkward it's not something i'm comfortable talking with-- no we can talk out a plan tonight before we go to bed it could be now it could be later i take grog by the arm and i usher him out the door of the mansionyeah just out the front door is it on fire fuck it grog let's go downstairs yeah and i ignore all of the cat-calling and all of the sniping and all of the shittiness these fucking assholes that's what grog is for big man i'm not going to be around much longer probably or you're not going to be around much longer one or the other yeah boy i've been holding on to a thing for a while now taryon that scamp gave me a gift ages ago he became a fan after i pranked his ass at the beach he caught the bug and before we said our goodbyes he talked to me for a bit and gave me something right i've got to talk simpler sorry that's my mistake taryon gave me a very unique item and the purpose of it was to fuck with you (cheering) anyway he wanted me to pull a prank on you and we have a lot of history with that and i held onto it for a long time looking for a time that felt right and it never happened and sometimes i felt like i didn't want to do that anymore but i don't want to let his gift go to waste and truth be told i did a bit of research on it it is a love potion grog (gasping and cheering) lasts about an hour (laughter) so i was right to assume then yeah we're not all so limited but that's your thing that's fine i can't even use it on you but i've got it and i'm going to miss you i'll be gone soon i don't even know if we have time a lot of us could be dead soon but i'm not offering you this thing but i'm offering you an experience (cheering) i don't know if we have time for this but maybe for old time's sake because i love you and i know you love me and we share this in common i thought maybe we could prank scanlan together (cheering) yeah it could be tonight here's what i don't have i don't have a plan i think he just needs to down it one way or another it could be mixed with something else it could be on its own well originally i was thinking maybe we could have a bet and see which one of us he falls in love with (laughter) so that means isolating the gnome away from the others because he could fall in love with literally anything or anyone i'm not sure i know what that means but i will carry this baton and follow your lead we'll call that plan a plan b will be that you grab his ass and i just shove it in (laughter) hey what are you guys talking about we are we are close i start examining my fingernails and moving closer to scanlan (laughter) oh that wine looks really good here let me hold your drink 29 that was inspiration to me 39 i instantly dive and grab keyleth's eyes and cover them and turn her away sorry philter of love i can recite it for you if you like the next time you see a creature within ten minutes after drinking this philter you become charmed by the creature for one hour if the creature is of a species and gender you are normally attracted to-- turducken-- you regard it as your true love while you are charmed this potion's rose-hued effervescent liquid contains one easy-to-miss bubble shaped like a heart one hour guys this is all besides the point we have a god to kill what are we going to do about the god i want to step outside the game for a second to say that sam riegel gave me a bullet to kill travis willingham with and i have turned the gun back on sam riegel (cheering) time we don't have a lot of time so what are we going to do with it are we going to get allies are we going to talk to allura again gilmore i don't know in here i need to shove my head out the door for a sec 24 am i able to feel gradual coming towards where we are away anything like that we've sent messages to tary and to who else there were two messages sent i think we'll all feel better after a night's sleep yeah as everybody's trundling up the stairs i catch grog alone for a second and say let this stand as a testament to how much i love you i'm sorry that i shaved your beard give him a little pinch on the cheek oh grog you couldn't if you tried now good night big guy by the way when everyone asks me tomorrow on social media why i did it same answer why don't i go see how much progress he's made and i stick my skull out the door again and see how far he's gotten very good 30 yeah they would assume we drowned yeah it could be to pass over their house he's bearing down on us we need to tell pike we need to warn the authorities we need to tell the temple of bahamut the slayer's take he's coming one way or another (shouting) pike thank you how much do you know already i am the paladin of the raven queen they all look similar she has granted me knowledge of his whereabouts and he is coming fast i think that would look better on your middle finger darling what a piece of shit be priests of vecna marisha and no i think that's a good idea (sizzling) and i start pushing whisper slowly show it to us how does it look the druids are dropping us off at the base of the mountain we don't really know where either of those things are in my opinion the gods are generally bored and looking for things to do so you percy want to go burn them up we have a cleric it's all or nothing pickle you're shielding them my begging has to count as well (laughter) yeah that's right she tron'd those motherfuckers are you telling me we're going to have to crawl into another monster's asshole is that what you're saying allura it is so good to see you we need advice we need help there you go when we fought vecna he threw us around like ragdolls he held us he did whatever he wanted do you have any way any thing any suggestion for helping us avoid his grasp again because if it went the way it went the last time we are fucked right out of the gate what was that he was able to hold us magically thank you (singing) stay alive and if he has any trinkets that lend freedom of movement we'll place an order tell him we say hi but are we trying to take out potential additional forces you know it's like when you take a duck and you put it inside a chicken and then you put the chicken inside a turkey or do we each need to deliver the one tied to our gods also yeah five more minutes raven mom five more minutes they are so fucking badass scanlan is important scanlan should have two also karma is a thing and i really want to balance the scales we've got a long road of history you and i best buds best buds met at big apple anime fest in new york city all those years ago (whispers) they know what does my vec-dar tell me shit we guessed wrong well we don't know where this shit is that we're looking for passed over fuck quickly please someone come up with an argument that counteracts that we'll learn something it's all right it's just our small group here no one's watching you know us oh man eight the final miniature is just matt and his name is larkin (laughter) i said we're going to have to shadow of colossus this shit yeah maybe we crawl up its butthole and kill the things inside my brain's on vecna not on the city is vecna doing a ride-along is he still moving in the same direction (scared bear noises) do i feel vecna riding on this guy's
