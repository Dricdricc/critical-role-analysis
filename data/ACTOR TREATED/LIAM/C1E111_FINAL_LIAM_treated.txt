i was troy baker's fluffer it's prestigious i'm in the first one the thing i killed two weeks ago that was me you play a sword they scare you so bad that even when it's official i'm like i'm in the-- i hope you like hearing the word ranger liam travis and we missed an opportunity to put backblaze on that back brace (groaning) no next time you show up ten minutes after we start you leave an hour before we end the game every week looks fucking awesome the writing is awesome the art is awesome it's coming out with the dlc for middle earth expedite i'm going to do my due diligence and scoot a little ahead of everybody and start looking for traps or anything hinky did anybody see that guy nobody asked me about him that clearly undead cannibal dwarf eating flesh as i saw it so problem solved we're on a time table yeah are we going to take a little 20-minute breather here we're doing the vox machina thing and standing around like a bunch of dumb fucks trying to figure out what to do i'm going to attune the deathwalker's ward to necrotic damage oh i don't know is like a headlamp yeah okay i'll put this away she's kind of canadian already come on yo up front looking for traps 20 feet yeah i turn around and look at her and go all right you're stage-whispering and that's very easy to hear i love you perception check investigation for traps yeah that is a 25 it's dark up there i can only see about 60 feet up does it keep going beyond that okay i'm a punching bag for this shit why don't you all wait here a minute wait well will you go with me they're gone this could be the last time we do this come on well there's only four games left sam it's scripted (laughter) yeah i think that probably faded by now yes right we'll go 60 feet up see what we can see sure or you could stay there and i could go even further up 60 feet-- all right let's do that 29 it's corked up it's all right yeah it's blocked up with stone i guess i'd have to get a closer look to see if we could get through hand on the sides to get my way up closer to it looking for any traps get ready to catch me yes my athletics is a two but i rolled a 19 so 21 yeah we're not getting through this hey i'm not getting through this you're not maybe kiki can is there a bubble at the top maybe dive dive 30-something twins are already at the top looking for problems i'll take the lower half that's called advantage 18 for me i will look at the sconces i'm going to creep about 40 feet down the hall and continue that search every day when i'm on the crapper matt everywhere and do i need to make a extra roll to look for traps around this brazier we are the acid reflux jesus christ whoever that is i don't want to go further than roughly 60 feet away from my sister yeah so i will peep in from here i did let this shit blow up in my face so everybody hang back for a second and i'm going to pitter patter in and look around the sconce the room i love you anyway here i go slower than this titan's footfalls mirror in brass so it's an iron room right so doorway brazier mirror look at his fake innocent face going to check for traps from right here to start all right that's totally fine that's a jellyfish that is a 17 stubby come up here i have a real bad history with pushing buttons (sighs) so we've got buttons if something stupid is going to happen here i don't want it to be on me alone for once so we've got an unlit brazier there's mirror over there and buttons yeah i thought that as well can we get your hub up here please jesus i catch her wrist just a second you two do the thinking all right and i take a step into the room what do i do i scoop some ash lady of the grey hunt here i scoop up some ash and i pour it into her hands look at that face you are not lying that's it yeah just quarters heads up heads down i pull off my belt and say hello simon wake him up hi gosh it's been a while that's right go check out the mirror simon all right off you go i dart back one step out of the room as it happens that's on the list simon buddy crawl up the brazier wrap around it go up to the top there's two buttons low down oh man the nostalgia here all right buddy i take two steps back away from the door buddy buds will you go push those low buttons in the room there's two right there's two high up and i don't think he can reach the high because he doesn't stick to walls get the one over here on the left first that's true that could be i lean over to percy i say science no i took two steps back from the door wait simon is technically a magical item so i don't think he would be harmed by anything going on in there so why don't we give it five minutes yeah yeah we've had blue balls for two weeks and it's all coming out now simon come here buddy (gasps) he's a magical item oh but he could have turned back into a belt he would come to me percy jeepers creepers perception check 29 okay i'll get that in a minute i'm thinking having no knowledge of magic that we either want to somehow push all four of these buttons at once as my sister said or light this brazier or both a way to get through that only the creator would know how to use listen all of you or i are going to be dead very soon are you sure you want to be that sarcastic right now so you are impervious to being set on fire or burned press all four buttons at once although we've got at least three sharpshooters-- please stand by how many people at home do you think have figured this out already did you use your ascot and i'm going to start blowing around the mirror yeah the last time i wanted you to do it on your own but i think we're pressed for time how long does your unseen servant last how long an hour ten minutes well i have this jar it's an oil of etherealness you could potentially be standing in here but not be in here lasts an hour though same time gap as your friend you could stand in here and not be in here i'm pretty sure it's up up down down left right left right a b a b (singing) scanlan man scanlan man does whatever a scanlan can makes a guy pushes buttons scanlan man-- i'm out also what about shooting the button or firing an arrow at a button we do have three trammels he's like a kids in the hall character not cool man not cool the last episode of the third campaign will be a door that we do not open can we see i meant where we are are we in pitch black i've got a dagger out pike says that's actually right and i'm going to scoot 40 feet up the stairs and look as i go for traps one i'm taking it but i'm still going and looking for traps does that oversee ones because i've been counting ones as ones for a long time okay well we wrongly assumed that ones and 20s were king but no that's an 18 my one is an 18 now okay but i'm only going to go 40 feet in advance that's like ten fucked rolls of mine from the past 30 games anyway i love it but do you remember when we were at home and we'd go six weeks without playing and we'd spend 45 minutes trying to remember what we did how the rules worked what our names were who you were 40 feet in advance i am that is an 18 anyway yeah i appreciate it as i go and i look for traps love it that's an 18 and is it like where i killed that motherfucker they were built into the cliff face right i want to confirm an intuition and use my last divine sense and feel undead 60 feet speaking into the earrings they're all behind me i think we're in a more populous place with the undead cannibals know what i mean there's a very large cavern in here and a lot of room we're on a schedule here i'll wait obviously nothing's going to explode on my friends so they catch up with me everything we were told is that this place is full of undead cannibals is there any movement because there's bioluminescent shit on the walls in here so there's a little bit of light right yeah 26 a second thing i want to look for is what other exits from this gigantic cavern ways through up yeah you looked but i didn't look i don't think we want to stay here-- find another exit yeah but where right what's your plan you expect us to come up with a plan to explain why your gloves are connected to that temple and you're going to get what a mighty morphin power ranger bonus for doing so yeah are they still dildoing on your fingers we're moving towards vasselheim now i'm negative on our chances of dealing with this before vasselheim but that's the goal right i'm pulling percy aside i hear you but this is a city that has existed here for a long time vecna didn't create this city vecna doesn't own these people this is a fucking mountain that existed and now they're going for a ride what do these people have to do with vecna no and vecna's just a user this place was just sitting there he lifted it up and took it away these assholes don't have anything to do with-- percy this shitbird has appeared like three times wherever we were yeah he's 110 miles out from vasselheim at this point i'm also going to put something on the table here we're trying to save vasselheim but we're also trying to save the world we might not be able to do this without recharging before vasselheim no but we're trying to save the world not just a city what if we lose the fight scanlan then who fucking cares vasselheim is gone westruun is gone kaylie is gone everything's fucking gone if we fuck this up i hate the idea but i'm the stealthiest motherfucker in this room everybody but keyleth the boys all die the girls go to glory i yank the druid in for a kiss 40 feet in advance vax walks ahead of the group hating himself here we go i'm checking for enemies hiding 34 but that's a lot of good 29 can we put the goliath on the carpet so he doesn't kick something or be himself i know that but he's a big blundering mother fucking asshole when he wants to be-- and they're to the right or the left or ahead of us go left jenga jenga jenga can we put grog on the carpet now we've got a little bit of business a little bit of activity ahead of us so we want to curve to the left what's the distance oh shit pickle walks forward and takes a knee and waits with her holy symbol of sarenrae waiting for them vax does the same watching his badass sister and pike waits to turn whatever's left of them so what happens first yeah she's waiting until she sees them so she's waiting until they're within range of her holy abilities that's a good question because i'm a rogue paladin (sighs) goddamn it what if i look in the sorceror rules 30 feet so she's waiting for the twins to do their work and anything that's left over she's going to scatter 25 31 natural 20 i'm after my sister she talked before i did oh and we go first so it's advantage sneak attack hits the first time we connect right so then that one's gone okay so paladin action-action and my bonus action so that's the first of three the last one's the one that was a critical hit so the second one goes onto the next whole skeleton it's just an eight okay and then the last critical hit which is whisper again because it bamfed back is two plus eight is ten two and three it's not that much it's 15 total i've already said it but she's whispering to me to hold she's half of pike right now you're half of pike right now pike holds breathing hard looking at them coming on we still have pass without trace you're the doctor keep your patients on the run 37 by the way is it ready to go though is it ready to go though do we have any sense of where we started in this giant cavern or are we totally fucking turned around oh all the way on the other side i thought it was central so it's pressed against the opposite wall of this big place is that light you talked about coming from one specific source or all over the place every window from down below but what are our options if that doesn't work i want to do that if that doesn't work i can click the boots and i can be there in a heartbeat and run but what do we do next this goes back to my conversation with you which is are we going to find a pocket and rest agreed but we're talking about vasselheim and is damage to vasselheim a sacrifice needed to be ready to do what's necessary so we're talking about no rest i'm not talking about a short rest not without him spilling into vasselheim yeah that's right my wings are gone there's no wings for vecna unless we rest it's fine i still have the boots just the wings it was death or wings i chose wings but wait where are we going though if we get this thing we have no verification of an exit or a hole or anything that's my entire life but this is the last moment we have a plan for getting the crystal just not how to get the fuck out scanlan only with the boots (singing) don't worry be happy now how close are the pursuers i'm throwing 29 i rolled a 77 for mine i do i can say things to her i can see i'm looking for gaps or holes or anything in the ceiling of this cavern or anywhere to get out matt you see entrances to homes that are built into the sides 27 vax is trying to appreciate his last ride no way i'm not going to stop fuck you all every game until the end motherfuckers this is what's up did you say the hole is a natural gap in the cave or does it look made is it faster than my heartbeat slower it's like a hunk at the natural history museum of minerals i'm going to do that she looked at the eclipse too what if it stops this thing where it stands we're all thinking that this thing could be its heart it's not evil it's not good it could be the thing that's keeping these undead moving i like the spiking idea i think that you should let me squish it because if that blows up-- we spent ten minutes getting this thing on it 27 yeah not locked can i use my finger skills to see if it's locked just my finger skills i made a perception check to see if it's trapped wouldn't i know if it's locked i'm going to try to sidestep this lock with my lock-picking skills travis and there's nothing to do quick glance in the crates check them out i eat some edamame that was the first crate what's the next crate is it whoopee cushions healing potions are blue for toilet diving i give one of them to percy for being so sharp i give one to my sister you don't need it i keep one no i don't i'm barely alive i give one to scanlan 30 to 40 feet in advance 28 for stealth she's coming i hide that's what i do we don't recognize faces we don't see faces i will follow my sister's lead if she attacks one i send one to another one and two to the third one two three yeah 27 on my first 27 19 25 oh really okay the first is sneak attack you are the most powerful person at this table i got 48 on my first but that's it 48 done 48 20 ten that's the critical that's the dice damage i rolled really low may i also dump some poison into the first one i did one into my first target and two into the second the poison would have gone into the second person it's a dc of 15 so nothing right balls initiative yeah odell i just know we've heard it that's not our way not good for pike get that long range get that runner i'm not fast 13 pike clocked in at four yeah where's the remix of this song so this wall of force visually is floor to ceiling yes it is ghosts shadows there's ten different kinds of things like that fuck come on they're both out of visual range right one's in a pillar and one went through a wall are they moaning and shit in the wall i can't hear them can't see them can't hear them all right thanks here's what i'm going to do i'm going to dance through to here where i can see grog and these guys and i can see all my friends here and i'm going to hold my action to attack anyone who comes right up to one of my friends within striking range you got glitter-bombed with holy goodness i think the cultist shits his pants and his brain explodes i think that's in the book also if you get out of range of vex vecna knows all no he's grappled it's a higher level no he did what scanlan does with counterspell he beefed it up so about that long rest (singing) i want you to be alive liam and boom i attack sneak attack on the one near keyleth all right 27 on that guy okay so that is three plus three is six so ten (counting) 34 for the first hit and i have the second paladin attack so if it's not dead i will attack again that is eight for the second when is pike is it her turn no okay for clarification that is the one i hit as well right oh pike hit the other one fucking hell i'm going to do the same thing except i'm going to move to here and wait for something to attack one of my friends i know it is that's what i do i'm waiting until one of them attacks one of my friends one of the undead i can't do anything about that that's what i'm doing that's my turn stupid i know that's what vax does you're vex it took 425 hours but we did it we broke his brain it's eight plus proficiency bonus plus her spell bonus do you know many hobbits i have under my cloak that's what he gets for profiling i bet your spell is 120 feet sam is it thaumaturgy because that's right where your eyes are you can move what about long-range shit man bigby's hand him grab him that's just some dude from sea org in a bathrobe punch him i get to attack i've been holding when you hold does bonus action carry over i rolled an 18 and a one okay so sneak attack one 39 for the second attack back to the belt how's the ball doing sis come up to where scanlan is so i can go a little further ahead yeah i give her whisper i'm standing as far from vex as i can but i can't go much farther because obviously-- yeah also we can have pickle talk to one of these arseholes matthew mcconaughey is going to reach out of it for you so did you want me to talk to one of these guys were you kidding are you really in the explorers stop the game all i'm thinking is i could come up and do lay on hands and heals but i'm like you made your bed lie in it wait a second though god i don't know what this will do i have a spell called zone of truth a creature that enters the spell's area for the first time if it fails that's right no they don't an affected creature is aware of the spell and can thus avoid answering questions to which it would normally respond with a lie so it could avoid the questions but they have to answer the questions because of the other spell unable to lie and with pike's spell-- laura and charisma saving throw against my spell save dc which is not huge 16 i like it what has vecna got cooking he might not know everything how long does it take for keyleth to pee shit so can anyone drag him down on his roll to save or boost me does anyone have a cantrip okay all right let's do it well first zone of truth then pike red robe seemed more fancy red robe did she tried to cast speak with dead dumbfuck vecna is in these motherfuckers' brains
