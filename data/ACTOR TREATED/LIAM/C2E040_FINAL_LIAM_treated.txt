(as mickey mouse) ha ha i'm kylo ren ha ha (as mickey mouse) ooh sorry dad (air hissing) (as kylo ren) i have come from a galaxy very far away to talk to you about tor books tor books is america's largest-- (laughter) listen to him again he has a very subtle brooklyn accent always i did one time yes he was great it was a great project i love star wars i'm dressed as him (laughter) oh the burn but only from the fire burns deep down that rabbit hole for years oh my god i liked playing with you never won but i enjoyed the process amazing we're going to time change again here jet lag absolutely destroyed any gain we got also lots of love to kit buss who's a good friend of the show and a good friend of ours and it was so cool meeting you guys from all over the fucking planet man amazing (deep voice) hey how you doing we just need to wait this out we killed all the creatures how many eyes do i have right now because it feels like i have three of them that's good whoa oh yeah hey you guy how come you did not do anything it was pretty touch-and-go do you want to sit back and stay safe and then get eaten i am really not myself right now three eyes each one is an onyx stone are you reading anything off of all of the eyes that i am seeing those stones question do the eyes in this picture bear any resemblance to the tattoos i spied through the window when i eavesdropped through frumpkin on fjord and avantika's conversation very much so okay und amber for the three eyes on the head or every single time you described the first group looked humanoid no strange features just arms legs head but for the second one with the serpent they're a little weird also the three figures on each wall are they standard humanoid form is there any writing of any kind am i able to read it with the comprehend languages that should still be cooking because it's an hour-long spell come on dice be good to me no that is a 17 wait fjord can i talk to you for a second before you go down there there is-- the pillars are covered when i do the shield-- when i cover myself and put the shield-- the columns have that in them yeah but it's protection it's holding something in or holding something back we know what that thing is with the yellow eyes but what is the tapeworm they are picking the lock on this safe maybe they might need three there's two of three i'm eyeing jamedi as i say that presumably just two of three as long as it's just one maybe fjord is thinking better of it i'm grabbing nott by the scruff and dragging her up the stairs okay weren't there spiral stairways can we see to the ceiling of this chamber eyes up make a perception you said 15 yeah it's stuck up there ja so the fountain lowered but nott is trapped inside-- wait we're in the chamber we're all inside there i'm going to cast dancing lights and send four globules up around the roof so that everyone can see everything perfectly wait i cast enlarge on caduceus so he's twice his size double the size ja yeah caduceus hold fjord's hand fjord hold his hand you got it travis and i cast reduce and now he is half his size oh they're gone then because enlarge reduce none of that was like a melee attack or anything because your damage is reduced since you're teeny seven over here as well i'm sorry dante could you please describe the-- where everyone is physically the enemies and us just so i can see it in my head a bit better yeah also the trapdoor-- ah ja son of sparta the trapdoor into this place was like a metal grate wasn't it not fully-- like there were holes was it a metal grate or was it solid yeah but not like metal with holes for the water to go through no it's slowly starting to sink it's a verbal spell verbal you have to speak i'll go first because i'm scared i'm going to use my air to cast expeditious retreat on myself so i too am going to spit out some air and do this in the water that doubles my speed which i can use a bonus action for dashing plus my movement i will swim up five feet and then towards the stairs that's everything i'm dead oh question matt did you move me two groups of movement because it would be for the bonus action action and movement so it'd be one more third when you cast it you get that extra juice and then bonus action on every following round thank you i have not released it yet no oh is it 'tis so it's dropped so he's regular size so i have three ways to move first way is the bonus action do i reach oxygen doing that does that get me to air so all the way to the tippy-top oh balls i'll use bonus action and movement to go as high as i can do i reach the trap door i will pull out the wire from my spell components and try to jimmy to lock oh god i don't know what to do i'm underwater yeah so i still have action so i'm going to try to open the lock straight roll oh it's so good natural 20 and a three that's a four i lost five of those hoo-has for casting a spell you said so do i need to make a constitution throw okay let's all die together 13 if there was air where beau was wouldn't there be air where caleb was i'm hasted almost and i just blasted up to the top of the temple then i would have (inhaling) then i failed the lock picking i'm taking a breath of air caleb would have just rebounded back down and swam i use bonus action if that gets me to them good if not i will use bonus action plus movement to get to them which i would assume it would get me there then i help nott i will continue to drag jester up towards the surface i cast feather fall on myself on nott on jester on beauregard and on fjord it's my last spell slot i already did it it doesn't matter it's what i did it's who i know not what hit points exist i can see that they are on all sides the people down below or are down on one side of them i'm paddling through the air towards the direction we came from drei i have keen mind i would call out exactly the right way to go i have keen mind i would know the way that would lead us towards the way we came ja that way go that way unnatural 20 yeah i would be calling out this whole time which ways we want to go to get out ja raiders of the lost ark we're just cutting through the jungle question are we under 10 minutes since we shot out the top of that pimple so i'm still sped up and i'm going to run at the front and just shout out directions and call out holes things in the ground to look out for i'm going to lead the charge okay natural 20 i see it and use the glove of blasting to fire three scorching rays three scorching rays no the glove i haven't used yeah there's three rays how do i handle this is this a skill check no i'm just waiting for nott to throwing it back at them yeah well i reacted to fluffernutter being shouted and seeing it-- so i will track it and then hit it as it struck the ground well i rolled three times because there's three rays do i use the spell modifier for this or not okay so the highest roll was a 20 and then the second highest was a 12 so probably of the three rays probably only one-- i rolled a 20 a 7 and a 12 total of 12 one i tell the group she's doing something stupid she's distracting them i have an idea but i don't want to leave her let's go i start trudging through the jungle towards the direction i think is the right one are we able to tell the direction-- where the lizardmen are in relation to nott or just yuan-ti on us i'm saying we all hear the yuan-ti or nott hears the yuan-ti coming okay but i can tell the direction nott is running or moving you've seen us we haven't seen you never mind yasha's moving towards the beach caleb's going to just start firing firebolt after firebolt at the treeline i've a 120 foot range and is going to set the jungle on fire behind us natural one it's all they had at smogschmeade one die roll man one die roll (high-pitched) i said bi-- is that super-glued on or something it was in a hurry but the type of runes that were in that chamber were one of protection some sort of ward that i don't understand it's old it shook the entire room we were in i thought maybe there were three locks down there but you only saw one presumably there are two more places in the ocean or in the world for you yeah yeah yeah she said for all of us to hear that the real reward comes from releasing the serpent is that your intentions is that what you desire so what are we doing she looks at him like a skeleton key she needs him for what she wants i doubt she would allow us to leave on any terms she needs what's in him if we want to leave we are not going to walk away we're going to sneak away she's not going to let go of you you are a key that she needs she said herself that greater things come when the serpent is released the giant god-like serpent i would ask you-- we're all here we like you and if you are being completely forthright with us we're good but if we get the slightest whiff that you are after what this woman is after-- well i can't speak for them i'm not interested in being here anymore also that boat is fucked and they could shoot us to bloody hell if they wanted to so it won't be that big of a stretch if we wanted private sleeping quarters none of us have any chance any other option but to play along what's jester doing right now yeah well you do what you have to yeah i'm exhausted she's cleaning up i've seen this film his name is captain wiggledick fade to tentacles how many points of exhaustion you succeed the check but you disappoint your dungeon master right in the blowhole aw that's a great ending that's a good finish pitiful i rolled a two so a con bonus gets me to four points up seamen seamen everywhere sam and
