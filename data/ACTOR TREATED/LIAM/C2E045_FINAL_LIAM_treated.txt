we should just get a sound cue for that at this point (like an air horn) dungeons & dragons well travis some might say that you were forward thinking ha ha oh my gosh i'm so excited i've had this idea in my head for two years two years i wanted to do it last christmas i'm mostly ready we'll see what happens it's going to be fun it's going to be so much fun if you fail it's half damage not full damage hello i hear you're trying to do a rogue action do you need to have any company below caleb starts speaking in zemnian what are we doing what are you talking about this seems rude to me what is going on zemnian he was vague about his wording at that moment that's pretty freaky too which one of these two is taller who-- what-- how-- why are you on the boat that clarifies that okay i am halfway through identify on this clockwork gizmo i was doing a ritual casting of identify as soon as the thing was in my hands and not talking to anybody what is this thing that you have what is this called does it have a name yeah did you make it did you get it from someone else in a museum or-- what's his name yeah sir cadigan that's a good name well twiggy tell me this happy fun ball of yours what does it do how much money that's a frumpkin and a half sometimes a spider and other things as well this does other things besides making money what else does this do okay 21 that would explain the money yeah can i tell how old this thing looks cheeto dust sprinkles out no i don't hear anything is it limitless does it make money all day long can you show me the one way excuse me one moment twiggy would you show me how you make money with it may i see that one more time from perfect memory i duplicate what she just did well i take them yeah i walk it over to him here you go no i don't think that's a good idea what are we going to do with this little kid and/or old lady oh no don't you dare it's an 18 yeah i'm not a happy guy (awkward forced laughter) do you have any prospects any long-term plans goals where do you see yourself in a year let alone a week from now what about kiri what about nott that's going to draw attention to us is this regular paint or the magic paint that's good 21 noted i am also worried about traveling around-- well i am not a fan of the name balleater for this boat on a similar note i feel like our new miniature friend will also draw attention maybe i'll have a chat with her get us on the same page sometimes people listen to me well it takes two to tango my palms are sweating at the moment i am going to find our little friend how long has she been doing that for bitte a moment of your time just to have a chat you can keep swinging but could you swing a little lower all of that movement is making me nervous welcome to the mighty nein it's sort of a running gag but it's our name you know if you're going to be traveling with us for a while i have a few suggestions so three the first of them is probably when we get to land it will be better if you kept a low profile because we sometimes cut a rough swathe wherever we go and i can't guarantee that someone is not familiar with us so i would hate for any danger to you know-- best not to call attention well just stick with us for a little while and see how that works out okay the second suggestion is that you should meet my cat frumpkin what's the matter oh my cat is very well trained and will not hurt your squirrel i promise i scarcely know what to do with you we'll get to the cat in a minute i will so gladly introduce you to my cat because i'm very fond of him and love for people to meet him but before we do that the third suggestion is-- and i cast suggestion-- i suggest you share any strange or unique or arcane objects or things even that are of threat with me just so i know that we are safe that's rough 16 oh how about you just sit next to me oh put that back in your pocket always i put one of my hands through their heads oh that's good yeah i'm not going to try to do that is there anything-- yeah the neatest do you have anything that is harmful or is it just those two things including your puzzle ball yeah okay well-- for what it's worth i apologize and here's my cat i turn frumpkin the first night on this boat into a cat and use the last of my supplies so it's frumpkin the cat right now that's frumpkin he is best cat of course he's already climbing up her shoulder i tell him to do a blep so he just does this-- all right you're okay you can hang out with frumpkin for an hour (laughter) i go and sit like 20 feet away and watch to make sure everything is on the up and up yeah well if she's shown me everything of arcane nature we're going to force perspective this shit (as gandalf) hello twiggy maybe three one is in fjord's gooch oh i'm very curious about it i would like very much to see if she's willing to sell it or part with it somehow i was not paying attention has anyone said how long it is until we reach land taliesin and maybe she'll lend it to me this is still the same day correct yeah hello your hour is up i need my cat back now okay maybe another day though you can see him again i'm sorry that i used arcane trickery on you may i borrow the happy fun ball for a few hours just to play with it if you want this to poop coins i don't think you should do that too much you've had it for a week oh boy oh boy okay i wander off with it to study it i rolled a 16 sometimes it takes a while for my mind to settle on truths and i'm having a hard time thinking about it right-- you know maybe i will save this for later ja well you just have to tinker with it a little bit holy cats i pick up the jade are you looking to sell this by any chance so a good trade you're talking about what about-- i'm going to throw out some ideas here i'm going to start spitballing because i'm very curious about this i love puzzles what about some sort of mystical tattoo many things i have been listening to my friend jester speak of them a lot all the time that is true this one time she watched an ant carrying a piece of bread six or seven times larger than it up stairs i've never either but i take her word for it because she's on the up and up maybe you talk to jester about a mystical tattoo that's one thing on the table you could be an honorary member of the mighty nein i do too (gasping) thank you hey you get the whole day danke schï¿½n (singing) that was a fun time good i'm short circuited from the kiss on the cheek yeah no i know it's not helping 22 no have you ever seen this before we don't see through no that is a very bad idea twiggy if you want to make that arrangement with your squirrel you are perfectly welcome but my cat is not going in that hole (foomph) for the moment something-- captain and it's traveling with the boat is there any lumber there's no oars are there any rifles left on this boat or anything long yeah rope is there rope let me borrow that i'm flustered i start lowering rope down in maybe five or six feet and i pull it back out i don't know that it's fine there's a hole to nowhere in the middle of the boat that came out of happy fun ball what do you call this thing laura and no i am not going to put my hand in there i mean at the very least we need to put a plank of wood over this so that nobody falls into it fjord first mate beauregard i'm glad you're here i want to introduce you to the new honorary member of the mighty nein yep the bigger the better i will say what we have learned on all our travels on the ocean is the days are long and you have to make your own fun it's getting more pokey less smooth and spherical does this thing every day sort of shrink back in on itself or do you ever slide it back together or has it been getting more complex over time oh okay it took me a few minutes to-- oh okay to press-- oh (clicks) you could have been decapitated doing that keen mind nah it's a minute are you readied what did you see could you see beauregard let me see this but it's on the coat yeah it's the coat it is boots and the third thing was-- it's a vault here hold this i give her the doohickus and i say i need 30 minutes i gather up all this stuff and i walk with it very happily i also use an additional ten minutes to touch the coat and cast comprehend languages on this see if it says anything matt and well we have just robbed halas old magic natural one just roll with it though okay are you ready eins zwei drei (click) which i am memorizing yeah sure somebody come on three rollers were you in this ball what did he look like why don't you all take ten steps back and we'll see what this next hinge does oh investigation for it yeah investigation 21 i would give me the advantage probably oh shit i'm at plus eight yeah sure remember that sphere i cast mage armor there's no entrances or exits 13 yeah i have it danke the lightning came out of here did any of his friends get out hey man you let strength be the dump stat i have an idea i can make a magical hut that nothing can pass through i am going to begin to take the minute to cast leomund's tiny hut in the center of the room it's a ten-foot radius and everyone is allowed to enter and exit absolutely but i have to stay in the center of it where it is safe you can stick your hand through the barrier and cast mage hand and pull back in yeah this is impervious to-- yeah we'll get there we can experiment because this is impervious it cannot come in here oh hours that is a good point although i have a decent supply of honeycomb we could knead it up and make earplugs for ourselves that's just as good or better you are clever before and after okay we are still safe in here yeah i think so we have heard everything that happened outside of this bubble if it is wailing at us i don't know what that would entail for us yeah that's correct nott you could at least give it a whirl picking that lock we are in here for another seven hours and 40 minutes you've got to follow through i am placing frumpkin outside of the bubble i am going to go look in the next room 13 you know i could throw some light out there but i don't really want to announce our presence what do you think we should do he would have told me if he heard-- i can't hear you i come out of it i don't want to really announce our presence if there's somebody out there i don't know caleb says nothing i'm going to watch everyone safely go to the door and not get killed and then drop the bubble it would stay there yeah oh yeah if i leave it's gone hightail it out of this fucking room with your staff yeah do i recognize it as an obvious arcane effect natural 20 okay i relay this to the group we jumped dimensions to get here and whatever is laying before is not a hallway in a way it is but not the traditional sense it might be yeah you said we can see the end of this passageway but not what's beyond it 15 like stepping off a moving sidewalk at the airport but way worse ring based nosebleed i think both of you should be taking a look around in this moment the worst roll old just like the device the red bubble this is some labyrinth shit motherfucker i know a lot of people are doing a lot of things but eventually get to me i'm going to start ransacking the desk for notes about that i'm looking for a way to help fjord right now six oh she's in it i am going to trust my friends to take care of the monster i have a feeling about the desk this is what i would do i would think that there might be something in this man's desk so i start looking for anything of use it is a 16 okay so then what i do is think all these things can kill me i back away from the desk i'm going to move as far as i can away from the dresser along this way no i'm sorry i meant-- exactly so yeah that's it fava beans deborah can you be here every week that cabinet had a mother fjord fjord yeah what are we going to do about it nott i'm going to join the women up top are

single time okay i put it in my bag just do the two next to that one and then we'll go yeah they're very good just do one more okay we're going to go follow them and we're either going to die or get out of here i hope we get out of here i need them let's go i climb up and i'm screaming at nott let's go nott this is torture to me let's go after you i take her finger and i push our fingers together
