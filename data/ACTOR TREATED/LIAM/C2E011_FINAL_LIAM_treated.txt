talking about that's because i was speaking to you jester sitting in front of me you made the windows-- i am sitting right next to you it's a small room we'll switch it around then maybe nott you go with jester you stay up top and i will go to this meeting frumpkin will stay with you no because i wouldn't be able to hear what they are saying or know what they look like this one said she wants to punch me in the head i don't want that to happen i have done that are we talking about drugs again i will tag along with you again because i still have-- well it's functional no you go to pumat's i

ground it's nice in here it has a name it is called chastity's nook marisha and yes it's right in the name what was that called again it's a good name just before we head that way just out of curiosity what is the name of the bakery that is near i go and ask i walk into the-- come are you hungry okay i will get us some sweets if you want yeah sure why not we are flush at the moment i walk in better than after (groaning and laughter) yeah what are you in the mood for do you want something sweet or something savory bear claws well let's see excuse me whoever's running this show yeah

sweater you have is that from here in the city i'm sorry what is your name iva pleasure to meet you iva deshin i'm new to town and i'm looking for a bit of reading and this place has been highly recommended to me and i'm wondering what-- i made you plan for this you know my tastes are very varied i'm always looking for something new of course i am very interested in literature recommendations as she walks away from us you know i'm obviously here for a purpose but i like historical fiction as well and i like when the two things are combined do you know what i mean i like historical fiction i don't like shallow smut i like to learn something while i'm being titillated i suppose i have rolled a zwanzig that is twenty i'm very much interested in this and other books as well but we will start with (whispers) the courting of the crick i'm still interested i would like to see the quality of the book you know see if it's in mint condition did she walk away from me by the way i cast detect magic everything the range i believe is 30 feet if i'm not mistaken yeah it is am i covering every part of the store where i am i start to browse just one of the patrons nothing behind any doors nothing on the shelves okay i wait for her to return that is finely made may i hold it i turn with her so that my back is and i speed read four pages oh jeez out of curiosity if i flip through do i see any boning anywhere inside yes it's a high quality item you can understand my excitement i've been thinking in the space of time that you have left and while i would like to purchase something here today i'm very low on funds and the nature of this book and the trouble i could get into-- i mean your secret is safe with me but it is too hot for my hands i was wondering if you had a copy of shallow breaths here perfect how much would this run me three silver okay i take out the three silver one two three and i hand it over yes and did you two want to get anything what is your niche all her hopes and dreams written by seven corbo it's probably about time to go pick up the bear claws on the top shelf behind you there what do you call those these pastries i slide the smut under a tray of bread a tray of bread on the counter yeah hide it they look the other way that's all right 11 oh okay i'll take my bread please thank you would you like to carry the bear claws as we're walking out i will show you a trick that i've learned in the past few years it's very cold out i pull sides of the bread out it's hot i hand to you a bread and i hand you a piece of bread and then i shove my hands in it's warm and i can eat it later let's go yeah but i can eat this why are you looking at me that way it's not weird many people have done this in this make-believe world and also in america i walk out the door i slide my hand under the sheets and i feel that thread count maybe if you had carried a ruler you could hit my knuckles harder next time no no i light my hand on fire i would've burned the bread and then i couldn't eat it it's simple well i don't have-- the control is a little tricky sometimes sometimes zauber like sour what are you looking at you're squinting where are there people i mean if you are in the empire you've heard of the cerberus assembly ja ja it is what it is well that is also true but it also is what it is it's the empire where are you what are you doing down there and yeah what are you going to do about it insight check one (laughter) we're going to hit the bars tonight nationwide yeah should we go or-- did you you bought that book you bought me that book that is so expensive for this book this is just smut i don't know i don't read things like this yeah you have it you know the thing is places like that are like yard sales 99% of the time there is nothing but broken crap but once and i pat the book in one of my holsters i found something did you draw the dick on the friends spell you did it that's the one yeah i found that in a porn shop porn yeah hidden you go first give me your review yeah have at it i appreciate the gesture because it is the thought that counts it's the gesture jester but seriously thank you a tale of two titties there's a casino you want to go to the casino i don't want to go there this neighborhood makes me a little edgy to be honest i'm done but i will go with you if you want to go somewhere shall we go you know i'm a little tuckered i'm going to take a rest upstairs i'm going to copy that last spell into my book i'll see you guys in a little bit maybe around dinner time yeah it's cocked oh no yes how far in are you how long have you been working on it the second t is silent oh i'm with my friends here they've shared a bit of what is gone on here and i'm sympathetic thank you caleb yeah you have already mentioned that some of your people were followed and eyed which ones specifically i dabble a bit in the arcane nothing too impressive but a little more than nothing i'll go along with fjord what is the benefit for us i send frumpkin after her i have a hand on beau's shoulder-- are any of those books of an arcane nature because i'm also looking i'm looking through frumpkin very bad just an eight i'm sorry i did not catch all of the meeting that you went to the other night are they paying anything are we doing this for altruistic reasons so has anything been discussed in advance is all i'm asking what did you say i did not have a--oh yeah there is some sort of wards on the gates there it's something i've done 100 times in small towns i tried to disguise myself and there was nothing there they saw right through it and they were dicks about it it is not the entire tri-spire because-- no not not nott it is not i cased the smut shop i looked for arcane things there and did not well but i was able to use my abilities oh wait i knock on jester and beauregard's door you are turning in no by all means but i have changed my mind i feel guilty for discarding the book that you purchased for me and i was wondering if i could read it tonight but only if you are going to bed okay i'm going to read it before bed it will take me about an hour good night come on i'm just putting up the thread come to bed come to bed no no i don't (poof) alarm i go to jester and beauregard's room and say-- good morning sleepy heads i leave the book leaning against the door did i find anything good in it there was a lot more historical fiction in it than actual pornographic content i was surprised feels like it's weighing on you it's amazing what a good book can do it gets its grips into you yeah because if we come out looking like rats then out we will go yeah i was going to ask if the two empire kids know about that position yes that's true she could be a lazy ass sure caleb said let's find out we're going to be quiet in the sewers because there's things down here they were everywhere the last time he is going to be about 12 inches shorter 20 i make myself look like the male version of the elven woman that jester did in a similar high collared clothing nott what fjord is implying is-- you know how i can make myself look like anything okay well you're always good to have hidden away in case something goes squirrely so definitely you maybe me as well yeah if you make it in no i'm going to stay with nott i will be back-up you're a good talker we don't need two good talkers yeah oh cat i think that we're hidden away in case things go bad with the crownsguard after that then they're on their own i think be careful twinnie caleb is turning the diamond over and over in his hand like a fidget spinner watching all of this so we've got it buttoned down we are not going bring this woman's life down in a shambles because she is an asshole i mean we are assholes ja for different reasons okay and okay so let me go over this then we have no form of payment of any kind planned in advance we don't know if this woman has done anything besides being a snide puppy-hater i have personally bribed people i don't know that i would-- listen i do not like the government--i say this quietly--i do not like the empire but we're really sticking our neck out with very dangerous people i don't think we have much to go on i don't think we know how we're going to be receiving recompense for this well i am willing to discuss our continued involvement once the payment is figured out it's on all our minds unspoken we have already dropped our disguises if they recognized us yeah i could yeah well it has to happen eventually we're pretty ragtag but they're both very good at what they do insight check on that statement balls total balls literally no figuratively yes the biggest and the baddest potentially too real we would like to discuss i want to walk away very fast if this goes wrong my hackles are up it does not feel as sure a bet as other things that we have done together but okay but there's money involved so there's incentive one hundred percent he is hard to read level three motherfucker which is possible yeah most likely meanwhile at the soltryce academy sam and so it's another dance through the sewer if we want to do that tonight which we could do yeah i think that ship has sailed fjord come up with one actually come up with one
