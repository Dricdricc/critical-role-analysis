feel i need to be honest with you there's no question you and i have danced around each other a bit in the past few years and i have been curious i've come close many times to going further than i have you are a charming man but i respect you very much and i need to tell you that i can't do the dance anymore i am in love with someone i don't think loves me but all the same it wouldn't be fair to you to think that we might dally and i don't want to be a liar so i won't be i reach out hand behind his head and i say you are a beautiful arcane bastard and i kiss him full on the lips i pat him on the shoulder thank you good night gil cure alcohol poisoning can pike follow us around all the time everywhere for the rest of our days it's just twigs and berries anyway more private than our house ah cin-cin everybody cin-cin maybe it is i don't know where it would have come from though this is a land of magic and mystery who knows teleportation device that's it if we were to be interested it's true that you are pointing us in the direction of this place but we would be doing all the work we would need a very high percentage i know that's what you said i said high 80-20 or i'm not doing shit you can send him in (spitting noises) we're not talking about breaking into a living man's home krieg is gone krieg was a dragon we have a dungeon did you just say that out loud oh dear with advantage amazing amazing oh shit you pulled a rabbit out of a hat scanlan said he's in love maybe we could pay jarett a little overtime the last time we were there something looked at us through things on the wall right so it knew where we were and we fled we have no idea what we left behind we left in a hurry what kind of classes have you been going to night school emon community college everyone says words i don't know what all these words mean what's a douchebag have a look around anyone around watching 23 for me what about around the house outside the house or surrounding buildings and during that whole exchange i've been changing cloaks and putting on the red one great i don't need to be subtle i'm just standing around you guys are arguing he's making a fool of you i'm just changing my cloak i have 17 cloaks yeah it's on wheels it's on wheels it's functional they smoosh up to about the size of a cabbage it's really all right you know what never mind i think what i think is that grog and pike should lead the way stealth in pick all the locks and i think everything will go really well i'm going to hang back i think that's the way to go i take pike by the hand and go here you go chum and i slap down my set in her hand i'm vax there's no way this is not good everybody meet your new rogue she pushes massive statues she unlocks all doors shut up baby i know it enough to open a door does the smell get more intense at the food i almost can't smell you you mean the not okay part being the teleportation room sam and and that's it they didn't make it out of the room right this is in the room that we're all in wow oh 11 still mildly hungover pike then grog no it's got to go behind i have to pull it behind no (laughter) not enough to recognize anything that doesn't sound good can i check for traps while they're talking 20 you're like a magnet for evil pike don't you think you should have a look at it let's look at the evil skull first i mean we've been talking about-- -- some fucknut with one eye i feel like-- there's a door behind there all right i grab scanlan by the scruff and pull him back and then i start in and i grab my sister by the ear behind me and start pulling her down perception check perception check perception check 20 for me and the last time we were here i found a safe path through do i remember it up up down down left right left right i could use luck yeah 20 jeepers worse than a natural one but i think we assume we're walking into trouble these were palantirs hanging in a wall where another dragon somewhere peeked through and was pissed off is there any sign of the pile of gold that grog started rage-looting 23 and none of us remember them from our past visit pike you're frozen out of curiosity i'm going to carefully make my way towards the mouth of the cave and see if there's anything problematic out there perception check the whole way perception roll to tell if it's an earthquake put that thing away put it back in the bag
