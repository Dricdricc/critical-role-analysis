it and for now we will have it let me see in the dark for now i would also transcribe every spell that was in the book and every scroll that i have found so that i use up all the paper that i have purchased have every spell and frumpkin is back as a cat there is only one frumpkin i stayed up all night doing all of those things because they're very time-intensive and would have went to find beauregard very tired and ready to go to stay at the library as long as i am able she said a number of days and when those days are up the thing that i would do is spend as much time that is left with the-- i would borrow jester's haversack if she would let me and spend time with the dodecahedron i want to learn all of the martial arts hallo oh thank you thank you bo-bo-bo-bo-bo-bo-bo if i had four days to peruse at will i would have spent the first day trying to research anything i could find about xhorhas the xhorasians' mentions of beacons of them living many lives their religion if possible investigation that is 19 pray to the great god titty do i find any mention of these beacons-- he mentioned beacons plural-- and reincarnation or multiple lives i spend a day reading about that i will spend every remaining day reading about-- i was rushed the first time i came here so i'm going to spend every day left reading about the weave of time and any mortals' attempts to control it 22 nearly killed does it talk about any of the people who were nearly killed but weren't no record of their names i would still have spent the entire three days reading about that dunamis ja good cool super cool danke then i'm all done with all my shit yep is the traveler happy with you yet just everybody think back to the stink eye laura gave us on the hospital run jeez louise i'm old somewhere in another part of the city entirely caleb's going oh that's interesting wait they all blink out got any spell slots left not since scanbo i think that is also the most exciting night kumas has had in ten years it's almost like a game of d&d feed me (as kumas) i want rice pudding i got a lot of reading done oh library books so they're not mine that's the beauty of a library is this a realization that you had you were off on your own are you okay that's true is it an actual cove an abused cantaloupe oh no no i have no specific destination in mind i'm happy to accompany you if the group sees fit no i have never been out of the empire what about you can't jester send messages (shouting) who are you drinking and not very explained at all well what if you tried how about right now is there any of this that you have not shared yet you speak of a remedy how do you mean do you mean you would rid yourself of that blade these changes in you or am i not hitting it oh good morning our next destination for what it's worth fjord soltryce academy normally starts with younger students not exclusively but generally i don't know we're all agreed then that fjord eats poop after what we have been through in the last month it'd seem foolish to split up now i'm curious about the menagerie coast she would be okay with you-- seven spell slots later (as jester) okay i'm starting at the top again it is dangerous there not yet where's the map is that on the way oh it's to the north it's not towards the menagerie coast where's the map do you want to propose it to the group i'm happy to go of course what's the time limit on that it's the end of the month right on the delivery and we're at the beginning of this month or the middle-- beginning what if that is the next place we go so much water on this road tell you what after the coast we will propose it to the group if they don't want to go i will go with you eh i don't know go ahead i mean i've expanded my repertoire i have a few new tricks that i will hold onto for the right moment are you okay okay you seem a little restless to me i'm working on mine mine is a little long-goal perhaps you know what i've done well i don't have one plan in mind part of me thinks that i should just stop it from happening to anyone else part of me is very selfish and wants to carve it out of my past it's dangerous not just to me that is true you are my greatest friend i like you because you are funny but it's more than that we will get you what you want even if there is some risk because if it's really important it's worth the risk ja okay you and i we have an agreement a pact whatever you need we are going to make it happen ja if it is in my power i will do it that's funny i've never been to the beach done and done the cad in the hat delivers we could go anywhere on the planet at any time matt we want to go to brazil-- no norway
