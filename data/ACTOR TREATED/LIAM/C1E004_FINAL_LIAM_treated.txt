hi nancy look back the way we came there's some sort of light up ahead stay with clarota i'm gonna go take a look scanlan come on 29 grab scanlan put my hand over his mouth and say quiet man what's wrong with you with great power comes great responsibility shut up later later save it for the mind flayer so with him tucked under my arm like a football i start to creep further and try to make out-- if there's light from the lantern i can see in dim light thanks to daddy's blood so i'm gonna try to figure out what it is exactly that i'm seeing perception check oh do i have any advantage on that 11 pike jeez where have you been we were looking at that we couldn't make heads or tails of it you ever seen that before are you sure think about it just for a moment longer oh it's a natural 20 you just forgot what is it how did you know that we're in a very complicated situation a lot has happened to us we found sort of a war camp down here and there is sort of a being i don't know what to call it he's got a little of this going on and he speaks and lashes out through his mind we fought a huge force down here and then we ended up falling into a cavern and then keyleth and my sister found another one what are they called they're called-- illithids this just happened he seems extremely dangerous however the forces we faced in the other illithid seem maybe worse so that's where we're at pike this is clarota we've just met clarota can you help us understand your kind your history how you've come to be here and who this individual is that is fucking with your shit (all laugh) i have a few questions is that all right you and your brethren without this do you think as one so one individual of your family sees something the entire hive sees the same is that correct and you mentioned the arcane being a stigma upon you what do your brethren put their faith in if not the arcane i have one more question and we have allied ourselves to you that's true but i'm curious to know hopefully our goals intertwine and we want the same thing but once that is achieved and it will be what happens then for the illithid do you return to your home below do your people harbor any ambition to move upward into kraghammer i'm sorry what was that name i do as well scanlan does he speak true insight 20 over here but can she suss him out is there any way to be hidden for us i think we do understand your desires though and we can align ours with yours so let us speak of specifics clarota strategy percy shot this one i think i think it's important to point out that your kin this general is aware of at least three of us of my dragonborn friend the singer over here and myself just us then true it could be just me then you look lovely how do you think your kin will react to that what will their response be if they know that outsiders have come if they've seen just me at this moment plus a few illusions can i assume that you would have already given us any advice by now if you knew a way are we stuck with our own resources so no back doors no secret entrances that you know of into the camp anywhere near this general fuck how did that go with the little brain thing not too well the bridge is gone we have to-- get out of this city scanlan took a poke about he boofed himself out of sight and had a look around and then we returned to the edge of it and i kind of flipped the bird at them and taunted them a little but most of us haven't been in under the bridge there was-- and the ogres were getting sucked under by something he will probably hear the thoughts inside your mind i think so pike i think at this point we should just move forward yes that all sounds shitty (all laugh) no we haven't had a look around perhaps but the water breathing sounds good to me i feel like a head-on-- -- run into the chasm is a bad idea yes he's got a bottle plus we've killed a fucking dragon i know it's not an easy task to accomplish but we're pretty badass i think we might have a good chance well we don't know i mean our options are we can vote on it although we all know keyleth is just gonna go fucking do whatever she wants our options are-- just the one time our options are a headlong advance into the middle of their camp that's a big fucking force go fishing with you and keyleth said that she can cast water breathing can help us breathe underneath the surface you were having trouble if i recall just getting the waterfall out of the way to create i mean it was amazing but-- i know you fucking saved the day but we're talking about-- yeah lake superior there's 50 to 100 fucking creeps up top hold up hold up those are the ones we saw though how do we know how far back the camp goes how many are in the gate behind it wait a second wait a second clarota you've been listening to our thoughts for the last ten minutes what do you think what do you think have you seen it it's big what's the sitch that illithid took out my brain from like 100 feet can you make me invisible what what's he doing this is a fairly shitty situation how it's pale as shit when i go to the beach i don't tan i stroke we've seen you surrounded in radiant light before you think you can do that to the carpet and clarota while they're figuring that out if we remain to be hidden or blind our opponents as we approach your kin will not know our thoughts 'til they see us can i fight one of your kin with a blindfold on it wouldn't be hard to get hold of some pitch down here some tar no if you can be invisible and you have a ring of mind shielding and you can carry a bucket of pitch to that motherfucker you can splash it on its face cover its eyes and it's helpless yes but it could take it off possibly if you smear sticky shit on its eyes-- then it can't control-- no not solo i like your idea of turning me into a fly you and i go in-- but that could get us in close scanlan and i could get in closer and blind it and i could stab it in the head did everyone hear percy that's a good idea yes two fronts you and i separate from the group they go in shining like a beacon you and i (buzzes) in and while the illithid is focused on them we go in you blind him and i stab him in his maw it's pretty good what else are we going to do vex you mean my sister vex that's a good question i gave up trying to understand her years ago well i-- 20 nothing to add what creatures are you speaking of now is this something-- but what are they this is something worse than umberhulks i assume buttholes in the underdark well i need to take a moment to find some-- i'm gonna look around and see if i can find any pitch anywhere in the goblin camp investigation i got the exact same number 12 goblin shit let's cook it up a little feel pretty good about that so here's how i think this goes i think the team infuses the carpet and any shields or head pots they have with radiant light they go in and make a big stink on the side of the camp you and i go in you're invisible i'm a-- yes let's say fly we go in find the illithid and then we pop in you yell hey spanky throw goblin shit in its face yes we want to increase our odds as soon as he's blind i go in for the kill and then it's on us to deal with what happens after that it's playtime yes please do it's possible they could be weary frightened seems unreliable-- yes mind controlled your time to kill is coming that's our starting point i imagine the main thing is to get the illithid because if he's out nobody's-- then they're all separate he's playing chess with all his minions until we take him out yes but there's no bridge we talked about-- we have an infinite amount of rope tiberius talks about making him light as a feather clarota is there anything you can do to help us on this endeavor you have our word there's no bridge get over together get to the edge that's a good idea if we go as high as we can and just hug the ceiling of this motherfucker and then go down in the middle and as we're going down you turn me into a fly and go invisible and that's when all hell breaks lose no time like the present i will sneak through if shit goes south i will peel off and join the others we're just gonna have to improvise that we'll do it live we'll do it live sorry everybody does it our mother did it i do it sometimes (hissing) vox machina let's do this shit tiberius percy and i are on the carpet and tiberius are you good to help grog fly across we're all taken care of yes tiberius percy and i are on the carpet yes she'll be back do you propel yourself with thoughts i turn to scanlan and say scanlan we are probably going to die today it has been an honor what were you saying tiberius don't play it that way what were you saying it's all right 28 want to take kraghammer this close to the ceiling tiberius can you turn me invisible now he's sitting on the carpet so are we floating above but i can't go invisible while you're flying we're running the risk of as we come down on duergar going (groans) we're gonna go in we're gonna hit the roof you turn me invisible he turns him invisible you guys light up the night and we just do it we just gotta go if anyone takes notice then turn off the lights all right let's do it 28 if that thing sees us though it could be game over i still think we should stick to the plan of blinding it you and i i will fucking yell into my earring if shit goes down and you guys gotta pray for me tiberius could you do me a favor of making me disappear holy shit where are my hands i take scanlan by the scruff and swing him down i'm scaling in after him 18 we're in we're in we're holding hands i'm leaning way down on the side sam and i have done this before first i just heard tiberius' voice in my head so i'm going to test it out and think scanlan can you hear me i heard tiberius whispering about i tug on his hand to keep going into the barracks you just lean to live with the stage fright you never move past it should we pause right now look my sister's here we'll make it work we'll bring you up to speed later you're on the roof of osama bin laden's house (all laugh) so i think we should probably stealth and start moving in 20 we have does anyone have a laser light all right squeeze it together ah there we go okay so we're going to go down here so we're gonna go this way all right i'm inching up i'm pulling scanlan behind me but i'm inching up to this door just peeking through seeing what i can see okay i pull scanlan by the hand and we enter into this room it's just like the day we met sam quietly walking this way we're past the door that looks like the front door we're gonna keep going this way i still have the pitch in a bucket the shit in a bucket in my hand by the way but we'd make noise how far apart are the two duergar standing in that door okay i pull a gold coin out of my pocket and throw it in this corner and because of keyleth i have advantage correct so this is what is this so that's a 17 i pull scanlan behind me and tiptoe right behind this asshole and take out my vorpal blade and reach out and grab him by the hair and stick it in the back of his neck i'm so tense right now okay good yes well i get-- yes i get advantage but you can't triple up on advantage i believe (loud bang offscreen) thank you so this isn't a dexterity check this is an attack okay so that's a 26 i'm sweating okay that's two plus seven is nine that's nine that's just that part six seven nine 14 and 19 which is what's doubled the sneak attack damage just had a thought i'm going to sit him back against the wall and let him slide against it and grab scanlan and into the room (shushes) i got a 28 we can't talk i put the bucket of shit into scanlan's hands give him a little nudge a gentle little nudge and i'm rolling behind him at the same time behind the illithid ready to go oh yeah behind him behind him plus advantage oh thank christ using scanlan's advantage so 16 29 (sighs) i'm stabbing i'm stabbing this is stealth right stealth for me oh okay 29 29 that's a critical right i'm assassinating this mother fucker the illithid can control us all roll my damage okay dm 62 into the back of his head critical hit oh it's a poison one by the way i have no idea poison dagger i think it's oh it's 15 natural 20 20 natural 20 oh yeah that's a 25 we snuck into the war camp we all landed on the top of their main building i'm just gonna (grunts) in the back of his head some more i'm still invisible according to tiberius' greater invisibility spell stab him in the back of the head for assassinate do i get the critical still here dm so this is a 28 i just rolled a 28 oh so this is my bonus attack okay this is fire my flame tongue dagger i got two plus six is eight eight was that the bonus attack or was that my main attack that's a nine and here comes my bonus attack okay 14 24 here comes my keen dagger which is an eight yes windows are swing-down-in-able it's wood oh it hits but i use uncanny dodge to try to swoop out of the way as best i can er mah gerd i derged (all laugh) did you bring any wheaton power from the other room (all laugh) do it starlord the guy on the table attacking me vex'ahlia i yell bring the fire tiberus toys toys clever girl there's magic in the dwarves the duergar yeah son they were all eights right he's a power top probably if anyone tries to hit him he'll snap out of it so hugging him dm is out of his mind 18 pretty good overall (groans) it's a worm i have a question can we take a potty break before no breaks no i'm fine aw okay i think where's the laser here it is it looks like i have just enough squares to go one two three who's this right here can i get to here on a turn i can't tell it's 30 feet i'll use my bonus action to click my haste boots together okay and since percy is right up against it i'm able to deal sneak attack damage because there's another one of its foes so i'm gonna try to strike him in his underbelly 20 oh and it was-- never mind so three there we go 22 to fight the bulette or to-- oh we don't know oh he could just be reacting to the bulette take his fucking head off that's a level nine barbarian that arrow just went slow mo aw man thank you gary gygax wherever you are (all laugh) dicks freakin' tank in the room ♫ why can't we be friends fuck you scanlan shorthalt playing vegas ladies and gentlemen he can do anything with any instrument way to slack off mercer good musical riff 24 11 that'll learn ya did it drag percy through the air these games keep getting better scanlan he's unconscious he's in bad shape but we're gonna get him hashtag save scanlan strings of gnome blood are being flung across the room she's 25 speed but what about her-- which means you're-- ten yeah it's one or multiple people remember when i brought you back from the dead remember that remember that you're gonna be all right i think you did it four times yeah that was plus five you don't go below zero you hit zero and you're there making rolls to see if you die come on clarota show us what you got got to bring that mental power and that arcane magic let's do it okay so i've got enough room to run up to its anus which i'll do it's got plenty of people around so that means i can sneak attack him ain't no thing okay that hits who cares i'm saving my gnome friend okay here i go 14 it's a 25 to hit his butt this is my keen dagger with vorpal blade two plus seven is nine that's just nine where's a pencil that's a pencil and then we add my sneak attack damage which is six seven ten 15 21 plus

second attack second attack 22 it's a tank double damage it means double damage stay in school kids yes and that's why you're on the team (all cheer) you sadists (all laugh) 826la probably right oh hi laura had to bugger out i mean he's pretty good at dungeon mastering right chaotic good what was your first roleplaying experience i saw that go through this guy just started i did ad&d in high school and i dm'ed while playing which is totally cheating this is the first pure experience i've had i saw when and how did you all start playing together the reason this started is because i directed matt as leon kennedy in resident evil 6 and every time he came in he would say hey you know i'm running a game you can come in and just do a one off and i was like oh i got babies i can't do that i can't do that i can't do that and then finally once for my birthday i thought i can do a one off it'll be the only time we'll do it just see how it goes scanlan and i did a podcast together and every week we would do some new thing and we're like fuck it let's play d&d we all did it and everybody got snake bit and it's been the best thing that ever happened to me at least travis everybody's asking about your shirt i'm also seeing why did we switch from pathfinder to fifth edition oh you did someone's asking if we like presents i think we'd all like fan art immortalize our shitheadedness that'd be good we still got that little one socrates asked what was a favorite moment before we started streaming the show our first game was pretty amazing most of us i was giggling uncontrollably i couldn't believe we were doing it and just watching my friends who i work with all the time just dropping into character there was no like oh let's see what will i do what am i doing i will move i will roll like bailey bailey dropped into character from the get-go and was a ringer but the moment i was thinking of was when pike died pike died shortly before we switched from private to public it was emotional a couple people started crying i teared up we put two and a half years into this and we're all very connected to it i'm not gonna get into it but i've had a hard couple of years personally everything's fine but this was like therapy for me and to see one of my friends go down it was fucking emotional of what do we have $50 in the budget to go on ebay and get a castle of greyskull set put it on the set somewhere let's do that yeah we're working towards that someone asked what kind of food would everyone like i like indian don't that's a terrible idea somebody asked something like what do we hope is the result of this show i can't remember the wording obviously we're doing this because we love each other and we're having fun together but i also hope d&d has been its entire history has been like oh it's this weird thing that guys do with dice in a room anyone can do this i love video games i work in video games but d&d has changed my life it is social it is person to person it is real because it's people in a room doing shit together and that's kind of lacking a little bit in our world and i would say find some friends i mean i love that there are sort of online tools to play with people across the country but if you can find three or four people in your town to do this i'd say do it do it someone's saying what edition to start with i would start with the most recent because you know they're gonna keep updating it over the years it's really loose i feel like all of us felt like we were doing pathfinder and fucking loved it otherwise we wouldn't be doing it but it was really intricate and we were doing it every six or seven weeks when we were off-air so we felt like the rules were really complicated and we'd lose track of it we loved doing it obviously but fifth edition is really fast and loose i recommend that and travis just stuck his finger in my ear he kinda does that he hits me in the nads a lot connected to that someone asked if you had any tips and i'd like to know the answer to this too because i'm running a game for my eight-year-old son and his friends who are about to start do you have any tips for new dm's although you wrote a monologue for clarence right because that was very intricate we were all just ready-- do you have random encounters ready in case we're like ah fuck it i don't wanna go down to the dungeon i wanna go back up and beat up some dwarves do you have shit kind of ready somebody asked how we pick the character class that we picked when we first started this game and i said hey it's my birthday i wanna play a game laura really likes rogues as well but i made sure that as fast as i fucking could so she yeah she plays rogue in like dragon age and everything that shit's a favorite class of hers so i know i got it out there also the reason that we're twins is because laura and i have the exact same birthday may 28th that's why we're twins i'm so glad we pulled you in one of the greatest pleasures for me and i'm obviously a huge nerdlinger and this is just me reliving high school when i was talking to sam about starting all this and saying hey let's get together it's what i wanna do for my birthday we pulled travis in travis is fucking tight look at him he's not the stereotypical d&d player and he was as snake bitten as the rest of us play dungeons & dragons please play dungeons & dragons it'll make you so happy thedouginator keeps asking you matt how you brought the party together the first day of play you're so entertaining take it away mercer jake bodro asked what's it like playing for three hours in front of 2500 people i think our games have gotten a little bit better only because when we play privately there were sometimes lulls where we weren't sure what to do we would go off to bathroom we would take a break but now there's a little bit of the element of theater to it just a sprinkle of it and it kinda of gooses the energy up also sam riegel did a lot of a capella in college he helped write several seasons of the voice which was all about a capella so samis sort of a ringer for the bard class yordee yorda-- someone keeps asking if any of us have hirelings or henchmen and the simple answer to that is no just trinket oh that's right right before we started it was like one episode of the sims we've been playing for two and a half years someone wanted to know how long if you want sam and i it's kind of languishing but we have a podcast together called allworknoplay we're both parents we have kids so we have no time to do anything enough time to take a shit the first or second episode the first episode is about us playing the first game and there's audio from the first game again go to itunes or to allworknoplay on pod bean and you'll hear about two minutes of us dealing with a puzzle that matt threw at us yeah it was timed there was an hourglass going off it was us discovering d&d really for the first time allworknoplay all one word taliesin on game one was actually not percy he was a dragonborn paladin you fucking blew our minds we were like what do i do can i do damage points to stop this puzzle there was this tunnel with all these moving parts we thought we were gonna be crushed and he was a dragonborn for the first episode it's in the recording on the the allworknoplay podcast and he just breathed ice on this water-based-- and froze it and everyone was like you can do that you can't just roll dice and hit it and that's when we kind of understood oh it's whatever the fuck you want no no that's an important question no it's important someone's asking if we die would we roll in a new character and plus we just started this show so part of us were wondering like what if we die the second episode what happens we recorded this opening to the show that's coming when pike died we had all of us many series of dice rolls to do and it was very story-based yeah i mean luckily we were in a big city there was a huge temple there were very wise clerics who were good at bringing people back but still we all had to roll there was three rounds we had to roll he might have fudged numbers i don't know but we were all still scared we had to all the majority of us had to have good rolls three times in a row scanlan had to put-- the tears scanlan had to kiss her on the head he put a figure that he carved of her it was very elaborate this one was majorly in tears laura was in tears someone's asking if we drink while playing and the answer is no (all laugh) one i see keep coming up since we started is how would we react to life if we were our characters i don't know or differently from our characters 'cause i wouldn't stab my children when they frustrate me how do we feel about team demihooman and inspiring them to play d&d for the first time i think the number one reason we all wanna do this is because we love each other and we love this game the second thing is we all knew we kind of felt like-- we're gonna make dungeons & dragons cool again and make it open for anyone to do there's no reason not to do this if there's someone you know who doesn't understand it don't worry about it just find some friends and connect with them someone keeps asking about troy i don't know if troy baker is ready he has some preconceived notions answer this question i like i saw it a couple times how did you guys get involved in streaming for geek & sundry are you kosher with me you took this film there's a video of you breaking the news to us that geek & sundry came to you about it are you kosher with me sharing that video all right i'll find a way to put it through my twitter so just keep your eye on my twitter there was a video that orion took when matt told us about geek & sundry coming to him and us all sort of toasting and laughing giggling like idiots someone asked if given the chance would we like to do a live game at a convention like acquisition inc i'd like to do although there's nine of us so that'd be kind of-- oh good then yes i'd like to do it the answer is yes how many of you aside from matt have run a game of d&d or another rpg in high school i ran a d&d game i ran a rifts game for a little while i ran a cyberpunk game for a little while yes the last two months i have been helping my eight-year-old son and two of his friends from school create characters and i wouldn't have done this if matt had not forced this shit into my life i wouldn't have done this but i'm about to start running a game for my son the half-elf druid and his two friends the dragonborn fighter and the dragonborn rogue that's just how the cookie crumbles motherfucker of course you did metal gear dragon age castlevania symphony of the night i played 'til i had blisters on my thumbs pool of radiance on my commodore 64 baldur's gate which i played again on my ipad a year or two ago somebody oh go ahead somebody asked how we focus in the room with the sexual magnetism that is scanlan shorthalt i don't know i just let myself get a gigantic boner every week travis stupid question thor odinson or hulk in a knock down drag out one man doing it all scanlan i would be scanlan someone asked when trinket came into the mix day one i see two questions i wanna address one is what is each of our favorite kill and the second one is what's the story behind the super high intensity team (all laugh) until today that was the same thing another fabulous moment that you guys have to know about is we wanted to get into a tower at one point and there was a very intelligent sort of right-hand man to whoever owned the tower scanlan just started fast-talking which is his defining characteristic took his finger and put it right here as a mustache and said hi i'm burt reynolds (all laugh) and you weren't expecting it to work in any way shape or form and you went okay that was sad for me because it was my idea but i had health problems at the time and i had to bow out and i was very very very sad the shits how did we become the shits largosensei keeps asking what are your most cathartic voice acting experiences i'm gonna guess for ashley that's the last of us since that's

infamous maybe pretty fucking sad what's under the freakin' lake matt bracheon89 you said stephen king plays d&d bracheon we're going to wait for your answer how do you know he plays d&d let's get him in here takes a lot of stupid somebody keeps asking and we'll do a show of hands here lord of the rings or game of thrones what do you prefer 10 seconds to think about it and then i'll-- they're asking the question lord of the rings fuckin' lord of the rings there you go there's the answer i love game of thrones maybe possibly not dungeons & dragons without lord of the rings pike's daddy wilhand the money everybody if you could choose whatever fantasy world to live in what would it be lord of the rings i wanna be one of the fellowship ashley johnson lived in a marvel universe already right why is matt scarlet witch googoo17 arkazey keeps asking what's your favorite nerdy t-shirt you own mine is one that says mordor world tour it looks like a rock 'n' roll t-shirt but it says

in the city of eman he's got a big friggin' crush on me and wants me wants me and some day you and i will actualize that maybe in a game maybe not someone asked how do game devs find us for acting work we all audition hundreds of people audition for every role in los angeles we all just try today i worked on a superhero game and the guy who was directing me for voiceover said hey so what are you doing for the rest of the day and i said well i'm gonna go to the gym i'm gonna do this then i'm gonna go do that do you know about that d&d show that a couple of us are doing and he's like yeah i heard about that and the guy who had written the game went yeah i've watched every episode (all laugh) give him a pencil-thin mustache i liked it when grog got it on with a what was it a nymph in the air a nymph could have attacked us but grog looked her in the eye and she liked what she saw then he disappeared for a little while and he came back and he was in a really good mood i've always been fascinated with the mind flayers you're fucking throwing an army of them at us 'cause they're dangerous and they're so outside of the norm i'm proud of the knife other streamed d&d games like rollplay hosted by itmejp no maybe we will though everyone play dungeons & dragons yeah they're a signature character of dungeons & dragons they represent d&d viagra i'm gonna guess that none of us have been
