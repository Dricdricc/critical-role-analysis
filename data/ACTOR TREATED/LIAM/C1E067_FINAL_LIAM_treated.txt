i take offense at that loser contest loser contest i am the biggest loser i multiclassed into monk is there anything gained by discussing this here do we need to look any further or should we get the hell out what're you looking at there keyleth yeah if anyone wants to roll this place do it and let's get out of here yeah it's this way i think i checked for traps last-- yeah i went all the way to the top and peeked around i had a look around is it public or off to the side i'm going to scurry up open up-- 20 no 22 i'm off to the side like marion in raiders to the side of the alley terminator overlay it was fucking awesome are we getting out of here or are we going to get out of here let's head back to the debt's respite i grab keyleth's hand and pull the gun over and say but for now we assume she can hear everything that we are saying percival's going to fucking murder you she's also potentially listening to us right now i mean time is of the essence i mean percival be sure there's nothing in the gun please yeah that's a good idea all right should we scry now though you have been holding out on us it's not necessarily a bad thing anything is workable stupid i think as soon as possible interesting interesting oh snap that was magical what's the matter what's the matter what did you see i thought it was beneath the waves yeah beneath the ozmit sea ah boy how far away is-- what's left after that she has the cloak that we know of she's on top of the dagger almost i know but if we're in an arms race and she's on top of another maybe we should head to the next that's out of her reach now and we're not going to get there in time to stop her from getting that dagger i mean there's many reasons to amass power a little mug interference how do we get there if your magic runs out while we're flying over the ocean what happens we drown but how you have to have a circle to a circle that wouldn't do it i like that you're assuming we'll have an airship that's true are either of you gentlemen smart enough to do that do you know where that island is it's possible i mean percival is correct the first thing we have to do is get that gun unfucked but then after we have to decide if we are chasing her down-- and it seems 50-50 to me not impossible but not a sure thing at all-- or do we head to the next vestige to keep it out of her hands well isn't that where we have to go anyway whitestone is much further away from the ozmit sea than where we are now right way way other side of the continent right how long's it been since we left draconia you can do anything in nine days what's the hooded figure doing right now i'm going to keep focused there they had an unfair advantage why would we come directly to you if that were the case why wouldn't we have not just left i'm curious if you can imagine a reason why we would come to you with this rather than sneak away in the night in this moment everyone in this room wants the same thing i boot scanlan forward on the tush good terms we have coin what do we got did you say bay of gifs yeah but the magic thing with the gun you don't get fast and cheap sorry that rang a bell sorry perfect it's like hannibal and mr t together that's what you want vincent you are my twin help help it's happening my barrels (dragon roaring noise) (whispering) we're not there not your fake little star from pre-show you just babe ruth-ed that shit yeah mr shorthalt yeah that's bardic magic bitch this city has had its way with you scanlan shorthalt you talking to matt if he doesn't roll for damage then i'm going to be offended wait so way faster than the casino trip while we've been waiting so long percival has been acting fucking twitchy since we found that body so i walk over to him sitting off at a table hey mr cool-as-a-cucumber shush or come with me come have a seat what's the matter yeah it's her again we're going to find her it's fine you're huffing and hawing since we found her body it's fine what's going on well she's going to go away percival if not now later you're probably right percival she probably is this is not lord and lady briarwood over again though and you're not alone you have me you have her you have her you have the other two laurel and hardy motherfuckers who aren't back yet all the more reason for you to be the same cold-hearted asshole you've been for the last year why change now get the job done percival well all right we can do that we can destroy anything you make but for now percy keep your head man now i'm nervous one day at a time gang let's deal with ripley first look we're going to help you get to her you're going to get her you've got to let us in on it a bit though all right that's a promise i think my point has been made i start moving keyleth towards that door for some fresh air come on thought for a second you also had one ball no shit grog how did you do it who's excited now oh cheers to that cheers so many things that seems like a bad idea is he that picture of you on the carousel it's more the grimace whoops and then vax died yay new matt character do they have the model airship yet the model airship should we melt it just in case are we staying here for the night before heading out in the morning travis and so we're sleeping on the ship travis and get the cube out oh it's high can we get back to politics please as the airship bears down on ank'harel scarface this is really happening we've joked about it for ages we're friends here you're good while they're doing that i'm actually flying next to the ship and praying for a while out in the dark 15 or apprehension you do the flying we'll do the fucking shit up like a meteor or a comet from the sky i actually do yeah speaking of heat make with the bed farts trinket i get cold at night you can alert one of us if we come upon a ship in the night or day correct of course but someone is awake i'm going to meditate for an hour before bed (grog voice) meaning i would like to get fucked up on a regular basis i'm heading over to find the captain and the halfling to ask how far they estimate we are from the island is there anything you can do about this hot fucking damn keyleth everyone knew that you're like a reverse pyro you're undoing all the violence checking his stocks message from mom are we close enough to see if there's people on the deck yeah that's the duration of the spell the eight hours they could be back already it's better that they're floating on the water than standing on the ship then i'd like to put my vote in for the meteor well we can stop their retreat they're going to be in worse shape without that boat and it lasts a long time it would be a very big coincidence a^2 + b^2 = c^2 are we above the ship at the moment i think we should still go keyleth you ready let's go i'm on your back or piggyback aren't you going earth elemental here we go you ready to do this all right we're going to twist in the air here we go as we're twisting in the air i cast bless on keyleth and myself 18 that means that you and i whenever we make an attack roll or a saving throw for the next minute add a d4 bullet cam and i have a 28 can i use evasion so that's if i succeed the dex yeah it's every turn it halves it right see you later how do you even know which ones you rolled it looks like 80 dice how far am i from percival on the airship then i'm beelining straight through the air towards percival am i closing on percy oh really i click my boots of haste then i can go 500 feet in a round 480 yeah if i use double dash yeah action action i mean i did the math at one point i know it's 480 feet my speed flying is 60 as a bonus action yeah but if i'm hasted it's doubled so it's 60 it's 120 action action bonus action so 120 plus 120 and then bonus action i can also dash i don't know i'm going to pick you up you haughty prick and i reach out my arms and grab him from behind barrel roll and follow my sister ugh lego it's all made of little legos i'm a vax backpack so we'll just-- that was a great game matt
