yeah from down below inside the bubble of leomund's tiny hut i pull out the wire and i cast message up to fjord and say i have plugged the bottom of the ship so i think our troubles are behind us now [laughter] yeah i'm inside a giant sphere of glass basically no i cannot do that i have to stay here in this bubble or the boat will sink presumably well it lasted between ten and 20 minutes while i got this going but i am not a boat expert that's fjord's mo so i can't say for certain how long this will stay afloat no nein i cannot do that but i could walk away from this are we all leaving there are actually pirates above okay i am trying to process this as quickly as i can i'm glad that i spent all the time making this let's go fuck it i walk out of leomund's tiny hut it goes (whooshes) gone yeah as we go up topside i say quietly to nott you know i did not allow for gallan to go inside the bubble so it's all the same to him let's go yeah and going up also i grab hold of that leather thong that's tied around my thigh and i cast mage armor on the way up okay tally ho (mocking) ha ha you're so pretty oh phillip [laughter cheering] we're all going to die just out of curiosity if i look back over my shoulder do i still see a boat i hear her say that and for ten or 15 seconds jump into frumpkin's vision to see what i see hey guys let's steal a boat it'll be so much fun [laughter] caleb died are we off on our own a little bit from everyone training guns upon us what is our plan here i'm trying to move my lips as little as possible we go with this for the time being then when the moment is right we get away or are we just pirates now [laughter] i would warrant a guess that we are stuck here for the time being but i think at a certain point we are going to want to go and if that happens all of you if you see a window in which we can get away tell nott or myself and we will start a snow chain travis and we will tell our friends that it's time to get out of here just find you or me and we spread it quickly so we don't leave anyone behind like we almost fucked off without caduceus from the docks i think for the time being we are in fact pirates and that fjord you're absolutely correct learn as much as possible and when the opportunity is right we leave but for now we have to swiff them they are our new best buddies also glancing around for books big 11 yeah i'm sorry you have a very thick accent sometimes it is-- [laughter] was i eating cheese my perception is so low (laughter) i thought that was a metaphor i have a good sense of it caleb is in the background pulling cheese from the wall [laughter] well clarifying question did avantika just watch fjord yell at nott that shit is in my body i want to know you beat me to that by like 02346 seconds yeah absolutely this is an advantageous moment for all of us if we can help you and your hentai cult achieve your goal-- [laughter] we'll all come out as winners this is true if my name is philip yes jumanji costco clear as day the tradition continues also if we're leaving the chamber and there were all those people outside with the percy sticks-- yeah if there's any out maybe there's not but the thing i'm going to do leaving is to try to subtly get a good look at size what i think they are capable of 12 can i see at least is it this or this oh okay so most everyone here is packing then i feel like we are learning a lot about you right now and not from you are we alone [laughter] i pull out the wire in view of everyone and cover my hands and say to fjord is there anything that you maybe want to tell us about that you haven't already well i would have to ask the dm i don't know about this that bubble i don't know if it is soundproof at all because i just got that spell i don't think it is yeah i would-- well you were upstairs so only if you're screamers you have i'm speaking very quietly amongst jester's whispers you have been having-- this is an ongoing dream that you have been having three or four times you have had a dream with a thing that has a giant eye like the one on your sword and like the inner motifs of this woman's office yeah okay were you able to summon a scary transparent tentacles before that explosion on the boat and those dreams happened were you vomiting seawater before you had those dreams or making a sword come out of the palm of your hand before that explosion no judgements here but is it safe to say that you have been under-sharing with us every single thing seems pretty relevant yes this was my next question i personally was thinking about getting the hell out of here but we are here for you and you want to understand what is happening to you yeah i think we are you know we're friends i think we're trying to figure out where we-- we are friends but-- addendum now we are friends with a giant squid being with a giant eye so i'm just trying to-- ouroboros giant eyes lots of tentacles i mean we've all read stories of sea creatures i'm just vibing here go with me the point is-- that is the point [cheering] i think we are past the point of secrets here we need to know what is what not straight charisma the hunt for fjord's third ball continues [laughter] yeah this is too simplistic it could be both for now we are allies for now we work together to figure out his problem if we have to eventually (throat croaking) is that a stealth on all of us too you snuck out on us is it a guy in like a costco t-shirt also in your ear very quiet you hear oh hey is everything okay going well caleb's alarm spell is going ding a ling a ling would you do me a favor just as a rule maybe keep that ten feet away from me please no it's useful just you know oil and water he shit under the chair why not both before this goes any further because i'm fascinated-- i would like to attempt to go into frumpkin the one-ounce elf owl if possible yeah i remember where that room was so frumpkin is taking a little fly around i think they're about to get naked caleb can't hear any of this but in the middle of the room he says it is getting very kinky in that room it's just so much you guys it's just so much i thought they were going to make bumsen but it did not happen question i am still watching her [cheering] i know it's confusing i like to stay inside this zemnian accent so much but i did not say that out loud that was for the dm yeah i did not stop watching her after he left what is she doing okay just a ten so she did some arcane shit did she also look very hot and bothered yeah well so after you you know made the flirt talk that i was watching oh they were both pouring it on pretty thick that's a subjective thing my friend anyway she is very interested in you and after you left her room i watched a little bit longer and she did some cutting she dropped a little bit of her blood on a miniature altar or something do you do this yeah she stood on a stool and she did a little she seemed very maniacal is the word that i would choose she seemed very driven i mean it sounded like she wanted power and a lot of it fjord if we venture into this sticky wicket do you share even in a small way similar desires as this woman do you want to control the sea well you are grappling with a great deal of power we have watched you do it are you trying to understand this thing better be free of it master it yeah i place the elf owl back on beauregard's shoulder and go to sleep also why did you talk so funny for a moment you sounded like you had a different accent for a moment there fjord except that i pull beau back while everyone proceeds upstairs speaking as a massive liar i think he is lying to us a little bit sure one eye open i don't think he knows what he wants yet no i'm the authority on knowing what i want beauregard he spoke with a different accent for a split second yeah to a purpose not when he is waking up instantly okay i walk upstairs
