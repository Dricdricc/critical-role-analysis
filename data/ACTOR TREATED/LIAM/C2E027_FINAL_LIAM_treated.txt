you've got to laugh i just want to procrastinate and prolong the-- busy day was it a busy day travis bring me pickles pretty spot on i've known her a long time metal okay i'm going to give us about ten minutes to figure out what we want to do here and then i am sending frumpkin out after them we need to decide something now because i am going to be out of it for a bit beauregard she would have told us she wouldn't have been able to hide it i pull keg up this place they are going is it permanent or a temporary camp or it's been there for years and this where they always are do you know how far off we are from it now how many people are in their camp what did you call it yeah sure what about the sour nest what do we want to do that is what i'm talking about mollymauk is dead three are not not yet and we have invested a lot of time into forging this alliance we are in nott i'm not proposing a head-to-head confrontation maybe i want to know where they are i want to know what conditions they're in i'm not willing to walk away from this we could live sure we could live we go hide in the woods go back to picking pockets and pulling scams on people you know that i want more than that what are we going to do first the man crawled out of a grave once if he's to be believed he's done it once maybe he will do it again do we stay here do we try to find i don't-- i've read of miracles a note how many days' travel are we from the beginning of this journey yeah from the gentleman we are in the middle of nowhere you can get us there though it does not need to be a frontal assault we don't need to throw our lives away i pull out the clay cat's paw and cast earthen grasp and the cat's claw forms out of the dirt and i use it to start digging a hole in the earth yeah as the cat's claw starts digging down i'm looking for-- the glaive wasn't left right he took it with him sticks branches ja no i go to molly's body and begin to get the coat off him the claw has about a minute so hopefully it can dig something deep enough okay i'm going to start to pull him into the hole i grab some paper out of my bag and i start writing a note to mollymauk telling him to find us through the gentleman i take that note and i stick it into the lapel of the folds of his clothes and i brush the hair out of his face and then i start to push soil back over the body shine bright circus man caleb sighs and takes a five-foot six-foot sturdy branch one that could be a walking stick and i take that stone-- that lucky rock that i found-- and i start to hammer the branch into the ground so it is sticking up like a post and then hang mollymauk's coat from it not right away if he comes up out of the ground it will be here waiting for him in a day or two i think we will just leave the coat beauregard well we do not have to decide what we are going to do right away we could have an opportunity grab our friends we don't need to rush into the lion's den let's see what we are looking at what we are dealing with we get our three friends back we have not traveled with them this far to throw it away their deaths would be a waste caleb storms off into the woods i'm in the open right now with the horses yeah the horse is there's no person around i walk up to the front of the horse oh who are you freund hi welcome hey that's a pretty good trick you're out for a stroll oh gut how long have you-- you are very tall ja okay did you see everything that happened in here in the last 20 minutes or so hey guys we have a visitor um yes i just was not expe-- you know we've been through-- it's been a long day you don't have any holy abilities by any chance well if you've been watching we have just buried a friend of ours maybe we were premature should we go dig him up that's a stupid question from me i apologize she probably would have offered though you know ja how are you feeling about your chances now after watching the bloodbath she was a horse a moment ago it is a little trick can you turn yourself into anything dangerous have you ever been in a fight hey over there is a tree stump on the side of the road that's the bald one what do you do that sounds good what time of the day is it the fight was in the early morning right okay can i borrow your flask please how old is your boy horse nap i send frumpkin up into the air as an owl yes i'm pulling the first of the three off the road to the side are you able to do just one person could you do the whole group we've taken everything yeah ugh were-goats you and me goblina sam you're bonier than gollum 21 hearty german living you're like the little kid in a christmas story i can't put my arms down i kick my horse along rewind the tape just a little bit we were going at a pretty good pace there yeah we could just take everything off our horses and gather it yeah we lie you over the horse and we put a bunch of shit on top of you yeah then you are going to do some sort of horse magic that makes us-- sorry i'm unclear invisible or-- you cannot but what you can do it's still useful here if the people who are hiding try to look like-- covered in cloth and shit and try to look like cloth-- you can make it more believable this whole pow wow was happening around the bend no we keep going for a while-- keep up appearances yeah you're going carry these two they're both going to lie on top of your horseback too heavy she's like all sticks though she could be on our horse because you and i are skin and bones ja i mutter a few words and suddenly look like an old coot with a band of hair around the sides and my jaw is off to the side a bit and it's missing a few teeth and very squinty that's me yeah that's it stop the game what's the drawing hold it up let's see somebody was talking having a moment then you draw a dick man rissa and robert duvall shut the fuck up yes we have that oh yeah okay do you have any place where we can lay up does she murder everybody or does-- that is correct are you still laying across the back of a horse or have you pulled yourself up of course (spits) in zadash it would look like shit but here it's the belle of the ball are they altruists though or are they mercenaries (horse huffing) keg if we find an alleyway to drop you out of sight of you suddenly appearing can you walk around this town or is that dangerous how stupid is it for you to walk up on open road in this place ja one second though which way from here are these iron chefs located two hours' travel okay in that direction can you describe to me what it looks like is it noticeable no i do not want to go up there now i was thinking of maybe sending my cat but that can wait let's go into this place sitaritic this is what she does in brothels you have had a lot of luck predicting things with this stink pouch what do i smell oh that's pretty good 19 oh well yes i'm convinced we should definitely just march up to the estate well perhaps we don't want to show up on these people's doorstep as the sun is going down why don't we spend a night here you were looking for some companionship you can work on that sure we can talk to the clientele maybe you should hang back how do you mean yeah that's outside of the city into the woods yeah i think so we've been traveling all day we stay here we get up we don't know anything about where the shepherds-- we know nothing about their stronghold just what you're able to tell us but that doesn't tell us how many people are there now what we are going to be up against we talk to the marduns tomorrow figure out the next step from there no we have been together a long time so we're used to-- sure i don't know if that was called for at all shush this one and myself will take one room i will handle the two gold for nott and myself oh boy sure i'm good you know maybe quit while you're ahead nott come on let's go upstairs no something else you're good go on get it on you're probably nailing a 250-year-old welcome to deadwood before going down with nott and caleb i would say when we get up we need to talk for a minute okay i don't care about keg or any of that i want to talk about what you and i are doing i was this close to running off from that road when things turned on us you and i we are going to survive together that is the main thing the dwarf stepped up (snaps) changed my mind like that whatever she said to him he left yeah but we have done a lot and you know what i am about so i just want you and i you and me especially to be on the same page because we have been for months now ja you are my friend i want you to be with me and i want us to live we have done a lot with these people and if we can finesse this and do it in a way that does not throw our lives in the fire there is more to be achieved we will help you get to where you want to get and myself together we will work together with these people yes i like them we are not hiding anymore well not like we used to there is a certain amount of risk to what we are doing and what i want is good for more people than just me well we are about to risk our lives to pull three people we met four or five weeks ago out of the hands of a lot of dangerous people seems like a pretty good offer for them i don't have any family you're the closest thing that i have i have come to rely on you and i am grateful for your company well let's screw our courage to the sticking place and get them out of there he would get more defensive with time i don't know we don't know enough i would like to find out where he sleeps head-on i agree not a good idea we will take a roundabout way let's figure out what we're talking about first i invite her in i don't even say anything just a firm hug let's go down sex bacon (laughter) (long sigh) we are going to go and meet the marduns we are going to ask for ophelia mardun maybe oh not right now but when we are-- ja it's very enigmatic but we will-- okay where are your 20s ashly where are your 20s we'll let you know if we find them come on where does he get such wonderful toys there is a difference between crownsguard and empire soldiers is one higher than the other yeah i don't think we've ever discussed this but is caleb's father crownsguard or empire which is below both of those okay well you're not familiar with this where you are from roll one of your buddies 14 sniff nuts -- giant shitty rooster speak with animals she's an iron shepherd kill her would you like to ask it what is dangerous in the wood three days ja that is not a problem hello ja we are good here we have been traveling a great distance we are here to speak if you don't mind we have a message for ophelia mardun it can only be heard by her we have been charged with this message and no funny business i hope that we could impart our message and be done would you tell her that a very refined gentleman from the south would like to pass his regards to her ja (groans) not very good at all sam and it is a long way yeah only a fool travels alone i'm just smiling at the guards (exhales) we are all going to laugh about this later i promise (nervous laugh) we are good that is correct ja well we will be plain he has sent us he has told us that you are in need of assistance and he has deemed us worthy to provide it (small laugh) not very much fireball (laughter) am i right it's like-- i can be on the shitter if i want to check-- caleb's spells i can be mid dook mid dook and check my spells one more time please your accent is thick no i appreciate hearing the old tongue again some of us are trained killers for sure and we have picked up help as we have seen fit everyone has been carefully selected carefully vetted i'm sure that with your input on their mannerisms and habits their routines we will do quite well we have come a long way is there any-- you know them better than us we're out-of-towners any tips to specifically deal with your problem there we go yeah this is a pre-existing arrangement that's outside of negotiation at the moment i understand we will take care of what you are asking zemnian we're left with guards all right good fellows would you escort us out and point us in the right direction did i see any books on the way out 14 fuck this podunk town you know where you are yeah let's put a little distance between ourselves and this place and this gentleman and i will send frumpkin out to have a look while you look i will say an important point for clarification once we are out of the view of this gentleman guarding the secret entrance caleb walking with poise up to a tree leans against it bends down and has a panic attack stop it i am nauseous let's go kill a bunch of people that is sour let's go 'member 'member clerics four yeah you said yesterday that-- you were a horse first and then you said you could only do it one more time or a certain number of times correct if you were to become say a raccoon right now and go running around that is one time that you cannot become a crocodile to eat somebody's face off okay i think let us reserve that for now because frumpkin can do the job let's get closer to this place and it would only take five minutes he will go yeah i mean i could turn him back into a cat but then he's slower he can't get over the walls maybe how far have we traveled at this point unless you roll high nope sumalee and ducks you guys it's ducks ja okay that's easy i sit down on the ground and send frumpkin into the air (whispering) there is a very large black bear ahead of us with bones coming out of its butt and stuff and it has just laid down for a nap what are we going to do 26 you guys taliesin's a bear (laughter) how dense is the forest around this place there's no manicured open place around it's just nestled among trees around it or-- our lot is hidden in the trees a ways away this is where we send an owl i'm going to send him and it's going to take a moment i want him to go around the entire place and keep an eye on it and watch it maybe 20 or 30 minutes are we good with that how will we-- you and i could talk to the mouse well for now this is easy we're going to send my owl now if anything goes wrong will you please tap three times on my left knee i go blind and send frumpkin up i tell him telepathically to just chill and sit there for a while perception you say 22 how many people do i see down inside total two up top they definitely don't know any ice magic did you say how big the structure within the wall is they find a dead man on their perimeter and know that someone is fucking with them they could be inside this is not any better than our chances on the road looking through frumpkin's eyes was i able to see the entrance through this wall that the guards are up top on what's the way in here no gate or doorway at all solid none of this how do you get out if you are in a mouse the gates are solid that's why i asked possible could you make yourself a very distinct looking mouse like a shock of white hair on the mouse head or something like that something unique correct send in the animals would comprehend languages work with a mouse or no that would be a different spell right speak with animals i agree yeah yeah kit keep it together you must know jareth the goblin king you're buddies with him truth ja but we didn't talk about the first part frumpkin's got to bring her in there buddy don't eat just carry her stay away from the two on the top okay put her by the barrels if you can then come back as he's going i tell him correction find an out of the way place to sit and watch those barrels stealth you say for my owl so i have to go to the other page the owl page which i have ready 13 take your shot does not hit my owl you hear beside you arschloch of the building pov two inches tall this floor upstairs or downstairs squeakers after a while yeah that's a 17 what was that's true did you learn anything many one of these in the mess hall how many people you said two i pull some paper out and say can you draw these rooms that's cool yeah well i like the idea of an extra hand or two to back us up but i also agree with you we go in at night and try to take the guards out who are watching quietly hopefully if that is the case we can go in and get our friends and if we do that successfully then we can burn these ones in their sleep write what you know good game
