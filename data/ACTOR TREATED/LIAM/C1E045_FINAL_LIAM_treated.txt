norman's kickstarter the abcs of rpgs has three days left i backed it immediately because i like d&d and i have kids and you put those two things together and good things happen so that's good three

of ireland into burbank (irish accent) it's fucking irish wool shit help help help help you should be what what it's acid-resistant whatever you want vex'ahlia the same could be said about your new pajamas i think percy is right that we should let it out now because it's a question mark no matter what whatever it's all theories we don't know what we're getting into and better that it pop out now on its own and not while we're facing a fucking beholder percival are there any libraries here what about a personal collection in your family goodberries sure yes yes yes keyleth had a good idea yes i thought we rested before we went down under the water though-- i don't remember resting afterwards and i was there what're you talking about that killed my sister what do you mean well what happened percival you just opened it just like that all right could you do me a favor in the future-- if there is anything that your little heart desires inside of a box-- in the future could you check with my sister or myself first well-- well listen percy we are not playing a game and we will all make mistakes and i wager i will make my fair share i've little doubt and percival i want to apologize i'm sorry but-- and i punch him in his know-it-all fucking mouth goodnight percival (grog voice) go fish keep in mind how confined it is okay and go (laughter) that's more than the price of a book wait 'til it's quiet and i leave the room that i've been given at whitestone and i find my sister's door and i stand outside it and i stare at it for a minute-- and i stealth away 25 and i wait for the door to close and then i walk to keyleth's door and i knock i don't know i go in i don't know all i know is that i felt her i don't know magic i don't know anything i open doors and only when the wind is blowing in the right direction sometimes i think i don't know what happened but i felt her 22 yeah i don't know if i did anything in there and i wouldn't take it back if i did but i don't know what i'm doing i don't know anything about any of that i'll let you keyleth i love you i quickly leave her room go water elemental sorry just one detail from there i went and fell asleep in this idiot's
