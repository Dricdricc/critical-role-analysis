out four globules of light and start casing the room 004041066 --> 004041829 21 on investigation 004124802 --> 004125435 the books are basically mud at this point correct 004244060 --> 004251264 it could also be someone who was having dreams fjord 004510618 --> 004512775 if we are in a group they are they were around the group 004605161 --> 004606707 take your pills travis take your pills 004611657 --> 004613104 how about a high roll nope 004719426 --> 004723690 (singing) caleb takes the rear 004800756 --> 004804096 <i>sechs</i> 004933957 --> 004935169 cocked 005352955 --> 005356300 it was cocked 005358087 --> 005358849 there's too much awesome in one spot 005751935 --> 005753386 i-- shite-- take it 010024885 --> 010028222 there's nothing to do about it 010029985 --> 010033895 i'm good at those 010035368 --> 010037470 that's a six 010042929 --> 010048095 how much did i get harpooned for 11 was it 11 010051743 --> 010052642 it lightninged us 010126661 --> 010128095 shield 010153920 --> 010202259 i've abandoned my son 010259121 --> 010303124 so those two are incapacitated in this second right 010507240 --> 010508612 the one on top is not 010510098 --> 010512436 okay well then i will cast slow on the shallow priest and the one that's laughing in front 010523973 --> 010525974 of me as well as i back away 010525974 --> 010527735 slowness 010531687 --> 010533858 hurts their ac it's a wisdom saving of 16 010539175 --> 010549895 so shallow priest's ac is down by two disadvantage on dex saves and he can only do an 010602200 --> 010604336 action or a bonus not both 010604336 --> 010609752 i back away half my speed towards where everybody is in the boat i move behind my goblin <i>freund</i> 010621639 --> 010625719 (gurgling) okay pretty good 010641229 --> 010646129 negative two to his ac 011228888 --> 011233097 does it get a multiattack or does it just get one attack 011459853 --> 011502089 it's a single attack 011503015 --> 011506052 its speed is halved 011601441 --> 011608225 make a save 011612774 --> 011615103 let him let her 012025467 --> 012027305 from where i'm standing i see nott firing drunkenly up at an angle i'm going to move 012144460 --> 012150054 forward and peek up in the direction that she is looking and see the shallow king and say <i>fick</i> 012150054 --> 012152938 <i>das</i> i will cast magic missile at level three 012152938 --> 012154016 no it's <i>fick das</i> 012157312 --> 012159965 a total of 19 012217626 --> 012222193 the five of the magic missiles will spiral around fish dick's head and come in at a different 012234893 --> 012237292 angle and five of them go (impacts) 012237292 --> 012243288 i will step back in five feet 012312891 --> 012317499 all right let's treat this situation with the seriousness it demands i douse the lights and 012603191 --> 012609268 bring frumpkin down onto my own head like a mask so i can see through frumpkin vision 012609268 --> 012613330 like a zorro mask with frumpkin's beak right there 012619074 --> 012627592 little zemnian man who's like can't believe i didn't think of this sooner 012630977 --> 012638243 no <i>ein bisschen</i> 012707461 --> 012709534 yes 012919104 --> 012921780 19 012935805 --> 012937076 i would 013245092 --> 013251760 maybe bioluminescent just like an underwater creature 013305761 --> 013307754 i'll be with nott 013347022 --> 013351587 caleb and nott are together 013415701 --> 013419055 it is like the beginning of the campaign 013422345 --> 013423433 yeah 013617711 --> 013621870 okay so i can do that i will send frumpkin low along the bottom in the direction of this 013630331 --> 013631401 thing stealthily 013631401 --> 013633461 ooh let's take a looky-loo for the moment 013636350 --> 013644224 but i did see where this flashing source was 013752572 --> 013753905 occasional okay so it's not like there was a creature that frumpkin and i were able to aim 013758044 --> 013800695 towards it was just this thing that was appearing and disappearing 013800695 --> 013804945 yeah 013811497 --> 013818460 so we're connecting those two groups 013845605 --> 013846409 we're spread out a little 013847594 --> 013848385 frumpkin will piss out some ink and use a bonus action to dash back towards the group 013917697 --> 013923389 i tell him to come back and come out and say there's a lot of things just ahead of us over 013931517 --> 013933046 the ridge 013933046 --> 013934735 flashing moving things things that are alive 013937900 --> 013938943 more than one i think 013940918 --> 013942097 i think so 013945123 --> 013946582 or something large with many parts but i could not tell too well 013950764 --> 013952737 i could not tell you 013955787 --> 013958623 no it's murky down here 014002074 --> 014006633 i am reaffixing frumpkin to my face 014053440 --> 014055316 but maybe-- 014106607 --> 014108771 just you two right is this the group 014225373 --> 014230229 okay 014234154 --> 014238577 so the ground is littered with coins outside of this 014336055 --> 014341159 it will also put it at alert even before we get there you send it in and it sees this other 014457324 --> 014459531 jester and then it is ready for a fight 014459531 --> 014506605 well-- 014532339 --> 014539352 we're on this ridge 014542826 --> 014547533 what do we see to the sides and-- so there's a cavern straight ahead facing towards us 014555163 --> 014559576 that is my point i think we quietly go around and get on top of the house and throw 014613860 --> 014618267 whatever the bait is in front and then we're back here for whatever comes out 014618267 --> 014619496 take our time 014635354 --> 014639984 sitting on top of it 014646109 --> 014650242 you just turned 12 years old 014810579 --> 014812559 yes dm 014828451 --> 014830905 shitty rolls at this table 014956917 --> 015004568 i'm going to keep an eye on our rear 015203593 --> 015208357 that's all the show is now that's the rest of the campaign 021342226 --> 021352370 the hell is wrong with us tonight 021459165 --> 021500373 what on earth are we doing 021824169 --> 021826081 mine is functional 021835043 --> 021838878 i am not what are we

didn't know that was for me 023258029 --> 023300413 can't do the math right now 023306464 --> 023307054 then i'm good 023308564 --> 023310867 i thought that was for one person 023313461 --> 023315514 i can light it up in here if we want or do we want to 023354377 --> 023357378 <i>ja</i> 023401155 --> 023402613 all right i'm going to put the string of globules up the passage 023406374 --> 023409219 at least so far they are not harassing us 023622129 --> 023625093 expeditious retreat as a reaction 023712859 --> 023715912 yep 023716554 --> 023721701 whatever i've got ten minutes of zip baby let's go forward 023739857 --> 023744122 i'll say that they're 20 feet ahead of us and 20 feet behind 023825637 --> 023828388 has it been over ten minutes 024539993 --> 024541574 yeah it lasts ten minutes

pick up on the fact that caduceus was looking at glyphs in the wall did i see those as well 025039558 --> 025040618 no okay 025041711 --> 025046973 what you told me was that studying this thing it seems to require elements to set it in 025339221 --> 025342787 motion how did you describe it 025342787 --> 025350378 it is the ring 025539510 --> 025547045 there's the throne over there 025612501 --> 025615059 so is nott the brave 025707313 --> 025710968 four 025801821 --> 025803698 i'm assuming the ten minutes for expeditious is gone from studying the table 025808158 --> 025813029 a minute or two left okay great i'll take it 025817282 --> 025822733 son of a bitch 030238818 --> 030252157 frightened 030253211 --> 030254586 fuck you come at me you sea hag 030334901 --> 030335695 another one oh

031301703 seven total so i got that 031303333 --> 031305610 but expeditious retreat is gone 031312389 --> 031313119 is mage armor gone 031314271 --> 031317559 if i crouch behind the table from where dashilla is will i get half cover or something 031430838 --> 031433122 okay so i am going to do that and then i am going to-- 031435898 --> 031437481 i would like to stay semi-crouched to try and get some cover from that thing 031443072 --> 031444424 thank you and i pull a twisted blackened twig out and point it at her and cast witch bolt 031453321 --> 031454522 at fourth level 031454522 --> 031455635 that's a ranged spell attack correct 031507946 --> 031512379 plus the bless 031514034 --> 031515290 travis and spell attack is 13 plus the bless is a d4 031522222 --> 031522933 it's a d4 so 14 031528783 --> 031531821 blast it gone 031533457 --> 031540095 them's the breaks them's the breaks 031554787 --> 031557631 the murk it's just physical crap filling the water 032722034 --> 032727805 desperation 032840782 --> 032842993 he just threw the basketball over his shoulder from half court 032918207 --> 032923527 it's not necessarily a magical effect 033054161 --> 033055724 if it's magic 033059417 --> 033105699 that's why i asked if it was shit in the water 033115298 --> 033119976 where are they 033152775 --> 033154003 i'm going to cast detect magic because i have a suspicion that she has something on her or 033202846 --> 033209121 perhaps the orb in her head then i will down the potion that's in my pocket as a bonus action 033209121 --> 033210626 yeah 033211232 --> 033216823 ah 033219334 --> 033222187 okay so i get six points back from that i am going to move towards fjord and crouch behind 033237248 --> 033238349 the table 033238349 --> 033239046 a little closer this way so i'd be between fjord and the table <i>ja gut</i> 033242984 --> 033244506 yes trying to get cover again 033246376 --> 033250467 so it doesn't affect just movement it's everything 033317874 --> 033327080 oh yeah 14 033341262 --> 033346231 ah you were fjord in that moment 033351358 --> 033356110 (laughter) 033356110 --> 033357016 i'll bring back cookies 033411430 --> 033413022 sorry 033413695 --> 033414886 14 033910019 --> 033910782 yeah this is a fucked situation i am going to hold magic missile at second level if she appears 034529858 --> 034531144 just in case 034532495 --> 034536364 that's pitiful 034551152 --> 034558846 oh get her 034559952 --> 034601601 shuriken 034604659 --> 034608849 you're right there she probably busted everything to get there 034613341 --> 034615128 14

when you've done that 035201119 --> 035201639 back in the chamber detect magic is still up does caleb see anything with an arcane glow in 035207342 --> 035209614 this room other than what fjord picked up 035209614 --> 035212728 so none of the shit around the edges okay i guess i will start studying the runes on the 035221914 --> 035227340 walls to see how they contribute to this mystery 035227340 --> 035229419 this gets the d4 035234306 --> 035237529 14 035238474 --> 035249767 on a whim i'm going to use a 2nd-level spell slot to cast comprehend language instantly 035313578 --> 035318842 to see if anything becomes clearer and i have to touch the table and touch the walls to do that 035318842 --> 035326604 what are we doing here fjord 035339153 --> 035343520 we should go she's not going to follow us to the surface 035514855 --> 035519263 what are your goals your goal is what to-- 035529273 --> 035532620 you know what avantika talked about you know what she wanted you think this has nothing 035537845 --> 035539537 to do with that 035539537 --> 035546926 yeah but if that was some sort of lock you want to put the key in that lock 035557829 --> 035558674 do you feel any different 035601397 --> 035611716 wrapping up in here 035845668 --> 035859817 i'm going to go fuck a ghost 040011518 --> 040018741 too slow shit stain 040030568 --> 040036299 ghost puncher 040039991 -->

assume that next game we're going to start with a fresh day so i want to toss in 041448083 --> 041456398 that caleb goes to whatever chamber they're in and he pulls out the other book from his holsters and 041456398 --> 041458953 he writes for hours 041458953 --> 041506720 i came out of that with a favor 041558505 --> 041559859 travis and
