automaton a robit into cloud did we do that already does that work on doty tary we can camp it up if we need to lionel this is really awesome for real you're going to like this this is 100% the spot i'll wait until she has looked and then i'll take a look let the expert what did you find out well vex went this way is it in that direction do we see footprints going in a direction though you described but there's a bad door somewhere around here a bad face yeah slow down you're doing all the shit what if they still see the arrow fly in i'm going to assume that before we heard her gasping keyleth was filling us in i'm going to go check out the top (mist sound) well i'm not going to stick my face in something can i stealth as cloud i'm wind i'm not going high i'm going through the treetops all right i will that is very good that is a 35 i did it's on the plastic oh man i love you so wholeheartedly and on a regular basis you kick me in the goolies i don't understand it seven luck it's not per game it's per day so if we go to bed it resets fart knockers i'm doing investigation that's 18 okay so it's not a volcanic hole or anything there's just a secret entrance i return to my loving sister kind and good i land and say i saw another face but i didn't stick my face in it because that would be stupid which i could not find i mean only if you want to i remember that being a sore spot could you see through the mouth of this face that you saw when you were in there so you couldn't see through the mouth it was just a dark maw i'll go with you any footprints weird what is it kiki but you saw no footprints inside is the plan to camp out tonight in the mansion by a fire whichever was the light seen by the arrow so you're looking at the face oh it keeps going i will take a look at it and look at the area and see if there's anything left to it or other traps further down 19 i'm going to stay 30 feet in front of the group and continue to check for traps 37 check for traps check for traps check for traps and are there any tracks or footprints ahead of pike and i survival ooh that's good 19 both ways shite not perception 21 and is it dead silent in here 24 over the earring not alone not alone something up ahead i don't think we're camping what do y'all want to do natural 20 kiki a couple more faces can you shimmy your way up here please left hand green right over there right up ahead 30 feet both sides grab her shoulder move slowly past pull pickle along and continue to carefully search 18 that's at least an 18 oh it's better than 18 it is 26 we're here for your friends right 32 that's not going to work we've got company coming i actually stay halfway between both i'm creeping back broken clock twice a day well done how's the menu wise do you want to play some cards or something want to go back to what your room catch up play cards boy it is more extravagant in here than i remember no but there was just one mirror on the ceiling and now there are three yeah that's weird do you want to play cards yeah i'll pretend to know what those are let's do hearts okay no idea how to play this game but vax does all right so catch me up man what happened in the beginning what happened right after you left first couple of weeks so how did you get to marquet and that somehow stumbled into all this that is hard to believe i don't think it's true oh surely not no that actually is not surprising i mean i'm not going to lie i think it's pretty cool i mean you did save a fucking continent you are scary it is true a bit you've had a year to clear your head you think it was just a bit you know there are multiple times we'd all be dead if it weren't for you you know that you know that and the same could be said for any of us that's true but you take any one piece away and the tower falls jenga man you know it was ugly on all sides when you left but i've always understood why you left i admire it i wish my dad gave half as much effort as you have this year or i used to anyway you know we've missed you everybody has it is true and i certainly have and if i did anything or said anything to make you feel lonely i'm sorry i really am fucking missed you man fucking every time i know i miss that flair well i don't know yeah he's good looking that's true i don't know that we have-- i mean we've scattered a bit i live in zephra now i'm on holiday yeah pretty much yeah it's all zephra heights no i'm very happy right now yeah i know i was happy for a long time i mean this is no this is part of the bargain yeah but you know i have sunshine in my life every day so it's all right fucking the best man it's the fucking best yeah but you know all i care about is that you're happier now than you were you seem a little happier well that's a step up and kaylie is she better off well that's great well again a lot of hard shit was said on your way out in many directions and the way i look at it it's to be expected we went through hell together that's going to have an effect but even the ones who are angry at you they did miss you and family doesn't break apart that easy don't scare away just be patient clap him on the back of the head i can i love you man it's good to see you i don't know how to play this game but thanks for the conversation that's been about an hour i think yeah i walk away not even chicken salad in this mansion said vex we wait till morning and we throw pike out the door they're all bones this is a world of magic and delight stay in the mansion forever back at the breakfast table just before they make whatever loud sound they're doing it's good it's almond milk but i like cream a little bit (explosion) area of effect y'all come on cleric here he goes math still math more math i walk back to the kitchen and start clearing people's plates you've got to appreciate that travis i come out with fresh coffee for percy and keyleth what happened why is it so tense in here all of a sudden it's a stupid name yes everybody quiet down (whispering) can i murder one first (whispering) thank you i thought she said the door was just barely open now wait a second 43 twins are in the front (dagger throwing noise) on the left oh 29 and this is assassinate critical hit 78 on the first hit and i use a bonus action for an offhand attack and i got a critical on it i rolled a 20 let's both check natural 20 20 spick and span mack spatter thank you we have a box of crazy shit will you look at it and tell us what we're looking at tary i am an assassin of the highest caliber it says that on the paper matt i mean poorer but richer freddie where's fred what's this well i think you might like this thing you could come up with very creative solutions with that wait hold on would you like this either of you it's not my bag we should go well let's go quietly you and i take point twins are in the lead i rolled a two so it's a 27 yeah you've got to juggle these balls twins in the lead point traps all that 18 nobody move don't move sam i'm using my first luck of the new day okay the first one of the day constitution saving throw 18 but armor after those faces is set to necrotic damage i rolled an 18 clicking my boots i'm doing this 31 perception does it sound like anything i've ever heard before natural 20 i was wondering all right those 60 seconds have passed do you want to go elemental i'll have a look as well 24 i'll roll with percy and keyleth combat here we go this is the real deal 15 sunshine roll high feeblemind on the dragon taste the rainbow let me just reiterate we always appreciated scanlan so long pawns boots on poof go the wings i have two actions left it's really hard to see how far am i from skeletal minotaur and nowhere on the board are any of my allies within melee combat range of any enemy that's what i figured okay so i'm going to use my two remaining actions to throw daggers at minotaur skeleton i'm 40 feet away i'm in range i didn't say it on the first i have it if i choose it but i don't want to choose it i have sharpshooter right so i ignore three-quarters cover so the first one is a 19 good and the second one-- oh that hits for sure that's a 16 28 okay so for the first one i'm going to unload some smite into this motherfucker because i know he's undead that is three plus eight is 11 plus psychic damage is 17 plus 3d8 because he's undead so 17 plus eight is 25 29 36 for the first attack fucking feathers buddy and then the second one is four plus the smite and i get four plus eight is 12 15 22 wait i can only smite once per round i'm also going to use my movement is there enough room to fly safely over big skeleton then i want to get into the back corner closest to liam on the map yeah 120 feet of movement yeah as far back from the enemies as i can be that's good done y'all motherfuckers need sarenrae well you got a 20 on the last one well we've all got to eat a little humble pie every once in a while even you wait smite i missed you shorthalt me up in the corner it's what i do mother bitch he's at the bottom sorry honey you're fine oh you're dead she can go wherever the fuck she wants matt mercer in drag shitting all over us two eights holy fuck back into the skittle fuck you delilah holy shit come on baby and if you make it in you're in a death box scanlan shorthalt killed by roygbiv congratulations you're in a prison cell with charles manson hi my name's jeffrey dahmer welcome to my prismatic sphere oh i'm up lionel is right on that dark paladin right all right i would like to use my movement to fly it's probably not all of it but 120 feet to get to his backside and stab him in the back we'll start with that that is a 19 all right so that is sneak attack damage he gets three plus eight is 11 plus where the hell did my d8 go okay 16 plus sneak attack damage (counting) 45 so that guy took 45 in the back perfect so that's movement action and what i have left is hasted action and bonus action so i would like to use my bonus action to zip over to pike 120 feet yeah and use my hasted action to carry her out of here out where there's nobody towards the end of your map that's 60 feet that's great i give her a bonus-bonus action to tousle her hair next you're a fucking beast advantage yeah yeah motherfucker (motorcycle revving) but we're way in the back we'll have several problems if keyleth dies do you have a giant crate of the things she can turn into sorry matt and are the wings schlorped back in i mean she knows what she's doing she knows how it works we don't know why she's here but she figured shit out the last time if you lose your brain you can't do it so why not do i feel anything sense anything from my patron yeah use my last luck of the day same thing it's shit seven yeah that asshole you've got five is the gate safe for us to travel suggestion how did ripley return-- that's what i meant to say delilah yeah he didn't know the answer to the last one so he might not know the answer is there
