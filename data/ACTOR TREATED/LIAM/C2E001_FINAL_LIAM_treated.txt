has anybody seen you-- seen you seen you i do did you make it back here okay at night yeah you are did you have the mask on well we-- (sighs)-- discussed coming to a bigger town it's going to be a little more difficult now you can't go-- it was easier on outskirts it was easier in farms but we can't do that here okay well i think today you should have the mask on at all times it's better when we're working together if you need to steal something do it with my help all right back up the conversation a minute thank you i would not be alive if you had not-- you saved my life so thank you yesterday was really not great sure sure we will are you hungry well nott what are we going to do today i can go down and get breakfast and bring it up here at least-- i don't know i mean i'm a little wary of just splashing back into the town right away always all right well let's get something to eat then okay sure is that easy to do find a seat is this how d&d works a trost for each of us please yes i need books that's true but did you find drink yesterday how much so that's also on the to-do list then all right okay so we'll do that first i take the last piece i'm putting my hand on my purse those coins went all over the floor i did it's on the table though so i think on the table it will stay i don't think that's true-- a what now no i've bathed before yeah i know what a bath is i've only just met you hi i'm caleb are you checking your dnd beyond specs just-- nott never mind never mind could i get another trost over here please i'm going to put my hand up and say quietly to nott the moneypot is not for them it's not for them it's for farmers okay but i said it really quietly (laughter) but she can hear my little whisper i mean i'm sorry not to be blunt but you know it's pretty obvious goblins are not welcome strolling about that's right she's my companion she's my friend there's nothing to make a big deal about that's why she's wrapped up just leave it please somebody asked why she was wrapped up somebody said the words-- this is liam-- why are you all wrapped up vaxleth is over it's so over so a literal and figurative peacock while everybody's watching this shit happen may i cast detect magic yeah we can go also for the record there was nothing magic about that maybe he's good at reading people but that was not magic nott-- (strained laugh) that's silly (snaps) well it is a he this is my cat frumpkin frumpkin yes you can call him frumpkin that was a little show gift from marisha so this is frumpkin you know sometimes less is more i telepathically tell frumpkin to jump up and sit in the lap of the woman in the monk's robes who just made a big scene and hopefully keep her occupied with being cute sure right now he likes you what do you mean a fake cat he's both a real cat and a magic cat do you feel him i don't know what the fifth edition rules are-- shit (laughter) it's a very fancy place i have heard of it yeah that's a tricky question i studied when i was younger and then i gave it up for a while i picked it up again recently it's all book-learned maybe in a little while well-- and i pull apart the lapels of my coat i have books in what modern-day people like to think of as holster-straps but there's a book hanging here bap-bap-bap the books are right here i have these but these are heirlooms family heirlooms so i don't share those but-- no i like to read that's all and i'm a bit of a self-starter so i have to find-- i mean good luck at the academy that's rough i hear all i know is how hard it is to get into listen i would not be sitting here if it were not for you do whatever you like it's all right i will front some coin for you to play this game i will give you a silver piece wish i had more you're only an hour and a half in because you saved my life yesterday you may have one more silver piece nott nott that's fine that's fine she won my two silver pieces we'll just leave it at that that's okay she's very jumpy sometimes you can understand we've been living in the woods for a long time every time we come near any place like this we're attacked jumped followed so i apologize on behalf of-- that's making it worse no i insist a round of trosts for both our tables please not baumbauch what is a training game it's fine it's water under the bridge it's fine it's all right if you feel slightly worse there's a drink on me that's later tonight though isn't it dm did i tear that i can't remember that was what it was yeah do you know something i shockingly think that's not a bad idea yesterday was a very bad day well yes bottom line can you hang with the goblin we will mourn her tschuss not much we were going to sample the different trosts and i wanted to maybe do some book browsing nothing major there are two others to choose from here dm which one is the one that everybody knows has got the blessing of fryda langer shit no i'm just saying the one that you swindled it's got the blessing of the big cheese here we don't need it it's just pleasurable to have a trost is what they say she kind of needs it can we just bring my book-browsing down to a single roll to see if anything of use-- i take it easy i have one more in the first half of the day and one in the second half --you are poisoned is that where i went the last time except not as myself so i'll go as myself all right don't fuck me vax that is-- yeah the thing about even a light german accent is that when you say vex and vax it's the same shit (laughter) and the person who ran this place was an older man right just sipping tea i'm sorry you have a nice selection here do you mind if i ask-- i haven't seen any other booksellers of any kind in town i'm not really looking for anything on farming so much is there anywhere else i could look into zadash no it's a fine selection sorry how much for this book on hoe technique oh i'm very embarrassed i'm sorry i gave away my last two silver pieces i gave away my last two silver pieces so maybe i can earn it back and come back later this week yes my name is caleb widogast okay good day thank you you little fucking poltergeist frumpkin come on oh yes matt's got to make cat sounds now by the way dm can i ask-- sometime in the entire day when nott was getting wasted could i have spent an hour using arcane recovery to gain back that one spell slot i used this morning magic grenade lobbed in by foster at the last second do they get stored in some sort of locker or something that seems fair-ish to me well that's funny because your name is also beau i pull-- all i have is a dagger but i just hand it to yasha yes here you go i open up the coat just so she can see the books i'm practically concave is it concave or convex i forget out of game i just drag nott five feet over that is two strikes against you i think we should really just sort of enjoy the show tonight well i'll handle that for you okay when someone is a goblin in the middle of a town where people hate goblins-- technically i dragged her away but you know d&d is funny with what is known and not rip it's pronounced 'felching' (laughter) nott do you have five copper no i'm not asking i was going to help you but if you have it you're good i'm going to keep my hand on my meager purse for the evening the miniatures come out guys probably but then the third campaign begins 11 you're a cock i would like to use my movement to push as far into the crowd as i can half-movement that's fine sure i just want people in front of me that's great that's exactly fine with me and i will pull out the diamond and cast chromatic orb and i will send a ball of cold at the creature that fee-ord-- fjord-- yes here it comes my goodness that is a 17 no that is nine (thicker german accent) now is the part where we dance he's killing the memory of scanlan that's our mo baby oh pretty good that is 17 for me what are you at girl level two that's major all right i know that it's restricted movement but i will push this way through the crowd so that i have a clearer shot as far as i can and then i will re-up with chromatic orb i certainly don't want to do that i want to stay in the crowd behind people and i will do chromatic orb again but this time i'm going to set it to acid so see if it hit oh that's not good it's 11 hope that didn't hit anyone you said superman punch man i would agree it seemed to happen with this-- have you had the elderly or the sick in these tents before i mean i'm sorry but we're basically a group of strangers most of us don't know each other we all have the same story there was a show an old man became a thing and we helped destroy it this one destroyed it what more do you want from us caleb widogast while that was happening i'm close to the edge of the tent and at some point i just (snap) and summoned frumpkin i have a 30-feet outside the tent so frumpkin's out there yeah yeah it's a good spot oh my goodness look at all the 20s taliesin rolled tonight
