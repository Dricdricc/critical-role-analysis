why don't i go and then you can go hey you guys i just want to make sure all of you are aware-- this is going to be so awkward-- i want to make sure you're all aware of a kickstarter that's out there that is put up by a good friend of mine named joe madureira now if you don't know who joe is he is a comic book rock god and a game developer when i was a teenager he made a comic book called battle chasers look here's mine from when i was 16 joe i fell in love with it nobody does art like joe mad does and i've followed his art for years and years even when i fell out of comic books i was checking in with hellboy and i was checking in with joe mad and then years later i got cast in a game called darksiders as one of the horsemen of the apocalypse i played war and i walked into the room and joe mad was in the fucking room and then we became friends so that game was amazing darksiders is a beautiful game it just reeked of joe's art style and now he has formed another company called airship syndicate and they have a kickstarter up they are making a game called battle chasers oh shoot i didn't put the thing that comes-- oh nightwar battle chasers nightwar they've already hit their goal but there are stretch goals they are making an rpg sort of in the ilk of jrpgs like final fantasy and chrono trigger and it's just going to be bathed in the glory of joe mad's amazing art style so they've hit their goal but the bigger the budget the better the game is going to be i backed it already and you guys should at least go check it out a lot of love for joe mad and one the main character from battle chasers kind of looks like pike eight nine ten 11 primarily doing stuff saturday that we know we're waiting to see what's going on sunday weekend i'll go halfsies i think we need a little history lesson here-- we've never questioned it before we've never wanted to make you uncomfortable but we're about to walk into a party and i feel like we need a bit of a history lesson you witnessed none of these deaths and the remains of your family were they killed by the sword percival you don't really have a choice in the matter my sister and i know a little piece of your pain i'm not going to get into it but there's nothing she and i can do we can find reparations for you we will how does that cap work we got seven days i can make you look like anything i can talk to the right people and get you the right paperwork and you can be anyone and no one will know a fucking difference we don't know if these people are straight up gangster or if there's something supernatural seriously supernatural about them that hat would probably work on 80% of people but i don't know we don't know anything about them yes keyleth can you-- kiki can you and scanlan fly to kraghammer two days is the horse riding hard what about an eagle we don't really have a lot of money at the moment you haven't been scratching yourself have you i should probably tag along good try do you remember us yes i was hoping to catch up with him we've been gone a while and i was hoping to trade news with glorious gilmore is he not in at the moment i'd hate to pull him away from business i don't want to get in the way of his business i mean i am rather sad not to see him but no i don't think that would be a course of action we'd want to take let him continue to set up can you get a message to him though well tell him vax'ildan and friends visited we're in the city for a week vax'ildan that's with an a not an e we're here for a week i don't know if he's going to be back from westruun before then but if he is tell him to get word to me i'm very interested in exchanging news for the past few weeks thank you we're here late in the day are you still open for business you didn't have to go to all that trouble to come back here no we're seeing to different bits of business i turn back to him i walk forward with hands out i walk up to him take him by the head give him a good european-style kiss just about here-- right there-- come back and say there is so much to talk about where can we be alone see to whatever business you need to those beads i walk right in follow him in i walk over and i sit down opposite him and i say before we talk about anything i feel like i should apologize because although we didn't have any sort of written agreement you and i are friends aren't we and i was supposed to help bring your brand wherever we went and i thought that would be possible we came back from the underdark we had a very hard time some of the hardest weeks of my life i haven't delivered on my promise and i mean to but i haven't yet i apologize wholeheartedly i'm sorry in addition to that i am changed and promises mean more to me even more than they did before and i promise to follow through in the interest of time for the game dm vax tells the whole story of the underdark of the horn of how close it was i spoke too soon no after ten minutes of finishing all that of telling every tiny detail if you mind me backtracking i briefly place my hand on top of his and say it was terrible i've never seen anything like it now we're back we're in our home and i'm hoping to learn how uriel is doing how the city is faring is there any news things are ill in kraghammer they still haven't seen the last of their troubles but i'm also concerned for our new home here and westruun how's it going you're a busy man have you any time for leisure you seem a tad weary is there anything i can do to help you that will happen i did not even mean to discuss this coming here but i noticed coming in a sigil under your carpet i had no intention of this but we need to get back to kraghammer in a bit of a hurry and i certainly have no abilities but do you remember my friend tiberius dragonborn fellow he needs to run an errand back in kraghammer is there any way you could hook us up with a favor i just want to send the lizard to dwarf town do you think we could make that happen understood i don't want to push my luck i'm pretty magic-stupid correct one last it's small or it's boring it's business i need a dagger i don't want one for free or anything i want to purchase it but we're a little low on funds the reason tiberius needs to go to kraghammer is because we're owed a large sum of money what would the credit entail i was going to-- what was that retrieve god i've been in the underdark so long what was the deal understood no we almost did that correct dm that's what we almost did but we didn't do it you offered it i would be interested-- gilmore i really just need a quick favor and i mean to pay you back quickly i need a dagger for something not your best dagger not your shittiest dagger either i just need something nice how much would a fine dagger cost something that would be good in a fight and could i pay you back in a couple of days once tiberius returns from kraghammer can i please purchase three of those done i reach out and i give his cheek a little bubby-squeeze and i clap him on the cheek and say i'm good on my word and you're a good friend thank you gilmore i know you're good on your word keyleth scanlan very good warm in here i'm good no everything's good here just not everywhere else i'm using my earring on the walk home does it work i don't know what the range is tiberius can you hear me tibs hello oh all right gilmore has an in he said we just need to mention his name and we're through we can send tiberius through holy shit i've never flown before this is amazing is this going to stick tiberius we're all going all of us i have an errand to run sorcerers they improvise while they're doing that i stealth away from the group i rolled a 32 yeah i'm totally down an alleyway through the alley onto another main thoroughfare i grab a random person on the street excuse me i'm looking for a specific butcher harold the butcher do you know i think he's in the upper slums can you point me toward him where's the upper slums upper slums please i don't even say anything else i just walk i don't know how long that will take me yes i see a stunted old woman and stop her on the street and say grandmother i'm looking for harold the butcher do you know where i can find him i'd like to go stealth i rolled a 20 do i see kynan anywhere no and it's a home it's a business and a home okay i'd like to go around the back of the building and scope it out there's nobody in i'd like to at the window listen and use perception to see if i can tell if anyone's inside yeah that's 25 is it one floor the building it's one floor is the window locked all right i'm climbing in it's a family residence where kynan lives are there bedrooms they're not trapped are they so i'm going to crouch down and push open the first door what do i see oh no not that one there were two other doors weren't there there's one other door that's the one and there's no sign that this is a youth's bedroom or father's bedroom what can i glean from what i see in here i'm going to use luck that's better 22 and the father went out the other way all right so i creep back out the window and i go out the front and i knock really loud on the front door hello i'm sorry i don't mean to bother you i know you've closed up shop i'm actually not looking to buy anything i owe your son a bit of money i lost some money in a wager we made on a dog fight and i was hoping to reimburse him do you know where he is you think he'll be back i want to leave something with you yes i take 50 gold of what i have left and i leave it with him and i take out three daggers i can hear my sister's voice in the back of my head i want to use insight on him to make sure he's trustworthy oh that's good that's 20 just give him the 50 gold thank you and i leave i head back to the keep another nine hours yeah you 7500 people fucking thank you man thank you all right i got him i'm going to feed you so much chocolate johnny kraghammer we're above base-- an arm is not a scalp it's this (singing) roll high in what circumstance would testicle advantage come into play he's doing it excuse me as soon as they left trinket and i we left and i went to the nearest shop and bought a lot of pink ribbon and i have been furiously tying bows all through trinket's hair the entire time they've been gone keyleth has been weaving flowers in and i have been knotting braids started at the head and then worked all the way down trinket's back and down the tail the entire time feverishly i feed him a piece of chocolate at that moment side note i let trinket give me bear-kisses all over my face vex never lets trinket kiss her face and it's so sad and i let him just drool all over my face everywhere what is the piece of art immortalized upon a piece of wood for my share just my share and i take advantage of her good mood and say i just want 1200 gold and i won't ask for any more of it any of the amount percy you go to work we'll figure out everything else what if he rolls a 20 yeah what are we checking out though i mean it's not like the briarwoods are out in public we don't know anything about them can you remind me and the group the dinner i know it's with the briarwoods but who else is it with uriel or who is it with we maybe want to talk to uriel you think uriel might be in the briarwoods' pocket and pass on that we're aware that's true percival there's nothing i want more than for you to take bad news and unload it on every one of those motherfucking shits but if you're me and i'm nobody if i'm a ghost i can help take out one or two how many days left can i ask you a question dm i have in the assassin perks i think it says seven days i can be anybody as long as i don't do anything else and i work on getting the right papers and no one will know who i am 100% but it's six days so am i shit out of luck this is why i was talking about it yesterday motherfuckers you make me invisible yeah one of you two percival i trust you implicitly you have earned that trust do you believe them to be evil in the purest sense that's all we need i repaid my debt to gilmore another thing that i did was go off and get a lathering cream and the second to last night after i took grog out to the tavern i bought him a lot of drinks i didn't shave off his whole beard only half of it this much dm i rolled a natural 20 i have advantage on stealth checks and i rolled an 18 and a 20 natural 20 after the 20 i'm using luck okay so i rolled a 21 21 why did he trip me and make me eat shit two months ago taliesin marisha and you have no idea it was me make an intelligence check make him make an intelligence check he is dumb as a post why does he know-- magic is mysterious why couldn't you grow half a beard due to magic sorry big guy roll high come on (singing) circus bear roly-poly is cute cannonball is-- roly-poly do i still have the finery i wore to the velvet cabaret all right so we have to worry about you grog you pull the hairs out don't forget his exotic facial hair as well that probably lends to the whole package this looks very good thank you grog no i don't want to cloud my thinking before we go up against the briarwoods where are we nearing the palace hit me no promises you've got to go more nasal taliesin while all this is going on can you describe are the briarwood couple together seated next to each other i intend to be behind them but what's behind them like and behind the servants is a wall so there's lots of open busy crowded space okay all right i'm going to drink the potion of climbing that grog gave me and i'm spidering up the wall and i'd love while listening to all this to make an insight check on them just as they talk just for funsies just to see if they seem like sacks of shit luck oh not that lucky this is going to be very low yeah never mind low very low it's very hard to read them upside-down what's the gentleman who realized that i was there earlier before we came in oh that's all right i'm clicking my boots of haste and scuttling along the ceiling back towards the door am i finding what's-his-face i'm doubling back i'm following oh that fast all right how close to the door are the guards right up against it i yank off my serpent belt and throw it as far as i can not as far as i can 20 feet and set it in motion so there's now a snake in the hall 20 feet in front of these guys so one's 20 feet away now 25 feet away and one guy stayed i drop and i'm going to bean him on the head like his name is kynan okay advantage on attack rolls against any creature that hasn't taken a turn in combat yet and i'm invisible so that's an 18 that is 29 to hit using the blunt end i just want to knock him out doubled 12 17 23 24 26 so 52 plus-- no i mean if i am as skilled a rogue as i am how could i not just want to knock somebody out and not unintentionally-- ten on top of the 52 hand on the door is it locked okay so i flip my hood over my head and i quietly go in the door yeah i know they're both at the bed i got a 25 for stealth and it didn't work all right oh sorry sorry i heard a noise in here i work for the city i apologize that was really stupid as you were i walk out i'll use my last luck of the day didn't do it same thing nine 11 yeah yes ma'am oh i'm a guard i mean there's not really a name for what i do i work for uriel i just-- i'm security ma'am and i thought i heard a noise in here and i heard a body fall i thought-- sounded like a body fell i'm backing up as i'm talking i'm right at the door i didn't shut it behind me i just cracked it open that's crazy yep and i run not good it's an eight this is awkward ma'am i'm just trying to do my job that's cool like attacking an inanimate door i'm sorry you're such a nervous fellow come on how am i going to play my second character unless i die now i regret nothing
