you don't slow your roll loot crate is going to poach you taking the initiative this one came to my room then inside i think we've probably been quiet for a while staring at the ceiling and after a while finally say we've really fucked things up haven't we i need to tell you i know with all that's happened between my new patron and my sister pretending to gag literally every time we attempt to share a word together and mostly my own being fucked up in the head for weeks now that i've pushed all of you away you most of all because i've been afraid you would-- i'm sorry and you didn't deserve any of that keyleth i need you to know through all of that everything nothing has changed about how i-- we've had so many near-misses and now finding tiberius death is unavoidable and it's all the more reason for life to be lived and it doesn't matter to me what this is what we call it if you are willing to spend some time any time with me then i will simply count myself lucky to have it you're very dear to me maybe so (sniffles) i'm sorry i love you that's pretty fucking great i tackle her into a bit of a hug into the bed we're already on the bed sleeping in and the means of travel is when we were last there hadn't they talked about a brass or bronze dragon but there are brass dragons as you well know is that overkill we'd have to convince a dragon not capture a dragon he wants to help he does we don't necessarily have to sacrifice a dragon we're fighting a war here they're fuckers well i'm talking about a dragon couldn't we try to talk a dragon into helping us do what we're doing they're not all evil are they they're not we don't have the troll dick anymore that's gone i was about to say yeah we put into the contract that it has the remains of the beast we take down which we will take down sure as a souvenir right yes it's a very large creature but that could happen with any contract any band of idiots could go die on the battlefield i look at grog and see he's really bored i pick up a wooden sword and i hit him as hard as i can on the small of his back it's not going to be that hard 17 come on big guy i know you're bored come on i hit him again okay cool that's a 20 oh but it's with a stick just strength modifier oh dear i'm going to use luck 14 i missed the nut ugh come on come on take a swing i'm trying to do you a favor come on get it out i see a gauntlet
