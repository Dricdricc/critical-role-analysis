stuff though well the dagger dagger dagger shirt is back i know that's not brand new but it's new-ish the scanlan shirt is even less new-ish but it's an amazing shirt and it's still there we have the aprons still we have pencils we have tarot cards i feel like going ooh she's in the desert she can't touch me right now that's it yeah we've got that art book coming out if you want to get updates you can go over to geekandsundrycom/artbook and sign up for updates and you'll get the latest and then also taliesin's not here he's also naked in the desert but on wednesday he'll be back for wednesday club in addition to everything they're going to be talking about there will be a little scuttlebutt about the critical role comic book we might show you the cover of the damn thing other things to announce about it so tune in if you're curious yeah he plays many characters safe totally safe red barrels everywhere oh hello no i am traveling actually yes well have a seat i'll tell you everything let's start with my childhood no and that was irony i could have something to eat do you want to get us something to eat just a little something that's nice you're from here is it always this cold i'm sorry what was your name strong name tell me about yourself and as he goes she starts inspecting the room kind of listening it was almost good ten does anybody look dangerous so you were going to tell me your story yes i did you know i'm happy to share the loaves of bread with you but my feelings won't be hurt if you want to change over oh start from the beginning you grew up here tell me all about it when you were young you lost it that must have been a long time ago jayne is quietly digging her fingernails into her leg to stop from screaming yes he's way up in the ass sailor so you're telling me this man has impugned your honor actually quickly i whisper over to the weird one and i pull out my holy symbol of the lawbearer and say there is a time and a place for law and civilization but your experience sounds trying and i know what i would do and i tuck the medallion away are you not familiar with the gods assassin's creed and a special shout-out to dwarven forge for sending me all this shit two days ago 16 which is the spell don't worry there are people tweeting advice right now that you can see three hours later the target makes a constitution save for this one are you shrinking yourself or someone else so you have to make a constitution save and in matt's world and homebrew bonus action you can use a cantrip on right since i don't do spells a lot okay so i cast the spell command which has a range of 60 feet on the little red-haired girl and i will say approach and she has to make a wisdom saving throw she has to beat a 14 wisdom wisdom 14 approach means she has to come toward me on her turn on her every turn until the spell gets interrupted and then i would like to use my movement to start moving toward the door as far as i can get 30 feet so five ten it's crowded you could probably slow it down a little bit and before all that happened and people were running to what to grab their weapons to be part of this bloodbath yes does anyone have a hand on a weapon yet yes what about by the door then i'm just going to use my bonus action to yank the belt off of me which is actually a white whip and crack it on the floor and that's the end of my turn just flair baby (laughter) how many shows are you directing right now 72 is this the maul that's six two times the square traditional die and one more time a six two that's eight plus six your hunter's mark is a bonus action i seem to recall that's big time yeah that gives him advantage on every attack against one target so if you really want to fuck that guy up do vow of enmity but i think that's an action vow of enmity bonus action if you want to destroy kingston it gives you advantage vow of enmity one time tonight you can say that person and then you can roll with burning hatred religious hatred you know the religious hatred do you know the mutton man versus strength oh that does it it matches my albino even constitution save is right here plus four to whatever you roll oh yeah 20 i barely notice because someone from the jersey shore is lifting me into the air etchings (soft giggling) sorry i was just imagining you burned to a crisp am i bound hands are tied behind my back are they movable they are then i cast sacred flame on the guy oh it's holy fire for 1d8 damage yeah the target must succeed on a dexterity saving throw you make a dex save 14 hey you've known me for so long i can attack normally i just can't move anywhere i would like to do a melee spell attack on him so first i'm going to see if it hits then i'll tell you what it is that is an 18 on the guy grappling me so i would like to cast inflict wounds at level two and rot this fucking asshole from the inside out yeah it is 18 good that is a 25 total i would like to use my bonus action to break the fucking lawbearer chain off my neck and throw it over my shoulder and walk towards the door you could get an extra one-time attack right now i'll never learn the violin i am rather attractive oh command only lasts one round well i'm letting you know that it's not going to last forever at the moment he attacks if he hits he does regular damage and adds smite damage right so he can't attack he could cast hunter's mark did you cast that already you could cast hunter's mark on jayne or anybody wisdom save is this so plus three natural 20 actually thanks keyleth because those are her dice i have auditory issues oh man the room has turned into (singing) turn down for what yeah i rip off the cloak that i'm wearing to reveal the white porcelain doll dress and straps of white leather around the biceps and around the thighs yeah i look like courtney love a little bit there are very light chain tattoos along the collarbones disappearing down the dress wow i kick the dog how does matt do it right every week you created a combat scenario for yourself with 33 enemies (new jersey accent) did you just make a hoboken reference in the middle of our dnd game (new jersey accent) the clam broth house is a huge part of my childhood and she's right it's not there any more it's been gentrified (new jersey accent) sure yeah when i was a kid it was a place where drunks stumbled out of it is 15 oh am i there's still a dwarf holding the girl right the dwarf is holding her frankfurt is i would like to hit that fucking dwarf's bare ass with my whip so i'm going to make an attack oh that's a natural one (groaning) fucking fuck a duck as a bonus action i would like to cast sanctuary on myself no i have to stay right here next there's no reaction to getting hit in the face it's if somebody is running away from you that's hazy that's up to you hunter's mark or nothing you count it up the one with the lowest hit points gets hit first within the area of effect creatures within 20 feet of a point you choose within range did you pick a point are affected in ascending order of their current hit points starting with the creature that has the lowest current hit points each creature affected by this spell falls unconscious until the spell ends so whoever's at their lowest gets hit first hit the dog with one hit point that's the first hit point frankfurt's in the center viking woman barmaid she's not a minor but she is not interested players are in charge of knowing their shit except for eric you don't know that's the mystery eric plus five that's right 23 so why are we doing it again jesus it was almost the same oh no that's a 12 17 this has got to be gilmore girls dialogue i am 13 but until the spell ends any creature who targets the warded creature must make a wisdom save versus 14 choose a new target or lose the attack okay so i know that i can get within ten feet i'm going to take my fucking white whip and whip this guy in the fucking face ugh no it's bullshit it's eight it's just an eight that does not hit fuck it then for a bonus action i'm going to cast chill touch on both whoever this person is and clothesline because i'm a death cleric and part of my perks is that i can cast chill touch on two people next to each other instead of just one two ghostly spectral hands fly out and latch onto both of their fucking faces the targets must both succeed on a dexterity saving throw versus 14 fuck you ashly burch yeah both of them oh then neither worked oh bffs k-i-t well i can move back one space that's it sanctuary is still up i don't know you don't know yep the square the cube six plus roll it again six but you got maximum damage on that attack which is rare constitution you've been rolling real well tonight eric and you still are it's a 23 total fuck that guy just for the record when i sat in the chair i'd at least directed-- dmed to eight-year-olds once or twice sam came in blind hot so hot clit-rota cholieamenthys punchy pithy i'm moving towards the door immediately the trapdoor as i walk i'm casting shield of faith on myself it just boosts my ac that's all i'm going to kick the bard in the ass and when i kick him in the ass i'm going to cast light on his ass as he falls down into the hole it's anything i touch and it's a cantrip so his ass lights up as he falls down the hole oh let's see how long that lasts one hour so kingston's ass is lit up no it's a really easy spell for many of us on your other side sam i'll help are they here or are they here what's our marching order dm we shoved the bard down first i'll go after him we have something to do you can ask me lots of questions later let's just kill the thing and get the girl all right i do not sort of i walk past the idiot and start walking down the hallway yeah i'm looking as carefully as i can into the next space i will peer for enemies or the people we're following or anything i call down over my shoulder and say hey ass kicker no it's not clothesline get up here and i'm going to do my best to see if there's any kind of trap on the door i'm looking at i'm looking at the door in front of me and seeing if i can see anything hinky with it natural 20 well i'm going to go inside i would first like to cast light again because it's a cantrip i can do it as many times as i want and that means the bard's ass goes out and i'll say that the grip of my whip lights up and i hold it upside down you're not there you said there were potions on the table that i see now i've entered the room and i want to inspect the potions you said there were on the table ten i jot that down on a scrap of paper and put it away because i am a businesswoman as well okay i will start back and find the catwoman in the doorway it's up to you if ten minutes have passed since i cast it that's the third one for burch and i have to roll versus it so you got a what total that's a big four (laughter) the big thing tonight is i'm like luck-- no phantom limb syndrome (strained) it was probably a bad idea (strained) i think you need to kill me later i think we need to survive this basement we're talking a long time can i cast a spell i would like to cast inflict wounds at second level make a melee spell attack against a creature you reach okay she's done that is a 19 plus six that is a 25 this is inflict wounds make a melee spell attack against a creature you can reach on a hit the target takes 3d10 necrotic damage except i'm doing it at second level so it's 4d10 and so my hand just grips her forearm and death filters through it ten 19 29 ashly and not even the bard no you're awake you motherfucker that's water under the bridge brain gagging your ass and then lighting a candle seems like possibly three actions dnd is all about negotiation while they're thinking about it can i talk to the cat i'm not a very nice person yes i am a servant of the chained oblivion and i want everything destroyed and i know that doesn't sync up with your motivation that's rough but i could kill you now or you could come with me and help me get this girl and then maybe you'll make your way out of it maybe you'll survive i'm going to give you a chance because i think you're worth more to me alive now than dead and if you're very nice and don't argue i'll even make you feel a little better what do you say clothesline i'm not a nice person i facepalm her and cast cure wounds that is-- i'll tell you that is eight hit points back for you hooray eight hey you can try to kill me later i want the little red-haired girl you understand come on i'll follow her no but i have other skills i would like to cast command on the dwarf he has to make a wisdom saving throw so roll the d20 plus three not until after this spell is done aw 13 plus three is 16 he beat it damn he beat it spell burned was he anywhere near me when i had that private conversation roll high catch me out because i'm terrible that's a two jayne places her hand on clothesline's shoulder and says wait no i didn't leave that hallway whenever she would have walked forward i would have said wait it's up to you if you wanted to come no i'm at that tunnel entrance i never entered oh shit i'm looking at the ceiling you said there are a lot of numbers up there and there's nothing different about any of them what color is the lock an irish flag that is a 17 for me you're a terrible person were those the orange numbers i got a 14 how's the bard doing the bard i see him staring up as well how are you doing darling can you read the numbers on the ceiling keep going there's four pillars one of them poofed out poison and the lock looks like what over there sam's given us a mensa challenge and we all die here seven months without an episode break the numbers on the pillars are not any color are they you're so brave kingston you should try as many combinations as possible even if it burns you somehow you should keep trying my weaknesses i don't know what those are i could tell her many things i will tell you lots of things in the interest of not slowing down this episode you learn that i'm very weak and easily hit you learn that i am almost out of spells and you have learned that i am part of four generations of women that have served the chained oblivion which is a god that everyone has heard of and the chained oblivion wants to destroy everything and i am fucking crazy just like my mother what's after the eight 24 nine the fuck is this sam i see a pattern but i don't know what it leads to assholes six is one-third of 18 seven is one-third of 21 eight is one-third of 24 nine is one-third of 27 ten what's the ten ten is different than the rest i don't know if that means ten is important but it's different than the rest ten six is one-third of 18 seven is one-third of 21 eight is one-third of 24 nine is one-third of 27 ten is one-third of-- there's nothing there 30 why did you have to bring math into it you shit you're doing it mary and shit what is that there are so many math majors watching right now who are so mad at us but eric can sound like chris rock so-- can we get a wet rag flown in you are getting beat up behind the studio tonight i mean his character's dumb as fuck i think he might be going in (new jersey accent) you know what you got to do you got to fucking attack (new jersey accent) i would like to use my bonus action to drop a deuce disadvantage on his shit i love high fantasy by the way i start pushing the cat and start moving towards the room and i would like to try to get within ten feet of the salamander so behind the sorcerer and i would like to attack if no one else is going to jump on it yeah 17 none of it's real on her next turn she makes a death saving throw so she's just unconscious she could be brought back if anybody gives a fuck oh it's running it's within ten feet of my range with the whip so i do too disadvantage on everything with how things are going and where i am right now i'm just going to cast chill touch which has a range of 120 feet retreat oh it's not my turn oh if he ran no that would be the whip as soon as he ran so that's just an attack that hits that's an 18 plus some stuff okay so that's just 1d4 plus two so that is a two plus two is four and i'm going to channel divinity and fill that with death so that will be a total of more than four one second please hold on that's an 18 damage as it runs 18 total as it runs it was a four from the whip and then 14 necrotic damage because i'm fucking insane and the chained oblivion's wrath fills this fucking asshole half cover so at disadvantage so you can go on a diagonal and then you can see him straight on elizabeth warren runs in well it wasn't me shit as a cantrip i'm going to cast chill touch on the salamander ranged spell attack all right i want to use this one oh that's terrible that is an eight so a ghostly hand grabs the pillar and nothing happens that was an action yes i'm going to move i'll move myself five ten 15 20 25 30 i'm just going to be right there to the home audience choose the luck feat whoa she's unconscious i can oh good instead while everyone's focused on the salamander i'm going to loop the whip around and yank and twist her neck that's two death saves is what that is and on her turn she has to make a death save if she fails it she's a goner at who frank grillo you can get up it's half your movement but you can fuck me up still i haven't lost a hit point this entire game no the dice are doubled what the fuck is that get out of this building do the leonidas handshake with me that was amazing in addition to the last attack no hit points to all the hit points no not all only the best people are in the cult you'd be surprised not great but hold on five plus six is 11 i'm sorry that does not hit i'm so sorry this salamander is like look at these assholes fighting amongst themselves so you could cast it on me which you would do as a paladin who hates the chained oblivion so roll again if you do better you hit me he's got no legs wait before we move forward i know that i'm after gryffin yes so because that is so i would like to attack the tabaxi with my whip now that is a 13 to hit fuck okay i'm going to start to run one two three four five six okay six seconds have passed one two three four five six takes a lot of concentration yeah ashly we all lived so it's like we're all winners right i kept trying to take away those two hit points for so long if i could have rolled a critical hit one time like you did three times i could have one-hit killed any of you any of you thank you to matthew mercer who does this week after week after week
