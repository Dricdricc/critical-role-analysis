i'm not feeling the hag i've had enough hag what's the terrain like around this hut does it look possible to skirt around it from where we are okay we've kind of already had this conversation before we went and poked a badger with those floating instruments we really don't need to do every single thing and i have a bad history with hags and i would like-- --to skip this fucking place are these new opal dice did we use the dust of tracelessness no well i will settle for a 27 no i didn't we use-- laura and i just oh all right laura and oh 37 yeah perception that is never not unsettling they're stupid aren't they can we all see this why don't we back it up slow for once i'll climb after her 18 i'm gonna chime in over the earring and say somebody could turn grog into a marmoset or something that would work for the circumstances strongjaw's kitten honestly i can't even tell the difference i don't know how long ago did you bust out my wings for me dm under 24 hours how thick are the trees here i had such a hard time when i flew up the other day such a hard time and everyone's just floating up easy as pie yeah i'm skinnier than your broom let's do it no but i will anyway observe yes yes let's do recon let's observe it for the next six to ten hours and then rest up in the shag like evil maple syrup i got a natural 20 using luck yeah i'm gonna rest my chin on my sister's shoulder and just stare for a minute and say you know that bow is going to be reeeally cool yeah worth it no no that's a bad idea yeah we want to be at full strength don't run in willy-nilly yeah you're in control seventeen what a lackluster okay i think a little bit actually got out buddy what are you doing with this log percival what is this for can i help give it to mikey he'll try anything i'm gonna hobble past vex and say you know i think that broom is not as well-suited for um men i think you might have done gern a favor i've just taken a very long spin class i sort of tenderly walk past oh dear kill him i come back in with a big bag of ice no i mean i'm gonna take my bag of ice and i'm gonna sit on the doorjamb and watch them go and just see if they need help but i'll stay here if i can yeah i go and i tie one end of it to the heaviest piece of furniture i can find in the foyer yes i use the swirly-whirly knot i start backing away slow (all laugh) scanlan does your house unbreak itself if grog breaks it you know if it goes away it poofs and it comes back is all his damage there or does it-- grog he doesn't want you to know this he told me this the last time you were here you actually have to do that 33 times before it takes hold so just keep going street fighter it so percival would you imagine that the science of the feywild i don't know what that phrase means would it be the same as our own world maybe it follows different rules pull out the magic jug yeah worked out does the tree have a weakness what is the legend at the heart of this tree probably inside would a really successful history check help vex remember what the fuck she was told oberon maybe if we put shorthalt forward well that seems likely but we'd have to turn over every stone in la-la land to find it scanlan and keyleth combo scanlan and keyleth duo to talk to the tree yes how can we help you how can we fix what's going on tofurkey no i'm going to knock on my sister's door before she falls asleep hey well you know we don't get a lot of time to talk alone because everything is so fucked up but you seemed really on-edge more than normal when we lived there before you know what i'm talking about are you all right i've he's not a concern for me anymore i don't think fondly back on it we have bigger things on our plates but i do care how he affects you and there is no question how much it affected you when percival made his offer in that room and i was a little surprised and i'm not trying to start an argument or anything like that i know why he did it of course and every fairy within a thousand miles of that room could see how deeply it affected you and it surprised me because look if that makes you happy it is to be embraced and i'm certainly in support of anything that gives our father heartburn but i'm sorry his offer in your brother's eyes is a bit like gilding a lily or framing a sunset you have always been the coolest person i have known ever in my life and you still are you're already perfect at least in your brother's eyes and i guess i just hope you believe in you as much as i do because it's quite a bit well you're a countessa know i understand that's what you are all right whatever floats your boat stubby but you know just don't wuss out on me now all right you've always been stronger than me i need you to keep doing that bullshit that's it i love you too all right what do they look like i set the deathwalker's ward for necrotic damage do we have any fancy um fancy-- crystal bowls for keyleth to crush up and feed us from heroes' feast yeah never mind i don't claim to understand anything i actually think i want to tail grog thank you all right i'm scritching his ears while we walk not a penis at all it's gonna be a squeaker could you pour some crisco out of that magic jug of yours and lube up this is sparta come on i am here comes the general bad dm follow suit vex'ahlia and shitting black diarrhea out of the tree he's creeping on my sister fuck him 23 secrets yeah i can see fuck-all through this magical window-- so i see where i am in that circle what are the big clumps of poop in the middle all right boots click uh i am hanging back behind-- is trinket out still all right then i'm just leaning out from behind grog and i am going to dagger-dagger-dagger him and i'm first to attack so i have advantage okay so the first hit is a 26 yeah second is a 26 and the third is a 21 okay so the first one is sneak attack this one is the flame-tongue here it goes six and seven here comes the sneak attack damage say again (mumbling) 30 for the first seven for the second and eight for the third where am i in relation to the party to my sister i'm gonna just roll forward and crouch in front of her low to give her a shot but be in front of her that loaded die was the best investment we ever made oh that's our specialty i'm gonna burn a luck 16 sneak-attack damage not my computer oh yeah uncanny dodge oh at disadvantage excuse me because of the cloak of displacement sang for his supper (malone voice) they send one of yours to the feywild you send one of theirs to the morgue (all laugh) is he pressed against the roof of this chamber towards it 29 so the treants are prone right everybody's prone and that gives me advantage on the attack as well doesn't it all right so i'm just gonna whip down and stab into the treant that's at my feet now okay first attack is a 29 well actually yeah 29 second attack is a 29 third attack is a 17 okay so the first one which is with the dagger of venom i don't know if it'll do anything but i'm gonna use the poison in it two eight 28 and the poison dc on that is 15 11 points of poison damage on top of that second attack does seven this is the flametongue dagger i don't know if that's going to do anything-- and the third attack does-- i don't remember now uh i can figure it out it was roughly it was 20-something 25 third strike got eight thanks i just quickly look into keyleth's flaming eyes and say finish it off and then i'm going to run double speed along the curve of the wall underneath flying fuck yeah past keyleth and the one that i just stabbed the shit out of yeah i've got double speed disadvantage turns on-- c'mon dangerous nerd do it dexterity save strength burn a luck ah 20 us against the environment smacked him into the wall go hide like a potato in the earth oh jeez how high off the ground is that apex that he's hanging out of 40 feet all right king of improv right here put it on a kitten poster but she's always angry that's a fucking miracle is what that is girl all right i think from where i'm standing i'm close enough to see that keyleth is absolutely mauling the tree she's right on top of it right with double speed i can get there yeah all right so i'm gonna flit across the floor come up right behind keyleth shoot right around the side of her and stab up and in one-two-three first attack is a 28 second attack is a 29 and the third attack is a 26 sneak attack on the first two plus six is eight 30 for the first attack second attack does seven and the third attack does ten ten and seven am i burning at all as i just came up next to flamey here because that came up in the past being around her woo yeah what was that i have a question and i could be wrong-- i thought percy gave me that mask oh right i forgot that is true nah it looks good on you best wisdom roll of my life 21 which was huge for me are you halfway done yet groggy vex just healed herself right all right all right and is he within 60 feet of me he's within 60 feet of me all right and is there anyone around me i just can't see too well from here next to him no i know fuck it i'm gonna burn a bonus action and shoot out the wings and i'm gonna fly into his face and stab into each side of his neck 28 on the first 29 on the second as i stab into both sides of his neck i say if you want to get to my sister you gotta get through me stab-stab first one is ten second one is eight yep (slightly delayed) dead-ent and that cheeky line about romance can he use his bonus action to just shove his sunglasses up at the end sorry feywild interference what was that you know it's interesting i understand exactly zero percent of what the dm was saying while he was in-character as that particular character due to the nature of skype and microphones so i was faking understanding the whole time and then picked it up in retrospect listening to laura's responses i missed it i don't know i don't know anything we should find that dagger no question we're going to vasselheim soon you can cut down a lot of trees there it's cold there they could use the firewood soon what are we talking about vex'ahlia i'm fucking curious pull that bowstring scanlan i think you would make a very good arrow for it (all laugh) do you still need muscle strength to pull it or is it just easy-peasy now you're going to have to start doing pushups then the theater the theater what about the theater i fly up there-- garmelie he's a deity yep yep yep what are we doing we're warping out yeah but i'm tangling my fingers up if she'll let me with keyleth and say just quietly to the side you know you've been pretty fucking amazing lately as usual more animals more animals for vex
