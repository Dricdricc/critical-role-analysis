creeping along the back of that tent and curving around thank you small square near the top upper left hand dm i'm throwing a dagger at the queen now by my saying that do i get into the initiative

clarota and dagger dagger at this jerkface over here yep that was stealthed by the way all right okay and i'm going to use luck okay so stealth is 23 and he hasn't gone yet so for the assassinate feat for rogues if he hasn't gone yet this is a critical hit okay the feat says if you have the jump if you go before the person's gone but we can talk about that later all right okay so keen dagger flying through the air oh i didn't hit to-- okay so that hits 16 plus-- 27 okay so three plus (mumbles) (muttering numbers) 36 total oh sorry asswipe okay that is a 19 and that is eight damage bard ass he's dreaming of honey here comes the illithid come on tibs tibber-hoods oh so sorry bad news where does he get such wonderful toys i start hiking back towards grog it's what i do give me a little space let me look at this can i detect traps on his bands that's a 17 yeah and are there locks contraptions on them 19 i'm going to move on to the next one and a 25 on my lock pick vax is moving to the next band that's a 24 12 wait vox machina our purposes here are done but lady kima she has further to go and i am curious your highness if you know anything about this k'varn chap or gal or thing we have heard his or her name they seem to be famous in these parts i was wondering if you know anything about k'varn yes i am so well that's a two vex'ahlia would you come up and talk to this-- yeah professor x what a mercenary vax'ildan is going to go pick at the charred remains of the illithid me yeah sorry 13 probably a cursed item this is the time for an intermission yeah (singing) we've only just begun (speaking) because we went right into battle vax is walking off into the distance to urinate on a stalagmite or stalactite whatever's the one on the ground oh that's a relief oh it's the longest pee ever so i'm walking back from my pee and i've overheard this we were sent here to bring back kima she's not going to come with us until we've killed this k'varn do you know something we don't keyleth i want to use my-- i would like to do a check on keyleth i want to see her intentions it's a 14 hold on a second that's unfair it has been a long road keyleth i know you have had a hard time we all have i know we're miles below the surface of the world but we're together we are family and everyone here is here for you as you have been for us now i say we camp for the night inside this schmuck's tent we stay here we rest up sleep on it and see how we're all feeling in the morning we're here for you keyleth and we'll protect you as you have protected us you've got a family with us who in this world is without fault who hasn't made mistakes we certainly all have the bottom line is all of this insanity is going to bubble up to the surface if someone doesn't stop it remember think back it has already begun and no one is here to stop it except for vox machina us we've got your back that may be so but the evil that is brewing beneath the surface of the world will stretch up to everything we know and i know that you have made mistakes i have certainly made mistakes that is to live there is more at stake right now and we are the front line we're the only ones who can stop it mistakes are all right i think we are all a little frayed i think we need to rest let's set up camp i'm sorry scanlan what is that never entirely welcome in the company of elves or men vax'ildan learned at a young age to skip past formality preferring instead to invite himself in your door along with twin sister vex'ahlia vax was born by a chance encounter between elven royalty and human peasantry raised by their mother in their early years the twins were eventually sent off to their father in the elven capital of syngorn but their cool reception among the elves there never warmed and their time in the capital didn't last the siblings stole away one autumn night and set out on the open road after a few years of wandering they eventually decided to return to their mother and journeyed back to the lands of their youth but instead of finding their childhood home they returned to a pile of rubble their mother was gone their home burned to ash pressing the townspeople for answers they learned of the day the dragon came (roar) with their ties all severed vax'ildan and his sister set out to find their fortune together in tal'dorei an outsider since birth vax quickly learned to solve life's challenges in his own particular way often by side-stepping them entirely and when his knack for circumventing adversity isn't enough (knife scraping) the way of blades the elves schooled him in more than makes up the difference we will be here every week so subscribe and to be fair he was only thrown out once k'varn took over the elder brain correct slip of the tongue worried for him what for his effect on the group well the bottom line is (sighs) we have a pretty clear goal at hand everything else will have to be figured out afterward a super history check grog are you skinning a boar over there what are you doing we slept it's not pretty to look at it's fine except the pinkie toe pinky toe's a nubbin now yeah i need percy to make me a replacement first pike could you hook a brother up as we walk vax falls in next to keyleth keyleth we're walking are you all right you are everything we said last night was true we're here for you no one be a yahoo grog we need you over here scanlan you as well 15 for vax 21 vax chases the arrow yeah stealth i followed it yeah i rolled a 26 on stealth follow up the arrow i'm going to check out the very first the closest body to the exit 19 you said they're covered in webs small natural so not bilbo baggins i'm just going to start searching all of them i don't give a shit about these bodies i care about what they are carrying you're not even in the room i grab the pendant and then i start-- this looks good for pike so i start taking the chainmail off (wheezing) no armor it was the armor wasn't it (strained) i got this for you pike so i grasp kima by the hand and say that is one i owe you that's one i owe you it's yours as we leave the cavern i give one of these to the dwarven bodies yeah i got that armor back sorry sis kima has it no she wore it oh that's between you and her i'm not taking armor off of her wait my armor that's my armor i gave it to him he gave it to her and you're taking it hey hey hold on a second i think we need to roll a brother sister contest die i grab her by the ear and say that's mine that's mine squeezing her earlobe really hard yeah sure sure it's not fair i'm not fucking-- figure it out one i can't see shit lady keyleth plus three for shark dolphin hump him a little bit grog can you pull up any of those boats pull them up grog pull them up ladies and gentlemen we're going to pull up one of those boats pull it up (singing) sailing clarota put the image all in our heads vox machina there is an island there are also two small caves and-- where two and then rivers and paths out yes we could go straight for the big prize what do you mean keyleth when we eventually want to take the temple and kill this son of a bitch we probably want the shortest amount of distance on land as possible which means coming in from the north end where tiberius is pointing yes i agree but i think we're all a little slap happy and curious but the north-western edge has a beach but we're curious about the island so vox machina are we going to head around the southern south-eastern edge does anyone know how to steer this thing oh towing that is impressive this is on the island what's the scale are we talking manhattan and brooklyn or smaller than that we're all very curious on the beach well we're in the boat but grog and i want to go right no is the boat coming up to the beach yes all right i scoop up scanlan and go piggyback style like he's my son and jump on the beach 27 i'm going to use perception on the chest and the bodies that is not that good that is 13 i'm back from the chest i take out one dagger and throw it at the chest to sink it into the lid from a ways back okay so i did a 13 perception check i guess on the chest so i'll go to try and open it you're on my back scanlan pike someone call pike oh nuts come back ashley you could use the shark like a baseball bat it's the undead we all know this is going to grow so we're just getting ahead of the game yes have fun with the new manhattan-sized island minecraft get those clippers out though (bzzz) i know it's off-putting but scanlan's beard is right over here (all laugh) scandinavian sam that's on you second place is good we want all of you guys to go find these books find other people in your town or online and play what was our goal for subscribers for the night too and they're staying around for our questions no no song for grog we would like to rage it's like the hulk is attacking the chat
