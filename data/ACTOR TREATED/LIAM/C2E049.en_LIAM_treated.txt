ah it a dragon yes (imitating record played backwards) thank you satan i like tortles before we leap in could you give a quick physical description again of the two archmages also elven at the apothecary not where we are two separate locations we need to go now right now these things we have we have to get them out of here now please we heard someone describe the operatives from xhorhas coming up out of the ground over by the farmlands correct yeah that's a good question but also we just stole some very important things and we saw what is probably the owners going into the building is there anything we need to do in this town now to help you do what you need to do here or can we leave is this person you're looking for here do you know do you have any ideas we were being stared at as we came through here is anyone else-- is there anyone coming do we hear anything natural one by the farmlands are we going to i don't want to talk in town what do you think that your child made of that cut off the is we're in the wagon (deep breath) mist your name is veth my name was bren aldric ermendrud was i uh i have been using you all i am from rexxentrum i attended the soltryce academy and i was plucked by one of the cerberus assembly with a few others and was being trained to do the kinds of things that i fear may have been done to-- ja and a lot of big plans for me that didn't pan out and i went a little crazy and i ran away i ran away i've been on the run for a long time and i was tired of starving and i met i met you and was a little less hungry for a while i have just been afraid for a long time and two of the people in that town over there are on the cerberus assembly i know who they are i don't think so but i have walked past their portraits at school many times one of them is the head of the cerberus assembly there's good teachers there it's everything that they describe it to be but after going there for several months one of the assembly who also would teach on occasion started interviewing me calling me in and asking me a lot of questions he put me in advanced class me and a few others i don't want you all to be seen with me because if you are seen with me by one of them they will use you to get to me you met the man who trained me his name is trent ikithon i'm not a very good person i'm worried about your husband i know the things that they can do and i start to unwrap one of my arms no i have been wearing bandages on my arm and there are little very faint scars all up the arm they are scars faint scars from cuts he used to put crystals in-- he experimented on us on the three of us he was trying to strengthen us no the first time i had ever seen that word was in your libraries just haphazardly scrawled into a book no explanation no everything was for empire we were being trained to serve our empire above all else he was a little mad himself that is-- he was mad he believed that the unwashed masses relied on their base instincts and the highest calling was to rise above the muck and control the cattle for the good of all but we were-- are-- at war many of us felt that way-- feel that way i don't believe in anything now yes i don't want one more thing on my head to have you guys-- it's probably too late anyway the cerberus assembly are the most powerful mages in the empire over two centuries ago a number of mages went to war in the streets of rexxentrum it was bloody and awful and eventually they came to a truce and banded together and proposed to the king at the time that they serve as an advising body alongside the throne i don't know for sure but there is a reason why i did not use anything like that back there i don't know it is something to do with the thing but i don't know why him was he gifted in his work that is what is written about there it talks about-- listen i don't pretend to know what we're talking about but it does not seem like anything that i ever studied it says they were looking for a way to achieve their ends without the object i don't know what they need i hope he is alive i truly do they will make his life very painful though ja the city of rexxentrum they're based there and the empire they are close to as powerful-- arguably more powerful than the king we watched lunidus da'leth appear 200 feet in front of us maybe i used a lot of names caleb is just what i told you i don't know caleb let's stick with caleb for now (stuttering) i honestly don't know if we can-- if we are up to this unless they're en route on land maybe but that's all the might of the empire they're both elves vess derogna-- i'm sorry no vess derogna is the archmage of antiquities she is half a recluse she taught at the school-- not me or years above me travis and she's a historian she knows-- she has uncovered mysteries of the past they would say at school she's a history buff and awful as well probably da'leth is domestic protection he is the head of the military if they are both here i would imagine that he is here overseeing all of the red brands we saw and she is probably here trying to figure out what's in that bag they could be combing the empire for it thank you 19 more than one yeah we saw an attack on the tower in zadash that was ages ago at this point and now they're well into the empire what about the annexes the annexes people who-- it was in the lore that you shared with me these papers conjecture that in ghor dranas they are able to control fate and time clearly it was stolen from them and brought here so it could be the source of their presence here ja it was a note scrawled to the side of a book it said that the cerberus assembly was looking into some sort of new arcane study and the word dunamis was written that was it i was studying history and-- i need to become more powerful if i want to do anything look at me i am a string bean i am weak as it comes i am weak look at that look at her you have no guns that was an exaggeration that day you are just fast and quick and talented ja (sighs) i oh jester i am glad you see good in me okay i will consider it heavily i don't doubt any of you at all (louder) you too that one will be off-camera no the elder gentleman started the cerberus assembly over 250 years ago that's a tangible goal that we can do it all depends on how he reacts if caduceus is able to contact him a couple of us tonight-- not me but a couple of us could check the town out and ask some questions and ask if many people were taken away or not laura and hood up and i'm still dirty as sin i have a decent amount of molasses if you like well one is the bee poop but molasses comes out of a tree the umlaut's over the second f hey laura hey laura that's a pretty good penis you drew over there it's very lifelike looks like some stuff happened there too pretty good are you talking about what nott and i do or what you do that's between you and your god jester is it dark yet i'm no expert on worms but i would imagine that it is more collapsed earth than open space they chew their way their way through the earth and poop out the remains we don't know we don't really know yeah but they can do that in a basement we have no idea how deep the blockage goes we plan everything to do i did not say that it is heavily fortified although i'm sure it is it is the largest city in the empire when i lived there-- and it was only briefly when i was at school-- i could go anywhere in the city i wanted because i'm a citizen of the empire the largest city in the empire that would be hard to attack not the name not the group none of it (sad trombone) little floating trombones (sad trombone) (whispering) ask about the chair ghor dranas xhorhas i also had notes and i read a book at the cobalt soul about xhorhas i have all that oh 17 beast folk what do you mean have you ever heard of something called the luxon the luxon i'm not sure i read about them or it i don't what it is something that is having some sort of negative effect on the people of ghor dranas this everything we've been talking about it says in there that they control fate and time ja i have read this all around ghor dranas an empress runs it named leylas kryn we are focusing on your fellow there are beasts in the north but yeza is not gentlemen we can't fight in here nott can you make yourself look like him he seems like an interesting fellow that's a symbol the person's more important so we have to come up with a plan for what we are doing rexxentrum is its own set of problems and dangers your husband is heading towards xhorhas and a war i am not feeling very optimistic about the tunnels but i have been wrong about many things so why don't we check out the tunnels let's do something positive should we hire someone to go with them as muscle take care of your family that's two stop its tonight well i imagine the same guards will be out there again are we just going to plunge on in and try to-- we just won dungeons & dragons guys we'll be lucky if we can proceed i don't think we can take the cart with us it's worth just checking the box perhaps it connects to a larger cave system that they used-- we don't know-- but the cart cannot come yeah i will cover the cost of that excuse me how much would it cost to house our cart here for a month a month not a problem here you are one two for a brief period of time yeah brief yeah for a minute oh jeez creatures all the way to the right creatures creatures is over here so actions blah blah blah all of them are right-- tap it and then search just start typing in a name then use google for a badger a honey badger as high as challenge rating what get us to the underdark laura take us to the underdark pick pick pick argh oh this new item it follows me i know i was just curious about my new-- okay yeah and the tripod no the hole that was dug by our honey badger yeah as a point can i tell if we're walking into any bullshit ja okay real bad nine no i'm going to pull them back to me and lose three of them and pull out that rag that i carry around and cover them so that it's even dimmer my transmutation stone is set so that i can see in dim light who wants to walk with me do you hear anything do you see any kind of traps left behind the people could put them on the ground or anywhere from everything i read ghor dranas is mysterious and exotic so let's press on i'm going to start walking forward da da da liam and they might have a little mini-base i don't like it it makes me nervous argh damn it self-fulfilling prophecy matt and i rolled a one (triumphant gibberish) six yeah
