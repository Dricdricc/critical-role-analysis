i am so happy i had a fur blog in the early 2000s i know i backed that shit i didn't realize when we were trying to save your voice box in the game at gen con that that was part of a running inside joke can we get a show of hands for everyone who got max hp this level-up fuck you and you and fuck you and especially fuck you jeez get off my back mom seeing beau go in ahead of me still sitting on the table i mutter a word and cast knock and the manacles fall away jester no we are sorry we tried our best but it wasn't good enough we should be sure we need to give the house the once-over make sure there is nobody left we agreed to clear this house of everything and we learn for the future this won't happen again you understand me kind of a moot point at this moment oh group effort travis sure it was nott thanks too long laslo has jumped bodies let's go rob them blind i will hang out with her while you guys go check the house please bring me any books i will sit with her short rest we've heard that before blue ink (puffing) i was waiting for the right moment to give it back you find him-- while they were gone caleb holding the huge slash on his chest together and the coat is ripped laid down next to yasha looking at the ceiling after a long moment of silence said oh that's quite a day ja i'm sorry we weren't faster caleb would know how many they've seen nein are we all in the same room at this point i have a-- never mind i'll tell you tomorrow this is-- oh i have been carrying this for you i know looks better on you no i didn't think-- thank you yep oh now who has it okay book out and on the floor and start tracing the symbols on the floor and give me ten minutes blood pudding mmm coffee hmm oh identify you guys know what this is this is a bottomless bag it can hold a lot though it can hold a lot more than-- yeah who wants it yeah tradition what are we doing are we staying here or are we hitting the road badass what do you want to do are we staying here or are we hitting the road well i don't always look great but point taken that's a good idea i have a surprise for you all (shushing) (groaning) oh shit yeah take all the hidden goodies inside it's a piñata yer a wizard harry we are dumbasses caleb is doing the silver wire while that happens it's a cantaloupe excuse me just a moment i'm sorry does anyone have a glass bead just a glass bead cheap doesn't matter you have fifty rings do you have a glass bead necklaces anything do you wear a glass bead on you do you have a bead your rings do any of them have just a glass-- are they costume jewelry he pries it-- he's not very good at it yeah okay good throws the ring away as you were then he starts muttering again and walking around the circle that the silver wire makes caleb is not paying attention to anything going on he's muttering and walking in circles everybody hears some muttering behind them of words they don't understand and then they hear caleb say huaah a large bubble goes (voom) in the entire entryway and there is a giant half-dome of pale orangish-brown energy and then you just see caleb's head go hey look what i made (whoosh) (shouting) ja only you no you walk in and as soon as you're in and look back where you came you don't see what you walked through you just see the room and everybody around it (whispering) they can all come in but be quiet hello probably yeah you can't see us but we can see you i've been working on this for weeks you can come in i pull fjord in so the idea behind this is that if we sleep in a field or something nobody's going to come and take us off to be tortured in the night we can go through it you can go through it i can go through it-- well i have to stay inside it but (chair squeaks) excuse me i have bigger ideas for a big place but i can't but this i can do a yurt it feels like outside but you know also if we're ever in a tight spot and we know something-- i don't know if i'm looking at laura or jester-- if we're ever in a tight spot i can also do this if we are in real danger that's a little tricky because it takes some time to do it like a hundred feet up i think i couldn't make any furniture yet but anyway in a pinch and tonight and the alarm is up it's been done nott of course i can't make a side bubble so-- i don't mean to intrude but what you said-- that's a lot i will spend the next hour or so before bed going through every single thing slowly and methodically with my spellbook and that gem that you had beauregard the red gem leave me alone i'm reading this has great power it's a meat hook is this what yasha had on her yeah no we're good this potion will give you a silver tongue for an hour or so yeah like this one over here or made this one inhuman i'll come back to this this is the manacles yasha had on her when we found her this is strange you put them on a person and someone like me maybe fjord could make that person fall asleep for at least a day well now we have it nothing i pocket it what is it how big is it (southern accent) i was thinking oversized handcuffs but nevermind you got that you can have this this is a gem that can summon a creature of fire yeah that is amazing that is powerful it's not my thing not me and me alone i'm good is it ooh yeah sleep until the afternoon we all saw this you just see a windmill of legs i go outside and get some fresh air and see what i see 17 are they deep heavy dwarf footprints i rub my thumb along the lucky rock in my pocket and smile at the snow and think about playing in it when i was younger and go inside to wake up anyone who's still sleeping cling clang clung clung name is spelled wrong too a charmed bracelet of dwarvenkind just gets a little bit of stubble amazing just give it to me (muttering) that is magical in that it is very finely crafted but it doesn't do anything expect cut me across the chest quite deeply we have a long way to walk so is that what we're doing but also we should go back to ophelia mardun no it is true the money meant fuck all no that is incorrect i would like my share of the platinum to be sure any coin that we found please what is east are we going to go to ophelia first and then to mollymauk or he's in the fields just give me ten goddamn minutes identify the cart how does it work also how long was the ride from shady creek to this compound like three or four hours oh so slower by cart because-- ja but worth it i'll sit up front we're on the cart no snaps for that one i feel like lorenzo had his way with me just now nice try foster the reason we're not overflowing with happy birthday joy and radiance is because we also have a cold dead fury that she's not at the table come back remain inconspicuous you mean in the open not hidden by the illusion of the cart just a jesus fish i look like a peasant i'll stay put good evening good day good afternoon we are expected by miss mardun very well true i know this cart like the back of my hand and if one inch of it is touched i will know well as i said on our previous meeting we have vetted appropriate people for the task at hand which has been completed that is all you need to know everyone other than the common folk that they had taken away have been put to the blade or burnt to cinders you know the one who wields that weapon this one broke his jaw almost off of his face and then his skull was burned to ash we murdered everyone in that house who was not a farmer it is empty natural 20 we are amenable that is just fine there are more of us waiting a ways away we have three more drei well we have come with our own means of transportation we can travel with you (clears throat) you could keep some of those puns in your head you know well the job is the job we will be watching our own backs regardless but the job is the job that's not too much to ask boy i wonder how long before ophelia's ready to go this is the sticks right i think that everyone in this town is dangerous so eyes wide open do you spend time in the-- no you have been alone-- it still stands it's pretty shitty he's been living in a cemetery-- exclusively for a number of years still a cemetery though it's strong at first but-- yes but you get used to it and it mellows the longer you're around him it has not been that long since i took a shower i don't know why this running gag is continuing of course quinn we need our cart to be driven-- in the two carriages just hers i will enter the second carriage if they are looking for people i think perhaps we are the intermediaries here why don't you ride with me no not at all cut them loose she's missing a lot of context on that sentence got to keep mamma mia marisha taliesin and can i interject for a second since this is a lot of time that's passing and it's just beauregard and i in this carriage can i as a ritual spell cast detect magic and check out the cart around us are you whispering to me through the doorway or-- ja (dying sound) excuse me once we're past the border and time has passed and the two empire kids are sitting alone in this carriage caleb staring out the window not even looking at beauregard beauregard who are you you know an awful lot about me now you are not some (sigh) youth throwing themselves on drink as you tried to claim when we first met you are clearly tied to something greater than that you are not some fuck-up who are you that's a separate issue we're very different but not completely i would feel a little safer if i knew a little more about you okay her or you right why are you out here in the wastelands now you what you want to follow the orders of the cobalt soul you want to do whatever they ask you to do or something you want to do why are you running around with criminals and me this is all orders you are following okay so a little bit of official business a little bit of your own personal axe to grind (repeating) ja danke no (exaggerated) cool (high pitched) i'm alive i'm happy yes i pull out my own wire and i aim towards ophelia and say miss denzala we require a few moments on the side of the road here ja ten 20 minutes nothing more caleb scoops nott up out of the cart that she's in and we watch from a distance what time of day is it he tried to get to your side he tried very hard knowing how young nott is i hold her closer and rest her head on my shoulder and walk away from this very painful thing to look at come everyone molly wanted us to keep living back in the carts there is always a cost i don't know but caleb would know it exactly also since we spent so much time in those carriages i would have spent a full day with my lucky rock that i found and those ideas i had have come to fruition i have set it just so i have luck again i got a new feat cheers never again yeah but hold on also rewind seven or eight days on the road how much money do we all have 163 not as much as i wanted of course she did actions spell equipment and then touch on the icons of the coins in d&d beyond no of course not the internet's full of troublemakers but it's all platinum right he might we all have roughly 30-something platinum detective we don't doubt you matt we don't doubt you i know you don't sleep i know you stare at a computer monitor and think up numbers for us non-stop (robotic voice) it's all good these pretzels are making me thirsty it's a phrase i'd like to offer many gifts bitches yeah of course 3250 gold it's platinum plus gold around 600 platinum pieces times five times ten even better hundred silver y'all what are you interested in well but still what are you interested in i'm sure they have a lot of tea blends here in zadash you had three cups so you need (counting) (whispering) secrets man your schlocky bit is great and all but it is really good to have you two at the table again it'd only be better if ashley was here but it is really good to have you two back fucking for real ja okay as you were that is correct he had his own business to attend to we parted ways natural 20 thanks matt colville it didn't end well it seems doubtful but ja if we see him again rest assured i'm going to plonk down in front of fjord just for a minute after everybody's milling about for a while this may be the alcohol-- it's the alcohol raise a glass you two assholes here is to fucking making it work congratulations on being alive travis and you cannot blame yourself when you are taken advantage of you know what i mean no and we're never going to forget it it's going to ride with us until we're dead yeah those things don't go away you carry that shit with you just sixteen candles-ing it i think it is an act i think it is an act no she has a lot of-- she's an amazing woman but talent is different than happiness i guess well she's very drunk yeah mr clay have a seat drop a deuce i mean it's well-natured though you can't properly be part of civilization until you've gotten shit-faced and thrown up bit of a little side conversation i slap down the rest of my goldschläger no you have some more you will dance better ja you have just survived death i understand that but we are dancing along the razor's edge of death so you know i feel like you should embrace the morbidity of life you definitely do not have to definitely don't have to marisha and don't drink it whatever you do you are supposed to not drink that-- ja are we talking when you were a little girl with the-- i don't think so look at her biceps they're quite large there's no reason to be afraid of anything nevermind do you know what we are all just happy to be alive it was just the spirit of the moment i don't mean to pressure you you know hold on a second grab your milk everybody raise a glass laura and no (laughter) that's ironic fjord you want to go
