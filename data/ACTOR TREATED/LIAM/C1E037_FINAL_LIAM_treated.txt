they're very soft on the inside and the code for free shipping is critrole critrole and the shipping is free she put it all up she did a group shot and then she did this long row of each separate we have more than one set of clothes well i love everyone in the room and i love all of you watching so thank you (laughter) what about-- i know someone needs to mind the store here in town but cassandra was in their pockets for a long time and what about father-- technically royalty before not well not with that face so all the messages-- because i sent word out to gilmore as well-- we haven't heard anything back from anyone though it's too soon yeah percival you have the run of this place somewhat can't you walk us through an oak tree and everything is good here for when we go percival your sister and everyone keeper what's-his-butt well first there were dinosaurs that's in the wayback machine victor the powder guy ivan from the other show do you mean ivan from the show before us she's the brains of the group i'm just going to say here's what we don't know if we beat the letters home if we try to walk up with the letter we should send someone to them with the letter because probably uriel came to his senses once sylas was hit with some dicks who he's long gone man i don't know where he is get in line but i don't think we want to walk up ourselves just in case we should send somebody all right well let's jump through maybe we need more letters we don't know roleplay this sam those notes are written on her pathfinder sheet tucked in pick a fat tree after all that pie trinket's a little wide in the haunches tolkien would be proud matt as he walks down the stairs i call out don't get caught shithead you must leave immediately i come out behind my sister and i take him by the hand and i say tiberius your friendship was always valued here i don't think we'd be standing here without you i will never forget you safe travels stormwind said the shits (laughter) yes how did you fare boy what was your name again i mean i asked you a direct question but that's all right matthew mercer anemone tea you've kept the house in order good job thank you traditional emon breakfast yeah fried tomato yeah blood sausage you dick desmond yeah that's unfortunate but there it is right in front of you all red and swollen gross can you do this can you do this desmond yeah i did too oh there we go a kid i think whitestone owes this boy a little coin percival coin yes fine fine somewhat higher than zero you just blow in his thumb and all the fingers go-- that took a long time though o'brien approves coin percival coin you shut up you are so caring this conversation is now making me uncomfortable your greed is endearing yes our diplomat yeah i mean it's probably fine but i really don't think we should walk up just in case the last time we saw uriel he was rather awful to us and i think he's probably fine after we took out the briarwoods i think but i'm not a hundred percent sure and i like my head on its shoulders i don't know it's an unknown quantity c'mon snitch i see a guard i recognize and i go oh i got my snake i'm thoroughly impressed i pull her a little further along with me and we step up if i may vox machina would not be here today without the aid and advice of lady allura and i would like to personally testify on her behalf of her ability and her wisdom and her heart i feel she has a great place in this city and you should put great trust in her specifically she will do much good by you sovereign my mother would have said she is a good egg oh no so if you could send an order of sliders-- you're on whitestone soil do you know what's amazing sovereign is that vex'ahlia and percival were just talking earlier today and they promised each other to match whatever you offered this boy and i am amazed at their generosity and kindness-- i'm making this up as i go i don't know what i'm doing is desmond off to whitestone oh vex'ahlia you'd best give him that 1000 gold now-- man we ain't found shit i mean could i take a week and really size up the entire building the keep for little sneaky holes that i didn't know were there validity i honestly think that if asum doesn't know nobody knows asum is our source of information here well i'm gonna perception check that shit investigation you said all right 20 for me okay what are you gasping about you sound perturbed natural 20 grog he's got two pieces of toilet paper with charcoal on it grog's the good cop look at his face percival you seem a little pallid all of a sudden are you feeling all right you're a terrible person pike and i spent a bit of time underground in the graveyard district with the clasp i don't know if the thieves' guild is connected-- wait on the way can i throw something in here halfway there i go argh oh my foot pike come here and i pull her off to the side we'll catch up we'll catch up i take the insults and i wait 'til they all march on used to it used to it pike i had a front row seat to the briarwoods and that blade that grog has now that we have never seen before came off of sylas briarwood it makes me nervous i don't know why other than it looks big and fucking scary i thought about talking to him myself but he will just kick me in the goolies so i thought that i would tell you because i think he would listen to you he certainly would-- yeah it kind of reminded me of percival's shit which is why i'm talking to you now but he likes you not so much me anyway that's it i'm gonna throw up my hood and i'm gonna pull out my other cloak the red one and i'm putting it over pike putting the hood over pike's head oh the mountebank the displacer cloak i've been wearing i just don't want you to be seen you gotta pull it round your cheeks have we heard of these individuals and these-- oh i forgot about dran 60 seconds late ladies and gentlemen i plant my foot firmly into his arse and just shove him towards the two guys vuvuzela another whisper two whispers you had us and then you lost us vex once helped grog in a very specific way you doubt the cube there's a very short man right there his name is jonathon i haven't been paying close attention but who is this mark don't know his name he's just a dickhead that's all you know i'm gonna pull up a chair and sit down in front of him hi there my name's greg greg yeah i'm scanlan's friend craig scanlan might be able to help you with this i'll definitely be able to help you with this but i'm not going to do anything unless i know something more so if you want to go into the house if you want me to break us into the house which i can certainly do i really need to know a little bit more your chances of getting whatever you're after inside raise if you're honest with me and i don't feel yet like you're being honest with me so i want to help you but i don't think i can and without me i'm sorry i'm sorry but we're not getting in the house so is there anything else you wanna tell me about-- i'm gonna insight check that is a 19 i walk up by my sister and where the woman just wiped that away i take a piece of chalk out of my pocket and write thieves' cant-- not the word thieves' cant-- i use the thieves' cant on the bar and say in that language there is a threat here i can help you deal with it and that's it persuasion you said 20 we need to have a talk we need to talk yes grog it's true he's a vampire could we please meet in a booth in the corner of the pub please we need to talk now i can't be 100% sure but we are sitting atop the thieves' guild pike and i have been here before-- not down in the heart of it like we have underneath here is a honeycomb of thieves i think our man is downstairs they've given me the way in but it's not going to be easy it's not just an empty basement we're sitting on top of the thieves' guild this is the clasp i can-- yes i should take point i'm just saying we're not going down into an empty grain cellar to kill a bunch of rats it's possible for money anything is possible it's complicated where did she say to go it was through the kitchen your memory is like an iron trap we're going to go into the kitchen we're going to go two minutes apart all right don't all go in a crowd i'm going to go in first i'll see you in there and then i walk-- i'm in the kitchen no i already went in (quietly) she told me to go in so that's a 23 do you have an earring on scanlan i need you to make an ode to the kitchen staff could you call the kitchen staff out and-- oh really we've just been in-- in the back-- in that downstairs room where we didn't know well we're in a separate room everybody else come now come now come now really every tool has its place story of my life you've got two minutes while she's doing this bullshit i'm going to make sure that the rice bags and everything are not trapped is there a clear stairways down or i check for traps check for traps come on gnome i got a 25 when i checked for traps a few minutes ago all right i don't know what's down there but let me take the lead because i've dealt with this before i don't crouch down or anything i just start-- still quietly-- but i just walk head held high walking down the stairs motioning everyone to follow who's here yes yes you have the best of jethro tull over there or what careful careful i'm still raw we're all doing stealth checks oh i hope there's so much money in that bag anything we encounter is far easier than what just happened i'm sorry i was just thinking of wendydoodle's art from the comic yeah yeah i'm going to check that door for traps is what i'm going to do earlier yeah i did get a 25 up top yeah i thought you were giving me another door yeah 25 up top where the fake bags of rice were to pick it sure that's no problem it is a 23 amateurs all right i know sometimes i can seem like i'm an idiot but let me do the talking yeah and then i start down and lead the way everybody hold up for a second could we crowd-surf the bard up to us at the front please the bard yes i'm gonna scoop a hand under his head and give him a slap on both sides listen to me i'm gonna try to do the talking in here because i know these people a little but if that fails i need you all right i need you on ice for a little while all right so just stay between me and my sister five locks i want to perception check for traps and for thieves' cant and anything else that's all right 20 i speak elvish common abyssal there's five of them none of them are in elvish so we that leaves one left and we don't know what says there's no thieves' cant on this door so all together there's five locks and we know four of them i look at the two in abyssal they say 'entry' is that right and i already checked for traps and there were no traps just locks do i need to check each lock fuck yeah so we got abyssal abyssal dwarven in the middle and-- and the primordial says no yeah the abyssals say yes and the dwarven said what so i want to try to pick the three that i know two abyssals and the dwarven say entry and i have advantage on i did i checked for traps right i'm rolling right now to check for traps so the top is abyssal here i go no i'm gonna unlock that with advantage four so that's okay this is lock-pick right 23 all right i'm gonna go down to the bottom to the abyssal at the bottom checking for traps oh i thought you said i did perception's 20 all right dwarven in the middle checking for traps 20 all right that's three the fourth one was primordial 20 and the primordial said no but what does it mean we've got three traps that is 26 the last one that we don't know what it is does appear to be trapped i'm not alone and this affects you asshole so there's two that are trapped i'm going to attempt to disarm the two that are trapped this affects you you dark sword-wielding dick everybody wait wait wait wait everybody please walk up the stairs ten feet please yeah walk up the stairs ten feet you're all gonna see it i'm gonna try to open the door you little asshole but i don't want you to get burned while i get burned okay so of the five at the top and the bottom and the middle it's abyssal abyssal dwarven and i checked those for traps and there aren't any so i'm gonna unlock them all right so for the top one check for traps or can i use what i just rolled for the middle one there's too many people talking i don't know what's going on i don't know what's going on yeah i just rolled a ten twice and that's a 23 now the bottom one-- shush okay (laughs) 29 so here's where we don't know what's going on we got number one number three and number five are untrapped unlocked number two and number four are trapped but i'm just pushing the door open but i don't have to make the decision on my own because you're all ten feet away from me yeah i'm gonna open it no high fives here okay so there was a cell that we were in and there was a larger room where we were surrounded by modeth and a lot of people while we're waiting i'm gonna throw my hood over one shoulder and i'm gonna undo my sleeves so that-- oh the clasp is back here isn't it so here's what i'm thinking i mean we could sneak through here and this one's going to sound like a herd of-- our chances of sneaking through here are low i could try to talk us through this guy's a threat to them because the kingdom wants him and they're housing him and that is not really financially viable so i feel like perhaps we talk our way out of this we don't have to go in banging an evil sword not that we have one i belong and i will vouch for you we're in a very thin hallway right now i'm gonna call out i'm calling out member of the clasp entering i need to parlay i do start unlacing and i say i'm one of you and i show the tattoo on my back it's modeth i didn't stumble i've been here before i've a fucked up past with this organisation but i've come to tell you-- and i'm pointing at the tattoo sovereign uriel knows you have daxio here uriel wants him you are in danger this whole organisation is in danger with him here do you care that the emperor knows you're holding a person he wants he's a traitor to the kingdom uriel wants him you are bringing danger upon this house and avoid the hammer of the empire we had the mark i take the keys we've got two to choose from no no but there's two cells or has he opened the cell that he's in okay thanks daxio we've got your papers c'mon i'm going to lock eyes with grog and motion him towards one side of the door and i'm gonna take the other we don't and i called out already 25 we're both at the door and i called out so i guess we'll wait a moment to see if he'll-- well i already went stealth earlier too i got a 25 on the stealth check i can go again if you want if we wait like 30 seconds and nothing happens no 21 i'm doing nothing i'm just standing in place okay i'll use uncanny dodge then unless it's an area effect if it's an area effect i'll use evasion that hits nine points with the uncanny dodge can i move and then hold my turn can i move at all hold the actions yeah that's what i'm saying could i just use my movement and then wait yeah that's what i'm going to do i'm going to circle around and i'm never going to leave him i'm going to go all the way around circle him and then wait and then my trigger is when grog steps up to him oh i can't go around him is grog considered five feet away from him oh then i'm going to sneak attack him from me okay all right then i'm going to use disengage i'm going to step five feet back i'm going to use one action to click my boots of haste and then can i attack because the boots are on after that then i'll throw a dagger at him that is a 24 all right 11 from the keen dagger i was only going to do that if you told me that i could move around him now that i know that i can't-- whoever's in there is locked in there i'm going to disengage and back up against the back wall-- already have all right so i'm going to back up and hold but if i were to go left or right would i be out of range of hitting him because of the doorway so if i move sideways either way i can't hit him so i'm not going to do that i'm going to just step back against the back wall and hold was i within five feet of him yes i'm going to use disengage until grog steps in i'm going to wait to see what grog does as soon as grog's done i'm throwing why do we need trinket we have a small giant are we able to tell from what grog just did what he does does he react does he just go (grunts) until grog did his thing yeah but i wanted to see what happened so it would be after this all right so i'm hasted because i did the boots so i'm going to use haste to climb through my friends over pike under grog's legs and i'm going to-- i'm going to flip daggers over and i'm going to bean this guy in the face a couple of times should be a sneak attack the first time because of grog being there all right that is 30 all right i'm going to blunt-edge him three times so the first one is a natural 20 that's also sneak attack so that doesn't get quadrupled does it it's already doubled from sneak attack yeah okay so-- and then the second one is a 23 okay and did i use all my movement to climb through the scrum or do i have my third attack so i do have a third attack then okay so that's 17 okay so the first one blunt using the end is-- 11 two three seven ten 15 19 19 times two right is 38 plus the seven so 46 for the first that's blunt though and two plus six is eight on the second and seven on the third did i use all my movement to get there all of it i'll take-- i'll go back ten feet see what happens he's on his back so he could probably take a swing at me all right yeah okay i've still got daggers turned around i'm gonna knock this fool out okay yeah and you guys are right on top of him so first one is-- and advantage because he's grappled and down right so first one is 22 second one is a natural 20 third one is 20 all right so the first one is regular attack well there is no sneak attack-- oh yeah yeah i meant that the critical was on the second one that's what i meant so the first one is 11 plus double this 11 plus four eight 12 15 16 22 so that's 44 plus-- oh the second one's the critical attack thank you 22 plus seven is 30 i have three attacks 31 second one is-- that's easy 14 and the third attack is ten the second one was critical but much smaller and i'm gonna jump back ten feet again let him be a hardass we've got about 50 more minutes in here what say we drag this asshole out of here let's get the fuck out of here i get that piece of chalk and in thieves' cant i'm going to write on the wall much appreciated uriel sends his regards v no no we're outstaying our welcome let's go now what the fuck are the cooks gonna do just as a minor detail as we're walking almost like a magic trick i wanna grab my cloak and yank it off pike and wrap it up and put it into my pocket don't make me talk to him because it won't go well
