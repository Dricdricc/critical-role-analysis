well i've probably got about 30 or 40 minutes left on the-- do that yeah i can go swimming your thing or your friend keyleth it was nice being in a couple i am having the best conversation with jb right now okay i am starting to sweat who sees it i don't see it it was like a magic trick it was like a fish turned into a corpse i'm not angry what the shit is this show vax is sitting with jb right now going like so what was pike like when she was really little little for a gnome i was really paying attention to jb though yeah because she's got a wild streak now does that run in the family or is that just her and you what you-- what i'm casting lay on hands for my piddly 20 hit points what did you do did you die she looks like a fucking macabre mess what happened that's what alcohol is for don't jump off cliffs anymore please and i turn her bloody face to you and say let this be a lesson to you then i start kissing the gory mess in my hands all over her forehead we should celebrate because we've broken in the entire group jb welcome to the family i got this make-believe has consequences is 15 hours of that therapy we all stand for something what do you fall for oh so good investigation yeah 18 this has been a bad couple of days well you weren't a proper adventurer until you were got to start somewhere (cell phone ringing) oh dear no you didn't get a read oh it's too hazy i can't see him it's dried in the hair though and caked in give the woman a job keep her busy laura and all right sure right best of intentions yeah i feel you matt has burned us too many times we just got swindled yesterday i'm going to be real shitty and stealth up and peek in and see what she's up to we'll find out won't we 33 for stealth yeah natural 20 i want to insight check and just get as good a read on her emotional state as i can even though she's got a thousand-yard stare this is insight i'll use luck better sure why not what am i saving it for 18 into the earring i say we are terrible terrible assholes she seems fine she seems worthy of a baking job you know work with her for a day but i'm not seeing anything hinky here yeah you need anything else because i'm staring at a woman crying into her satchel my significant other just mangled herself i need to keep busy let's go see yennen and so i lead her off sorry sorry you don't know anything about orcus do you didn't think so we should leave come on surprise so much that's what she's doing tonight i don't think that's what she does every day did i see more than one room or was it a single-room home of cakes that's pronounced boysness grog got down to boysness and ended a fool's life sharpshooter wouldn't that nullify that three-quarter cover means nothing it's just full cover yeah both were high teens he's telling her real stuff man vex dies well first i drag keyleth off to the cozy little bathtubs that they have here in the castle and took the opportunity-- they're quite small actually and washed all of the caked-in the last of the caked-in blood and everything no that really happened that actually happened yesterday congratulations you got a little bit of sleep stuff still in your eye yeah that's better sam he's sleeping in isn't he where are you no they're at vex's house sam why don't you just tell us where you are i tag along i want to a take a look at that and see if it looks like a trap and i don't understand magic but if it is similar to any trigger mechanisms that i've seen 31 do you think this thing is looking at us this little bead yeah i don't think it's trapped or anything you probably can do that looks like the bead shut him down did you see tary-town was she a drow yeah he is daddy's boy well it's irrelevant though we've got to go get him laura and a tree stride spell traveling yeah that's a lot of ifs though 22 no 24 all right it's not locked anymore 32 one more in here is there any bullshit hiding around in here 29 all right whisper out and i cut her free you all right what happened and you've met us before no that's good that's also pretty good yeah what's our fastest method there gilmore's been many places he might have something from there two days go to emon talk to shaun he's been everywhere don't do it the last time we came here we came flying out of a tree on an angle before we do percy do you know anything about this country we're in anything also we can't talk when we're farts so when we get there what's the plan plan man what happens if we don't see the person on the horse what happens we just land right outside the gates and ring the bell okay but that seems a little dicey if we want to work out what we're going to do we're just going to appear and say howdy you and tary are thick as thieves now how plugged in is his dad yes maryanne darrington all right who are you talking to (blows raspberry) many things are possible though have to be within 500 feet going down to tary-town to where we can see the city and see the road coming to it what do you think you think we should camp out here for a while and keep an eye on the road for a day or two see if we can intercept and if they never show up then we need to figure out going into the city and intercept him is there forest on the sides of the road from where we are so open fields and roads shite okay and what's on the sides of the road is it tall grass bald i'm going to get into some grass as close to the road as i can oh that's a good one 37 it's a reliable talent in fact horse killing is a feat you took right (whoosh) 24 how close are we right in this second or not salt salt you got a four because of all that salt what distance am i right now would you say okay but am i within 50 feet 60 feet 60 feet all right so i'm going to throw whisper at her and she's brambled right yeah that hits that's a 32 i'm going to bamf there on this one right up to her that is four plus eight is 12 plus this guy makes it 19 plus these guys now we do some more math 20 26 27 31 34 39 42 with whisper right into her back and then click the boots of haste and then i'm going to scuttle to tary and cut ropes he's probably within ten feet right all right so i'm cutting him totally loose and i'm going to lift him away whatever you'll let me do action action bonus action right and movement to get there then i'll use it to cut him loose okay good enough you all right t well initially we thought you could handle it you're not really in a position of power here darling you are rose gold bet you're glad for that cloud cover today aren't you what should we do here and how do you want to play this because your pops wants you back obviously what do you want to do i'm still watching are you sure you're cool to walk in right now i'm going to yank vex aside actually are you talking about what i think you are talking about you want to send her after your friend you think he wants a mercenary showing up in his life looking for him think about it he's doing what he wants to do i wasn't trying to hide it when you were in vasselheim-- how would you feel if you learned that we'd sent someone to watch you he left he wanted to go he wanted to be away from us if he wants to come back i want him back what if he's being a father to his child what if he's enjoying his life i'm off to the side with grog going one two three shoot we could have cut that air with a knife i know some about the myriad correct rusty rusty trombone i understand this is very complicated are we really looking for a solution to fix several generations of your family's misdeeds it sounds like your father your grandfather have been navigating murky waters for some time i don't know what the right decision is either do you marry this woman to fix decades of terrible decisions you make really good blondies and many things besides blondies as well so if we know that that's not happening then we deal with the problem that is left behind which is do we worry about your family's life their safety are they safe here or are they gonna be eaten alive god this sucks nah man you're one of us now you're halfway there he actually can take that much damage though mom was great she was the best it was years ago i've got this great trick but i can only do it once
