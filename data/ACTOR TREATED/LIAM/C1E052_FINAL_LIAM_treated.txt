i have a little cute facehugger for the face the other neat thing about loot crate boxes is you can turn them inside out and they become something this one's an arcade machine you are a good actor yeah kill him a lot for what he's about to do dungeons and dragons we've come a long way to get here tonight it's true we may die and when our bones are turned to dust carry them away in wyrmwood gaming boxes the finest wooden boxes for carrying the remains of the dead ever they're great oh and you can put dice in 'em too which is probably their intended purpose and if you like them they have many different kinds of woods you go to wyrmwoodgamingcom and if you want to pay for shipping you can but if you don't want to pay for shipping use the code 'critrole' feels so good and you'll get free shipping and then also lastly this is the last couple of hours for their kickstarter for the sentinel box you can get our logo onto any box like this or you can get the real swag and get the master box it looks like this on any wood and you put your dice in it cards in it so that kickstarter a couple more hours then finito if you want to get in on that okay that's from coriolanus i want a d10 sam could you kiss your right gun we're the innocents matt we're the innocents 24 all the people who wanted to go first are going first am i at a window as well downstairs am i half on a street in a door all right i'm going to click my boots crack the door a few inches and i'm going to hold my turn until one of our magic-users pulls a trick or kevdak takes a swing at grog between the legs upside-down this is where my held turn comes in yeah go for it no he's stuck do the twins go first or does grog go first i'm going to go just to verify because kevdak is still raging am i denied the surprise attack from inside here okay so i'm going to use sharpshooter and drop five to hit harder i'm going to throw a dagger at advantage yeah yeah to the doorway right so the first-- kevdak 60 feet okay so it's 25 four oh hold on i'll save that four 20 okay (counting) 31 37 okay i'd like to use my bonus action to throw the next-- i thought that was a gimme-- oh that's the bonus action so taking a hold is an action i don't understand okay which doorway where am i on the map i can't see myself right there could i run to the corner of the building that the archers are on and scrabble up the side of it and get to that archer acrobatics check 30 do i have an action left action action bonus action with the hasted boots okay so i'm outta gas he's going to fail this one and remember this is happening in about ten seconds who wants bacon in the shape of madeline kahn and it's out for blood you mean 30 seconds with the earring it's all right you're already a badass i still think you're really cool two for kevdak's initiative and two for here all right i want to preface this with last week i misspoke i thought i had one luck left as i used it but i got it backwards so i have one luck left this week in case i want to use it you can well no i said the wrong thing but anyway i want to use my first action to shove that archer backward off the roof yeah shove them off strength athletics check i'm going to trigger the luck right now that helped it yeah that gets it to 20 ah no towards you matt was my intention yeah now question am i able to use my bonus action to hide behind that chimney from kevdak's view and the archers are am i able to do that just with kevdak okay so i hide behind the chimney stealth check that's 25 and i would like to use my last action to throw at kevdak so i should still have advantage because he's held and i should have if i'm hiding it's a sneak attack isn't it oh my friend's still next to him oh then then excuse me i would like to throw two daggers right and i did the boots so i have action-action-bonus action every millimeter counts tonight two attacks right now okay so first one is an 18 to hit kevdak second one is a 25 to hit kevdak both hit okay so the first one (counting) i'm missing a big pile of dice eight 12 13 19 22 28 30 36 is it it's not a crit right right i have to be right up against him to get a crit and the second dagger does eight halved to four and i have a little bit of movement right i'll go fwoosh right up against the flat side right below keyleth pressed against the wall there no not that all right maybe maybe a quick look maybe a quick look oh shit never mind never mind i didn't say it i didn't say it so it doesn't matter staring at him with that dead-in-the-eyes percy look yeah airsoft shot to the nuts something to remember you by yeah mvp 8d4 four-sided the four-sided pyramids if he hits if he hits the ground yes it is welcome to our production of julius caesar here it comes that's what you said are you saying what's in your head is different than what's in my head he can't get the bone or stuff i hope ask that guy scanlan's going to disneyworld head of the snake the roof blows off shit i'm going to use my bonus action to dash and hasted i get 24 squares of movement on this board i'm going to drop off the roof staying along the wall i should be able to take a diagonal at that corner and totally avoid greenbeard i want to go no i want to go straight this way towards the tree and drop all right yep i want to go along the wall i can swoop around it and avoid greenbeard i'm going to run past this barbarian she'll probably take an attack but i'm wearing that cloak so she's at disadvantage i'm going to run up to kevdak and i'm going to stab him twice-- i should get sneak attack damage and a crit because he's frozen then i'm going to run the fuck out that's what i'd like to do misses 22 daggers out hasted raven queen armor fuck y'all okay advantage on all these right right right ermagerd 22 for the first which hits ah yeah they both hit and 26 for the second first one three plus-- oh my god three plus-- eight ten 16 22 23 29 32 which is doubled to 64 plus six right well let's get it up to the top and then halve it so 32 to 64 plus six is 72 halved that's the first and then the second one does two plus six is eight no two and da-ba-ba-ba-- that's just the dice is doubled so four it's ten and i'd like to use the rest of well go ahead any movement i have left i want to use to run up to the other side of the wall that keyleth is on if i have enough i'll climb up if not i'll go behind that barrel but if i before i go quietly i say to kevdak your fate is sealed here today my friend yeah no this is like 30 seconds later if that but he's great at riverdance (laughter) end the fight scanlan it's all right do it do it i can dodge that shit i can dodge that shit i could've avoided it completely can't you stay alongside him the whole time just circle him

everybody set that tree on fire c'mon red laura and while the entire square sets on fire vax quietly and quickly falls a little deeper in love laura and you accidentally knocked one off the roof matt

amazing every week you do amazing and we're all going to die yeah well c'mon sarenrae but they're all attacking each other now constitution save right this is real bad what is that that's eight i'm kate moss man it just halved me everyone's at disadvantage with me just a reminder i'm coming whoa ah help poetic justice he's unconscious you opened it up to the dice and the dice decided not me right after vex yeah i'm going to use disengage to back a little bit away from them i'm going to scrabble up the wall-- where's the light no-- i want to go up by keyleth i'm not the first one to do that and pass her i want to jump down and land in front of grog and jump in front of him between him and-- not greenbeard between grog and everyone over there that's fine that's fine 25 and i land on him and i say kevdak has fallen will you let strongjaw rise and i hold my action to attack if they come at me is it full palm-up or is it barcalounger style pinkie's up shrinks as it leaves i would like to sever the remaining gristle away from his arm that's holding the gauntlet on then i would like to loot greenbeard's body yeah shot right in the chest i already called greenbeard okay i'm going to spend the rest of the time that they did that ritual gathering up the bodies the remains i'm going to start a fire-- is it i'll stoke it and then put the bodies on in the short term we should be
