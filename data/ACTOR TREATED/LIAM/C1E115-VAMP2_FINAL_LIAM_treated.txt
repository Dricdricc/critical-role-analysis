and gary gygax beloved for inventing our cherished game i'm a snaggle tooth now i just took one out sure for now i'll change it it'll be different teeth at different times sometimes there will be none sometimes there will be both let's make it none and gygax had very long protruding fingers like obscenely long fingers right i don't know i talk into a can for a living i don't know i saw the lost boys that doesn't tell me anything about vampires it's in the movies guys we are going to die or undie or something can we focus in on what are we going to do dani's dead does my iphone have any service this is a really character-heavy question does anyone have an extra pencil no you should probably do that obfuscate thing that you've talked about is above sealed help me visualize what's above us so we're not getting any firelight or anything i'm not seeing anything definitely sam or laura or travis should go ahead let the brain hang back and figure shit out right she's got this that's like here to the door out to the-- i mean you're not really human anymore you're kind of tough now i'll be 51 feet behind yessir not doing a good job of quelling the serial killer thing sam she doesn't either you don't eat rats what do you mean sofa king we can but yeah let me pitch something here like we're all tired we have day jobs i am that's not what i'm talking about i mean in general we got day jobs we got night jobs we work a lot we could be princes and queens of death now husbo you are two hours into being a vampire if that you just learned how to run who knows what else you're going to learn that's hot did i kill that guy did i kill max when i ate him who was it that's the worst thing to say dressed like pacman and also i'm really shy and awkward right but as a vampire it can only get better right i mean i am there might be underground lakes in here okay so we're not nazgul jeez all kinds of things are changing now yeah we've got to progress our lives our unlives further so we can't stay here arguing whatever we're going to do i want to be a vampire i'm fucking in i'm not hiding this from you travis i'm not hiding anything from you we'll bring you around i'll give it a shot like an otter pop let's read the handwriting a perception and awareness that's not bad that's not bad let's see i did really well in school except that's cocked i should just take the six so i got an x i got a one on the red and an eight one two three three successes and one-- yeah it says skanktuary that is disgusting i'll wait for a person thanks this says sanctuary and we know that shit was going on in this building for a while before we were let in on it so i don't know maybe a hideout that's been under here for a while that we didn't know while vamps were getting-- yes you are i will okay laura's going first listen when i was a teenager in new jersey my first job was working for the department of public works no joke and we cleaned up after homeless folk okay can i try and read the hobo code yeah okay ooh okay yeah we cleaned up and once i found some nasty old mattresses with some magazines some smelly things right underneath hamilton park oh no one success only one success and one failure on a blood die i didn't roll that yeah like dirty magazines on a mattress that's worse it is taking me home though it's good i'm going to leave it behind because i've got a new future now why do you look like that what's wrong with you i'm backing away there will be brawl i'm following too but not that fast you guys doing okay down there good call i've been listening in and i come in and say what about this and i use presence awe on him sure am what do i roll charisma plus persuasion is all it says all right well charisma plus persuasion ooh i failed it wow there are a lot of failures tonight yeah two successes and one failure on a blood die a lot of failures on a fucking blood die yeah do you work in the business bottom line we don't mean you any harm i mean we're hungry but you're not really our-- you're not our diet just the basics if you take the vampire teeth out taliesin did my glamor work don't know all right you're not nerdist i mostly know geek & sundry before we do we're idiots right we're brand new obviously there's been some sort of peace between above and below and we just want to facilitate that right it's hot in here so if you could keep doing that how big are we talking like an nfl stadium i was just in one are you not allowed in there lock same taliesin's brother are you sure okay if you insist only if you insist my normal place how big is the house how many seats specifically lizard men i step forward and begin to talk using presence awe again which is charisma so i roll a single blood die that's a two i'm at four i'm real hungry lizard two we mean no disrespect or harm and are in awe of what you have built here we have wandered down by accident due to calamity and we are children of the night in the purest sense and we ask for patience and empathy for the unwise i'll go further we are in fear and awe of this council no fucking joke and all we want is safe passage and understanding we don't mean to subvert or cause problems merely to survive he doesn't speak for all of us might be too soon for a jump right away sam this is like being john malkovich you're not the real john malkovich this is like a pretend john malkovich john malkovich playing a pretend john malkovich we'll pretend you aren't super keen yeah you look like a serial killer well i'm not going to fluff us up we don't know much but we did come in contact with some sort of vampire lord they all burned up the airport subways lizard colonies there's always one guy is he as old as the rest i mean how much is the iguana talking about iras and shit and also do you have any human prisoners down here or anything i'm a good talker these days these hours if i could maybe eat gratefully no yeah (whispering) that's what i'm talking about travis yeah sam yeah this feels great i mean i'm hungry but we get to spend time together for fucking ever they've got internet question have you heard allworknoplay any episodes you've got nothing you've got nothing is it one of these smiles which leads to los globos they're not typical though gross guys so careful i do not want to get mercer-ed or you guys but especially me let's go worse but mercer-ed seems easier to happen so the pyramid goes all the way to the top flying squirrel see vampires are fucking awesome your husband can fly my husband can run what are you doing you're trying to turn into a bat oh my god do it you feel it but it stays up inside and we're all in the top of this ziggurat (yelling) travis blam i'll give you a boost but how are we all going to-- okay this comes naturally do you still have that cable so one of us boosts the other up drops the cable don't dick me it's got to i mean neither of us are willingham i could try it's not going to be pretty thousands of feet away we're at the top of a ziggurat looking at the ceiling yeah lock can you boost my friend don't offer to mahlo mahlo come here let me find a sharpie i write on his arm vax /// let's go i'm not but that's what i did i'm not at all and i step on sam's back and i jump i'm not talking about the character sheet dex athletics okay ooh well one success on a blood die and one fail on a non-blood die same shit yeah two successes yeah boys can you help my friend up you're so big in a small space seven we're within a mausoleum or something a metal gate that we can see through is there any writing in

antelope away from the herd sure sure i'm into it so i look for one of the porta-potties that's got the little circle turned to red right yeah (knocking) i forcibly yank it open yeah you know how shitty porta-potties are built i'm pretty sure this is the one thing i could break open the one thing sure oh that's going to be shitty strength ooh what do i-- i have more blood die than strength and brawl combined all blood die word one fail yeah sorry man it's uncalled-for i'm sorry i'm going to wait until he's done i'm waiting in line and as soon as the door opens as soon as i hear k-chunk i'm yanking it open and pushing in i'm biting yeah as soon as that door's open of course i'm so hungry oh no i need another blood die that's great three successes one failure the successes are on blood
