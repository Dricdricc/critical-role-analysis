good time to mention that in between last game and this-- --cantrips not-- right but caleb would have known that after liam had asked the dm so we're switching out that cantrip for hold person if that was at the store and caleb is flat broke until right now you blindfold him on the way to being blindfolded oh oh six of one half a dozen of another order of the story (intones melody) why do you have so many names you woke up buried in the ground and you are saying that you have no memory keeping it real on the field line well you can say whatever you want but whatever you say has to be true that's how it works you can also just say i don't feel like talking wow 13 but dm we know that we feel it according to the spell yeah but do you have any theories for what happened before how much time passed between waking up in a dirt box and the circus yeah many are you a good guy are you talking about your abilities (as jester) oh i have a question is there anyone in the group you find super attractive (as liam) a text from laura oh ask yasha oh (as jester) what about you (as jester) you can tell me yasha how much of this was under wraps you knew any of this in your time in the circus with-- (as jester) molly what about have you ever pooped your pants mt or empty jester i feel your touch on this conversation is this all accurate and the rest well i will say i am a little concerned about you know loose ends coming to bite you and us in the butt however-- i believe in second starts and that's enough for me may i make a check to see if i have ever heard of the moonweaver 23 (as jester) molly (as jester) i have a question (as jester) can you really read fortunes (as jester) you have a feeling what about your tattoos though that's a lot of ink man hey does any of that symbology mean anything to me (as jester) (clears throat) caleb i have a question (as jester) do you shave your butt (as caleb) i can truthfully say-- no that was for me now you know that neither molly nor i shave our butt and also there's not a lot of hair there anyway so perhaps we have learned all we need to learn from this conversation maybe it is time to turn in we have some things to do tomorrow i am satisfied mollymauk tealeaf for now the gentleman described the research facility to everybody right before they split off the gentleman described the research facility the job to everybody right so we all heard that yeah oh no i'm going to scuttle off and go over to pumat's i have just a short little shopping oh you do okay so i'm having bacon down below so i will wait until i see you you need to let your soul glow shuriken how much is a little bit hey for throwing stars from pumat okay i will definitely ask him if he has throwing stars not interested but i will ask about the items you are looking for well not one-of-a-kind no oh man laura is texting with a full case of fomo right now ooh we miss you laura next week when you get home just the blinds are open you did the artist formerly known as prince just breathe it in i gather we all hear this conversation yeah ah regular percival de rolo over here yasha and caleb in napoleon dynamite i'm sorry i have a simple request about 100 gold worth of ink for transcribing arcane knowledge i have four gold to my name again don't worry about it it is it is i don't think she would actually she might but it doesn't seem her bag sounds like bullshit to me what about yourself yeah but i've seen you throw a dagger or two in your time and you always have to walk out to the tree and pull it out or walk out to the gnoll and pull it out this way it would come right back to you think about it i understand if she changes her mind we'll let you know how high are the ceilings in this store i low how your voice went (low voice) to (imitating matt) the ceiling's about-- okay got it she is quite pale it's hard to tell attention's a bitch isn't it ashley and a thousand throwing stars i hand yasha one of the ten gold that beau gave me this is beau's money so i think she'd want you to purchase them yeah but she doesn't like me very much that's doubtful why do i think it's doubtful she will like me she has threatened me constantly she is very aggressive she's very surly she doesn't smile a lot unless there is a spell cast on her i've only seen her punch people in the face give her time i give one gold to yasha and i hold on to the other nine i'm going to give it back to her too real for me too real we see guards asking around okay i am just going to pull my cloak up and put the hood up that's all well horris is part of the mission we should go let's make hay while the sun shines yes they were so heavy and i am so weak that i gave them to yasha to carry here's your change i'm just weird in general this is a
