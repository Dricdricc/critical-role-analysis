i would like to announce that i am nervous as shit no i should feel comfortable that you're going to soak it all up come on guys just like we did in rehearsals (laughter) he's more into shadowrun we need to build bleachers back here we've got this thing well step into camera if you're going to make such a big to-do come in and say hi and then get out you already pulled wil out of the picture we never left 13 are they rats or are they rous's yeah he does that math is for everybody guys really it feels like you just did 17 things now go home and get your shine box we're how high up from here we're that far back all right so it takes my whole movement just to run to the edge probably yeah and that's it bonus action right but i can't see can i see past the lip of the edge to the top of that (sighs) that's it are you body-shaming that otyugh coming okay i'm going to run up to the edge of it are any of my friends right up against this nasty shit keyleth so if it's occupied with my friend i can take a second aim really well and sneak attack from up here okay so that is 24 all right so sneak attack that's a two plus nine this is keen dagger nine plus 12 17 21 that's 21 30 and the second dagger which is life-stealing hits with a 24 that is eight nope just going to perch that is cg that is computer-generated you got your dick bit by a rat son you're a man now you need d10s refuse is code for shit i'm staying safe up here i'm going to throw more daggers there's a little pile under thorbir's hiney and a little bit out by itself right are they spilling out from under the dwarf's hiney or are they all hidden okay i'm going to throw daggers at the one that's biting his ass so it's a sneak attack that's not good that's 13 oh hey rats oh right that's two plus seven is nine plus 11 12 17 18 19 21 is the first dagger and i send the next one down if the last one hit this one hits so that's 21 and the second dagger is a ten so 31 cheese i'm going to hop down in the shit and loop an arm under thorbir's arm come on old man all right hold on everybody i walk right toward it perception checking the area around it and the door itself that's 24 locked all right well i pull out my little sack and i pull out one of these (twing) and go to work on it that is a 28 i fonzie'd it okay tiberius are you still lighting up this room okay so there's probably a little bit of light going in there so i'm trying to look in to see what i can see from his spill-in there okay tibs follow that try and keep behind me and i throw up the hood and go as low to the ground as i can and i start to gollum along the floor looking at the ground in front of me in the dim light trying to see if i can see any traps ahead of me 25 hear anything i grab my earring let's do it and i start moving forward i'm looking at the floor and everything as far out as i can see ahead of me i thought we would have seen it here what's in there okay out comes the pick i'm going to perception check that corpse through the cell that's a 12 now for the door natural 20 i feel really terrible but i'm going to give him the old half-elven pat-down and see if i can find anything on his personage you can do that that's badass you know he's dead right weeks ago not five minutes ago thorbir's right we're burning time we need to go in you're absolutely right we're going in when we're in there you keep it busy and i will carve it up i slide past tiberius crouch down to the ground again and start scuttling along the ground looking listening i'd like to imagine that thorbir and vax left that conversation behind a little i start pushing back on thorbir backing everybody up silently pushing backward and trying to steer everyone in a heap backwards and to the side of the cell we just came from just trust me 19 did i get them into the cell yeah that was what i wanted to do just backwards to everybody i give everybody a group hug with my cloak of elvenkind and try to make a big rag pile out of this corner i'm very uncomfortably pressed against thorbir's backside (laughs) thorbir it's the thought that counts (muffled) what the fuck all right back around the corner following around looking listening everybody the same perception i got you baby well that was perception towards that other door that they did not come out of 23 i rolled perception okay let's unlock it that is a 21 can i use uncanny dodge to roll backward right now and i say nope 11 as well i roll back going (squeals) okay i will do that 11 this is going to be fun (whispering) they call me count chocula (laughter) use this one it's quicker would it be his wisdom 17 right now me and ghost in my mind are doing that scene from ghost with the pottery no tiberius--  i rolled 22 rock that math come on don't i make a stealth check he got 19 oh yeah that's true yeah my cloak gives you disadvantage okay that is a nine plus five ten 22 24 that's 33 there's no save or anything let's go to the bar 17 it's hard to accept love from others when you hate yourself okay that's shit i rolled a 12 with advantage on both attacks or one because of my ghost friend so the first is high 28 second is a one come on one (mutters) 19 doesn't he have an armor class of 20 doesn't one of them miss wouldn't a 19 miss his 20 armor no one was a total 19 so the first one does and that is-- okay that's the lowest this could possibly be seven plus nine 12 16 17 24 tag i don't like this game i don't really like this episode come on clock me war and peace let's do this okay you have a fan you told me when i pick-pocketed that guy topside it was a healing potion it was blue right that's what you told me i'm pulling that out of my pocket and walking over to that door in a daze and i just down it push the door open with my foot no well yeah sort of my name is vax and i keep going i'm just looking i take another potion because i have one more and i'm going to look down the hall save it what's that superior is a 4d4 i'm just going to look down that hall okay i put my hand on thorbir's hand and guide him back out and shut the door and say it's fucking acid in that room i just sit on the ground i'm back in the hall with you acid-filled room i'm going to rest let's all just take a breather do you want to camp or do you want to take a breather it's a 20-foot-long hoagie too soon (laughter) it's a tribal food that her people eat it's vegetarian she set it out have a seat eat the food i just start eating i'm wiped out he's going to get gone that guy or that gal i don't want to go on a date with it i want to kill it we're on the clock here how long does everything last from that feast keyleth i'm already good yeah i flip my last potion to keyleth it's a superior we don't have an egg timer he just ran down here he could fly to timbuktu go to kraghammer hang out with johnny kraghammer long story kash let's go i'm going to slowly push that door open and try to use perception in the room yeah if that crud is moving and try to see a door on the far end wait a tic wait a sec i back out slowly and i'm going to creep back to the other door that other one yeah perception check there as well that's 16 okay and does that count for the traps as well okay so i'm going to open it an inch and see what i can see acid it is that's what i just looked in oh a third door i thought there was two just allow me you're strong that's 27 my armor is resistant to acid let me lead the way is there any shit sitting around any rubbish i'm going to pull up a plank of that crate everyone but me well there's that do you maybe want to sparrow across keyleth then i get to come you guys are pretty great oh we all fit on it oh look at that staring at the slime on the ground looks like kash is 26 sometimes i really hate this old-world shit can i make out any traps or anything in the ceilings or the walls but nothing in addition to that how about handle animals man it's going to be all right tell me how i would go about doing this as i fall with the carpet i want to try to pull up on the carpet and land in the shit 27 i'm wearing acid-resistant armor am i under is the carpet with me under the acid well that did not work me i'm trying to climb up onto the rock that is right there that i didn't jump onto who's on it now well i guess i'm swimming through acid then no i'm just going to start wading towards the other side that's all right because i rolled a 19 so that is a total of 21 i saw this great documentary about it on youtube i can walk i can fight i'm not as pretty vex is going to kill us my sister on a delay they just saw it the other half of the party saw it die 20 seconds after it happened and we heard them scream from out there can we just take a moment for the carpet please we've had a lot of good times with that carpet we found clarota on that carpet never mind let's not talk about that (sighs) well i do and my sister's going to kill me specifically (groans) sorry got an 18 on perception so we're at a dead end on the other side of this shit look tiberius it has sentimental value we'll put it in greyskull keep just put it in the bag folks we're moving and i follow him i'm going stealth now i want him dead i want his house burned to the ground 22 i can fly 19 to quote the bard scanlan all right well i earlier rolled a 32 on stealth but i don't know if that means shit right now but i'm clicking my boots of haste and moving along the wall no i'm going to stay put i'm going to attack him i'm going to throw-- dagger dagger dagger-- through the air (flying blades) from the shadows i have no idea he might be able to see me like the predator he already moved right so i don't get advantage for assassinate but we'll see if i get sneak attack damage that's a three so that's shit that's a nine-- 15 that is 21 that was the dagger of life-stealing now you tell me i was hidden in the shadows and rolled a 32 does that matter with him yeah okay (counts quietly) 22 yeah 22 i'm going to move through the group directly counter to him behind the statue i'm using evasion i'm going to hit the ground and roll well what did we have to hit i rolled a 16 so i made it nothing i hit the ground and roll stop drop and roll people stop drop and roll tiger on tiger here we go this is science even your memory betrays you wheaton but with advantage ugh 15 yeah (robotic) i will kill you all i'm possessed man besides you should have done that shit already the moment already happened i'm possessed you can't retcon that shit let's cut the guest visitor because really really and i'm hasted my boots are hasted so here i go oh that's good that is a 23 should i do damage on all of these all right but there's no sneak attack so not that bad great good i mean let's kill this guy i love you rakshasa okay so that first one hit for eight the second one is a natural 20 (carving noises) you're already cut up you don't even know this is not sneak attack so it's not the worst it could be that was my life-stealing dagger and on a natural 20 i get the ten hit points that i cut from him or whatever i get i guess it was seven which is doubled to 14 oh okay oh so that's much less then that is an eight and then i get ten hit points how does it work it says i get ten hit points so i just get ten or do i get up to what i cut him for well the good news is i'm back up to full here comes that third dagger man this one is poisonous and that hits that is an eight plus the poison has a dc of 15 roll a 15 or higher please will sorry i'm so sorry he's putting it on my face i can't help it i'm so guilty with advantage 19 or a five so i'll take the 19 21 oh man i feel so bad about this channel it to where it matters no i'm good i'm out she's becoming the destroyer it's called crisscross applesauce now i'm going to use my bonus action to hide 27 two daggers out of the dark i'll keep that that is a 30 can i squat down behind kash all right you tell me i don't know how bright or dark it is in here can i run naruto-style low now he's behind me toward the statue and crouch at the base of it and then shoot up from there okay first roll was a 30 (counts quietly) 38 for the one dagger number two probably going to go astray that was 14 give him the al capone kash i'm going to uncannily dodge once a round i can halve the damage oh yes no you can do four level-1 spells you can do one level-4 spell you can do two level-2 spells don't piss off tetsuo man you were saying something about my sister he suddenly turns pink and says (snagglepuss impression) exit stage right even
