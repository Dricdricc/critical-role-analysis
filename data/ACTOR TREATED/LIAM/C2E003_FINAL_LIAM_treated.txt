first good one of the campaign come on well-oiled machine that party oh my god i saw some early black and white pages today show us your mouth holes i would like to hide behind 50 characters now elf 11 ja three what's your modifier holy shit and you're one plus nothing we just walked out of the tent door and are looking at that we're safe is that one five or ten feet away from me the horses immediately freak out and start running this direction in a gallop i am going to move over a bit towards that carriage and i pull the diamond out of my component pouch and a small prismatic ball forms over it i take my other hand and spin it really fast and little ice shards start shooting out of the side i take it with the free hand and i'm going to throw it like a fucking baseball pitcher at the one closest to beauregard d&d beyond where did you go oh that's good 23 okay so that is cold damage 3d8 come on nine total question am i supposed to roll initiative for frumpkin as well okay if that's what you want to do i'm sending frumpkin to zip under that tent he has 40 feet of movement yeah that's it ja i've seen this twilight episode he knows what is behind your screen the rest of the game okay i'm also tapped as well i'm going to back up against the tent that we came out of and with a sinking pit in my stomach my hand starts to blacken and flake and fire springs from the palm and it shoots and i cast fire bolt that is a cantrip yeah that's good though that's 17 that's 1d10 that's this guy here that i never used in the last campaign oh that's four i probably have a little bit of movement left i would like to sidle into the tent that i exited before and disappear frumpkin will dart across behind molly to the little tent 40 ja that's it that's my girl what does happen is frumpkin scrabbles up your back and comes to your shoulder and i'm watching everything from my hidey hole we probably have a half hour at this point nott you feel frumpkin's claws slowly and deliberately squeeze into your shoulder caleb gets over it and he comes out and starts helping push the bodies onto the-- doesn't say anything but starts pushing bodies onto the back of the cart this is not my thing i am not brave like nott let's get out of here please i haven't learned that one yet some day is its name roy during all the busywork i'm not saying anything but i keep giving worried and stressed glances at my little friend would you have the abilities to burn these things up the way we did are you capable could you have killed these things is that believable for people who know you yeah she frogged out i will attempt to do the same to do arcane recovery also i have a cat that's not what i mean if we catch up to them my cat can follow and i can watch if we find them then we assign frumpkin to the case and i will lean against a tree nott will keep watch over me and we will know where it goes you'd have to erase the tracks all the way back to the-- how far back are you willing to go what's the plan here are we going to flee i know everybody's in deep shit i understand the problem but my question is are we cutting and running no i mean cutting and running we do it all the time those two burnt men yes beauregard are the people on the boat doing anything different because the city is on the lake so we're just around the edge of the lake it depends on what we're going to do the other thing we can do but it will take some time need about an hour frumpkin is a cat but frumpkin does not need to be a cat i could fly him over as well but i need time i need about an hour i changed my mind i believe i used arcane recovery during the day so forget it if i have an hour to do some ritual casting yeah at the level two-- oh sorry go ahead it's a rules question you go for it rules question caleb is too fucking poor to change frumpkin's shape willy-nilly because it's ten gold pieces worth of charcoal incense and herbs which i don't have so he's a cat for the foreseeable future i need incense herbs and charcoal no i'm just talking in my accent to you do you have charcoal if we can get back into town somehow i will that random book about fiends has all the answers about the fiend we're chasing let's go get it how much ground did we cover i don't know half a mile that's your specialty drops a couple of horse apples i cast thaumaturgy (quacks) i do but i rolled 12 you have advantage right roll again 16 i'm going to dig some charcoal out of the remains of the fire in the common room and then go to bed don't thank me lovely inn good night just going to draw some dicks wait is there a rest button where are they whoa we got back in the middle of the night no real job here i go down it's yorda who runs the place i find yorda excuse me a question about the town is there a pawn shop anywhere in this city thank you wockwurt lochward's general of course excuse me that's in the lochward then only been here two days okay you are down here yeah okay that flask yes i did see it no i'm not sorry at all but i have a big favor to ask you that's very valuable what you have there do you know that is made of platinum let me explain it to you that little bottle is worth a great deal it can buy you many full bottles would you like to trade that for many bottles of booze many we could buy you another flask that can hold whiskey just as well as that one here's the thing you know that i was very interested in those books we came here for books and booze you've gotten a little booze but we can get a lot and those books are expensive and i know that we can get enough money for it and i really don't feel like pushing our luck with the law here in town and pulling a fast one again they were worth a total of 13 gold did she just hand me 13 gold i take her by the head and i rustle our heads together that's a good deal i leave to find that place oh you're coming too what a good day this is all right let's go shopping hello there my friend just as i said i've returned i have what we agreed on 13 gold for these two books that we discussed free books these are the same two books as yesterday oh i was asking matthew these are the same two books oh good excellent i never stopped with the british either last time so i'm never going to stop oh i'm so happy and i'm saying this out loud as caleb good day to you i scoop up nott and i just start dancing down the street with her up onto my shoulders no we have plans to make with our new friends let's go get some breakfast nope we're away good shopping run where did you get 13 gold good to know i don't need to know anything more i'm just happy that you have it i'm thankful i just squeeze the cheeks and i look at my books yes i will start on the one about fiends because it is topical no i'm going to read here good focus yeah go away i shove the book deep into my belt near my dick so she doesn't want to go near it good point hey now i do not let her i am in a corner how long was that for oh this is about grumpkins and periwinkles what is a periwinkle occasional drawings there's no penises drawn in this book so i don't think you'd be interested leave me alone i'm reading i need 20 actual seconds to see what the piece of paper says do i remember people talking about nightmares from the past couple of days not liam but caleb okay and i didn't overhear okay i mean it's chock-a-block with a lot of things most of it probably untrue and stories to scare your children but there is some sort of demon that is described as being fat and rotund and it talks about-- i mean this is too coincidental it can't be the thing that we're-- what are the odds of something being in this book and it's what we're chasing today but this is describing some sort of scaled demon that feeds on people in the night when they're sleeping and it leaves corrupted undead corpses behind known as husks does this book-- is it of this town or general book could be anywhere you haven't heard the word nergaliid because that's what i'm talking about here once again i have no idea if this is the creature that we're in pursuit of but this talks about it not eating food but siphoning the life off of mortal creatures but not to the point of death or harming them they might not even notice that it's happening it says that this thing has two types of feeding one is slow and unnoticeable maybe and one is quick with much pain and anguish no it does not right it's a kid's encyclopedia britannica and scanning through i saw one thing that popped out may i ask with my intelligence score of 18 and the keen mind feat could we say that caleb is a speed reader believably not magic good times it was still funny when it was just implied you can paint it across the wall we're talking about masturbation would you say that caleb is a speed-beater i could i could also-- here's the thing about my cat he's a cat definitely a cat but is also a fey creature if i have an hour he doesn't have to be a cat he can temporarily be a bird well i have a lot of charcoal now and you said you have incense on you let it all out go for it don't hold back yes i prefer him as a cat to be honest but in a pinch well not any kind of creature but i've made him an octopus once there was this one time when nott was very high up in a burning building and we had no way to get her down i think it's octopi it can be pricey to keep bringing him back and all that but he-- no you can't kill him she's eaten him twice i will need about an hour of time i'll probably head upstairs do you have a pot i could borrow i was hoping you had an iron pot i could borrow for-- never mind i'll use the piss pot i'll borrow this is this enough to jury-rig it's ten gold that's why i asked okay this is a joke i need to actually go to the incense store charcoal and incense yeah for this plan to work do you have ten gold we're still in trouble with the law i don't want to push that if we have the gold that's the safest path brain wipe i'm going to go up to my room and it takes me an hour to do this an hour and ten minutes to be exact i put the-- look at the dungeon master is that maybe the longest facepalm i go upstairs to cast find familiar a sparrow i'm sorry i know this is not your preferred form but it is only temporary until i get ten more gold let's go down and get some breakfast there he is he lands on molly's horn on his horn yes always frumpkin yeah he flits over to jester's horn takes a dump he stays there for the time being is this what we're doing i can't go anywhere i'm going to be blind and deaf i have to stay still and safe try not hit me in the head with too many things it'll take a while but he will go off that's true as well i could have done a bat but it's too late for that now a bat i thought we talked about this you told me-- and if you need to change it change it-- but that i can only control him telepathically up to 100 feet but could continue to see i'm happy whatever your ruling is but that's how we've done it that's what i based this whole plan on the wording was a little squirrely so i can give him the command up close to go but if anything happens i can't improvise with him he does what the command is to fly north to the island and circle it a few times to see what we can see and come back we gather in fjord and molly's room ow don't do that please i'm trying to concentrate that is a six plus very little or nothing so you can guesstimate this is the bigger one worse five does it look balder than the other okay last question i can probably tell how far apart these two islands are yeah 600 okay i feel that and it feels good you can't make me vax again it won't work when i see that he's halfway back i come out of it what are you doing i plant my hands on the sides of the wood and start transmuting it to iron hopefully it will dry but it brought us closer together of course sorry acid wood there are two islands out there a bigger one-- they're not close-- and a smaller one one is bald-ish a couple of trees but i couldn't see too well on either of them the bigger one is dense with trees i didn't see them i thought that he would be able to see from the air and i thought that would be safer so no i'm sorry i would have seen that it's not fleet week i think that the chances of finding it on the big island are greater yes how far away roughly was the edge of the lake and islands from where we are right now okay so while everyone is preparing i take out my spool of silver thread and i go first to jester's room and i stretch the thread across and a little (magic flitter sound) flashes across and the thread disappears it takes about ten minutes each time and i do the same on fjord's doorway stretch across (magic flitter sound) if anyone goes in to these doors besides you i will know but not when we're on that island only on the way there lasts about a mile do you have any empty positions at the circus for these two tealeaf you said it's mostly an act what's the not-mostly part are they all swashbuckling swordsmen like you nott if that's what it is yeah perhaps this girl toya is his baby's bottle and then once in a while he wants an extra snack fucking anime actors (laughter) well what are we doing yes i'm a good talker when i have to be not for this dungeons & dragons is about punishment we're scouting the way nonchalantly i would imagine we could make our way to the outskirts of town no we can stay in the open i send frumpkin up into the air over the party 100 feet in the air so i take your hand and i'm watching them from above i'm totally acting like i see everything it's badass i think perhaps the best thing to do is to rent a boat not steal a boat what's your idea all right no that ended we hear that there's beautiful islands out in the middle of the ustaloch i've never seen a lake before this one so first island it's a very big moment for me did you say piece of shite what's the name of the other one crookedstone yeah i actually tagged along with them 20 (laughing) did that make it in that was a nuke are you kidding that's big we're under the light of the moons correct moonlight at this point hold on i send frumpkin into the sky look down and see if now that i have him flying closer maybe i can see better or see something moving in this dim light before it goes balls that's a big seven it's too dark (flutters) no ranger because i can't see anything i'm going to hand on your shoulder do we want to do it like a v-formation with nott in the lead and the two humans just behind 15 the bells have been deflowered i'm sorry it was me no i meant caleb's stink i'm moving slow on purpose at the back of the group now yeah this is like a famine home in ireland you can see the edges of it probably i'll pull out the baba yaga give me five seconds oh shit snacks look you're up in the air bro i would be the furthest back i'm at 15 so keep him with me i'm human we're not holding hands anymore 20 put her in a body bag johnny question is the humans' visibility shit right now so i can't see what i'm doing right okay so four globules of light go (popping) out of my hands and one of them hovers-- it's a row of four globules of light one is hanging above where my miniature is now one is closer to froggy one is like a line over the building so that there's one also hanging over beauregard with my remaining movement i'm hauling ass towards fjord and whichever jester that is ahead of me so proud so proud from that blast sick nope that's a mistake you also don't mean to do that ooh it almost got me though 20 okay plenty to spare however he gains four temporary hit points what is this wisdom 23 it's your forte so-- get back in there rocky knock her the fuck out as soon as it starts roaring i am surrounded i have nowhere to go so i pull the diamond out spin it and the ice shards start to shoot and i pick it up and i throw it in his bellybutton that's okay because if i move i am dicked that's not good that's terrible the second one was so good though that's not great that's ten i'm going to-- nope i'm going to stay there and freeze freeze up the cat's a bird and she flies up straight deffo yeah that's a 12 caleb is unconscious on the ground jeez this is going south guys by the way when caleb went down those four balls of light disappeared stay maybe he'll be distracted by fear damn we're in a tight spot success he's going to fuck me up travis wouldn't but fjord would know yes that's the threat you can get there and draw attention you can soak up damage in the dark that's a success i have two successes not that you know that the dice don't give a shit-- everyone's like hey hey hey it's like that video from ireland catch it daddy death save fail caleb goes (yelps) and i cast dancing lights into the goblin and light her up ah what the hell happened dm am i at one hit point at this moment it was zero true love's kiss yeah you know ain't nothing (coughs) (high-pitched) oh do you have any anything left in you well okay or we could just sit here for a bit and i could catch my breath i think man i got the full wizard experience tonight seven times
