28 they know we're here still no the ground floor were there stairs-- when we went down that set of stairs there was there also stairs going up right there or stairs going up we could we should just spend the next three hours in the storage room lady kima allow me to take a peek around the corner see what's going on so i'm gonna go stealth and inch past her that's good 29 i turn back to the group isn't that a corner-- a dead-on corner right there another hallway i just put up a hand and then slip around this direction and slip down this second hallway that you revealed i continue to creep away from my sister specifically all right i got this i'm going to keep going an opening that's not a doorway or-- the door is open all right so i'm going to press against the wall up to the edge wait for five seconds see if i can hear anything and then if not curve around and peek in 20 okay i'm going to get low to the ground and peek in the door and his back is to me currently so this way oh but i see the door on the other side so i take the earring-- -- take the earring and i whisper to my sister (whispers) follow along (whispers) send scanlan up i can feel scanlan's flute pressing into my buttocks so i turn to them and then i start-- i pass the door i'm gonna go around the corner to that other door and now i'm going to stab the duergar in the neck natural 20 natural 20 (cheering) i'll use my keen dagger i think four plus seven is-- this is a pencil right okay 11 where-- how do you make it work 11 eight 13-- ooh 66 okay yeah that's right so it's the damage plus the sneak attack double that-- 26 one plus two plus two plus one i catch the hammer and i start going 'tink tink tink' and wave the two invisible beings into the room don't waste my natural 20 kima come on all right i'm following after her tiptoeing after her yeah i speak into my earring and say zubba zubba zubba zubba i heard the bear and i start sliding my back down along the wall and i'm stabbing stabbing stabbing stabbing stabbing duergars stabbing duergars i rolled a 15 okay so same keen dagger 32 for me she went renegade folks she's gone renegade and then she says okay i'm gonna dismember the body hold on (laughter) all right i'm tiptoe-jogging behind kima i carefully place a hand on kima's shoulder and do a little sort of curtsy motion allow me i can-- i say-- (silent) two words three syllables (laughter) there's a door to my left and a door straight ahead right okay i inch up to the closed door on the left and place my ear to the door and listen yeah natural 20 okay do i sense any kind of-- i'm checking for traps on the door trap's perception right 26 all right well i pull out my picks and i get a three on that so-- aw yes well i'm tempted to close the door for a moment but i will press on instead all right so i'm going to inch towards that open door ahead of me see what's around the corner so pike hold still please well done there yeah angling your nose forward all right all right i'm gonna start sliding down that hall there ignoring this other passage and get up to the door and again place my ear to it oh look there's the front entrance are you at the double doors with me okay i'm going to listen at the big wooden doors and i rolled oh not that great 17 i'm going to try to peer into the door and i haven't talked about this before but i'm wearing a cloak of elvenkind which means i have advantage on stealth and enemies have disadvantage on spotting me so i'm going to lean my head in do i need to roll for stealth or am i already stealthed oh i'm going to go check it out i don't know yet hold on i'm going to try to sense for traps in this room 14 i'm going to the door then i can hear that inside the door inside the door i'm gonna hold waiting (meows) (laughter) hey i'm gonna sneak behind tiberius and stab that guy and since tiberius is there i can get sneak attack damage 'cause one of my allies is there-- do the doors go in or out that i'm by in so i'm just gonna go like this (hinges creak) and throw a dagger and say peek-a-boo at the same time (laughter) that is a 29 to hit okay even though my ally is five feet away from him i thought i remembered that rule okay so that is a nine and then i'm going to follow-- the nine of damage and immediately follow up with my other dagger which also hits six that's a nine yeah bust in you can't stealth and now poop on this bed i give a couple of pats on tiberius's shoulder and start to inch down the hall just relief no i got interrupted that's a good idea thanks for the reminder percy checking for-- i checked for traps before but i can't remember what i rolled i'm sure it was successful 17 okay i'm gonna go check out the shiny thing so say we all in the darkness i say fuck (laughter) roll for deus ex machina 13 i'm pulling out my flametongue dagger to try to get a little bit of light in here i see him i'm gonna stab i'm just gonna stab yeah he got me that hurts a lot 23 i'm thinking of the middle finger 17 what can i do while grappled nothing until i'm ungrappled okay but then do i have an action once that's done or that's the action all right so i'm gonna try to use i guess athletics is what i would do well that would be acrobatics 27 yeah okay okay poison dagger in hand i roll an 18 does that hit i wanna grab him by the calamari and stab him in the eye (laughter) that's what i did so-- and then if i'm five feet-- if kima's there i can sneak attack according to the rules all right so i'm gonna stab him in the eye one plus the sneak attack damage is two four ten 13 19 38 plus seven-- 45 with the poison dagger i don't remember so it's just a stab i mean i would imagine between ungrappling and stabbing is that it for me or do i get my second attack i don't know okay well i think go fuck yourself and stab again nine plus-- 19 other eye other eye no sneak attack two plus-- eight i fucking hate these things exit the other side of the great hall that we're in walking in that door i'm gonna walk all the way in all the way in the right what do i see up or down vax is heading back to the group i do vax is following i kind of parkour past percy i'm gonna perception check the room which is high 27 screw this room nine yeah pike pike there's some sort of religious artifacts over here could use your expertise don't stab anything you did say shabang the music is on exiting i scritch keyleth behind the ear but nudge it aside with my toe and exit the room i did scritch her ears but i'm going to continue down to the end of the hall yeah i just walk all the way over to the corner stealthing it's high it's 28 what's behind me and the edge of the map this way okay i'm gonna keep coming this way stealthing yeah i don't know what's going on back there i'm just walking around screw that do i see a door for this room that's still darkened out then i'm gonna keep sliding along the wall okay pressing my hand just to see if i can check any for traps 26 i would like to stealth through the door good that's like 80 points of damage i hear that but i'm still going to poke my head stealthily through the door and see what i see do i need a new stealth check or okay great so that is a 32 anything good-looking one these don't look very good before we hurt ourselves any longer we should-- we need to get to the main event here kill this

flayer who vanished from the room we're in so i'm sure he told everyone what's going on but they don't know we've found the secret entrance so i think we should go-- vex'ahlia's correct we should use the stairwell near the secret entrance also lady kima our purpose here was to find you but your purpose is somewhat greater than our own what do you suggest we do in this moment and let me ask you this we can be on the same page we can go up and fuck shit up however your weapons and armor-- would they be a great help should they be our short-term purpose or should we just go up and try to end this problem no kima is saying this is the main event vox machina our years are short let's make good use of them there's multiple pike leads the diversion group what if you were a scorpion with a dragonborn tail sliding around and a gnome on your front leg and a-- we're off the rails here i have faith in you tiberius i love it when a good plan comes together yeah that's good that's good we have no idea what's up there but tiberius has got a plan i like it tiberius tiberius tibs tiberius do you intend to go up one of the other stairways i believe this one by the entrance the secret entrance we came in will afford us the element of surprise do you think you want to go up one of the others and make a distraction right your plan is to make a distraction you're a brave dragonborn who's the stealth party not you you and me you wait wait for the inspiration don't split the party we few we happy few (laughter) there are rooms up there excuse me sorry sorry sorry sorry sorry sorry
