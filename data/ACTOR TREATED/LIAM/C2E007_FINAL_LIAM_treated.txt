les mis was a stepping stone for that moment (as mickey mouse) comes with prime like the internet we like to obsess about your every little movement still got that art book are we doing a show right now (whimpering) okay it's her psychic power well from our vantage point it is the entrance that we're at and then there is doors to the left-- i will be at the rear i will also do that as well following suit with everybody oh okay great how about nott i have rolled a nine (singing) regular gnoll regular gnoll that's it just nine and regular gnoll that's all that we have that's campaign two ladies and gentlemen it cancelled out your advantage it's just a straight roll and you lost the sneak attack welcome friend welcome it's a one one of us one of us [laughing] storytelling get back to me in a second in about nine seconds now taking the stage it's mollymauk i cannot see anything so i cast dancing lights i put one above my head and as soon as i get a little bit of light i send one over beau's head and then i send one about 20 feet beyond beau and then the fourth one even beyond that one so there's a line of four lights because i don't know what the chamber is shaped like you know matthew the guiding lights those little 'foomphs of light they only have a 10-foot radius so probably the edges of the line that i have cast just barely makes it flame of course it is of course pretty never mind just continue oh fuck that i will stay where i am no thank you did you hear the sound go (high-pitched yell) so it's not ten feet it's big it's a constitution save 15 thunderwave is 2d8 yeah 2d8 there you want the one that's shaped like a diamond here it is yeah that's good and then roll one more time oh that's good oh look at that fucking miniature marisha and (singing) careful the kids you pull i cannot see anything except for fjord so if i move forward up to where he is am i able to see any gnolls or any other kind of baddies where i am then i'll let my hand blacken and i will fire off a fire bolt at him from here which i'm sure will miss yeah it is it misses (laughter) i turn to fjord as it misses and say eh yeah (laughter) i have them they're right here i need an intelligence bump is what i need boomp what do you mean i have a very high ac it's okay unload it give it to me no don't find a positive no actually that hurts an awful lot you ganked him at the last second well don't we send a lot of them down the hole we didn't get their ears so bad job it is very dark in here what kind of bird is that you have yes handle this child but then we're very curious to ask a couple-- i'll shut up yeah what do you look like are you a gray fox is that what you are meanwhile everyone is talking to this stranger i'm going to edge up to this hole in the ground and hold onto rocks because i'm scared to death look over and send my globules of light down there to see if it's a deep hole if it goes a long way what am i looking at we have to get this gnoll out of the bottom of this hole because that's gold it's still good for the monetary value that was laid out for us so maybe on the way out we could send-- we have a rope we could lower you down and you could slice it off not right now save it for a rainy day wait nott do you want to let her take a look at it in case it could blow up on you you know what we could do if we want to check this cave for more people is that we could bring them up to the cart and i could do that one spell that i have that would let me know down here if anything is happening up there-- yeah if the little bell goes off in my head then i know that either that something's coming out-- the good kind ja we would know more or less not 100 percent perfect but pretty close then we could come back down here quickly and see if there's anyone else who needs help well i was thinking about getting them to safety outside if anything leaves the mine we'll know it was them you know people don't bare balls all the time but i think it's a reasonable risk at this point in time i will help you look because i have an eye-- no i have very-- trust me i mean i could roll for shit but-- that's okay do i have advantage that's a little better oh yeah it's good that's 15 you know for level three fünfzehn no actually i'm going to scoop up some of those pieces of rotted meat and put them in my pockets you can't smell it that's why i'm taking it it's there by-- good roll yeah 15 for him i would say that i did not partake in any of that as soon as we exited efficiently i pulled out the silver thread and i'm already doing my thing while they do that i guess we do not need a perception check oh good that's my specialty thank you ugh eight ja you brought me from a four to a seven i stubbed my toe (spell effect) frumpkin was obliterated you know it's funny because only about 30 minutes ago i also had a bird but he was obliterated it was very sad i'll bring him back tomorrow he and i we are like that it's not a cat i'm also going with the dancing lights they're not leading the way the closest one is actually ten feet behind us like a choo-choo train back behind the group so that it's dim light 20 to 30 feet ahead of us just give you a little bit of boost you know oh low rolls at both oh verdammt it didn't work we're in trouble they are coming i think they're coming come back to us please i already sent the message i would get a spell back yeah we say ja ja (singing) damn damn damn you haven't lived until you've slept on dwarven forge critical role critical role we are down that way over this way it's bright behind us not in front of us so much oh that's a 19 natural roll he might have even thought it was a bat surprised is like a condition like poison but they know something is-- no you ruined it it was so good can i say i change my mind every five minutes about whether this group was a good idea or a terrible idea and i'm listening to these chuckleheads talk to each other and i'm waiting to cast blur on myself when it looks like everybody's going to do something but i'm waiting until the last minute good for you you get a doughnut hey i'll be in the back i've pulled the ripcord on blur if they're doing that there is a vision of me before me and also behind me flickering in and out of view siebzehn siebzehn is seven that is that one yeah the cube is a six hey a three careful the closest globule is ten feet behind us my choo-choo train of globules of light go (whirring) and float over all our heads-- yeah i'm already falling into a routine with my other human friend here because i know that she's a badass but not without light the globules pass her and curve to the left a little bit and one floats above her head the last one that was it no i'm staying where the hell i am ah i'll move up 15 feet sorry i apologize entschuldigung gnoll washington (laughter) oh nice regular gnoll (picard voice) engage toll house travis and i don't really have a clear view of what's going on so i would on this wall here i would inch five or ten feet up the cave to see what's going on i see a gigantic gnoll and-- okay the big one i'm going to do what i did to him before and i'm going to bring my hand once around twice around three times around and cast scorching ray on that one only first is a 17 second one hits as well and the third one also hits (cheering) 18 that is a total of 20 of fire damage i wipe my arm down and say oh boy yeah that's done i had no idea that was there we can imagine that matt we needed the fear of god yeah that back wall perfectly blocks that whole thing your eldritch knight is going to be great come on ninja (chanting rhythmic breathing) (chanting) monk monk monk a natural 20 this is clearly a case of the husband favoring the wife advantage and have a good bonus you've already fallen off one cliff you're not going to do it again it's the exact same thing blind justice what a turn around well you can do this a million times maybe get a little bit closer not all the way 60 feet of range on that yeah what are they like lie down or drop your weapons or it's a single word so drop drop everything in his hands or you could say lay you could say dance and he would just start dancing i'm not by the way we've got four jokes this campaign caleb who was just going into his bag to pull out a ro-- oh she does not need the rope okay so instead i pull out the diamond and i start spinning it around and it turns to thunder and i sent that flying into the tannish colored-- chromatic orb to that one yeah that hits that is a 20 to hit yeah this is thunder damage is a total of oh just eight you know just eight points of thunder damage okay this looks good i'm going to back down the stairs and stand by shakäste i think diplomatic immunity (laughter) all good sechssechs-y spiritual weapon khary and it's got one hit point marisha and with a letter patrick rothfuss again it's yours yeah all those dice that you could check before the game you could roll them we're all real good friends how much was in there it's a step up for me like the mine burn the mine to the ground under the ground our guests are like farm animals that we mine for loot it's sight and hearing for find familiar nah it's pretty good there it is 16 80 feet i don't know maybe not on our own two at a time i'm pretty tapped but there's a lot of us here and only a few of them there according to our new friend we could also try and seal the cave behind us as we go could we do a quick inventory check of how much of these boom sticks that we have the tnt we have more than one you have one we have one amongst okay it would help i'm pretty shitty at stealth plus thank you jester for saving my ass because the first roll was a four the second one was a 15 jester and beau yeah you've got dex also dm-- i will also say and i'll do this a lot dancing lights is in effect behind us 20 feet behind us waiting sees-- (groans) okay i did not see that did you know that you can't see oh it was really good it was a 16 total the bird that's hot come on birdy ooh good it's 15 it's alphabetical right on the list ooh plus are we in a weird in-between combat and non-combat i would like to hug the wall and slide along it i would like to think i can hear my friends breathing-- and stop yeah that's good-- and hold my action and if anything comes this way that is not my friends to cast burning hands as a tripwire i'm the tripwire yeah of course within range yeah maybe the other side of the tunnel so they don't see you you can see me doing this yeah pull him to the other side they're seeing me do arcane bullshit on the side while sweating i attack her not within range then i don't do it yet wow my initiative is such dick all night long all campaign long let's be honest oh my gosh at the end as always acht there's people after my eight what did you roll to hit those arrows are long gone all tens come on where's your ac you're grog you can't even see it so this has happened like six times now where i go right after beau so dancing lights excuse me of course so instead dancing light i'm going to do the same line of light that i always do because beauregard needs to be able to kill things and see one goes far as here and here and here probably it's always a line spread out no i'm also going to back up about 15 feet as well then i'm going to crouch because i'm frightened he done been bifurcated save us that's a very short range though you can't get close enough to anybody on that map to use it do you have a level one left i think these are your best options either a floating weapon that can go anywhere or a big fog cloud if you run up and put it on the priest or up there i think probably spiritual weapon you can adjust decide what it is a lollipop a salmon a sword nunchucks have fun it could be a cudgel carved to look like estelle getty if you wanted it to be like a beethoven bust but estelle getty that's the d8 yeah that's true thank you for being a friend nott's going to die are you up fjord nott nott's in danger i saw that and i walk as far forward as i can with my movement and start stirring the pot on chromatic orb i have one left i will use ice damage and i will send it out and i knock it off my hand towards the manticore come on please that's a 25 that is 3d8 cold damage that is-- ooh 15 total i would have gone as far forward as i can caleb is breathing very heavily and not looking at the manticore he's looking at nott in beauregard's arms oh necrotic necrotic just follows laura bailey cleric's down one of our clerics is down it's your call i will help you with decisions you make you can get to the front of those stairs do you have any spells slots left no that's great that's all you can do is try to take down the enemies and we can help that's all you can do i'd get it into the business it's on its way for the next round yeah in time for your turn attacks to wail on her what about the dynamite ja i cannot see too well so i'm going to take a step forward between mollymauk and nott just a little bit there now i can see that blond hair and i am tapped out so i'm just going to let my hand blacken and say a few arcane words and then send a-- well then i will if i can't see too well keep going down the steps until i can see him that's fine that's not fine but that's fine fire bolt and here it comes to you shithead that is a 25 to hit but i could roll a one i rolled a ten (cheering) i'm going to extend my hand forward i have five fingers out and then i pull in four i send the flame down my hand because these people have hurt my little friend i want his hair to burn off his head and die that's a seven i was going to do this on my own did you use all your slots that's hospitality (slapping) yeah you do i would like to sit on my ass and look at the ground yeah yeah you just cured me also caleb has been very distant for the last couple of hours but absentmindedly scoops up nott's hand doesn't look at nott but holds nott's hand khary uh oh all right i know how this works (laughter) slipping you the digits he's got gloves on him don't touch it crystallized rice just for one day
