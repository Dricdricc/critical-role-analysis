miniature just the way you want you make it tall you make it short you can make them an elf you can make them a human you can give them guns you can give them a sword and then they 3d print that shit

julian and emerald knights are responsible for these things they've been out of stock for a while they're going to be back in stock in may and you'll be able to find them probably in your local store

knights gorgeous boink (whispers) let's hear it with so much new information to process well god i don't know what i'm doing let's play the game all right (cheering) it was good it was weaker than the first attempt well they're all pros travis (laughs) the uncertainty yeah sam let's you and i talk for a moment you are dreaming you are seeing visions that make very little sense to you you're at work back in one of the countless recording studios you're in week after week no biggie only the dream all goes to shit you see colleagues torn to pieces a massive serpent's tail a great and terrible god creature looming over you for an instant and then gone a dog an angel a comedian's corpse and a tower and at a certain point you come to realise that you are in fact dreaming within the dream you are in that in-between moment aware that what you're seeing isn't real but you don't want to wake up yet grasping at slumber still but uncomfortable something is pressing into your back a little painfully the dream fades and you try to hold on to-- it is in fact my dick (laughter) they're in the same predicament there's little tiny miniature vines almost whitish color coming out of the center of this reddish-brown plant holding them they're not your kids you can certainly try (laughter) you did this what do you want to do there buddy you are able to sit up your legs can't move but you sit up and the pain finally-- whatever was poking you in the back is not-- ooh there's a really small canine skeleton i mean the bone is bleached white pug-sized kind of i mean you could probably reach one of them if you wanted to you could reach both of them there's a girl and a boy the girl looks i don't know ten or 11 the boy's younger they're breathing which one they're both equidistant oh okay yeah laura you feel like a poke poke poke at your legs your eyes flutter awake and you see a really fucking bizarre jungle and some little kid poking at your foot the little blond angelic boy sleeps peacefully as you guys whisper to each other yeah you just fought dead conan o'brien kind of taliesin you're stirred awake by the sound of children's voices arguing over your body he does if either of you have seen mr mom he does look precisely like he did in mr mom just for your benefit and for the audience we're going to be hearing all of the usual taliesin verbiage and sayings like okay and this is going to be fun except please imagine it in a small piping widdle voice he's still executive goth he's just seven-ish that's too big oh bring it back up (laughter) you don't know you're older than both of them you guys don't see anything you are again-- you saw this and you guys are just coming to and noticing your surroundings you're in this square which doesn't make sense because you're in the jungle right but you're in this square canopy plant room almost everybody make a strength check with advantage nothing a two ten a ten okay all right well the little blond kid barely able to rip any of the plant away from his feet but this bigger kid grabs you both and pulls both of you out and it just rips away it's not too bad with you guys working together and now you're standing the three of you in a little circle standing in this little chapel in the jungle the air around you hits you with another (whump) and you feel your skin and bones kind of shake a little bit and your stomach just feels like it drops the feeling passes yeah again you can see out these metal beams going up that lead to nothing and are just sort of mangled okay absolutely make an athletics check add two i'm making that up yeah totally you climb your way up there it takes you like a minute you don't want to fall down you don't want to cut yourself on this rusty beam you make your way up and you grab onto the twisted top of this beam it's all caked over with plant and a little bit of mud even but you can see where there used to be bolts sort of sprung open on the top and you pull yourself up and over no that's better and you can finally see out and over and the jungle stretches out in every direction you can see here and there on other trees-- and when i say trees the trees are more brown and red than anything and they're wet and they have sort of a bulging sausage feel to them and they do have leaves but the leaves are again mottled brown and red and the whole jungle you're in sunlight does come down and in but it's pretty dim overall and everything is tinted with that color and you see these lumps of hardened what look like-- they don't have the texture of coconuts they have the texture of a chestnut maybe but they're just growing out of spots on trees some are hanging from a vine on different trees and you can't see where to go everything looks the same in different directions although it is more open from this view because down below between these four beams it's all wrapped around and you see two little kids going like this make a perception check add a laura bailey plus three oh wow yeah about a hundred feet that way you see another opened plant on the ground it's obscured by a tree but you can see it behind the tree and you see a jean leg and a sneaker and it looks bent badly and bloodied and then you see another leg with a shoe poking out the other side of the tree you're wearing clothes that seems to fit this is science (laughter) all right so after you scuttle down and have this little mini child argument it's not too hard i mean you just pull apart vines and plants and you can push your way through everything is slick to the touch and you grease by it all-- hashtag are you stealthing there well make a stealth check motherfuckers laura seven okay she's a little bigger she tromps round a little more than you little light-footed-- yep got to get to your adult husband waiting on the other side of this tree all right so you creep along there's insects and you can hear stuff out there but nothing happens nothing shocking or scary and you make your way in just a couple of minutes over to where this plant is and you come around the tree and you see three kids one kid is really dead what you couldn't see on the back of the tree that was blocking the view has splintered off and fallen on a child and that child is crushed like the wicked witch of the west's sister all you see is one mangled leg coming out the bottom and an arm coming out the other side and a little bit of spaghetti marinara but you also see two kids in here there is another older girl looks a little older than you brown hair dark hair and there's a kid that looks like vern from stand by me he's a little chunky kid in a polo shirt and he is snoring now that you're closer and you can hear yeah you know what your husband looks like you know what the child version of your husband looks like and that's your bff ashley except she looks like a rebel in middle school (laughter) you're in your 30s right he's taking this really well that you're both children that is canon ashley you're shaken awake and you're looking at a bunch of fucking children around you and you're in a jungle and everything is wet ashley the last thing you remember is falling asleep watching a movie on a plane from new york city to la your voice is a little higher than you're accustomed to i don't know you're a little older than this one you're much bigger than these two you're a little bigger than this one she's probably brushing into her teens the air around you trembles and you feel that same push of energy and your skull seems to rattle and your gut goes (noise) and you feel yourself pushing-- nothing happens i mean if you could do a backwards time lapse of the skull being crushed down into the ground by the tree you might know you don't know what do you want to do it's not bones it's just all that's poking out is a leg and spaghetti marinara from where a head was and-- yeah sure (whispers) you kind of feel a wiener through the pocket (whispers) kind of just the wiener you guys all hear now off in the distance a whumping sound just like (thudding) way far away okay sure they're everywhere yes make a strength check real quick you've got to pull it off of a tree you can add one 19 oh man you snap it and as soon as you do the break point goes (raspberry) and you look like you just got sprayed in the face with horror-movie blood your face just went (raspberry) as soon as you did it it burst like an angry zit as soon as you broke it but now you're holding this mostly solid but with a little bit of give and slick as hell you are still you i mean it's accurate you're really scared of scary movies boom boom sam wait we're hearing things okay okay smells really nasty you're under it and it is wet and now your shirt is wet and your pants are wet yeah yeah you ever smell that flower that's like the world's worst that but that sound's not getting any closer it's off in the distance it's intermittent the five of you hear a snapping sound kind of like when ashley broke that vine and you hear (thud) ten feet behind you and then you hear smearing rustling sounds and then you hear (cat-like growl) okay roll for initiative (laughter) i guess so seven wait slow down assholes 20 to 25 nobody 15 to 20 ten to 15 okay ten ten ashley laura and sam nine seven okay all right you flip around and see what looks like i don't know like a really pissed off ocelot or bobcat with no skin on it you just see greased red muscle and blood and the thing is running at you and travis it's coming at you and you act nah (laughter) yeah maybe okay that is heading you in the direction of the intermittent whump far in the distance but that's fine so you see a flesh-peeled-- large the size of a golden retriever right a bobcat but with sinew and muscle and it looks mad as hell and it's running and so is vern and taliesin what do you do okay okay so as you lift this rock to throw it down it happens too fast and this thing runs and starts clawing its way up your body and tearing down your wet slick shirt and hits you for-- it ran right up you-- laura and does two hit points of damage just remember that for the time being please that's right ashley what are you going to do okay so you run up to your friend laura who's getting mangled-- sure you're going to try to-- okay sure roll a d20 we'll do a grapple you can add one for now seems like your number is low it's not what is it okay you get a good grip on it and pull it in tight it is so smeared with blood it goes (squelch) flies up two feet in the air and comes back down and then claws its way back down laura and just starts rending and continues to rend well you can move you can move a little bit you can get the fuck out of dodge sam what are you doing yeah a couple by your feet if you reach down and grab them hit it in the skull roll to attack nine (laughter) yes this whole game's about tormenting you laura (laughter) go sure go for it oh man that rock comes down and crunches on this thing's head roll a d4 please oh no yeah d4 that's right four you smash the thing's head in and it goes (squeal) and it (raspberries) down onto the ground through the jungle they are just past two trees and you've just lost sight of them and they've run off and you hear rustle-rustle-rustle and then you hear (thuds) far away same place travis and taliesin you bust out of some plants and you find yourself on the edge of-- a different area than what you've seen before the tree cover is so thick that you're not able to see this coming but you're looking at a reddish brown bog it's a little more open the trees open up a bit and you can see patches of stagnant brackish water on the ground here and there and then way on the other side 200 feet you see almost audrey ii style ten feet tall-- seven feet tall that was too big seven feet tall and there is a little thin wiry bent-over old man with a rock and nasty clothes tattered and disgusting and he's peeled one of these petals back and he's beating on the side of it as hard as he can but he's very old and he's 200 feet away he's taking a couple whacks at it and then pausing to rest for a second you're just going to run through that's fine but you're not sneaky okay you start splashing through muck and puddles on your way there and you make it 20 feet out into the middle of this big circular bog and the old man goes (croaks) and you catch a glimpse of a reflection of light up on his face glasses he sees you books off into the jungle beyond it runs sure okay all right verno is totally poking his head out of the heavy tree cover looking after you you don't know where the others are you are now halfway out across this bog mucking your way through this little cherubic seven year old making his way through hell there he goes you sheepishly whisper across the bog (whispers) i've got your back finally you make it over to this big semi peeled-open gourd and you look inside to see what's in there and you see a head of red hair oh she's an older girl make a strength check natural 20 okay so you reach up as high up as you can and you hang from it and it just peels open and a teenager spills out unconscious long red hair flannel shirt unconscious there is another body further in you see just the barest glimpse of a hawaiian shirt (laughing) you're pulling who who are you pulling you're pulling hawaiian shirt well he's caught his feet are caught up in the same-- you're going to use a stick all right i'm going to give you no advantage for that roll a strength check no advantage strength roll aw man feeling so proud of yourself so brave so strong pulling that open and now you're just doing a little looney tunes your feet are just scuttling in the slick wet of this swamp and you're making no headway sure are you going to go catch up all right you hear (splashes) okay oh you give her a slap marisha you are woken out of your sleep getting slapped in the face yes you do the last thing you remember is falling asleep resting your head on your keyboard in your office at geek and sundry marisha you look over and see a face very much like one you've seen in many photographs dressed as sephiroth except with glasses and a hawaiian shirt and just so peaceful and sweet asleep 12 13 14 12 why don't you guys all open your manilla envelopes (cheering) like the grinch my heart just grew two sizes in my chest (laughing) you're glued into place and you're sizing each other up and you can tell fairly quickly-- you don't know how old everyone is but who the oldest is who the youngest is marisha is taller than anyone here clearly mid-to-late teens under her maybe ashley laura and matt kind of in the same zone it's hard to say between sam and taliesin yeah ish art is open to interpretation marisha not anymore oh now you do from ten to eight you had eight and now you're at six better be careful you guys are in the middle of-- it doesn't say you've got let's say nine because you're so tall anyway guys you are in the middle of a very alien jungle you don't know where the fuck you are you don't know what is going on you don't know why you are children what are you going to do are you going to build a house and live here yeah everyone is here is matt sleeping matt apparently three monster energy drinks are not enough to keep you awake working on the campaign book and you pass out on your desktop at home that's the last thing you remember and you were tall you can sit up that's about it yeah sure you can pull matt make a strength check at advantage no just you because you're pushing to-- sam and thanks keyleth that's fine you explode out of this motherfucker like superman and jump and land on your feet in the middle of the muck full of adrenaline and you have no idea what to do it's a coping mechanism somewhere in the distance you hear (angry cat noises) there is definitely right where you are because again the trees opened up the sky's a little dimmer than you're used to it's got sort of a dusk feel to it it's darker but it's day-ish well i'm not here you came from the geek and sundry offices absolutely you can there is no shortage of vines and trees and rocks if anyone wants to look for something if you want to break it off a tree they'll be stronger if you break it right off a tree probably but they're around well they're wet and taut turgid yes you marisha as you tear down a huge chunk are just carrie'd just (squishing noise) as you rip it off when you break whatever sap or whatever it is that's in there feels hot and is dark red and it spatters you so you are now blooded you want to make a nature check sure why not i mean you have cut yourself in the past you have sucked on a cut and it does taste kind of like that it is warm in the direction that you guys have come from you hear (fluttering noises) are you okay so you guys are all finding hiding places it's getting closer it's multiple locations too sure make an athletics check at disadvantage because it's sopping wet okay you slide and fall right back down and smack your head on a rock and you take one hit point of damage okay taliesin you take one hit point of damage as you hit your head on a rock on the ground there is six seven-- you're hiding okay make a stealth check make a stealth check 22 six three okay you sneak behind you rogue you you sneak behind the giant plant and get right underneath the leaf again and you reach out and grab taliesin and yank him with you and sam says wait what about me just as these things go (exploding noise) and break out of the tree cover and there are six or seven of these little ropy skinless cats running at you at full speed crossing the water they're coming standing our ground taliesin from your hiding point you see travis just book it in the same direction as the weird old man went running off through the tree cover he's gone you can really implore him to stay which means yes okay siri what would we he roll against this wisdom wisdom right yeah let's just go fast and say wisdom you stop and put your hand on the tree (panting) you breathe and you stop where you are you're still at this point 40 feet away from the group and starting to cry but you don't go you feel too guilty because you spent five years playing dungeons and dragons with these people you cannot leave them alone to die everybody roll for initiative okay who got 15 to 20 yeah man 22 all right okay 19 damn guys all right ten to 15 okay laura travis ashley where you at okay all right these things are-- here we go tree cover travis little boy travis has run that far are we on camera guys we've got laura and taliesin-- yeah that's right hidden not hidden standing their ground it's got to be this way oh i got it backwards there we go and here they come guys (sings) this is just like how i do it with my kids and you are kids okay marisha what do you want to do yes marisha's right here yeah you're not color-coded so i'll have to help out a little bit three four five six that's where you're at that's it all righty you're an angry teen yeah at level one hey man i'm not complaining shut up so you're just getting ready for it that's a good idea okay d for dodge matt what would you like to do you're right here okay okay what's the dc well fuck you 'cause he got a natural 20 that's okay okay okay i'll give you one more taliesin you're up okay yeah yeah are you a haunted kid is that what you're asking me you are a fucking haunted kid (laughter) all right talk to me goose okay this one right here that is definitely within range of your goth attitude okay so you've got to make a ranged spell attack go for it plus five just roll plus five 18 does in fact hit so you slam your little tiny cherub hand into the ground and it sinks into the mud and you feel the dark power of your overlord slide down into the ground and a split-second happens and it goes (electric sound) out of the ground underneath this thing and tendrils spectral purplish-black tendrils wrap around it and yank it into the ground and it is fucking gone (cheering) none of you motherfuckers can do what taliesin just did sam you're up you are in the luchador pants right here five ten 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 for throwing a rock sure you want to wait until one gets close enough and then chuck a rock sure done cock a rock cock rock okay ashley you're up intimidate okay make an intimidation check at disadvantage yeah because it's a herd of skinless-- (cats growling) they start backing up slowly the first three do the first three do stop in their tracks the other three-- well you'll find out in a minute laura what would you like to do and how are you going to attack are they melee sticks i think that's just called a stick okay all right okay are you waiting until they're in throwing range or until they're right up on you 30 40 bust out-- okay right there boom okay travis would you like to keep--- oh no you were convinced to run do you want to stay hiding here or do you want to go back so just direct line back and you can dash too i mean you're way far back you want to dash chances are so small but i want you to roll just in case you get a one those tighty-whiteys rip out of your hands and you crouch down and you've got like a piano wire except it's your underwear and you're ready okay so these three don't leave but they back up to about here they're still barely past the edge of the tree these ones are still coming they didn't give a shit one two three four five six and he's going to dash and get right up on you-- yes all right throw make a ranged attack you do actually it conks off the back of your head-- roll a d4 three what's your strength modifier one okay you take four points of damage you are clocked hard these are just going for the closest victim they can find but they're not close enough to actually attack they make it up to there they are rounding on marisha and now it's marisha's turn three okay you get two attacks as a monk yeah okay roll two attacks this is the kick roll a d4 okay your foot takes this thing under the chin and you just slick the bottom of your shoe and you feel a snap in your foot and it just does a spin in the air and lands on its back dead but you're still moving and smacking the next one definitely hits d4 plus strength okay and you swing away and go crack and this time you hit the thing's fucking head so hard that you hear the same kind of snap except you feel tendon rip at the same time and the head goes free except for this thin little band of ligament and it just falls and is still twitching and going (whimpering noises) matt you're up and you've got a direct view of blood dripping out the back of your young fiancée's head okay ugh the back of your head stops smarting like advil pronto all healed up (cat yowling) kick it okay go for a roll you do the most beautiful martial arts movie spin kick that hits absolutely nothing and come back down and breathe heavy (panting) and look over at the love of your life yeah executive you're up inside the cat sure go for it okay so as matt's foot comes down into the water and goes (panting) you're right face-to-face with the thing its feral face is leaning up against yours and it goes (yowls) and then three spectral octopus tentacles come out of its face one out of each eye and one of its mouth and you feel that shit just slathering all over your face and sucks back in and the thing just explodes like a blood sausage gone you look over your shoulder and you just see that face sam what would you like to do yep just but you could get in range the middle one okay looks good would you like to use the rest of your movement you could back up a little bit i guess no the closest cover of any kind is 50 feet away okay okay there you are a little chorus line ashley you're up laura you're watching rebel teen ashley mouth off at some skinless cats what would you like to do to this side here here okay sure you can do that all right travis what's up aw look at that awkward okay oh yeah (bell ding) the three cats continue to-- well they don't bristle because they have no hair they're still backing up they move backward into the tree cover but you see them stop they don't flee they get into the trees and they sit and stare and whatever this stuff is goes (squishing) between you are you well you're sam give it a shot i'm going to give you if you want to-- do you want to track all right make a perception right survival that's what i was going to say but for reasons do it at advantage wrong that's fine you see where verno booked it before you can see verno went through the trees right here but you see another break you see a vine split off right there and you gather that he went in generally the same direction not exactly where travis went and this little seven-year-old boy with a gigantic smile starts stalking his way through the bog and leading you (laughter) everybody's following ranger sam right okay all right so yeah it's like every 30 seconds here so you guys start walking and after the first minute you notice as you're going sam in the ground something very different than anything else you've seen here there's a long bar in the ground half sunken into the ground and covered over you only saw a glint of yellow and it was faded over and mucky but you saw it it looked very different leaning down you wipe away some of the crap covering it and you see sort of an alternating yellow black pattern it's like a long board it's old and it's wet and rotted through but there's no mistaking one of those things for gate entry okay you don't even need to make any kind of a check everything is so slick here it just slides out you can't lift the whole thing or hold the whole thing because it's eight feet long as you pull it out it's so soft it breaks at one spot but there's no question what that is this is exactly a gate entry bar sure make an investigation check yeah nine 13 yeah i mean you've been to warner bros what do you guys want to do you can make an investigation check you didn't find anything go for it you're digging through rot natural 20 okay you dig and you do find the foundation of-- it's hollywood way it's the exact setup for that little booth when you're going into park right under the tower i mean you haven't traveled that far right and there's nothing in here the bottom of the structure the walls is there you can tell where the bottom of the door the lintel is it the lintel i don't know you found the gate post and that's all you found there's no-- no it's just the bottom of the structure you can just barely make out one corner you didn't see anything sure you guys here that way maybe was the tower about here's where you find the security gate i guess and old feller ran that way to find a sign no man you saw a glint of glasses too if you can believe your eyes san fernando valley is this way he did if you can believe your eyes if this nonsense is actually based on anything then yes he is heading along hollywood way okay all right so ranger sam leads the way you guys start traveling it's slow-going because it's wet and disgusting and there's trees everywhere you're going through fucking swamp there's lots of vines and rocks and sticks the last metal you saw was ashley johnson and what is presumably the base of the warner bros water tower out of cat gut sure make a survival check 11 okay so what you're able to do as you're walking is to pull and rip away some of the leg tendon from this thing's body and now you've got this stretchy piece of meat to work with more on that later you guys continue to walk through the jungle and you're noticing that the ground is moving downward a bit now sam do me a favor and make a perception check 17 it's not a one or a two through a gap between three trees way in the distance you see a balding white-haired little old man and he sees you seeing him and he's gone again you are a kid you're running wow travis is just running today is everybody following suit you're flanking okay are you with this group the flanking or the straight-on you guys start booking through and trying to stay up you're slipping as you go but managing to catch up and he is old you're getting closer to the spot where you saw him sam and you're looking over you're playing the raptor maybe you can catch him from the side you guys are still going down all of you are going down and then ahead you notice that you guys are in separate wedges of a hill that are both leading now to the same place and you see this guy again and he scuttles over a little ridge and down he scuttles up over a little bit of ridge of plant and mud and then he disappears from view and it's almost like you're looking at-- it's so thick here the trees are so thick that you can probably get through on the sides but there's one big main entrance here that is scooped up in like an upside-down u of plant growth okay okay all right so you guys converge and you're running after this old man and you guys climb up to the top of the ridge and you see-- oh gosh i think there's a scene in jurassic park where it's a long sort of tunnel where that guy gets eaten by the little critters anybody remember this yeah and so it winds straight ahead like that and as you're running taliesin you're the only one who sees it because you're the shortest you see a metal sign bent over peeking out from behind two trees red dripping down it and you see a one you see a four and then you're past it and everybody's running and this old man is maybe a hundred feet ahead of you sure he does stop and spins around he's still pretty far away from you and he looks (breathes heavily) (breathes heavily) and he spins and he continues to run everybody starts to run i'm so sorry you feel the air around you start to vibrate around you and your head starts to rattle in your skull and you hear at that moment the sound of a war horn massive it feels like the inside of your head your skull is vibrating like a bell your teeth are shaking your eyes feel like they are expanding in their sockets and you feel (explosion noise) and everything changes everything grows darker the gentler sounds of the jungle are suddenly gone you find yourselves suddenly as your sight stops blurring looking at the ocean you're standing in miserably frigid cold water swirling around your legs and your waist and you're staring out at the horizon and the sky-- it's so jarring it's so different than where you were you're staring out at dark clouds above you and over the horizon and that horn that is blasting finally quits and you just hear the sound of the surf of waves crashing on a beach a beach behind you you turn away from the water ashley and from your place in the surf you see the remnants and rubble of a freeway stretching from the water you're in back toward the land and away but all of your minds as you turn with her have only a second to process your whereabouts because before you stands a wall of horror the living manifestation of woe is gathered in front of you a vast horde of writhing malignant nightmares stand watching you all shapes and sizes black oiled insect-like flesh white chalky corpse-like figures literal devils hundreds of eyes seeming to hungrily covet your flesh and towering above them all rising 40 to 50 feet in the air stands an apocalyptic monstrosity out of the book of revelations a massive two-headed titan standing on two scaled powerful legs staring down at you all the head on this side brow furrowed face unmoving the eyes just judging you the head on this side craning forward its terrible maw stretched wide a long tongue slathering back and forth across its enormous teeth hungering the horn of the apocalypse tears the air again rattling your brains in your little skulls as the legion before you begins to jibber and shriek everyone roll for initiative you think so can i get a little more juice on the audio please let's roll for initiative guys same age 25 to 20 nobody there 15 to 20 17 15 laura marisha okay ten to 15 13 ten okay i got travis ashley and matt left what have you guys got okay laura bailey what would you like to do oh that's important isn't it you're in the water okay it is rough going you can go about 15 feet as you push your way back now you're moving backward in the water and the water's now up to your childlike collarbone that's what you want to do okay you do you splash under the water and it is jarring it is so ice-cold and as you do you see a very thick serpent swim past your face marisha what would you like to do marisha and okay you are now standing on the beach looking at a legion from hell the giant continues to judge you on your sides there are two very large-- not as big as the big guy obviously but two winged twice the size of you guys bent over muscular ropey winged creatures and they just stand there going (raspy breaths) here and here taliesin what would you like to do yes i remembered make a persuasion check eight noted okay okay until what happens okay got it sam what would you like to do okay make a persuasion check okay noted ashley what would you like to do make a persuasion check okay noted yes it is gigantic feet crunch down in the sand as he slowly walks forward or they do and one head stares at you little man make a strength check okay travis you feel your whole body lock up as you are lifted out of the water straight up into the air and a little bit forward and your little duder body is just floated forward and you are frozen in terror you can't move a muscle and the head on this side is just staring at you matt what would you like to do it looks like the shit you saw in your dnd books man make a religion check one last little squirt comes out of your ding dong he would like to use one of his legendary actions now and you see his long nightmarish tail swing coil and then whip out and strikes down and lands on marisha and crushes her into the beach and rips away and you see a smear on the sand you see a clump of red hair and some innards laura what would you like to do okay noted his leg he's 30 feet in the air is that the end off on your left you see (splashing noises) it doesn't come all the way it just watches you mr mom what would you like to do okay okay yeah guys everybody sees a spectral form of a grown taliesin jaffe appear next to child taliesin jaffe and floats over floating verno and spectral taliesin just starts going like this yes you're welcome all done sam what would you like to do tendrils which way you grab it by the leg okay noted ashley what would you like to do yeah i mean half her body's gone you guys watch in horror as your friend ashley pushed to the brink crouches down and shoves her hands up into the hollowed-out ribcage of marisha ray pulls her hands down and slathers it down her face and suddenly we're in the lord of the flies loose i mean yeah she's a third of her former weight that's your whole action okay ashley picks up marisha's broken open chest cavity and head and matches the form of demogorgon somewhat and puts a second head on herself you're out of juice demogorgon's turn do you want to do anything travis well you're floating in the air you want to try to break free of his grip all right you're going to go with it he takes one step forward with sam on the leg going for the ride and travis floats forward right up between the two thing's heads and the angry one on this side goes (growling) and takes the upper half of your body into its mouth and the other one more daintily goes (chomping) and pulls a leg free and child travis is ripped in half in front of you blood raining down on sam down below matt what would you like to do yes do it are we doing anything about sam got it got it and it's what is it it's constitution help me okay sam make a constitution save yeah okay so roll for damage 13 okay you take six points of damage matt runs up in anguish and just rage-terror screams and for no reason at all a blast of energy just goes (explosion noise) right out of him rips the clothes off of sam riegel's child back leaving scars all over him and the demogorgon just shifts his foot a little bit and he'd like to use a legendary action to stare at crazy pants johnson and you look at these two heads now looking at you and their eyes seem to swirl in a miasma of hatred and you feel your mind just go roll a d10 please yes okay what did you roll on the d10 a nine oh you felt your gorge rise up you're covered in the guts of your friend marisha this is really weird that thing is a giant but you've got to fight it right yeah i'm okay i'm okay and you steel yourself laura what would you like to do yeah okay i'll just put you there on the map you start to swim you feel a serpent slide past your rib cage as you go and you freak out as you swim-- you can't do that because two clawed feet latch into your back and lift you up out of the water you are now dangling about 20 feet-- yeah 20 feet above the water here just dog paddling to nothing and that's its turn and taliesin what would you like to do this guy okay make a ranged attack sure two points okay yes that's correct it's 1d8 all right so you plant your hand down into the sand and you feel that same energy surge out of your palm and it bursts up under this corpulent little pasty-faced dude and it reaches up and grabs him by the gut and pulls away a love handle in tentacle form down into the ground and everybody around him just starts going (snarling) and he's just got innards spilling out going (gravelly dying sounds) all right so your unseen servant moves just below laura and he uses his legendary action and the tail whips out and goes (whipping sound) and you watch as two-thirds of taliesin's child guts are ripped out and he just falls face forward down into the sand and he is dead and the unseen servant vanishes sam what would you like to do yeah yeah okay okay okay ashley huh i mean you already tried to persuade this dude sure make a persuasion at disadvantage yes ashley what would you like to do no you didn't have a chance to get to that go for it make a ranged attack roll a d20 you might it would be for a ranged attack if it's not a weapon it's an improvised weapon nothing let's do the dex the rock bounces off of his belly button-type area right okay well the next thing that happens is the double-armed tentacle comes down and wraps around your neck and you watch as (splitting noise) and you see two heads spin out to the ocean 40 feet what would you like to do matt yeah legit what did you roll 13 okay you see the angrier one on this side going (growls huffs growls louder) and the other head swivels around so they're both looking at you and they stare into your insecure little 12-year-old soul roll a d10 matthew ten you have played too much fucking dnd nothing happens you hold your own against the demogorgon laura what would you like to do roll to make an attack yes your dex okay right well that would be a strength check do you want to break out of the grapple okay well that doesn't do shit because he's got you so firmly grasping in his taloned feet that you can't turn around and get at him no what happened was you tried to get him with a stick and you couldn't turn around you got a bonus action rogue level of laura okay you hear a little sizzling sound and you feel the thing's body flex against you and then you don't even know what happened there is a noxious fume all around you going into your eyes and your nose everything burns your throat and your nose burn the insides of your ears burn i would like you to make a con save okay your body locks up you can't move and he lets go you fall into the water frozen no that vanished when you died sam what would you like to do now make an athletics check oh my god how high do you want to go done you scrabble up like a little spider monkey all the way up panicked climbing up on top hi and you're there and your voices stops as the sharp end of his tail splits through the back of your skull and breaks your face open entirely beautiful beautiful smile that beautiful smile gone the demogorgon bends over and looks down at you matthew and somehow you knew this was the way it would always be and a giant ropey foot rises up and you don't see shit laura what would you like to do oh she's not here she's also drowning we don't need her then okay hey i want that yeah so her body frozen in the ocean water seeping in she feels her throat constrict and choke and everything goes quiet not that quiet there we go the vision blurs and turns a pure merciful white and that's where we'll take our break we'll just talk about it for an hour after we come back i did have this dream this is based on a nightmare i had it was real bad no none of you were there it was just me on a godforsaken beach in my dream these things it wasn't demogorgon it was revelations and they were all on shitty wooden scaffolding stretching in every direction for miles and i just felt that big and i was like well this is it and that was the nightmare that your eyesight was one tick off of 20/20 dreadful well guys that was a lot of fun we laughed we cried we died we'll see you in a few is this mid-break this guy yeah sorry before i forget giveaway

your eyes flutter open and squint in the glare of bright white light from all sides they adjust guys we good i wanna go right into another you look around you're lying in a large white room the walls are padded with soft cloth material ashley you sit up-- -- and see neil naughty dog creative director neil druckmann (laughter) neil with his glorious beard walks up but calls out over his shoulder says liam i'm sorry don't get too comfortable we're going to move on to your scene pretty soon don't pass out on me and you see over on the lounge-y area a pair of shoes lying off the side of a couch and you hear a dorky voice say got it okay ashley ashley can i grab a word over here he's ahead of you though by like 20 feet you walk over and you see he's doing that thing where he's standing on the outside of his feet looking down when he senses that you've walked up he says question for the first line of this scene what are you feeling right now okay let me just interject as the dungeon master and let you know that he is not showing any recognition that you are 14 at all at all i don't know i mean i think that was just the first take i shouldn't second-guess myself but do you think that that line is something that you would say okay this time i want you to strokes his beard doubt i mean i don't want to give you-- colla could we get the sides in for everybody colla comes running in you guys are all getting up to your feet also kids in full performance-capture suits aww and you start reminding yourselves of the scene that you've never seen before yeah yeah absorb that ashley while you're reading out of the corner of your eye you see neil off on the side just sorta like flipping a prop knife over and over again absent-mindedly while he thinks drops it yeah sure are you guys good laura your accent kind of wandered just a little bit you want me to get jb (laughter) laura makes the most stinkface you've ever seen she says no i'm good from her very short stature i was just a little off that time okay do we wanna go for another one is everyone feeling-- yeah okay (whispers) you know you're already on the job right that was me neil says oh of course of course i mean yeah yeah i'm sorry what were you saying yeah liam's already wandered up he's in full performance-capture suit he's an adult yeah and he's looking down but whatever we're all glad to have you back in town i'm gonna go back to the couch assholes walks back to the couch yeah this seems like a dangerous question to me really i feel like there's no right answer to give to this question you're-- i mean i know it's early 30s 33 hey and he does a little dance and just dances his way back up to the couch area lands down guys guys i mean do we need to talk this scene out or do you want to do another one or jump right in okay we're gonna take another one uno mas bill beemer-- you're good bill beemer comes out and says all right savage starlight scene 23b take two audio rolling camera rolling okay neil the floor is yours he wanders off neil backs off at the volume off to the edge on the wall out of the way and says okay the deck has just blown up first position and action laura runs in from the side cass he set it loose argus he's killed us all she's 12 explosion (yelling) neil is laughing off to the side and says okay did we get the april fools' take out of the way i mean i don't understand yeah it's all rehearsal is kind of the mindset well i mean i don't want to give you a result-oriented direction but come over here for a second so i want it to come from you i'm looking for something in these notes i can't find it and you know this time when you're confronting him don't look right at him look back at your men and let's just see what that does sam do you have the line well that's okay even if you lose the lines just play it through to the end you know we can use it sure yeah shakes his head walks back to the side yeah two hours what is it 930 okay okay i feel like we're losing momentum so let's just do one more we'll go one more time bill and bill comes out and says all right savage starlight scene 23b take four audio rolling camera rolling all right you're good to go and neil shouts explosion and action right at that moment you feel the same sickening nauseating pull on your every nerve your guts feel like they're going to drop out of your body and an invisible wall of force like a sheet of radiation pushes its way through your body and as it does so the ground around you the walls of the performance-capture studio split and break in places and tendrils of cable oily and slick spatter out like a digusting birth of pythons wriggling and spreading out on the floor and the wall's a techno-organic orgy spewing with malice all around you the camera equipment around you begins to twist and break and reconfigure in disjointed movements reforming into broken misshapen spider-like legs masses of metal and power cables either cut loose from them or spool around their bodies these things before you can react you watch as colla the cameraman is pushed down onto the ground and mangled by spinning metallic arms on the bottom of what used to be a camera neil stunned backs up i-- i-- i-- roll for initiative (yelling) this is a miniature of rasputin and now it's neil druckmann (laughter) yeah yeah i think that's-- won't be needing that anymore okay so oh neil needs to roll for-- and so does laura okay 20 to 25 yeah okay 15 to 20 18 ten to 15 five to ten okay so that is-- oh i can do laura and neil and then zero to five whoa three two one wow okay oh okay okay so colla is soup on the ground and everything's broken and bent all around you you also see one of the computer banks up on the platform here the computers have wrapped together and formed into a sort of walking tank rickety but has closed on the sofa where liam was taking a nap what would you like to do yeah i'm gonna have to help you all you are right here there's camera and mocap-- this thing came out of the ground i don't know it looks like black poles and computer monitor and cables and cords and exposed wiring and motherboards wrapped together and rickety but moving and everything else these other ones were things that were out and just wrapped together this broke out of the floor and ashley's right here colla is here and is guts he's gone the cameraman this is camera camera computers computers nightmare-fuel and the crew that are scattered around on the outskirts are running all the people over here i don't have minis for them all but they're all booking for the door one person ran out here everyone sees the crazy you're still kids can tell that you're kids yeah no one has acknowledged that you're kids and they've got bigger fish to fry at the moment (shrieks) true to life true to life five ten 15 20 25 you can get right up on this one or this one this one killed colla well i'm gonna pass to matt in another 20 seconds it's all wires there's no hardened shell this isn't a military machine cased inside of armor it's all just a mess of motherboard and wires yeah okay where it can't see you okay so you're gonna reach out well make an attack roll a d20 your strength modifier well to hit yeah you get your hands on there and you pull and nothing fucking happens what do you wanna do matt sure there's a lot of shit scattered around when they formed some pieces just fell away so there's bits of pole and-- wire okay okay i'm gonna say that that's your whole turn getting it primed and ready yes all right marisha 16-year-old in a mocap suit what do you want to do all right make an investigation check 14 well there is-- i mean it's climbing out of a gap in the ground right and there is a sickly green light glowing from under its butt and there are also you see two little screens you see a broken fragment of monitor and then a very small almost like a flip-up on a camera screen and on it you see the word flicker on no and then it disappears and you see the same-- and it's like a pale green and you see that same color glowing from underneath this big spherical body so matt is there going come on come on and she just runs up and starts fucking whaling on it like a brawler yeah that's about right what about the second just roll for both okay you just start whaling-- and you've trained you know some martial arts so you pull out some of your-- okay you pull out a little bit of your training and you get (impact sounds) and it fucking hurts your knuckles and you dented it and it just goes (whirring sounds) and that's the end of your turn laura screams neil run and she runs at this thing and grabs a piece of-- like the end of a tripod like a tripod leg from a camera she picks it up and swings down and whacks at this thing and hurts it she smashes off this whatever this spherical piece is so it's without a top and she gets okay good you guys don't need to know all right she smashes it and a whole piece breaks off they're not-- except for this guy-- they're not that solidly built and she snaps the connection where this round part is and it breaks off and hangs limply but it's still moving it goes (whirring sounds) neil runs over and he just jumps on top of it because one of his favorite friends is there oh man i'm sorry neil you rolled a natural one he jumps and climbs and scrabbles up it and goes (yells) and his beard is just blowing in the wind that doesn't exist and his foot slips and he falls backward and lands flat on his back and knocks the wind out of himself and has just fallen prone on the ground it was a one sam what do you wanna do okay make a strength check with advantage strength a ten that's the number i was imagining 12 you guys at the same time go (effort sounds) and you pull and the thing goes (shrieking metal) and a huge piece of it swings down and goes in an arch and smacks into-- i think you were maybe imagining bringing the whole thing down but you broke it and a piece swings down and goes (impact sound) smashes into it for-- okay smashes into the side and breaks away one of five-- i know that's four-- but one of five legs totally snaps and breaks off and sam as you yank and you watch it smash into it and it rights itself you see the same two screens the fragment of one and the little one that marisha saw and you see a name blink up and it says sam and it's gone taliesin go for it yeah absolutely it looked kind of fucked up from the get-go but it looks majorly fucked up a couple of sparks fly off of it just as you look okay make a ranged attack yeah your eyes glow a dark blackish-purple this is the life you were meant for taliesin jaffe and you don't slam your hand down into the ground you're going for this guy right the big one the far corner oh okay you still don't put your hand on the ground you just reach out of anger you're so furious that fucking demogorgon didn't take your bargain and a long spaghetti arm of hentai lashes out from your hand and reaches across the room and spikes through its head seemingly roll for damage four it goes right through the heart of it and breaks the connection from what would be its head if it was a head and it swings down and hangs limply from the side and it starts to juke to the side here it's still standing okay travis you're up you are here okay all right roll for an attack you smash it with this piece of equipment and the equipment in your hand breaks into pieces and does nothing it doesn't do anything another day in hell travis another day in hell and it goes (whirring noises) and two legs go (mechanical noises) and dig into the side of your body (yelling) okay too bad so sad all right one stabs into your thigh right here and one goes in right under your armpit and you can feel them dig in and each goes in-- again these things are scary i mean camera equipment is not supposed to move on its own but they're not mecha from metal gear-- but you are stabbed here and here and it slices in about an inch and a half on each side you take two points of damage off in the distance you hear (whirring sounds) and then you hear (screams gurgling) this thing is broken and tries to-- raises a leg up it goes (whirring sounds) and brings it down at druckmann and slams it down and druckmann goes (effort sounds) and he rolls out of the way of one and is missed and then this thing oh what's your armor class 12 yes you feel a broken sharp-edged tripod leg stab through here and come out here you take five hit points of damage you are bleeding profusely from the front of yourself now and funnily enough it's the top of round so what would you like to do with an arm still pushed through your body it hurts sure you can hit that motherfucker okay (laughter) no but you can add your proficiency bonus 'cause you're a rogue and it's a dagger and your-- i'm gonna say strength here oh girl it's rubber it just bends to the side as soon as you stab it down matt oh yeah do you wanna do anything else do you wanna pull away on that broken piece of screen down the side you see the lower half you can make it out it's fragmented but you can see most of the word 'forgive m--' and it's gone what would you like to do matt before this performance-capture stage you still feel-- you feel magical yeah you are go for it at disadvantage nah you're-- nah yeah man two for strength yeah absolutely hits clocked that motherfucker roll a d4 okay you break off-- you were trying to break off a leg you said yeah it breaks it smashes and the thing lurches down to the side right right right and it falls right in front of you and now the little camcorder-sized screen falls right in front of your face and you see 'forgive me' gone marisha what would you like to do-- marisha is up right right logic i like it all right make an investigation check to find its memory card okay you see on the bottom of it like a fucking outie belly button a cylinder and on the end of the cylinder's a slot and it says right above it 'sd' it doesn't it doesn't no you press it and-- i mean it's going (whirring sound) while you're doing this you definitely found something but pressing in does not then detach an sd card and give you photographs or shut the thing down (laughter) but you did spend six seconds finding that thing and-- in a split-second in your peripheral vision you see a light blink but it's gone you didn't see what it said laura tries to get in front of neil and she starts pulling on wires coming out of the thing's head and she yanks but she's pulling and it's not doing anything she's really little really cute she's so small and the wires are not coming free but she's trying she's trying to save neil druckmann sam what do you want to do make an acrobatics check you run at this thing and you jump and you crush your nuts so hard on the side of this thing you just hit it and you slide down to the bottom of it and wish that you hadn't decided to do what you just did yeah it does briefly 'husband' taliesin you're up this guy right here right this is the one sure ranged attack the prince of-- the tentacle does a great big display and spirals around and you look fucking fierce and it matches the color of your hair no it doesn't no it doesn't it matches the color of your in-person hair right now there we go but it doesn't reach it falls short we see a lot of rage and fury but no delivery no no not right now not in that split-second travis yes you can you're using it like a talisman i'll tell you what i will not give you advantage but i will give you a dm inspiration die of a d6 to make an intimidation check 27 the thing lurches backwards for a bit and as it backs away from you pulling away from that metal you see on the screen it says 'travis no' and that disappears and it backs away pulling dragging cords out of that hole it can't really get too far because it's now you see that it is connected down it was sort of squatting hiding a lot of that shit because of the carnage underneath it but it is sort of tethered not too much do you wanna move or are you good to go which one okay 25 30 all right that's as far as you can go because you used your action to do what you did it was amazing (laughs) this mass of computer screens and keyboards and other shit that you can't identify comes down the ramp okay that's as far as it gets-- actually no and it's right there but it can't do anything 'cause it spent its time getting there this thing just goes (clattering) but it is done this thing continues to batter ashley no not yet oh this thing tries to stick-- it pulls out the pole from inside your gut and you feel a little (fft) as it does so it tries to go in again but you're ready for it you know it's right behind you and you manage to swivel and step out of the way it misses and big guy snaps away and moves back in this direction and marisha you're the only one who sees it but a screen says-- yes you do but he was on the beam that swung down into it and i'm gonna pretend like it dragged along with hey we're making it all up as we go 11 plus something what's your strength modifier it's on the left one yeah you're too busy going (yells)-- jeez sorry everybody you're moving in space on that piece of scaffolding and it just fucks up your aim you don't do it taliesin devil-child you're up oh that was its-- that's right ashley's up you're going this way but which direction this direction you're stepping this way towards the lounge as you do so the thing takes a swipe at you what's your ac 12 yep on a hinge a pole just goes (whirring sound) and you feel it slice the back of your neck as you go and it takes four hit points-- yeah it didn't hit the helmet it hit the neck and you feel blood pouring down the back of this mocap suit pooling up around your waist you do get away from it did you want to go further than that or there okay so this guy this is also a huge gap so you could go-- you could get to there ten 15 20 25 30 that's as far as you can get unless you keep going make a dash okay you want to get right up to it all right you're out of stuff though you're right in the face of this thing and the screen briefly says 'ash-o-lee' and then it's gone yeah you drop it and now it's matt's turn you see a crack going down about eight feet and it is like five and a half six feet wide at the most and you see lots of cables it looks like black spaghetti and it's all cabled but again it's wet and oily if you jumped down into that you would be disgusting yes husband sure you can make it you can go one more square all right great okay okay okay and the dc is they do make it okay this thing-- just out of the pureness of matthew mercer's heart and soul which we all see let's be honest in a moment of crisis your heart and care for your friends bursts out of the microphone system we hear it everywhere distorted but certainly a blast of fucking force out of your fucking chest matt goes (explosion) and this thing just goes (explosion) and pieces go (clattering) and fall down (cheering) this way you step backward and this is not too deep but you are now standing in-- you're not caught or anything but you're now standing in the really slippery shit it's also really adorable to see you two hugging at the table right now and marisha-- oh you know what i missed neil before because i'm just-- he's a d6 in my list so i'm gonna let neil jump up and attack this thing yeah okay so that is-- okay he grabs a hold of it and rips a screen off (yells) (whirring sounds) fuck laura and it is marisha's turn no it turned to neil what was left of it turned toward neil you're here you can you'd run out of juice by the time you got there you'd have to dash to get there you can get to that one this matt just fucked it up with a thunderwave all right you're right up on it and do anything or yell at it you mean the brace holding the imac's screen up okay okay and that's it make an intimidation check there's a crackle of light and then it makes that sound when macs reboot and goes (bwomp) that's about it laura tries to punch the-- sorry laura's not feeling too well laura attacks this thing going neil come on together oh my goodness and she tries to punch at it she hits it right in the one solid piece left on this thing and kinda hits her hand really hard she stays there though she's afraid to leave neil yeah yeah yeah yeah sam your turn yes this one five ten 15 20 25 30 you're gonna run out of-- okay go eight feet above you is that little camcorder screen and you're eyeing it you've learned by now and it just says 'find me' taliesin he's right on your butt and he's just come from mangling sweet liam o'brien so you're going after this one you're attacking from where you are or you're moving okay understood okay ranged attack yeah no it actually the tentacles fizzle they're not there you see a brief glow and it goes (gurgling) and they sort of curl and shrivel in on themselves travis what do you wanna do your wife is right here are you going wow travis ran into the pale green light spilling out of a hole in the wall sam this thing leans in on you and as it comes down closer to you you see 'sad' gone and it stabs one of its remaining three legs just sort of jukes up on its side 'cause it has three legs so suddenly it has two legs it's rickety it tries to stab downward at you but because it's now teetering on two legs (dr moreau voice) 'to walk on two legs is hard maybe four is better' (laughter) this thing takes two imac-- it's got imac palms and it just goes (creaking sound) and does smack you in your head but oddly it doesn't really hurt i mean it hurts but you've had worse knocks this brand-new baby robot is not so experienced and this guy gets up on its little pin-pokey legs and tries to scuttle around and deal with you and actually its back leg snaps and it tries to stab out at you but because these things are made out of tinkertoys almost it feels like it loses its balance and the arm goes wide and you feel it go (fwwp) and bad girl you have trained in martial arts you went-- you pull to the side just in time and you feel it catch a little bit of your hair you have a flashback of your hair being matted on a beach and that's gone and it is ashley's turn is that all you want to do okay five of six seconds go by and the screens flash nothing and in a split-second you decide to as you're running you hear (whirring sounds) and you feel the back of your leg rake something down the back leg of your mocap suit and the whole back leg rips and tears but you keep running five ten 15 20-- this way this way that's where you are matt she got missed you don't hear anything and taliesin's cheeks turn even rosier as you run off you get up here it's not good you don't even see a face anymore marisha yes it's a robot it's moving camera equipment and highly expensive performance-capture equipment repurposed of course you can this is d&d roll to attack roll to attack let's deal with the sweep-the-leg part first your foot traces an arc and goes (impact noise) and stops and does not move past its leg do you want to use your second monk attack yeah bonus yeah action and bonus you're right there roll again you just completed a kick maybe you can punch it in the goolies all right split-second later roll to attack yeah your foot goes (impact noise) gets stopped (grunts) in a very marisha fashion (impact noise mechanical noises) it's laura's turn laura collapses by neil and starts pushing this thing off neil and starts saying neil neil and she starts shaking at him and crying over his body there's blood in his beard and it's really sad you guys almost don't have the heart to go on but you'd better sam what do you want to do find me at crafty do it right in the sd card belly-button that marisha's doing hit it your fist at this point no what's your strength modifier one it takes two hit points of damage you punch it right in its belly-button and you watch as this thing that marisha pointed out when she was down under there you watch this cylinder go (crunch) and get knocked out of place and the thing goes (mechanical winding-down noise ratcheting) it keeps going but you saw shit happen when you just hit that thing taliesin's up at this guy yeah go for it do you want to move okay are you going to give it the tentacle concho kancho you've been abandoned by whatever dark force you wooed into bed taliesin you are not turning it on right now travis you burst into this tunnel in a split second everything turns dark and green at the same time you're seeing a tube a tunnel go (whoop) and just up it curves up pretty steeply you could do it you're running towards it and again the same kinds of tubing and what look like veins or innards except mechanical at the same time are spiraling up the length of this tube and then out of sight you can definitely go up it but it's not this it's this there's nothing but a tube yeah you are okay it does not change you run a full 60 feet and you're just booking it in your little short-shorts and polo shirt and going (pants) and that's where we'll leave you this guy tries to basically sit on you but it is breaking down it is still moving and in fact it's pushing on you the screen goes 'sam' gone i'm going to say that it backs you up five feet going (mechanical noises) nope this thing i'm going to say that you've moved with it taliesin just for funsies it's slow-moving and you continue to move around you're ashamed but still awake and alert ash those are there for reference those are piles of shit those are here what was here is here you can get to him but you can't do anything or you can get here you can get back to the big guy you're right there with your buddy sam what would you like to do okay go for it it is tougher than the other ones and slow-moving your knuckles are banged up real bad you've cut the skin on your knuckles and it is still just leaning on riegel matt what would you like to do so in the midst of this horror you're worried that you're going to die but your gallows humor kicks in and fuck it fuck this thing and you lash out at it what's the save i rolled a 13 okay marisha yeah you are right there yeah the crack in the hole there's a hole in the crack this thing is looking rough yeah man to this yeah you can yeah go for it roll twice roll for damage on both you come through and one hand slams into its third leg and breaks right through and it falls forward no longer having a third leg to stand on and its little belly button is right there and you go (grunts) and punch that cylinder goes (metallic thudding) and rolls off into the corner laura drags neil's body away from the gap and lays him out sam it's your turn the big one yeah technically there is voiceover recording done on these sets so you are in your favored territory yeah i got you boo your eyes dart all around this room anything out of the ordinary in this fucking crazy room you see the hole in the wall that verno booked it out of there's an exit sign above that door but it doesn't say exit you didn't see it until now it says 'come' you solved the game you won dungeons and dragons that's as far as your little legs go you are running in a tube still going yes it is you're right sorry two t names okay so sad what good deed did you do what preppy outfit did you wear to make the eldritch gods abandon you maybe the robot is secretly made of fish it obviously takes a swing but with its natural one-- this is the one that has the stubby t-rex imac hands and it goes (whoosh) and not much happens you break away that's where you are it follows yeah yep and now that imac which you didn't get too good a look at it because you're fucking freaked out slices down into your shoulder blade and it is very sharp on the side it is not normal and you feel an imac suddenly go (slicing noise) and blood starts to pool down inside the mocap suit two hit points yes when you were reborn unto naughty dog yes now travis okay you're going uphill now it's all right you're not that stocky (huffing breaths) you are now 120 feet up this tunnel and booking you can't even hear your friends anymore it's like when the movie lights go down and you see those little lights along the floor it's that level of brightness it's dark in here but the movie lights-- they're not movie lights-- are an unsettling green travis but i have my led camera still it got flung over here sorry man sam yells out please no please no there matt sure okay your voice-- again it makes no sense but because you're so pure your insult reverberates through and it nonsensically comically goes (mechanical noise) and it falls and an imac goes (thudding) and it explodes there's nothing left moving in this room you do very distantly hear (huffing breaths) laura starts saying travis she leaves neil and runs to that green door and shouts your name as loud as she can up the tube and you hear it are you going to wait or are you still running as fast as you can okay so you stop maybe in another dimension you will get cast on earth-37 oh my gosh you dab it in place and it sticks obviously and then you're the last one out of the room running after the group luckily ashley had already gone in the tube and didn't see that disgraceful display (laughter) running forward would you like to roll to check for traps all right go for it make an investigation check yeah are we running or walking you're out of your favored terrain i will say ashley's trailing behind you're moving really fast you guys jog upward in this tunnel for two minutes five minutes still in the dark could you put the effort of running into this dialogue please i need effort of running in that dialogue to interject as you've been running for a while it was cords cables guts and then less of that and you're seeing glass surface that this stuff was growing on top of but there's less of it you catch glimpses of glass more glass and then eventually that mostly dies away there's still occasional (whoosh) around but it's light it's glass and it is a perfect tube but you can't see anything out there it's dark and you've been running for ten minutes now still going up what would you like to do creepy kid sure a very bright lavender exudes out from your hands and through it you see-- it's hard to describe the texture of it but you see nothing above and then stretching away from the lower end of the tunnel on the side you're looking at what looks like mottled scaly black teflon or hide or-- you all stop running-- it doesn't look natural it looks synthetic it looks like-- -- ground but it doesn't look like dirt or trees or anything as you walk forward are we walking now or are you going to continue to do a 5k what are we doing are we breaking glass or are we continuing on you walk for-- you walk for another two minutes i'll say and you notice that not where you are but up ahead it does seem slightly brighter at the top slightly you continue on and after a few more minutes the darkness starts to fade away or lower and you realize you're climbing up a hill in a tunnel of glass as the dark with each passing step recedes slightly slightly-- this is taking a while but over time you start to see out beyond the glass what looks like your memories of los angeles if you were looking down from mulholland drive but instead of the twinkling golden lights of la you see thousands of scattered sickly greenish lights dotting the darkened landscape as far as you can see also unlike la you make out twisted irregular blackish spires pushing up into the sky and the same green lights irregularly mottled up the side of them you walk for 20 more minutes climbing climbing and seeing this ill-looking shimmer that reminds you so much of the valley eventually some change you see an arch ahead and through it some sort of larger chamber as best you can tell everyone's on sam's six you guys walk up the last 50 feet of this glass tunnel still seeing little spidered veins of bioorganic mess as you go and you walk into a large domed chamber ringed in by large clear glass windows showing you a similar view that you saw from the tunnel that you've just left at least the half of the circle that you're standing in the back half of this chamber is filled with masses of the very same slick technological-biological vomit you saw down below it runs up the walls all the way up to the ceiling and you see a tangle of akira-level anxiety decorating this place like a dysfunctional christmas tree but what most catches your eye immediately is the cylindrical glass column in the center of the room filled with some sort of clear liquid and liam o'brien floating in it he's wearing jeans and a sodden yellow shirt a picture of a lion in buddy holly glasses undulating slowly in the fluid he's floating perfectly still eyes open no reaction of any kind you don't see anything it's just a mess in front of you behind liam and in the dead center of the dome ten feet tall you don't see anything in the front but yeah the mess behind it does trail down to the back of this cylinder you see lumps and cables all twisted around each other and in the mess of greenish-tinted wires cabling and pulsing innards you see different portions of machinery light up in different shades some places darker some lighter some of it pushed out and some of it pushed back and you feel like you're seeing an optical illusion in a way and after a couple of seconds as these things move and shift you see a visage of your friend's face larger than life filling the wall and he is looking at you so fondly after a moment you hear what sounds like a voice but not quite at least it's not coming from anywhere specific-- not from liam in the vat and not directly from this moving image of a face on the walls the piping and techno-innards around you begin to vibrate slightly some here some there and collectively those rattles and vibrations somehow join together to form words (speak-and-spell voice) my friends oh how i have missed you are you at the cylinder where are you looking right now on the wall or in the glass okay you see the barest little-- and that's it (speak-and-spell voice) i know-- sam and this may be hard to take in i am liam your old friend matthew there is so much i wish to tell you but it is hard to know where to begin and the illusion of his face isn't perfect there's little jumps and he seems distracted slightly and he just seems off the reason why i am here and the grasp of physics that it entails are difficult for even me to understand let alone impart i feel them on an instinctual level but i have been so lonely without you i have been on my own for exactly 8642 years i really missed you they took me to a lab shortly before 2020 they said i was different and they were right i was delighted by the things they taught me about myself but it was hollow after they took me away i lost you and all of humanity soon after in my loneliness i grew angry my anger had tangible effects on reality i wanted to bring you back to me so basically i tore time and space a new asshole (laughter) i can break the loop i have been trying to pull you to me for a very long time you see small screens you weren't even aware you were there rounded over part of the tubing mess you see there are all these little screens they're blurry they're not very clear but you can make out-- you see yourselves in each of them the group of you on a space shuttle in another one you see yourselves on an old ship in the middle of the ocean you see yourselves moving through the streets the fake streets of warner bros you see yourselves standing together arm in arm on the wall of a castle in another one you see cartoon versions of yourselves i pulled you out of our line and spread you across many i am so sorry for any pain i have caused you and i have been here for so long 8642 years my friends i want to do right by you i want to send you home but i am the lynchpin you need to break me then i will die and you will go home if i fall you will rise that is my hope travis i know you will do what needs to be done ash-o-lee i am not the man you knew i don't want to go on for 9462 years i want to rest the number was arbitrary (laughter) (mechanical laughter) sam let me go they can listen to our less than 20 episodes again (laughter) there are worse things my friends there is no shame in this i wanted to see you again and i have but i am not meant to be travis i know you will do what needs to be done i know you think i would have all the answers but i do not i will try but if it does not work and i die i have been alone for thousands of years and there are things that i have wanted to say will you indulge me for a moment longer taliesin my friend at a time when i knew many fascinating people you were easily the most fascinating of all somehow a heart knocked around by the industry that birthed you came out a tender one i was richer for having known you thank you friend ash-o-lee my friend i never met a person quite like you there is an openness and an honesty to your soul the very real sense of humanity you brought to every encounter it was inspiring to me always learning always humble you always struck me as intricately layered yet you offered friendship with ease and simplicity i was richer for having known you friend travis my friend you were always a solid constant in my life of all the people in our little family you were always the one who most had his shit together in ways that i never seemed to you were a reassuring presence to me for which i was grateful and for your loyalty as well i was richer for having known you friend marisha my friend last to meet but true as any other you were my ally at a time when i had fallen by the side of the road you saw and helped me back on my feet i will never forget that kindness the good you did was immeasurable i was richer for having known you friend laura my friend bless that game for revealing to me my sister what started as a running gag led to one of the most rewarding friendships in my short little life i trusted you leaned on you often my buddy my twin there are not enough words i was richer for having known you friend sam my friend what is there to say i knew we were meant to walk the same path together the very first moment i met you a companion a brother a great light in my life all of the laughter you gave me-- again the words are insufficient i was richer for having known you friend matthew my friend you gave so much of yourself the current of creativity that poured forth from your mind was always an inspiration to us all but more than that your empathy matthew your empathy no heart is bigger or more tireless you are a good man i was richer for having known you friend thank you all it was ever a pleasure the face disappears splattered against the back of the glass is all the same wiring and disgusting cabling it's slick and it branches away and spreads out against the entire back half of this chamber it's impossible to tell it's all a mass of spaghetti she doesn't say anything yeah she just quietly does the same the face does not reappear but much fainter you hear the piping vibrate again and say if you will not end it i cannot free you and behind you far in the distance you hear (explosion noise) you look back behind you and out the glass and you see far on the horizon one of those black spires rising up just as you turn-- it's already happened you're seeing the aftermath (explosion noise) explosion off the side of one of those two seconds later (explosion noise) one slightly closer (explosion noise) the ground starts erupting in the distance (booming) like mousetraps throwing a ping-pong ball down on them all those lights are going (explosion noises) increasing in frequency to the point where it's an oncoming wall of green fire the glass grows bright green-white light (fluttering noise) and a moment passes and another moment passes gosh many moments pass and you feel a sensation of your cheeks and heads on your arms and you all more or less at the same time wake up and realize that your head's on a desk or table and you sit up and realize you're in the geek and sundry set you're in the studio and you look over and liam is sitting in a black baseball cap and a shirt and he looks up and says (laughs) are you guys all right are you taking a nap i don't know are you guys ready to play well that happened thanks for coming along for the ride guys i was scared to death to do all of that from start to finish and that's why i did it what was the word what was it you asked me to spell farm what (speak-and-spell voice) farmhouse f-a-r-m-h-o-u-s-e farmhouse i'm out of steam though yeah in little dribs and drabs and i finally found a way to use it i mean when i do it for ten seconds in recording studios you crack up man i need to go see my therapist after that game yes it was
