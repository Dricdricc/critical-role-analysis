scanlan been out for gosh i'd like to go get him but i really want him to wake up on his own accord yeah that's good thinking is scanlan sleeping it off i mean we're in vasselheim we've just bamfed across miles and miles we're here i lean in the door and say you've been in there long enough to pay rent what is going on uh yeah is she being a pain in the arse we're not begging in stillben will you give the guy some fucking coin so we can get the fuck out of here my time is valuable will you pay him so we can go please that was liam all he hears is fart noises and i grab her by the mouth and i drag her out the door it's why i'm saying nothing no he walked into the door with vex what does that mean you wanna rest in the tavern for an hour where i have to go is a little more involved yeah i scoop you by the arm and take you off for a minute you know i want to come back here sometime one i would love to go to the velvet cabaret again you know just like a date night yeah but without somebody trying to kill us i'd like to go back without somebody trying to murder any of us though that aside i do have to go to the temple but i don't want to go 'cause that's kind of what it's like yeah there is another shoe that's gonna drop probably eventually i wanna get back to-- no you have to hit send my friend her other shoe is gonna drop eventually and i'm not ready for that i don't know why wouldn't she i don't know but i feel like being a little selfish and taking a little time and when she wants me-- 'cause she's not talking to me at the moment-- when she wants me she'll call so i'd like a little time just to come back down the road yeah no no very sure well i don't know what's gonna happen at the-- i'd probably do it the other way around because i don't know what's gonna happen at church i'm talking months unless she rings okay i just want to spend some time with you before i have to do whatever the fuck she wants she's going to collect my sister is walking around and breathing still shocking as that is anyway way down the line way down the line jesus who is that that little vein on the side of your forehead-- who the wizard magic is like broadway musicals brechtian theater (pained groans) pfft trees don't fart out here (loud pooting sound) the ancient sumerians would pay for sex with silver dollars pudding why is he covered in pudding thank god sour hey buddy laura (sing-songy) welcome back this is the afterlife scanlan you've gone to the good place we're in whitestone you should have heard her play all your daughter knows is that you stood against great evil overtaking an entire continent that's nothing to sneeze at scanlan that's full bullshit yes asshole yes i've changed my outlook on life because of you what the fuck are you talking about of course we all love you-- -- you could crush me in a second how i've asked your age i thought you were the only one who had everything figured out i thought for months what haven't i got figured out that scanlan has got figured out i've been trapped in the mud for months wondering what i could do to get where you are scanlan you fucking saved the world with us if your daughter can't see that then she can't see anything you've thrown some of us like baseballs i don't know what that is we've never had one conversation you and i about my mother where my sister and i came from did you know thordak killed her we've never talked about it not once because i didn't want to talk about it i didn't push into your private life if you wanted to talk to me and you did about your daughter we did we talked in the sewers of westruun about your daughter because you wanted to talk about her we love you scanlan and if you want to talk about your mother or your father we will you have not been exactly forthcoming we have survived a fucking hellscape all of us you are standing before me talking to me you did that's fucking semantics shorthalt you've been brought back you're standing here your daughter is there and needs you what about the fight before that excuse me speaking as someone who has been fucking depressed for a long time-- look me in the eye i was shit for months and you are one of the main reasons i am out of that now we would be dead all of us if it weren't for you the first time we fought raishan we would all be dead you are in a pity party right now and i know you're hurting and i'm sorry you're hurting and i love you but you are lying to yourself that you have been no use to us you are lying to yourself Â if you wanna retire if you wanna go off with your daughter that's fucking wonderful i encourage you to do it but don't lie to yourself (pleading) scanlan family scanlan we'll miss you (draws in a breath) fuck (wearily) we saved the continent why does everything feel like shit but he's our liar grog yes they do i don't think so i think it's too late pike-- how you doing pickle i don't wanna go back to vasselheim pike-- and before too long we have a demon who wants you and i dead in the night we have to deal with it we can of course we can pike no no we don't we just wanna slow things down for a while it's been a long couple of months no we just need to not have our lives on the line every day for a little while or ever retirement's not a terrible idea i mean what's the takeaway here from scanlan can't hold anything in fuck you know that i've always looked up to you for everything that i've tried to model myself after you do you know that and you you know that she's my best friend right you know that you know that i'm madly in love with her right you know that right we don't need to joke about it or dance around it anymore you know that i'm in love with her right obviously i just don't-- he left because he felt like we didn't know him i'm scared to death about what i have to give to a fucking god eventually i'm scared of that i don't want to do that but it's going to happen and it's destiny i'm scared about that there that's out do you have anything that you're holding in you're in love with percival we all know that right it's plain as day right crack out the aerator yo yeah i've learned that i don't know but he's our
