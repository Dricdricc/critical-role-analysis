i knew this episode would start in tears (laughter) that's a line straight from the game matt is very fancy in it that's all i'm allowed to say i also play a guy yeah okay that's it why in the fuck should we trust you what do you claim your motives to be let's start with that insight check well hold on no 13 never mind yeah if we were to work with you and that is a massive fucking if if we were to work with you and thordak were to fall-- paint us a picture what can we look forward to after that what happens to you where do you go what happens to tal'dorei you might as well be feeding us nursery rhymes a lot better if you'd be willing to shed a bit of blood yeah we're getting a bit ahead of ourselves are you going to scrap with the white dragon with us or not it's feed a curse starve perma-death not for you you're so clever keyleth all we're debating is the order in which they die yeah shut the fuck up sick bag percy is right we don't want the people of whitestone to fall like the people of the ashari you're just fucking winding her up man we're talking about a second round of negotiations we haven't danced with a dragon that now stands breathing what is radar i said (singing) bitch i don't think scanlan is wrong i think he is weak however she will try to destroy as much as possible out of spite in her death throes he's learned a lot taunting you all along what do you know about the briarwoods really what do you think about the wall surrounding that beach ball down there it's a little creepy down there isn't it you expect us to believe you know nothing as smart as you are you know nothing of what happened there in the months past are you sure you're not trying to summon something awful out of that marble what do you want to do with that thing well tell me a little bit more i think you're lying through your teeth i think you want something you're not telling us about but i do want the white dragon dead and we can work on it later lies of omission are a tricky thing aren't they jump on the carpet and go kill her anyway look it's never an easy choice but you have to fall down on one side or the other scanlan oh chris hardwick as gern coming in for the political joke i am drawing a blade behind my back (rapping) whenever i go to the loot crate somebody kill me now 'cause of the embarrassment i'm experiencing live in front of the internet i didn't have a sideways hat i needed a sideways hat what is this manure movers of america she's obviously hiding shit from us and if one of us goes and pokes our nose in there she's going to start a draw right there you'll have your day absolutely if thordak senses sees any one of us in the same place as her he will go mad i worry about her intentions with this thing help me remember when pike has spoken to dead things they cannot lie so she wants to talk to thordak's spirit who presumably cannot lie right which could mean the cure to this disease but it could mean something to do with that thing away from this city it's pronounced 'purvin' that's so much better maybe allura knows i need to talk to you for a minute come on that's a good idea let's go to the temple i've been thinking a lot about your longer life that you told me about once you're leading your people you've come into your own yeah a thousand years or so yeah now i've thought a lot about that and i think we should make a point of seeing that it happens well once you come out the other side of this i want that for you well if we're all alive in a month we can work that out in the meantime i want you to have this and i undo my cloak and shove it into her hands i only have one made from the-- i'm so used to you smashing across our enemies shoulder-to-shoulder with grog i get complacent you're so strong i know that so much more powerful than i am lulled me into a false sense of security but i can't have you gone i need you here so anything we can do to stack the deck in your favor when you fell yesterday it shook me kiki will you wear that it feels really third-grade in here all of a sudden that guy's going to go back to his room and flagellate himself i want to go in and have a moment pray so i will go in and kneel down where percival showed me and stay quiet for a few minutes then ask a couple of questions i haven't spoken in a while i'm trying to grow stronger whatever it is you need maybe it is selfish but i seek vengeance against my mother's killer once i have it i will go to the ends of this world for you to help me go stronger is there anything you can tell me about the fiend named yenk we need to use it i will stick with that no i'll stick with that 21 sort of she told me something but i'm too stupid to understand she said that the path to the sphinx told us everything we want to know she didn't say because they can come here that's on crooked here's to a thousand years of you this is before beddy-bye time are you talking about for raishan she's a poisonous dragon maybe an enemy will come over you're right a vestige that was laura bailey-esque that was spectacular don't let them get jacked up sort of i wanted to talk to you and probably percival as well well i communed with my deity-- laura and that's the one and she said something that i don't know what she meant i asked about this yenk and she said everything we needed to know we saw on the way to the sphinx she didn't say i'm drawing a blank i don't know so i remember the more recent trip better what happened the first time it was under the slayer's take yes under the slayer's take yes then the second time-- grog almost drowned we just spoke to her i just did it yeah but i didn't understand what she told me so six of one half a dozen of the other i gave you a cloak once and you stopped using it no i do not want it back this is really awkward and i'm going to walk the fuck out of here good night ladies i go off looking for percy hello do you mind gods what does all this shit do just like us i just broke in the temple that you-- it was first i don't think i ever officially thanked you for it thank you how are you feeling buddy i came here for a reason you're the brain you're the one that hangs brain i don't know what to make of my conversation with the higher power i asked about yenk i asked what we should do and she talked about the sphinxes she said that everything that we needed to know we learned on the way to the sphinx i don't know which one i don't know if it was the gynosphinx or the not-gynosphinx did you follow me down here i said i didn't fucking want to-- you scared the shit out of me this is some nasty business this is what we're dealing with i don't know if it's smart but i'm really curious i think it might yeah the little guy can pull it off have you ever been here look at all this fucking esoteric bullshit you're selling yourself short allura or gilmore raishan has had everyone fooled for a long time i think better to get raishan away from here and in that fray she might not be touched but she might be whittled down a little bit that's better than nothing we have to get her away from whitestone we have to she's going to put out the barest amount of effort to help us from behind also we know we're walking into this shit that's no surprise arguably so yeah i do i don't know how good a judge of character i am though you know i have face-planted more than any of you maybe i have with that boy i can see it in his eyes we're up to our elbows in blood there has to be room for a little bit of redemption in this world it's a good idea do we have time to teach them how these things work do you want to talk to him well you probably need to get to bed but why don't we go find him before it grows too late i will thank you i head out the romance is over (laughter) (dryly) no it's great it's super cool mary is going to see this i'm not there i'm sure i'm more than 500 feet away well first how's he coming along yeah i'd agree with that i'm on de rolo business right now can i borrow the boy no you're fine take a walk with me i need to head back to the castle jarett he'll be back tomorrow for a little more all right hey listen to me i wanted to give you a little more time i wanted to and i don't think we have it things are moving fast you didn't know what was going on i don't fault you i fault myself that day you showed up-- look at me i had a point but i made sport of you while making it and that is on me and i'm sorry for it hey man i'm a little bit older than you but i'm a massive fucking shithead i've made plenty of mistakes and i only knew how easy it was for shit to blow up in your face and now it has percival and i want to offer you a means of squaring yourself off this city is in danger and it needs people watching it and i know you're training percy-- i'm sorry percival-- has a task for you and i think it's well suited for you you were around ripley you were around her other men and you know how to use a sidearm sure but the number of people who know how to use those things i can count on two hands here we have guns now we need people to use them so i want you to come and talk to percival for a bit and we're going to work out a plan for you to show some people the ropes this is your second chance i don't doubt you're going to make the best of it i truly do not and again i was going to wait on this because i can see the pain in your eyes but there isn't time and i want you to be well equipped so i want you to take these and i hand him two of the three daggers that i bought that day and i take out the keen dagger which requires attunement these are mine and now they're yours water under the bridge and i don't want to hear a word just walk with me to de rolo i'm sorry she could stay in the shittiest room in the mansion scanlan do the thing (laughter) you never know when it's out of character or in character-- all right quickly kima we need to talk to you about something very important and if it doesn't go well scanlan is going to erase your memory but-- of course not because you are so cool cool as a cucumber we're in a bit of a predicament we are going to draconia so that you can fight not one but two dragons here's the thing one of the dragons is here right now is coming with us in disguise-- we've got eight more minutes before we kill it you know what also this is like this is what this is like this is just like the underdark with one exception we worked with that fucking asshole thinking he might have some redeeming qualities and he didn't he turned on us right but on the side he helped us get as far as he did but then he got shot through the head but that's water under the bridge this time we know that we're dealing with a fucking piece of shit we're going to turn on the piece of shit and kill her the whole plan is to get them all to turn on each other and then we mop up the messy bits afterwards one dragon or two dragons you want to play let's play you were ready to run with us girl kimmy can you be cool can you be cool it's going to show up after the fact in draconia we've all almost died a hundred times i think all these words are fucking it up she seems down i think we should just get it on right can you be cool kima we've got three minutes left kima that's true you know our mind you know what our plan is you're kind of a firebrand do you think it might be better for you not to know-- you know now but to not know going in and then you kill everything on sight when we're there one to two dragons yes and then another dragon she's our ticket there hey scanlan could you wipe kynan's memory please yeah he's here you left with him i redact that statement excellent i see i was focused on the fire-- free wet willies sounds good to me it's confusing man it was weird five minutes ago matt you seem way more relaxed than even an hour ago yep i'll have whatever she's having ten minutes when he wants it well he had good-- there's a lot at stake-- i pull the gnome up and cast lay on hands and give him ten hit points you all right buddy there was that sideways tree also quickly i've attuned whisper and i've changed the deathwalker's ward to cold do we want to have a heroes' feast because of the terror that dragons inflict upon all those who-- what else are we saving it for other than this you can be invisible as well and i'm very sneaky well the dragon would know if i was really a mouse or not though as well got that dust of tracelessness i don't know how to un-polymorph myself one of us has to talk and you'll do the talking yeah hit us with the dust of tracelessness you turn invisible we'll hoof it yeah we're shit out of luck not in a quarter-mile with dust of tracelessness hit us grog we want them to know to stay clear to not attack this thing if they can help it it's a worthwhile risk yeah gather up you scanlan here can i do the same does that stuff stack or no i could cast bless do the same thing help with saves and-- all right i bless the three of us i shoot out the wings and i glide scanlan and i invisibly down to the bottom perception you said 22 and halfway through flying whatever we do we don't want to scare the shit out of everybody and get attacked i think we go visible now no we just hear quiet underground all right you're going to take good care of them you're going to leave them there all right i'll leave this up to you mr reynolds we came with a whole fucking plan do you want to hear about it we came to report and we'll get out of here all right man so many good things about loot crate the thing we're going to release is gnarly so give it a little bit of space all right good chat scanlan want to head back to the pad hey let's go get our shit and get out of here i grab him by the scruff of the neck and start pulling him out of the room i'm so sorry simon i should never have left you in there love you how long has it been since i bamfed out the wings an hour start going up toward the ridge this is intense yeah can we get a lift you're massive aren't you two massive enemies sure we're in the mansion
