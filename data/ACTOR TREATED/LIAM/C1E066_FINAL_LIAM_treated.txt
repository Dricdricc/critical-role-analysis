percy wishes he created that what did you roll what did you roll grog 19 19 going to click the boots together and i'm going to slide over this way between those two windows i'm closest to yeah all the way to the wall yeah yeah i'm going to dagger and dagger and dagger him okay first one is 24 second one i'm going to reroll with luck second one-- balls it's 16 that's two that's my second i've been checking them off the third one is 24 as well it was 24 15 or 16 and 24 again first and last okay give me the pyramid and i go and get nine plus i have advantage so i get sneak attack so that's nine plus 14 19 20 26 30-- 36 for the first 36 that ends my turn magic six seconds later (screams) (laughter) i'm all right there's a five foot square yes but you're ten feet away though (mickey mouse voice) i'd like to use my bonus action to go earth elemental there she is would you allow me to use my bonus action to go stealth and quietly run over using my hasted speed to get over to my sister behind that stone thingy in the middle of the room yes i'd like to try okay i'll use my last luck of the day though fine 29 okay i'd like to curve around by my sister and use sharpshooter to throw two daggers as hard as i can at him that's what i want to do first one is a 26 25 and the second one misses it's a natural one with sharpshooter oh no 26 21 this is with dagger of venom and flame tongue so the flame missed dagger hit excuse me venom hit is it a sneak attack all right so it's plus ten because i used sharpshooter so one seven plus ten is 17 that's the 20 23 27 32 37 40 do i have five feet of movement left i'm going to slink right behind the thing so i'm out of range i didn't hear any of that that was longer than six seconds you sir have the temperament of a yalie (gun firing) still well-aimed take that sword out man there's a 20 on the die do you see me angel guy 22 who that golem such hassle too much hassle shove out window fighting too much hassle i want to like a hasted spider monkey scrabble along the floor really low and flank the thing opposite keyleth and stab it in any gears i see i've got wings first attack is a 17 second attack misses it's a natural one third attack is a natural one oh it's advantage on all the attacks because i'm flanking advantage on all so the first one was a 17 one more roll for the second is a 13 and then the third attack--holy cow--is a 25 the last one is the dagger of venom it is three plus six is nine plus-- they're right there what did i say before nine plus six 15 18 24 25 31 37 40 again i'm going to guess i have a little bit of movement left and i don't care if he swings at me i'm going to back into the corner between the hole and the window that's still in one piece yeah all the way to the wall yep is it

distance that went from terrible to great yeah natural 20 so that's a 35 got you scan-man if it's any consolation that was totally adorable just wait outside for us we'll be out in a bit what's it like outside you know maybe go out to the front where the people are you don't need to be in the back with the dumpster does it only work with 20s these stairs are peopled or are they empty other than scanlan and this other guy can i ride my 20 up the stairs that's fine 31 i'm still wearing the fancy whites that percival put over me the other day you can do anything you want in this place while he's doing that i'm pretending to sort of drunkenly lean on the wall outside that door it's the cinnamon challenge i place my hand right on his shoulder i catch it grab him by the scruff of the shirt and start leading him back down the stairs what the fuck is wrong with you why are your eyes all bloodshot what's the matter with you is it this i rolled good yeah 19 that tastes terrible do i do more

all right here we go two this is so boring i'm going to get kiki some fucking elven wine come on and i yank him down the stairs this is so much fusaka what is jarett or anybody going to do with this i took three hits of this and it has done nothing i disappointedly drop the backpack in scanlan's lap and say here's your fucking cinnamon you idiot it's got to be a natural one it is hilarious how badly we all want this to be heroin and it's not i'm sorry to say that i am watching scanlan fascinated vex vax which of us yeah sure buddy if you really want to go get revenge i will get revenge with you but i think we should call it a loss 50 gold is a piddly thing is that a word no you are upset let me get you a drink you want me to go down and get you a drink i walk over to scanlan and i squat down and i start play-doh'ing his face in all different shapes pulling the cheeks out really wide pulling the nose up as-- if only i had scotch tape yeah and we need to fix scanlan before-- i've got my pinkies in the sides of scanlan's mouth aw i feel so bad i walk up behind him and i start doing like a scalp massage around the temples you'll be all right eat something okay enjoy that allspice that is sad to hear the bastards live you said and you would know about any dealings that whitestone would have that's a bit of a stretch grog or eat it hello there grandfather we are looking for a bit of help we've been told that your knowledge is great and we have some items that defy description one more time grandfather grymond trog it's a pleasure to meet you that's a very specific number

before they come anywhere near these shores step up grog show him the gloves we have three of them i misspoke we have four scanlan show him your blade probably overkill but i draw back the white that i'm wearing what of this armor can you tell me anything about it is that something that any of these would do espionage nail wraps i hate to wear out our welcome but you said you were spent is it possible your friend who scuttled off could have a look at my sister's tea set i was asking that yes you are really uptight about this well i can take us there do we want to be genuine and knock on the door i can't think that it's going to be useful to go sneaking in we got a full night's sleep right i feel like door-knocker what's your idea i don't think we should do that so that grog doesn't knock over a whole cart i think you and i should go yeah we're good at it i pick up scanlan like a football and walk off with my sister 25 and nobody's hiding 27 that was my suggestion but i thought we came here to watch for a bit i say to scanlan sitting on my shoulders i think bug this says five minutes of rat form scanlan can go all night long do you know why they call her that there are three of us running in after-- that is true but we don't know what is in here scanlan is still grappling with some sort of depression we either sit on our asses waiting for this woman or we go make shit
