yes i have two announcements one sam and i have returned to the podcasting scene and released a new episode of all work no play it's been an eight-month hiatus so that's out you find that on itunes and elsewhere but even bigger than that i wanted to announce the show's partnership with wyrmwood gaming we are now all using gorgeous custom-made wyrmwood boxes with character names etched in and all that they're gorgeous and if anyone heads over to wyrmwoodgamingcom and uses the coupon code critrole then you will get a discount on any purchases you make there from here into perpetuity-- that's not true at all as long as we're having a good time with wyrmwood so thank you wyrmwood for the boxes and everybody please go check them out critrole i want to lick mine and make love to it all night long this is the darkest ebony they have it's all good i'll take this you've got to swear i'm the dread pirate roberts and i will most likely kill you in the morning-- or myself because this is actually very sharp liam doesn't know how to use knives or swords at all how about that costume ladies and gentlemen he's a full-size action figure you say they not quite how i remember it i'm having a real hard time roleplaying right now i am not going to look at that table at all tonight all auditory for you three sorry i think we need to find a place to lay low not here not where we've been somewhere else i think we need to scope out another place yeah we'll go down to the tree and we'll make it look like no one's ever tunneled down there before (giggles) you know the situation is very dire i don't know why i'm laughing it's a nervous habit i'm sorry so percival spill your guts what the fuck is going on you didn't look surprised when that happened what the fuck is it what is it percival what is it well we're clearly not talking about a dream anymore we all saw it do you have any theories it matters now i don't understand we've killed with reason none of us debate that the briarwoods and their circle should be allowed to go on we all understand what they're capable of we all understand that they need to be removed but what we just saw goes beyond and you're telling us that this is going to continue after the briarwoods and their like are gone what are we to look forward to percival where are we going stretching a little thin right now percy i want to talk about a plan because our desires are in lockstep up to a point once we have gotten rid of the last of them i want to know what happens then percival and here's the thing there's a thing there it is right there here's the thing your chances of succeeding here alone are pretty fucking slim and if you want us all to work with you you can't go from door to door bringing wrath and ruin the way you just did or you won't have our assistance not all of us this is a city oppressed these people did not invite it upon themselves these people don't want to exchange one warlord for another we need to maybe dial it back a tick or two you think we're going to win them over by showing them how disgusting we are no i mean the civilians here of course but we're trying to win them over and if we're showing that we're ripping out their tongues and pulling their ears off and flaying their balls they're going to be just as scared of us as they are of the briarwoods yes i've a thought that at night obviously these streets are full of dead things tomorrow the briarwoods and the people that work for them are going to start pulling people out of their houses and telling them to look for us or anyone who's not from this city so i don't think that the beggar routine is going to work for much longer of course but if you want to talk to people i think we could probably get away with poking about first thing in the morning and that's it so we should probably get up early i mean i raised my hand before but that's all right i'll get some sleep while percival is sleeping i pull grog over and we look at him for a while and i say where do you think the smoke comes out of do you think it's the nostrils yeah that's right it could just be his pores you're right it's probably-- i wake up my sister there's fog or something what's going on do that thing again you can tell when stuff's around yes wyrmwood gaming check them out beautiful boxes 18 18 (sings) let's do this you're so intimidating in that costume well that hits but i'm going to use uncanny dodge yeah by half is the half nope (sings) it's my dice in a box marisha and be honest the karma will come back to you all right there is one vampire right in front of me right the one who hurt me but i'm looking past his head at the one next to grog the one that's got a blade down there on the map no the other one yeah i think i've got a pretty good shot at him i'm going to ignore the vampire in front of me and since grog is right up against that guy i'm going to sneak attack him and go (daggers flying) oh no first i'm going to go click with my heels and then i'm going to (daggers flying) it's all right it's a 19 the second is a 28 and the third is a 21 all three hit i don't remember okay so the first one is the sneak attack and that one gets-- oh i should be using the wyrmwood box eight plus 12 15 18 25 25 for the first one and for the second dagger that sinks into his head that is eight and for the third one that sinks into his fanged fucking face that is nine yeah actually i'm going to-- no nope i'm good it's so hard to roleplay tonight pull that shit out next weapon yeah that works what is the bonus for that hat go for the ear it's a one let's be clear that was the shitty plastic die not the wyrmwood box come on don't do that again you're my sister you're acting like you're botoxed it's the mustache travis taliesin and let me break the fourth wall just for a second to say that this game is totally fucked oh that's so ravenloft (laughter) no i'm not i'm going to hold for a turn there is no difference between our old home game and this right yeah i'm good now so the vampire is still in front of me right i give him a look like yeah go fuck yourself and then i keep throwing at the other guy who's with grog still right all right then i'll handle the guy up front i'm going to go for his guts i'm going to go low one two three right in his guts first attack hit way hits that's a 30 and the second attack is a 24 and the third attack is a 17 okay they do that's 11 for the first and eight for the second and eight for the third right in his vampire guts and the last thing i say is vampires ain't shit (laughter) nah so what so does scanlan's mustache this is our least serious episode ever we cannot wear costumes but once a year they're all still here they're taking hits real vampires oh my goodness it's the third one your mustache is almost down to your chin for a goatee but his singing skill makes it very bassy and full oh there is no gnome like our gnome oh my gods he just rolled a die here's what we're going to do i've got one silver piece right here i'm going to flip it it was a goatee a scant five hours ago now it is an errol flynn mustache thank you we'll discuss it at break i'm going to flip this coin because that's all we fucking got if it's a 20 we're gonna stay here if it's a one we're going to find another place it's still night though we've had a short rest we've got to get out of here they know we're here you're a badass as opposed to down here in the hole that's fine when you went down that cavern that one time that worked out really well so let's do what she says that's very open to interpretation back and to the left and bear farts hello my half-elven brothers (shushing noises) jeralt is speaking i haven't played that game but is your name solid snake the cube 17 i didn't suffer from this but permanently lowered health scanlan i think you and i going to go see how people are feeling in the town while everybody else looks for a new hidey-hole yeah i think you are but if it's first thing in the morning i don't think the briarwoods could have gotten to everybody yet so i think you and i could do our father-son act for like an hour fart the son and the vampires they're done-- father and son because you're little and i'm tall quickly though because even though we don't look like ourselves they know that there are strangers in town i have one same peasants yes sorry folks we're going to talk to a few people right kiddo we'll come to you yeah too long still so little expression on that face like vasquez (explosion noise) daddy daycare you and i we're going to go talk to people what was the name of the guy that grog de-tongued and kicked out the window sam and thanks i don't think it makes a difference i think there's no new people in this town but you guys are tunneling around looking for new digs right that's up to you i thought-- who cares what i thought she's not even here you're with me gavroche come on and i swat him as hard as i can in the back of the head the nina the pinta the santa maria it's like a ladder rung that you can put wherever you want and hang on it he's a mysterious motherfucker i'm dragging you along by the scruff of the ear shut up i'm going to look for anybody walking by is there anyone nearby i walk right up to him and i awkwardly put a hand on his chest and i make sure that i flip my pencil and spit as i talk and say i need a hard drink i need a hard drink right now where i spit at his feet and i pull scanlan by the ear come on you shit i'm following his directions and going there journey's end yeah empty so how many in here three all right i pull jimmy-john after me and sit down next to one of them shut up your mother's going to kill us both (sighs) two two here and a water for him i swat him in the back of the head for the bartender to see can't fucking earn a living in this land come up from a mile out of town been trying to grow fucking carrots for these fucking people can't earn a living something's got to change here i can't live i can't give them what they want i can't feed him what are we fucking supposed to do here the fuck are you talking about i take a huge drink of the mug in front of me (sighs) someone should run these fuckers out of town i take the mug that i have and i pour the rest of it out on this little one's head and say you speak when you're spoken to i start fake-weeping into my cup ow fuck (retches) i'm going to insight check patrick all right that's not that great that's a 17 and as he pulls me away and i slovenly turn after him i turn back for a second and i completely sober up pelor has returned walked out we act now we make a big stink in the house we're not going into how do you mean like a what you control the clouds but you can catch up through one of those little doorways it's a question-mark arrow it's no knocks against you he's going to catch up quickly meanwhile the twins are looking at our home sizing it up we're sizing up the other home i like it could we look at this house first what do i see i'm looking all over this house no guards nobody watching i want to go for a circle around 28 good that's pretty good what did you add oh because of pass without a trace oh 38 two humanoids are in the house there's a guard between the home and the warehouse thing you just described you do your thing yeah yeah i'll start you follow all right yes scanlan whatever you're going to do i want you to get ready to do it a what come on burt he gave you advantage roll again i'm going to run up behind the one guard and beat him in the back of the head with the back of my dagger this is a surprise attack oh that's good ooh that's not that good so that's 17 that hits all right and then the second attack which'll also have advantage is 23 okay so sneak attack yeah so here we go plus get them (mutters) 25 for the first attack or no 25 for the first attack-- that was it yeah so 50 all i want to do is gunk him like i do and i look over my sister's shoulder and say grog you want to play come on you want to play go for the door yeah because you've said nothing well that's not what i said i said do you want to play everybody's running at the door we saw front door we saw some sort of warehouse and a side window with two people going right let's go in the window there's windows around back i'm trying to get a better look and listen as i run closer to the windows still a dinosaur open the door (snores) so less dexterous than the video game here's a little secret for people who love video games when the heroes pull out a gun put a gun away pull out a sword put a sword away there's a guy on the performance capture set who just catches it and walks away hands it into your hand so all this they just go (pfft) and they don't put it anywhere they just let go of it
