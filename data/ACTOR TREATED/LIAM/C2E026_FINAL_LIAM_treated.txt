we're surrounded with people in white robes i don't know why a real job dad okay mrs willingham oh right sorry anyway i have checked your charts and you should be in a lot of pain right now really well you should get ready for a long labor this one could take up to 36 hours-- what that's medically impossible you didn't even push it was like travis was here send your emails i stand up and scan the area what is that that's a six plus something nine are their weapons here i am going to sit down and bring frumpkin out and pull out my book and begin to do what's needed to cast it again-- find familiar-- but i'm going to turn frumpkin into uh a peregrine falcon they're probably skinny dipping somewhere i rolled a six which turned into a nine i know i am sorry i will change you back as fast as i can i need you to look for the three that you do not see here the green one the blue one and the goth one go natural 20 oh shit there was a-- this way i come out of it so i don't trip on rocks there's a struggle this way and i lead the group back to this here is what i am wondering why we are still here yasha and jester and fjord they didn't know each other before a month ago if they were taken that means they came to our camp and took her possibly and even if they did not it's not like we were hiding you'd take the three beefiest of a group of strangers do you want my not-cat to go look first i send frumpkin to do a lazy circle this is your life hey ashly welcome the laura bailey bladder was right here where'd it go through the wire i whisper-- i put the wire away (laughter) (shouts) just make conversation (shouts) they have great sentimental value (shouts) no i'm good (calling) it's complicated frumpkin lands on nott's shoulder we are well traveled yeah she's all right ah i like that my name is caleb but you could still call me bush man well let's think about it yeah yeah i'm scooping up the haversack when you say powerful are you talking about ability or connections or both shit this is why maybe they took the beefy ones i'm not very good at it either and you are an exile you know we are some of us a self-deprecating lot we have some skill between the four of us but it would help a lot to know what kind of people-- not just assholes we are assholes-- what kind of assholes we are talking about are they part of a larger organization or are they off themselves it's just them i prefer iron fem shepard do we have an arrangement here a deal these three are of great value to us and they are our friends and we are better off with them and it is worth the trouble we cannot accomplish what we've come out here to do in the first place without them what you be the leader but do we have a deal yeah i think we ditch the cart they've got hours on us we need to make time and we can't carry their stuff without we leave the shield it's not a magical shield it's not special it's run of the mill life is more special ow what are you doing go faster without a spare horse dm you said we could put the shield on the side of a horse okay well then we shouldn't do that we should go as fast as we can right now we set it free or it's free or somebody gets a new horse pinch him off (laughter) which way are we going i said you were the leader i'm not a leader does it look like frumpkin could make it through that window and what hour is it in the afternoon i don't see anything in there i mean you want to raid an old house or keep going you want to cut for the day she's the local well that's what i was asking you described a window that was jagged glass ja but if my smallish falcon went in there is he going to get cut up going to get cut are there any books books nein (sighs) we're killing time but yes i do i take the ten minutes to take the book out of the holster and set it on the ground and while everyone just sits there in the dust i cast detect magic ten minutes wait wait yeah oh yeah i hear everything okay what-- dispel the spell what are we running from i keep looking over at you and thinking i'm on the jerry lewis telethon drei oh wow the suspense can i use my natural 20 now that time it's a three oh guests first yeah i go rummaging through my pack really quick and i pull out a licorice root and stick it into my mouth and bite onto and i start muttering to myself and i say pick up the pace and i cast haste on beauregard and then i will move as far as i can towards nott towards nott ja okay advantage on dex saves too yes get it right in the ball sack street fighter combo wow time travel too far i feel the wind and then shoot three magic missiles out of my hand at the thing that's a four and also (counting) six-- i've got to change this dice that is a ten total was ist los i will go crouch by nott i didn't make any noise i just sit down (singing) hello my baby does it have jester's shield on it it's suffering put it down she is extremely useful among other things yeah scared straight i have a potion i start to look to see what jester's got inside the haversack other than the dodecahedron and our tent she had a heroes' feast in there i think caleb comes up behind hold on here there's the dodecahedron made by gnomes i have a dagger here use mine i shoot out the globules of light to float around the corpse it's very bright super bright you can do this and i walk twenty feet back you're far more dexterous than i are you dexterous show us i'd say she earned one yeah short rest you said sorry was reading my book i'm sorry did we get any horses just enough to fit us all on condensed right i think we should continue to make time as well it's gone as they leave caleb scooches frumpkin on the head and says you know she always forgets about you but i do not off inside i think i will i will begin it by putting out the silver thread around the group individual because i can't decide better than my 16 how far away uh i would send one of two things one is our little friend here or-- or i lose the peregrine and go back to something else a little less noticeable and it's dark out now yeah (sighs) i would know if an owl-- owls can see in the dark yeah okay okay i'm going to change frumpkin again out of peregrine into an owl i will mark that off on my supplies i've got one more after this that i can do and uh-- no i mean i need incense but anyway-- yeah i send frumpkin tree to tree in that direction maybe 20 feet and wait a moment and then another 20 feet with disadvantage okay perception you said 14 knees to chest okay she is paying him no mind at the moment i whisper in fragments what i saw through frumpkin's eyes the whole time but i'm still looking and i can't hear anybody oh right i would be holding onto molly this is reminding me of stories that my mother told me when i was very young not good ones things to scare me into following the rules i come out of it and a woman or not quickly have to think here because everyone else is sleeping and that didn't look good for that little boy but then it doesn't really help us with what we are doing but then the child what to do i go back into frumpkin to see what's going on i swat at molly and say wake the others i'm not sure but i think there is a young child that's in danger there we seemed to care about the bird child maybe we care about this one i don't know we got to act right now she looked dead she did not look natural a short rest i thought we did back at the house i happily went i get to use arcane recovery in my head because of the conversation that was happening thank you matt i wanted to go with nott about 20 feet behind and cast mage armor as i go it is a big ten you did this last time you're not human you can't come back ooh that's craziness same i like it it feels like i am looking at the paper it's customizable i haven't customized mine yet always yes keg we are (yelling) we were going to camp back there but instead we are going to camp over there (yelling) at least it's just the five neins do you understand what i am saying do you speak is his ward awake i bring frumpkin-- without saying a word telepathically i have frumpkin come down in front of the child and do a little owl nonsensical shimmy dance on the ground just for ten seconds to catch his attention then have frumpkin flutter up and land on his head and gently find purchase and sit i smile mollymauk will take that only sometimes thank you both well dark business at hand they all know each other do you know a goblin named furgle burgle that is the best you ever did as we leave frumpkin's head does that crazy owl thing that goes 180 and flips around and just looks as-- we are well-rested now all of us know-- ooh i went vax all of us know what you already knew which is-- yes still hurts-- that these people are terrible and deserve no mercy what do you think oh you know if we can we're not altruistic by nature either but let's be clear we're going to eliminate the problem save our friends and if we can do something extra we do something extra when we can all right let's run these bastards down ja or a wizard who can read anything liam and i am so advantage minus five on both okay that's not good that's a one okay that means i got a seven at advantage minus five on both the rolls i rolled a nine and a one so hey if we do the one more hour it's constitution checks i'm sharp i should always do this same yes one more we push it one more hour fast equals a constitution check right natural 20 i don't want to hear it eight sweet this is my first what happens to me do i die on the spot that's my secret taliesin i'm always hangry eight hours and you said the eight hours was-- yeah there's a way to do that we could push it too i'm good okay five minute little fly-ahead i hold on to my horse and stop hearing everybody disadvantage it's terrible it's perception was that what i was doing five it's getting dark out here and i'm tired before i go to sleep i do the silver thread (hoot owl call) you played yourself i'll take this myself good frumpkin got-- i'm going to use my cat stats because i don't have owl stats handy oh okay good sam and eleven thirteen okay so sitting in the silence are any of these people awake that i can tell look at the lot of you look at these people i should go right now i don't know you at all look at this one he's like a walking rainbow what is this why are you with him it makes no sense he's a circus performer he's not going to help you this one you told everything to to try to get into a library you learned nothing on your gamble you failed you're stupid smart as you are you're stupid with this she could cave in everything this three that have been stolen yeah they're nice two of them one's weird one of them tried to kill you the other one she's adorable but-- stupid this one here what do you expect to do with her how is she going to help you do what you want to do she can watch your back-- i know don't worry you're fine she's as much a liability as anything else you know you're fucking mad when you're gesticulating this much you should just go you have told too much i am going to go it's time to go he sits there for a solid five minutes then two hours wait for everyone to wake up she can do it on the road you should do that arnold monologue from that documentary (schwarzenegger voice) you know when i am with my-- i am coming and then when i'm working out i am coming always bigger than average-sized man you mean well we're about to get into it yeah i'll tell you what i do is i dab my thumb into my belt for a bit of sweet oil and i rub it on my bottom lip and mutter an arcane word or two and say i suggest you tell us any details you've been holding back about these people so that we are fully prepared that is a suggestion spell no it was details that would help us in the situation you're compelled to say anything that's useful in what we're about to do with these people any other details that you've been holding back that would help us in this situation no magic the ones with the arcane ability look like what color is the half-elf's hair that is a pretty big matzo ball i take people at their word yeah lay low i plant my hand on nott's head and go into frumpkin's eyesight and send him up there advantage you say yeah owl rolls yeah 20 all but lorenzo it's good it's true shaved head the wind it's good sure this time he does sometimes i do lately this is our best chance because we don't want them to get to their destination because then they are surrounded by many friends yeah now is the time that is wicked no wait until they sleep we're going to follow at a distance and then when they bed down for the night we leave and then skirt around i like this well done nott well done of course you can this is why i say you shouldn't just hand it over just save it for the moment six better constitution than vax though one hour in 90 minutes i would recommend-- they will probably be traveling pretty close together and i could slow them down magically speaking if you were to bait them a bit and talk to them then if we pick a trigger point i could cast slow most of them some of them would make it through unscathed but-- what does that have to do with the dawn we have acid dispel magic how would that what yes i can but what does that have to do with the cart we may have a split second to-- you want to try to get these people out immediately that's what you're saying it was two carts you said i couldn't tell from the aerial view which one-- they're all hidden right that is a good giveaway though the best thing that i could do in that department is slow hopefully all of them down all of them if they are closely grouped if not i could hold one person we could but the way i would do that would be with a giant earthen cat paw which would seem out of the ordinary on a muddy road probably not very useful i am not going to destroy three horses in one shot i thought we talked about horses as well they come upon a tree and somebody-- they come upon a tree in the road and a woman that they despise now and that is not suspicious because i am not demanding anything but my counter proposal is that i walk 500 yards back along the road put the silver thread across the road so we know they are coming spend a few hours hiding ourselves at the tops of these hills waiting nobody is in the road we wait until they are just below us i cast slow on them and then we murder them well unless we hear a feasible plan for doing that first-- i say we kick them in the goolies as hard as we can from the beginning actually i mean that is a good idea could we spend an-- i'm going to go set my thread across the road could you make hiding places for all of us notti have seen both of you vanish so if you put in a little bit of time and elbow grease you can either find places on these two hills that are conducive to us hiding or create those situations with grass or something i don't know how to do it i'm going to tell frumpkin to go in the sky and watch and head up the road a ways to set that alarm if he were human sam as caleb comes back from setting the alarm spell tell me what you have worked out so far i set the alarm spell and i took a wee over that way that's great i think that we don't want to gild the lily that log is good-- --and it makes-- if you come to a road and there's trees along it your dander goes up you're on guard yeah i'm in favor of that you can stick a branch in there-- and nott's trap making skills for help i am going to be way ahead behind these bushes because what i'm going to contribute i can do from far away and i can be knocked down like that so i'm going to have to improvise if they can all be clumped together for the best but i'm going to wait and i'm going to call it in the moment if there's two together and not three i will go for two if all three are together great oh i thought they were coming from the other direction the horses will slow the people will slow and a row of carts though not a group it will make for a train which will not get them all within what i need maybe two of them they're still on a road they're still probably going to go well the risk of a straight line of them it is a 40-foot cube maybe it's dicey it's right on the cusp probably for two or three two is better than none slowed down that's great but they're still in a line that's awesome excuse me that is fucking wunderbar that is wunderbar if they were all clumped together but i'm going to give it a 50/50 chance of them being in a line that is true if they're in a train we wait for cart number two to be in that bottleneck and then i try to get the first two the third one's not going to go anywhere what we're losing is-- the more of these assholes who you used to be a part of are it's not just the carts it's them they can do less to us if i hit them but you know it's not perfect there's no perfect situation yeah oh that is a lot of fun ja on the first one thank you mr sheen correct no it won't ruin my books it's just i would only be able to use it this one time then it's gone do you have any paper yeah it would be gone either way (sighs) no i mean i do have a very near-perfect memory near-perfect yeah but there's no slow if there's invisibility oh but it's a scroll i'm popping out of my german accent if i cast a concentration spell and then i use a scroll does it drop the concentration check on-- i think slow is more beneficial than invisibility when they cross the finish line i've set a silver thread across the road and if they move through that-- anyone but us who walks through that line will set it off and i will hear no no no it's in here i wanted to do-- no i wanted to do more than that let's say 200 yards no i am in favor of slow over invisibility i want to kill them sorry to confirm step one is tree goes down on cart one if it's that way right slow happens you can get a sneak attack in if it's an ambush and everyone else is going to start whaling and that was a blonde pixie cut and a half-orc a bald half-orc sure i can dispel any magical stuff going on in the cages shortly after or improvise and switch to long range destruction ja the plan will fuck up i'm sure but we will scrap through or die rather than choose who we're going to attack in the moment i saw through my owl the half-orc with his hood down is a bald man i would say let's look for that one first that's liam not caleb everyone else was hooded so we don't know i would say then that whichever one reveals them first either half-orc or woman with a pixie cut whoever reveals themself first we'll say that is the one that we all target at the same time we focus our attention to one and kill them and they are out of the picture instead of splitting between two ja but if they don't reveal themselves first-- correct that's wise probably mollymauk up up it's totally whippets no every time it's magical and very special anytime caleb does it he sees all timelines but in the interest of brevity-- understood in advance you mean yes vax die yes 19 that was my trigger slow and i will target these four assholes right here i think i can get in one go probably 40-foot cube roll again miss the percy mega-initiative 14 ja vierzehn evil party evil party indeed i am molasses goes across my hand and i draw my hand down through the air and i focus on these four if i can it's a 40-foot cube putting this one in a corner up to six in a 40-foot cube all of them well you know fuck it let's also get this horse oh there's six of them oh wow yes yes never mind i didn't think we were getting all of those people good all of the humanoids half speed negative two to armor class no reactions and they can either do an action or a bonus action they can't do both they can attempt to cast a spell but-- your charisma sam your charisma nope if you attempt to cast a spell with a casting time of one action-- right read the cards people read the cards knew where i was my stealth was that shitty i'm going to die it's fine vorugal was the frost umbrasyl was black acid slowed oh he saved he's casting slash the best we're back to me i cast dispel magic on the cages or i could attack the person about to attack me that's what i would do i will use the glove of blasting to fire on the person attacking me the one on the hill yeah yeah three of those first one does not hit that is a 12 second is-- sorry 17 oh it was 16 on the last one does that hit thank you the third one definitely misses that's a two plus eight that's ten 4d6 not that great ten damage fire damage they have to make a constitution save oh they were casting an attack well i don't know what they were casting yeah they're fine i will lie down flat on my back shield it doesn't hit it's sam's raison d'être but you said everything's at disadvantage get the nerves out get the nervousness out that is huge i don't know that's your call that's why i go far away no i don't mind at all i rolled a 22 now you're mounted he's right there burned it burn that shit i'm going to hold my turn and cast a scorching ray at the sorcerer the moment they do anything first i will get up off of prone into a crouch the moment she does anything that depends on how you want to interpret that well i meant do anything-- i guess do anything to hurt us isn't one of them encased in ice you have destroyed the show yeah bad shit happens bad shit happens to mediocre people not with what we got
