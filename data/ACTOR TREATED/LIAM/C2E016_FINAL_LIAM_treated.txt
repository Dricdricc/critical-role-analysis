how on earth did you not put a growing pains reference in that they've just revealed the very dashing portrait of scanlan shorthalt today you want sherry or schnapps or what do you want my gosh you've got a lot going on these days does it have any legs the 11 herbs and spices are-- sechs 14 seeing how terrible everything is around me i stick a quivering hand into my pocket and pull out a little copper wire i learned how to do this from nott i cup it in my hands and i cast message to the thing i'm going to text you what i'm-- only it can hear me and i'm sending it to you while backing against the wall behind me i will send frumpkin skittering down by yasha's feet (porky pig stuttering) i didn't see any difference in it when i did what i did ja how close could i get to it if i wanted to walk straight at it right up to it could i get right behind-- no i'll get right up to it ja yeah okay i'm going to cast burning hands veered away so that it does not touch yasha it has to make a dexterity saving throw ja ja the creature is fine it's 3d6 halved did it make it oh no it did not make it it takes 11 points jester natural 20 can i see that last pot from where i am okay that is a 13 okay i will send a little firebolt off and try to strike it it's at disadvantage correct okay that's very bad also very bad that's a ten ja i will walk toward it to get closer as much as i can i should have done that first ja just a straight intelligence 15 the book said the soul is bound to the flesh be it in any form ice or ash but the ash in the pots was the will-o'-wisp i am going to start moving towards the middle towards yasha i don't have any healer's kit or anything i don't know how to do anything like that i'm going to hold my attack a fire bolt can i do that i am a wizard for the first time can i hold a fire bolt yeah when it appears we don't know that resistant to fire there's nothing else i can do from where i am i don't want to burn the room around us if i set it on fire someone will still have to pull it anyway it's not like it's going to disintegrate poofs out into a doughnut as a fire bolt goes (fwoosh) (laughter) i got it i send in two globules after her to see the antiqued goblin it takes the edge off hey nott how's it going in there it's a five feet by five you're in a tiny-- why don't you bring that thing out of there i feel like nott's head comes out of the hole going (rapid gasping) for fresh air i am stowing away the journal in there like a kangaroo pouch i would prefer to inspect it are we going to stay here for a little while we could sit down on the floor together and have a look also what i would recommend if we feel comfortable sitting down for a moment is to put all of our findings in the middle of the room and i can ritually see which of these things are magic most of these things we suspect but maybe there are some other things then i can tell what exactly they are i need some time also before nott even got out i'm stowing the journal away for a closer read oh would you like to add it to the pile i'm not really into smut that's a bit of a ruse i mean more than normal within reason well she was in a dark hole hey you know this is going to take a while so why don't we put it all down and i will get to work okay how much you care to drink is on you she's antiqued too she's covered in ash (spitting) pah pah i am well on my way i hope i have been doing this for a while so step one is detect magic on the pile to see what's what does it also help that i'm also within the-- oh no we took a short rest which is an hour-- okay good the sword is the one thing okay can i pick up this new book and leaf through it and try to see-- would you be ever so kind i would be very grateful i put my hand on top of yours thank you very much i begin the process of casting identify on the sword oh and the mantle what about the mantle was that in the pile the original goth okay this sword because i know you're all dying to know is very old it is a greatsword would i know the name of it by casting this this sword is called the magician's judge excuse me (heavy accent) the magicians chudge oh no i'm absorbing and i will tell you in a moment i need to make sense of it first it's a great sword and what this-- (as jester) it's pretty great when someone like yasha hits a baddie with this you can dispel any magical property that is present yeah or without attacking you can hold the sword up and do the same big woman this has your name all over it i think-- yeah you'll have to pick it up i can't even lift this thing yeah i assumed that immediately before the thing attacked probably siff's legs are all over you right now i don't know but it was worth it caleb is chewing on his finger and looking through the book i'm thinking of all the good things that i can do for our new collective it is the random old house first edition let me tell you this was a good find everyone yeah what do they mean you are correct terrible roleplay you know we could give him some of those rings ja definitely the art if we skimp he's going to think we're bigger assholes than we actually are you take my ring give her a ring i gave it a cursory glance i skimmed it that's a good point no we keep that sword this one with that sword we can put it in the haversack can't we i thought that thing was mary poppins' satchel it doesn't go all funny while we talk to the gentleman while we navigate that i could carry the thingy to make room for it yes and this sort of thing takes a lot of work from very specialized people clarification when caleb did detect magic did the circle in the center of the room glow at all or is it-- it's dead i will make a religion check 15 for caleb 15 why do you have such a queer look on your face for the crawling king you are talking about do you have a lot of knowledge for the gods and religions of the world the awe-inspiring one with the face is from a dream you had i would like to do an insight check on fjord while he tells us that story pretty good 20 whack well nott and i could tell you you know i think we give him the things of monetary value we are thinking long-term for this group working together this book and that blade are going to ensure a greater success and cohesion in the future then we are as one can we try to do it but go with the hilt downward see what happens what all is in that haversack that you have can we take out everything except for-- caleb starts looking at the do-- (shouting) jester i know you are but i am cutting through the noise can we not take everything out of that bag except for this new blade and the dodecahedron everything else comes out because the rest is pretty utility is it not yeah we can tie a rag around the end of the blade to keep it from piercing anything i pull off the new cloak that i got a handful of days ago we can wrap this around the blade so it will not pierce of course that will work the sledgehammer we leave it's a sledgehammer everything but the dodecahedron what if roll the sword up like a fruit roll-up wear my cloak if you want to cover it i hang out at the back of the group for a split second and hold out that wire that i used to cast that cantrip and look at the room and i look at the wire then i follow everybody it was broken what we would have done is face-planted on the stone floor can i say that as soon as i left this chamber i tagged along behind my new monk best friend and sent the globules in the air around us even though she has the goggles and i'm while walking trying to read every page of that journal and will continue to do so on the boats if we want to go back our two muscle sisters could get us up this current for sure yeah if we are doing that then i suggest camping in this chamber before going forward because we are all bloodied and battered you know i would know what time of day it is i don't think we should go we either go back the way we came or we camp before going forward i'm going to stay behind i am out laura and terrible idea as they float away out of earshot i say to my two friends here you know if need be the mighty drei also sounds very cool no frumpkin is scarfing around my neck right now find clarota again nipple rings in or out insight check (clarota voice) time is a circle (jester voice) you are like my little doll real difficult how long were they gone for i could probably read an average novel in over an hour so has this journal been read oh because it's in a different language oh yeah no because i used my magic thingy to get a slot back earlier in the day so no no i remember what i skimmed but i don't-- of what i skimmed i have to actually read it to remember it and i did not read this entire book i don't touch the book to my head and then i have it i have to eat the book oh what i would have done if they left and i'm tapped caleb would have used a ritual to cast comprehend languages yeah i am up to speed do you want to read it you are a reader fuck that kraken it's the same show that is not correct i was not hit in the final fight i made out better than usual yes okay i see where you are going well i am not much of a believer in old wives' tales but i do like trial and error so if you would like to do it again today-- as an experiment yes do we have any more flowers you may how do i look what is greek why don't you pull down your lower lip and show us what's going on in there fjord did you grow up with people who did not have tusks like you so you were different insight check (laughter) just a ten not great how quickly do they come back this is many years later though i can't imagine that any of us would even blink at tusks yeah well you know for many of us our early days are always with us i understand co-signed so cloak on your back sword on the cloak there is no we are going on we are going right through their territory we are a very convincing group i think we can talk our way through that you have your ways well the morning is getting on shall we hans and franz will you please muscle us up this stream it feels so weird still with stealth checks to only be able to add a one when i used to add 9000 still feels weird are we past those statues slowly by don't you have the heart of an ox we don't want to rock the boat here by all means do i see anything of note through frumpkin's eyes as we walk can i tell what's inside there come on frumpkin doesn't matter pretty bad yeah both bad real low five no you don't want to get pantsed we did not kill everything entirely there are some critters on the roof of the river passage nothing major you just want to have your eyes on the ceiling as you go through yes to be honest it looks like it was possibly looted some time long ago whatever has inhabited the place in recent years or in recent centuries has been removed give him the book yeah and we said that we'd give him the book so i'm a little confused i said no at the same time can she aid me i have very good charisma i'm disappointed that we don't have real bacon right now but less you need the protein help me remember dm did we have a way to get in contact with dolan what mantacles this is the first i am hearing of the manacles maybe pumat has a competitor in a town this big why don't we wait until we're back at the leaky tap before i look at these manacles you have i would if possible like to swing past dolan's house if that's okay yeah and before he died he gave me something that i think dolan would want to have ulog before ulog died this is surprising coming from me but i agree with that sentiment you are covered in dead person you come with me because you've spoken to him more than i have only a moment of your time i'm a little embarrassed that i did not remember this the other day but it was quite an evening that night when ulog was in that house he found something that i think you should have shortly before he expired he shoved it into my hand i pull out those papers that he found about the wife it's a little frayed he shoved it into my hand we are lucky that it did not burn up but take this please when it makes sense on his way it's entirely up to you now isn't it tschüß broken clock twice a day come on yeah marisha your theme with children continues marisha and passion pit on the third of fessuran i need money he said out of character (as sean connery) i cast hexblade what is the nature of the goods that you have if i take a look at this skein can i take a guess at what kind of illicit material i'm looking at yeah i have bad experience with fungus medicine you say that is a 13 yeah i don't have good association with that you take that back (distorted) how do you guys feel hey steve are we saying this is night one of a couple of days of piddling around yeah yeah i have shit to do as well party animals i judge you heavily this is an entire three day weekend pull it out no not as fun yeah she's got to walk ja i have just enough ink and paper to learn one spell in the big pile of spells that i have right now so i'm adding a low level one i am penniless aww ten games ago though well a couple of things so i need more ink and paper the kind to transcribe spells before i get to that and before they go off on their drug party yes before jester goes it has only been a short amount of time that i am thinking and i will be very careful with the bag i was going to ask if i could hold the haversack and its contents for a day so that i could better inspect and understand the thing that-- i understand that i don't want to keep the bag i want to have it before you go off to do i don't know maybe you're going on a tour or something aren't you about to go out with them you told me you were leaving well all right i would love to inspect our special package and try to understand it better if you want to be present for that-- i know you are going to drag me over the coals for this request and that is fine i would like the dungeon master to fast forward to the part where you tell me if you will allow me to inspect the contents of this haversack do you want to do this together on a different night maybe tomorrow night because you just told me you were about to go out with molly just inspect what's in the bag when she leaves i look to the mirror in my room and i'm like red-faced and i stare at myself like dead expression for a good 30 seconds (laughter) what are you back already no wait a second i'm talking to nott in this part of the day i'm really blushing how much disposable income do you have at the moment would you possibly loan me 200 gold i don't think i need that much i will give you the change thank you friend i will pay you back thank you for teaching me how to-- and i pull out the wire and back up 20 feet across the room whisper teaching me this spell you can reply to this message you know the thing about it for us is we can go-- no we can go back and forth over and over again just you and me it's endless for the other dummkopfs it's only they can say one thing back but you and i we can keep going i know i understand but for demonstration purposes well thank you i will go to mr sol's establishment (phone trilling) to pumat's to buy ink and paper thank you i buy 200 gold worth and i bring nott the 85 gold change i buy all that ink and paper and i spend the rest of that day learning a small handful of new spells which are in the rolodex now and then the next night-- ja hallo are you coming in come in it's open we are going to attempt to examine the football as it were you can remain if you like are you curious yourself to the best-- ooh that's a good idea you know to the best of my knowledge this is-- and it's limited-- this is a very powerful thing and we are taking a risk-- --but one that i think is worthwhile are you still game all right we put the lead box on the floor let's leave it in the lead box but we'll lift the lid it is a calculated risk and we are going to do this we are not going to take a lot of time yes the safe word is fjord so if shit goes pear-shaped and one of us says fjord get fjord truthfully i have no idea you game okay i am not coming on to you but will you hold my hand while we do this that way if we-- (laughter) i cannot even look at you-- i cannot believe i am doing this experiment with you let's not cover the camera and let's examine it together and if we go to the nine hells or something at least we'll be there together in theory we are going to look at this thing i don't know i am looking at it (whispers) yeah (long pause) do you know if it's achievable there's nothing about it that is sensible or familiar it's totally alien to me father and mother-- i hope i do not let you down it's a big paper let me read it i'm wide-eyed and not responding i'm literally trying to read this and failing because of my friends that's your right-- i literally still don't know what it does because everyone is talking constantly the dodecahedron of gray faintly glowing crystal is heavier than it appears this is peer pressure a set of handles are affixed to the sides and it undulates to the touch that's all you get if a hand is placed on the artifact and is concentrated on for one minute the bearer is granted a fragment of possibility a fragment lasts for eight hours or until used a fragment cannot be granted again until the next dawn after a creature with a fragment of possibility makes an attack roll ability check or saving throw they can expend their fragment to roll an additional d20 and choose which of the rolls is used for the attack roll ultimately after an attack roll is made against a creature they can expend their fragment of possibility to roll and additional d20 to see if the attacker hits it is like one luck that lasts for eight hours am i able to tell if that is correct any one of us one time it can only grant this gift once a day to one of us i absentmindedly babble about what i think this thing can do it's very incoherent what did i say what do you mean okay what that is a very common sentiment isn't it good to know that is true for both of you well you are in possession of it for the most part i said i wanted to have a look at it we can take turns with it we will decide by the way i shut the lead cover on the box let's put it back in that's not how that works i am sure yeah also with the knowledge that i have and everything that just happened am i aware-- the gray more that went inside me would i know does that limit this thing's ability to me or no well in the description dm you said this gray mote went into caleb not into them can anyone use this thing good all right just checking right it's like the little you know when you're learning lyrics for karaoke and the little thing bounces along yeah i think this is a very potent thing and we can use it to do a lot of good you know not in the heat of the moment to try to hit a gnoll in the face with something but when we are really trying to figure something out or do the unachievable that's a good hypothetical that was a lot of advice i mean it is no secret that i like these people so we are in good company this is working out you are you know you are capable-- oh dear i'm going to go to bed now definitely heard that awkward and weird and makes no sense but i will-- oh this is my room you have to go to your room goodnight this is the next morning i'm going to-- no you should hold onto this because you've got the haversack lederhosen wow
