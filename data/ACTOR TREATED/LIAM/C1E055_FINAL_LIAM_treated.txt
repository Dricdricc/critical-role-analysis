that didn't happen this is the exact icy steely demeanor that i depend on more about quantity than quality maybe just keep vamping keep vamping until the bard gets here you're busy you're busy just go in there i cannot feel the lower half of my body (laughter) 13 strength saving nine can't hear you i'm taking-- yeah go for it i'm taking the dragon sword and i am shoving it along the angle of the arrow that's coming in toward it to try to go parallel through and i'm sending it along that line natural 20 (cheering) this does not count as an attack on the creature the hole is this thick like a straw and the blade is this that's not piercing damage there's no piercing damage whatever you want yes i want it to be an attack i'm going to use one of my lucks i've got two left better i used one last time 12 plus strength which is low is 14 the dragon sword-- is the dragon sword plus anything guys i don't know that i have the-- plus one all right oh and i have to roll-- i'll just say i missed for my bonus action i'm going to slide the dagger up along the same line and try to widen that gap the last one was too which is why i just scrubbed it no and what did i just do though with the dragon sword did i widen the hole okay and i forgot one other thing i want to do-- i have movement too can i use my legs to push as hard as i can forward a foot or something i know with movement over difficult terrain it's halved and i'm in the most difficult terrain but if i use my movement could i shove and go like a foot towards the outside half a foot or anything pushing in using my legs to go-- so the dragon got very lucky and it went through like that and not like that why don't you bite it dude poisonous bite first turn i'm going to use the dragon blade to attack and slice downward and try to wedge that hole open a little bigger that hits well i don't know if it hits nine plus my strength for this sword right not dexterity i probably hit him before so that's a 25 yeah i know i got that written down thank you 16 and then this is a game rules thing grog's within five feet of this thing and i'm no longer at disadvantage or am i i'm not arguing i'm asking what's possible i'll use the dagger to hit am i at disadvantage with the dagger still then i miss and there's air queefing in and out of this slot (laughter) yes no i'm going to slide my body and try to stick head and dagger arm out of it and hang half in and half out if possible 13 (gasps for air) all about phrasing we're close to gatshadow already arrow range you're doing great de rolo come on keep your head in the game are we visible we're not like wonder woman inside the jet what about my hand hanging out i would like to use my movement if i can with the blade i used to go this way and i cut a big foot-long thing i want to try to use my movement to reverse the direction of the blade and stab inward my dagger hand's the one that's out i want to try to maneuver the sword around and stab inward and keep cutting bacon in here i want to attack the dragon but still from the inside with the hand that's inside then if i did this can i just continue to saw in the same direction and do an attack visual i don't know what i'm seeing then i'm going to attack at disadvantage with the dragon blade and then i'm going to stab with the dagger that's outside dragon blade on the inside rolled a 15 yeah dagger on the outside is 21 six i'd like take a chance to say here that when i went into this dragon i was lost and a wanderer as i am shat out its side i come forth a paladin of the raven queen i have multiclassed and leveled up and the last thing i'm thinking as i shoot out this hole in its side is if you have any wings to lend me now is the time hey i'm a brand new paladin lay on hands which is going to do fuck all for me but is that a bonus action an action okay i'm going to cast lay on hands on myself and i'm going throw my poison dagger at the dragon as i fall that's a 23 that is ten points of damage with poison on it it's a dc of 15 for poison i'm sure it makes it i'm thinking about my mother as i fall backward through space he said you can get to one of them so it's just a sophie's choice quick come up with a plan he got away no wait luck i have one last luck 21 i prefer raven-sized (singing) i came in like a wrecking ball welcome chris welcome it was very frightening i love you let me love you that's more civilized than what we were imagining i yank on vex's hand from down below and say pick me up put me on your shoulder i am tall i rolled a three so that's three hours we have to decide what to do he's gone back to his hole he's going to rest he's going to heal i like her too you never made it up to the cave entrance did you not all of them the longer we wait the harder it will be the broom and the two eagles at this point that's enough for a short rest for it he's not going to go back to full strength but he's going to go back up a bit we need to go now we need to go are you able to see a tree from a great distance not even by eyesight speed of the slowest it's still the best chance we have we have to kill it now kiki may i have my-- sorry (higher voice) may i have my cloak back thank you (flump whoosh) i don't know but i'm still putting it on half could rest at the top while the eagles fly back and the ones at the bottom could rest shifts of resting yeah eagles drop off they rest while the eagles return and the people at the bottom rest while the eagles are making the trip no that's worth it all of us up at the same time grog she's right it is your destiny what are you laughing at i'm sort of a halfling can i get on too see you in a bit sis bye keek we'll find out i'd like to re-attune to the cloak of displacement and the boots of haste are they spent for the day for anybody if i were to wear them could i get the juice or no they're done they would shrink to me i'm going to re-attune my keen dagger then for the moment so it's deathwalkers ward keen dagger cloak three items oh okay no i can do one i'd like to go stealth and i'd like to see-- is there one clear main entrance to this place yes so we're further down still we're not near the entrance from where i am i can tell that we need to climb around it if i look very hard do i see any little holes or cracks or anything above all right so that's why i cast pass without a trace on us what do you think do you think i should climb in that little hole there's a main entrance above but there's also a smaller little gap lower down he cannot fit in there natural 20 why i do declare i would just like to point out that my complete total is 45 yes it's mostly for your benefit natural 20 plus my 15 benefit plus pass without a trace poof (vanishing sound) marty mcfly's holding a photograph let me check out that hole on top you guys can watch me do it i'm little now it's a big hole it's quite big actually i'd like to climb up to it spider-sense tingling the whole time 14 i want to look through the remains i don't take that i take out the flametongue dagger and give myself some light is this a dead end does it look like it goes further in by the light of my dagger investigation all right 20 no wait-- yeah 20 it's a cave okay i tell my sister it's a dead end it's nothing coming my sister and i should lead the way you stick to grog will you grandma wait i don't get to dodge i skitter off ahead of the group she's bequeathing it to you in her will i'm already looking for traps looking for danger i'm not going to go in the entrance but i'm going to try to climb up and peer over the edge and look as carefully as i can 17 40 feet 50 feet scootching in yeah 24 do i need a further investigation check to discern their nature scanlan do you want to grab that big shale and yourself something there's rocks up here that look a little funky and i don't think they actually are rocks just come up a little bit slowly there are a couple of rocks up here that look a little funny to me don't step on me another time you know what it is hey dirty bard could you come up here all hands on deck no just they're not real a few steps back trickfoot's-- hey fuck it i'm going to take a good hard look at this rock i'm going to go ahead and i'm going to keep doing the same come on you big giant dummy i'll stealth ahead and look around a new stealth check okay well i still have pass without a trace right so i'm at 40 you people don't see shit they barely get in i'm just going to hold still for a second and listen do i hear anything 27 i'm going to quietly take-- i'm going to back up 15 feet (whispers) for everyone who's next to me and for those who are not it is in here it is awake and it is waiting for us pike don't move just coming running to go when shit goes down but don't move grog don't move yet i'm going to go back in for another look well yeah i'm not a barbarian i'm going to go along the edge closest to you and move back to where i stopped to listen and i'm going to go another ten feet in looking if i look back can i see my sister from where i am she can't see me either okay there's a pool of acid right by me yeah is there dim light here but you said that i can see a pool of liquid right is the surface of the liquid flat as far as i can see how far along that pool can i actually see if you had to do a cut-off point okay so it doesn't look like there's a big divot i'm going to creep along the wall towards that pillar i'll stop in that corner and then move towards you one does it give me a better view can i still hear the same thing what do i see if i look up there's no large outcrops that this thing could be sitting on i'm going to backtrack i'm going to find my sister and i'm still very little it's at the back of that cavern it's not in the pool of acid that's near the front and it's not just past that it keeps going back so if we're going to do this and we're all just going to throw ourselves into it and let the chips fall where they may the best thing that i can do right now is take it unawares hurt it for as much as i can-- i'm not kidding you i want to kill this thing this is the first stepping stone and i could potentially take it out catch it unawares before it vomits on all of you i want to do it and i just want to know that you're going to come in after and finish it if you need to i told you what i want to do i start off come back and tug (whispers) jenga i'm going back to where i was with pass without a trace 43 i'd like to go around the column and around the edge of the wall further along the wall that little rock-- yeah and just a little bit past it and then closer to you i listen 20 around the entire wall further past that pool of acid even further corner stab i'm going to call it i mean mostly i'm 14 i'll take it that means 19 fuck you jenga (laughter) because it's invisible is there no uncanny dodge displacer cloak nope just hits uncanny dodge oh you're right thank you halved to nine for this round i'm going to stay right here i'm going to hold my turn until one of my friends is on top of this thing and then i'm going to stab it not on it but against it attacking it melee attack 19 natural 20 and another natural 20 it's occupied with me with disadvantage but-- yeah okay nah 15 did i see where the ejection of acid came out from am i still at a disadvantage even though i saw right where that crap came out i'm going to throw two daggers at it i hope that trinket's near it but we'll see so at disadvantage bollocks that's 15 22 keen dagger it's 26 can i use my movement to go along the back edge of the cave as far as i can directly opposite from my family i thought that was his magic healing spot but i guessed wrong yeah that's vix trinket snack attack you can dash and get further away rogue bonus action hide dash disengage i hope he coughs his innards out the hole in his gut dragon hernia okay i'm going to dart out behind the pillar of stone there and i'm going to chuck a dagger at it 60 i'm a sharpshooter so there's no disadvantage then i'll move closer i mean i know how far i can throw a dagger so i want to get up close enough to be within range to throw a dagger where are you you're in the acid oh i'm going to go to my sister i'm going to drag her out and i'm going to pop the one healing potion i have down her gullet i'm going to pull her behind so we're both behind that pillar potion of greater healing fear this dragon is being violated in so many ways not like this playing medic with my sister how is this possible cancels out faerie fire and the golden butt for those of us on the outside do we see a bubble of darkness where key and the others-- he said he's bigger than the dark so we see his head coming out the twins still have advantage because it's got the faerie fire on it right you said everyone in it nobody's near it anymore right okay i would like to scrabble up behind it as close to its treasure pile as i can get and i'm going to throw shit no cancel that i'd like to run up its tail i'm going to hold my action until somebody gets up on this motherfucker and as soon as somebody gets close and catches his attention i'm going to stab into it i'm above it do i get advantage for that okay so good 29 24 and is the bonus action gone because of holding the action add one point to that it was the keen dagger i didn't add the damage add eight to that not one add eight to that sorry you could also run closer and do it it's close enough for scanlan do what you can he's about 40 or 50 feet or something don't land on me shot through the heart dex save yeah that-- oh displacer cloak did you do that at disadvantage that does hit i'll use uncanny dodge though this is in the same round so there's no more disadvantage sure and do i blow uncanny dodge now and is it we're blinded or we're blind where we are 25 can you believe it just walks in you finally have some hit points you'd have to lean over for that i'm not pygmied or anything i'm like a doll maybe this should wait till later i'm going to shake that off and then i'm going to do a once around the entire chamber and look around for any traps i can find especially around that pile up top but also i don't know that they'll be here but see if there's anything like what we saw in krieg's cave with the crystals in the wall little peeky stones 22 what about weaponry in that pile of shit i was first on the pile are there any weapons in there and no other blades it's also very lean times in westruun most of this gold should go back to westruun that's back in westruun if we take most of the gold that came from westruun we're a big pack of assholes probably another two hours i hand mine over from the one i gave vex maybe he has to give it to thordak in a dragon pyramid scheme can i help her out do you think we should just camp here for the night scanlan is there a hot springs in this mansion we need to bathe soak we need a good soak to get the stink off
