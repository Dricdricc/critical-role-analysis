scanlan's in traffic he's stuck he's really stuck these are dried apricots what's the landscape topography everything that's true were there-- you said there were buildings around all right okay stealthing away no 20 (retches) i should have rolled the one made out of meteorite but i used the jade one and it all went wrong and i'm saying (retches) good plan (vomiting noise) so helpful if he was here i know he's got a great plan on the 5 that is what he would want to do vax just backs back into the shadows hoping the giant forgets about him 27 yeah you guys are way far behind i just run up the thing's back i rolled 27 for that stealth so presumably i'm-- -- disappeared-ed-ed-ed yeah so i'd like to stab him in the back okay i miss horribly a one and a two no not yet it's too late if you had been here five minutes earlier you might have helped shape what happened appreciate it nice nice you're at 39 aw 47 checking the stats i tried to backstab him so i'm right behind he's gonna shit on me isn't he hello handsome i'm going to use the meteorite that's better 17 yes (retches) sorry yes no sorry i'm up you should come in close then i can fuck him up yeah so it's the same right up against him or five feet back same same if you move away he's gonna take a swing i'm not saying any of this i'm just thinking it furiously (sings) you got the touch you got the power okay i'm going to use that i want to make an acrobatics check i want to jump up on this guy's knee and then dagger-dagger right into his strange eye that he tried to mess with me the eye yeah so i want to jump up his body off his knee so what do i do acrobatics check first okay so four i'm going to use luck 19 for the second so that's 19 plus 13 so i'm pretty sure i succeed yes say that again all right meteorite die no good first one's no good second dagger that's good and that's also good identical so that is a 26 thank you meteorite die okay so this is 1d-- durdee durdeedoo okay that's a two plus six is eight oh this is a sneak attack yeah hey you're a nice guy eight is 12 and is 17 and 18 and 22 and is 26 eyeball i will disengage and move back which means that he can't take a swing i'm pretty sure i get that on top of that as a rogue hoo-hah but i'll stay there if you want i'm in no mood to argue with you tonight okay yeah i'll move back sure yeah that hits okay where he ate the lembas bread everybody all together now cleric and the sorcerer 13 five he smells slightly better than he did before yes you were tickling his nipples with your water the gnomes are like tent spikes holding him in place oh my god is the beholder attacking is it now look how little you look next to him you're so small yeah i'm going to go stealth and then this ring this is a wall right so going stealth is that a bonus action okay well i still want to do that so i'm going to try to scurry over the wall there and go stealth yeah it's part of the cunning actions all right okay so roll to stealth right come on meteorite die i'm using luck because that was terrible that was still terrible okay all right i'm not stealthed but i run over by-- oh five and a-- oh sorry it was so pitiful 16 and-- it is for me 16 and 18 all right i want to roll over the side of the wall and then just move along over by scanlan between scanlan and the giant and just hold my attack i can trigger that down the road right okay then i'm going to stab him in the knee all right i'll throw it in his face all right that's no good and then the bonus action is also no good well they're gone four and a five plus-- i didn't sleep at all last night 12 and ten sweet 19 when are you clever folk going to get in his head wow (whispers) rock him keyleth rock him that's very temporary while everybody's discussing vax is going to walk down to the center of the pit to take a peek at that hole there's a pair of pants hanging off his eye i'm going to see if i see anything more than just spikes down in the hole 24 i have a plain old 50-foot rope i'm going to try to tie it to something on the edge (whispers) percy could you give me a hand over here (whispers) there's something down in this hole do you think you could hold on to this tightly while i climb down all right it worked on you (whispers) grog there's a diamond up my butt vex'ahlia ask him what his name is yes tetanus yeah all right that's a 25 pull me up well i can't use this it's a javelin it's beautiful she doesn't really throw sharp pointy things this would be good for you big guy i'm still holding it tell me about it i spin it rotate it in my hand handle towards grog of spikes take the watch like we normally do i'll sit up with percy we need to find a frost giant first well we saw through keyleth's scrying somewhat care for some cold stone we've had a lot of success flying around right what if and i don't know who does what but what if one small group flew in with tiny in the form of a mouse and then-- with instructions and drop him and in mid-fall a cursed giant lands at the front door and if you're on the flying carpet dropping him you get out of there that's good too but he could go apeshit on us half the team gets into position on the top of that thing the other half splits off drops the giant the giant goes apeshit for like a minute right drawing help away from the beholder drawing attention down there we wait for a minute then start pouring acid and grog smashes it with his fucking forehead laura and can we recap on your-- you looked in using your magics and you saw-- tell us what she told us kima he means kima it's not one large mind right so you are randy quaid are we 100% certain there's no nooks or crannies or holes or anything we don't want to go have a look you're assuming we know everything there is to know about this structure about the city around it well i don't know how to tell you the things that you don't know yet because you don't know them take this guy he can go invisible we'll just take a peek united as one scanlan start tap dancing tune in for the beholder fight three weeks from today he's being true to himself crisis averted he's mending the cask there's your woobie you can sleep again i was just about to say does this look normal to you you know i've got a lot of flexibility back and it feels stronger but it doesn't look quite right i just want to be able to sneak better this is like the fourth time we've done this it's not nothing like a puppet show well we're moving pretty fast i say we go all around the rim of the city advantage you said i got a 14 what figures matt and and just to clarify the part where we saw all the illithid figures was on the opposite side right (voice breaks) so the-- (voice breaks) yes well i'm only 62 yeah the city is crawling with illithid but more on the northern edge not so much here on the side and it's a lot it's not a few it's a lot we need a distraction though that's the only thing i took away from what we saw yeah but they're going to take you over big guy here's what i think is better we take tiny transform him into a mouse we fly over just when we're over the right part of the city flick him in the mouse nuts and toss him off and then let him turn him back into tiny as he falls into a pile of illithid and keeps them busy we need to draw as much attention away from the beholder as possible the nut-flicking part and he could turn the thing on us pretty easily i'm willing to believe we're all open to an idea to get him out have you got one and also i don't understand we're talking about crashing the thing but aren't we risking at least risking dropping the upside-down pyramid onto the elder brain i still think we should drop tiny on top of the-- or at least near the main illithid encampment to keep them busy k'varn's eye will turn there for a moment yeah your plan is to lead the charge into k'varn's lair that's what you're saying do i have that correctly (laughter) let's go do the stupidest thing we've ever done who's throwing-- who's throwing him the way we always do it don't we don't the gnomes fly-- bird-style okay so percy vex vax on the flying carpet no we can't all fit this is what we always do you carry the gnomes-- how's he going to get from the top of the pyramid down in maybe he should hide here and live to tell our story scanlan and i flew over there 36 i thought you stayed back i saw it go home bats (laughter) he could be watching us for all we know can i just say i have no idea what's about to happen but it's been a great pleasure to walk beside each and every one of you no we want him to be weight (high-pitched) it's been an honor this is the suck well they're a question mark i am going to try very hard not to die i am clicking my boots of haste 17 all right i'm going to-- i'm hasted i'm going to throw three daggers down at him from here okay okay so for each attack too so where's my-- okay that misses-- well five that's a 16 21 okay and the last one i'm just going to roll it now is a 17 okay so the-- i'm hitting him with poison dagger yeah advantage well advantage on attack rolls on enemies who haven't taken a turn yet any hit on-- is a crit any hit on a surprise is a crit yep a poison dagger which gets three-- is nine plus poison with a dc of 15 yes he takes eight plus ten points of poison damage on top of the dagger damage every roll counts yes there's a d10 it's so quiet in here okay 24 fuck what you've been waiting for clarota 20 and a 15 are there ropes still going down okay i'm going to do something stupid i'm going to grab the rope i'm not going to rappel i'm going to grab about-- how high are we up 50 feet all right i'm going to use my bonus action to get down to 25 feet and i'm going to jump-- but i'm going to jump out in the hopes of swinging this way and swinging back towards k'varn that's what i want to-- pendulum at him yeah i want to jump out and go woo woo natural 20 (cheering) straight towards him three knives because i have friends right up against him this is a sneak attack okay okay fine that's fine it's fine it's fine okay great that's great that's 17 plus-- that's a 28 let's just go ahead and roll-- that's the to-hit so let's just go ahead and roll damage now so there's no plus-- i forget what's added for like my dexterity and what's the magic-- the keen-- oh it's two for the keen dagger so one plus five is six now here comes the sneak attack damage six plus-- there's nine 12 13 18 22 for the first oh and natural 20 is a crit sorry i'm vibrating right now okay so the second attack is a 19 plus-- 29 so that is a measly four plus five is nine and the last one we use jade and i shouldn't use the jade 'cause that didn't hit i don't think 14 okay all right i'm sitting on the beholder worth it okay with advantage 20 yeah i love you guys too much those zeroes look so good (high-pitched) what about the poison it was one-time disintegrate you could've been dead badass natural 20 that's all you gotta do all right i'm going to run-- i'm still hasted directly underneath the mind flayer and throw the daggers up yeah oh sorry thank you yes and here we go ten first attack is a 21 all right so okay so that one misses second one that's a 15 misses right and the second one come on man is a 20 okay that's a dagger into its butt three and there's no non-magical effect on me at the moment right 'cause i'm out of his vision so that's a nine just for damage okay come sit on me dude come on down it's able to-- i just don't know i'm not challenging it even under-- on its tushie oh i was going off that okay all right so what am i making at the-- advantage 18 like a hairnet i didn't see the second one 17 i've never looked so intensely at a little plastic toy full view of the eyeball like fuck you do you have a potion for a bonus action shove it in his mouth with what move out of the way move out of the cone past clarota maybe out-- you should lob a fireball vax is up i am and keyleth has already done her fastball special that couldn't happen again at the moment all right so dagger-dagger-dagger okay that's 26 to hit for the dagger hmm oh sure sure 26 i don't know if i'm in his cone or not if i'm not in his cone then that's a ten of damage the next is-- i'm going to use a luck point because i have one more and i get 20-- yes 25 okay which is ten of damage and the last dagger is a one so it just flies away evil god just two more hours we got this sure sure i'm not worried yes natural 20 jump (sings) with advantage still alive still alive 74 potion potion potion potion potion that's by your feet oh yeah yeah so beat it in the face punch the eyeball zip zap zop three more forms to go how many of you are going to have a hard day at work in the morning that seems a little one-sided (laughter) (illidan voice) you are not preared you stay up and watch livestream into the middle of the night (laughter)
