hi to peta by the way is that an eye of acomodo for my shirt yeah he talks just like this that's my butt sound the horns i'm not really very familiar with patrick rothfuss-- i'm willing to wait for it yeah she's trying to keep it on the down low but laura doesn't have any of her dice really she has three sets instead of the usual ten party what do you sense do you sense dragons i'd work on that if it's like luck it's a no how high in the air is it first gets 26 second is a 19 okay dagger dagger dagger 14 for the first and the second is eight that's it it's within 40 feet you said i am going to channel divinity and use a vow of-- oh i can't can i ditch the second attack we have no initiative so i don't know who's where am i close enough to go after grog i'm following grog to get his scraps this knife does the same fucking thing he's up on the wall triple disadvantage for the night may the odds be ever in your favor (laughter) we've never seen the picture at that size and it makes me want to goonies-style cut a hole in the mouth 22 how far is he from us at this point jeez how far away is that little rock right at the bottom of that platform that you've got vex on how far is that from me and how high is the wall okay do i see any wood or anything a barrel or anything besides stone sticking out i am going to hold everything until the rest of the party goes this round fire walk with me red yep i can't do anything now i have to wait until everyone's done give it to me i feel so brave (laughter) i stand a full inch taller now it's from the frogurt shop (laughter) monster calves do i have a go do i get to go question can i call out vex catch and softball-pitch whisper up to her sure 26 this should be pretty good this does involve me can i use my luck for her to re-roll that bamf and i would like to use my bonus action to cast lay on hands and give her four hit points that's it just four i get to choose how many and i'll use my movement to scooch my uncomfortable crotch onto this stick you ride all over the place (groans) cool would evasion work for this spell that's what i thought i just wanted to check i'm going to use my last luck oh i do and i can add it to that save right good oh then i'm 29 i rolled 11 off of that thanks for the limerick how close was it to us if it hit us can i do an attack of opportunity all right understand understand divine intervention ish we'll find out is the giant within 60 feet of me all right so i'm going to move up to the edge i'm going to use my bonus action to cast hunter's mark vengeance paladin yes level up and then i'm going to throw whisper at the back of her head and hope that it hits jeebus let's try that again that is-- i'm going to use-- mm yeah 22 all right okay so-- and i'm going to bamf there no i know and the damage is 12 plus psychic damage is eight 20 and then i want to use my movement even though i can't disengage-- oh no i-- thanks mattie 21 just one i can't wait i love you internet i love you so much and then even though i'm not using disengage i'm going to use my movement to back the fuck up into that doorway i'll use uncanny dodge so much fun guys i have 105 hit points i am swole thank you (grunting) here's one here's one use it echoing from in the gate you hear woo it's ten feet above your head fuck that shirt hold the hand cone to the shirt so handsome great for what oh awesome i love-- i know all about spells it's a one but i have luck so i'm going to roll again i have luck it's within the rules yeah concentration straight-- constitution straight 16 that was awesome you sound like you're an actual gnome (air horn sounds) (laughter) it was on them get him grog if i go four down diagonally towards the giant i'll be within ten feet yeah yeah i don't want to yeah i am going to use bonus action to cast vow of enmity against her with the feathers bristling in my armor and then i'm going to use the rest of my movement to back straight back towards the wall another two or three squares i think and i'm going to chuck-- well we're good we've got bigby's hand right in her private area but i'm now going to throw whisper at her back and i should have advantage because she's busy well and the vow either way it doesn't stack right that or bigby's so 26 to hit so four that's the dice before i add anything and then-- does psychic damage get damage it's a die i don't know i haven't done it all your dice okay no sorry ten and then don't message me internet ten 14 19 'cause i don't care 22 27 33 34 37 plus hunter's mark 38 plus my plus eight to the dagger is-- 42 and that's it i'm out of movement aren't i but the bonus action was for the vow of enmity i believe no no no yeah he's keeping you humble tonight did he blow on it like an nes cartridge matt and so in love grog is that an extra mace over there everybody to the trebuchet you're being punished for using that song who is that she just boromir'd your ass and stay down all right i want to a little mini curve and go two squares this way and on the way i want to throw as a bonus action throw my flametongue dagger at my sister yeah so here we go that hits that's a 29 so she takes a total of seven points of damage okay minus seven awesome points and then i want to walk up to the back of the giantess and stab her in the calf a natural 20 there are no numbers as high plus hunter's mark shit yeah i know did i-- yes i did i forgot just my straight-up bonus that doesn't get doubled that is 64 points of damage i want to to walk up and jab whisper into the back of her calf and then slide it up the back of her leg up the ass up the small of her back as high as i can reach probably around the tailbone i don't know because i stabbed you but at least you lost some hit points seven this is just balancing for the thordak fight it's all right what's it like looking at this shirt-mare all night hey my eyes are up here i will use evasion of course i didn't do too well i only got 14 14 half damage for me just killed a pit fiend if kima's next to him as a rogue does it cancel out and she gets advantage from her ally thanks slightly sad what gauche i'll take those take a look hermione check out the brain on vex that's a legacy we've all made awful faces and said stupid things oh man drop some mentos in there lizard-skinned man but you're so good with words do we want to ask him what he knows about the clasp's activity where's the beef but they might still be resisting i mean the question-- asking this shithead who still resists within the city will answer a lot of questions can you understand a word coming out of my mouth could be probably probably what about greyskull keep because there was a tunnel from greyskull keep into the city taliesin and two but i get plus two so it's actually four matt so spill his secrets are we done with him you guys can fill me in in a bit and i grab his collar and drag him outside with the rest of the bodies and start overseeing the burning of the bodies what of the elves did i hear correctly that syngorn has sent forces one day out we've an army close to emon we do have to talk to raishan though i think we should go to whitestone immediately talk to her and figure out if there's any news with her but be ready to move to the army from syngorn quickly it might be our best shot our only shot but we are out of time they rest up we go-- but the mansion can't travel i mean you just got used as a weapon you might want a shower well we said what we were gonna do we're gonna go to whitestone kiki set us up we're gonna talk to raishan we met them at booty they're totally celestial-- they have like angel blood (laughter) do you see all of this hey little guy grog dragon you're awfully quiet we need to act what do you advise you say we coachella needs capoeira classes (laughter) i just lie down across the entire table they don't stick to my armor somehow that's not nothing it connects that'll get us under the wall what about-- what about cashew what about shaun what about zahra yeah i'm sure he is but this the end of times shaun for what for keeping him alive or taking him yeah allura what do you want to do but you have faced him and that's invaluable i disagree you fought this fucking thing before you know him that is invaluable you have more experience than we do you're wiser than us coin toss experience experienceliam  ah sure (laughter) marisha marisha i don't know what would happen so gilmore gilmore well then it's covered then it's done unless you do what laura and marisha did and do the exact opposite after the vote right come on allura no that's just a throwback to what episode she's talking to her she's not trying to take her she's talking about something else vox machina smash cut to gilmore saying no fucking way you know gilmore won the popular vote (laughter) dude that city's probably like the nine circles of hell we're not just going to get there fast track to thordak this bullet-proof think-tank
