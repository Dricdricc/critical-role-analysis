sorry kit i refuse to applaud that i refuse also if you're watching this episode in july of 2019 you're welcome laserdisc you son of a bitch i would like to announce a small amount of progress for laura bailey who resisted the urge to keep a super cool d20 for herself which she wanted to do she gave it to me hopefully it stays in my bag except this is d&d so they're real penises ten gold a head i'm at a bar that's the way it goes i saw that you were eyeballing the room alles gut everything is good that is accurate white scales it is one of the languages of the country good name a question is there any rafters or any high place in the room behind these gentlemen for the moment i scootch frumpkin down to the floor and send him off towards behind these gentlemen to hang around under that spot for the moment nott i think you're too young to be watching this you should come sit with me over here no it's a bad idea you're too little for gambling use your skill come let us go sit over here i walked away from this one frumpkin climbs up into the rafters with a view of the gentleman's cards i would like to start looking at their cards through frumpkin's eyes (quietly) get ready to use your wire yeah that's a 21 okay tell our friend that mr mustache is sitting pretty and the young boy has schei√üe reverse that order please also i would like the curly fries yeah but that one had potential why don't instead we have something to drink and eat only i get to say schiet you have to say sheed what time of the evening do i know it to be ja okay yeah that's late it's not that late i thought you were going somewhere else for a second charter school lotteries are a bitch sorry i want to touch on something happening-- i'm not there we're not there so i want to touch on something that's happening at the same time but i will wait until you think it's a good moment yeah nott and caleb didn't go up they're busy would you like to learn something interesting sort of it's a little homework and a little bit magic trick this is where i keep my spells this is my book and this is the piece of luck that you helped me achieve in trostenwald over the months and years i gather the amount of magic tricks that i can do so in this book for instance there is a new spell that i do not even know how to use myself where i can make an invisible helper what is going to happen now i bought supplies for it-- i find a booth for us in the corner-- is i am going to move it from here into here and i thought you could help me would you like to do that okay so you can see-- i don't know what that means but this will take a little while here hold this i hand a quill to her hold that you can see the markings on this page it's intricate but you can do the first few strokes it needs to look like that it needs to go here i guide her hand a little bit to make sure that it doesn't smudge too much it's still workable good now i will fill in the details i spend the next-- they are probably gone for 15 minutes-- putting down the glyphs and the markings and begin the first 30 minutes of the two hours i need to spend copying this oh yeah sliding them over it's like latticework you have to do the smaller circle inside the larger each one's a little bit different we're really right in the middle of something frumpkin climbs up molly's back what are you doing with my cat go to the base-- look the circle goes inside the larger circle you know maybe we pick this up later how much do you need for what i'll give you two i hand them over hold on there's a bunch of people staring at fjord and beauregard why are we doing this i think it's like alcoholics anonymous or something does that name mean anything to caleb when you scroll your cursor over it though the descriptions are all in red i tell frumpkin to yowl between their legs i don't see it i'm not looking through it yeah i bamfed out of that probably two minutes before it finished so i didn't get the tail end but i got the meat he's not sticky with maple syrup he's lying maybe not that but quite frankly those people are reckless telling you what they told you the authorities don't delineate between the real mccoy and the passersby just like that man's story the dwarf i'm going to turn in i have a little bit more homework to do before the end of the night good night thank you good night i am just finishing up the spell unseen servant before i go to bed so that i will know it in the morning yes yes how do you get money from your mom oh you didn't come downstairs okay is claudia down in this room at the moment

mouth this is deep texan i don't know-- listen accents are not my strong suit would you please just stop talking to the town crier thank you i'm trying to drag her back yeah back towards the group

a square you say yeah well i am no super spy but i would like to just look at the area and see what i see in the nature of security other than these obvious robed figures and you said everyone going in and out was being escorted by one of these individuals if i see one or two people going in or out what do they look like same fancy type fancier than me yeah okay that's a beautiful building
