some of that will probably be finding its way in obviously we love rat queens i just tweeted out links to the store from the @criticalrole twitter handle you are now homer simpson in hell with donuts

off the rails again yes he's in mr mom he's in mr mom this guy right here terrible teeth how close together are the bars to this cell four inches well no i'm not saying for you not to but would i be able to comfortably throw through yeah all right i'm not telling you not to passive-aggressive much and just as he finishes talking i throw a dagger a foot away from her head in the wall all right i come out of the shadows i pull out a pick and i walk up to the gate and i say he's a very good shot she's a very good shot this guy i've watched turn things into the jelly of the month so i would tread very carefully she's a nervous laugher (laughter) all right i'm going to use luck it's not that bad that's a 20 yeah because of my-- skadoosh wait one sec this never happens (laughter) shut up we're still very tough (laughter) kill him let's go parading through the castle i just want to see if i sense anything around 23 perception yeah i'm following my sister in doing the buddy cop thing so close before my sister leaves i grab her by the arm and say listen to me-- (creaking) i walk out ahead of her (whispering) goodbye pike i watched him do that and i shrug and i reach into my pack and i throw 30 more of them i lean my head in and say the goliath could turn your head into paste now if you like see you later i go stealth 20 no 23 i'm off sitting in the shadows but i say percival we need to cut off the head i start running towards the direction that was described as i'm moving by the way it's minor but i take out clarota's (sniffs groans) metallic cap and put it on and i also whip out this other cloak that i've been looking at and whip it around you're not here and now continue on yes all right excellent it's fine there's two things moving forward that is 22 do i need to stealth again or am i already stealthed yeah it was like 23 before so i'm going to move toward that sound carefully okay i'm sticking my ear to the door and i'm going to listen for a full minute to see what i hear i want to gently try the door handle i want to push it like one inch in and try to peek in i back up about five steps and very quietly say jenga (laughter) yeah what am i looking at right but he's behind her a bit right well i recently added the sharpshooter feat so three-quarter and half cover means nothing to me so i'm going to aim for his eye that's peeking out the side all three are going right in his eye so here's the first the first is 24 okay the second is 26 as you can tell i've been screaming monster sounds my voice is a little ragged 26 on the second and 16 on the third the first it's three plus seven is ten plus 14 20 26 29 33 39 that's the first one and then the second one does four plus six is ten oh but it's surprise so the first one is doubled because it's automatically a crit well it was 39 so now it's 60 78 for the first one ten for the second all right i'm going to do luck yeah that's a 22 i am running at him and stabbing the shit out of him i'll use luck again yeah that's 17 for constitution saving throw am i able to use evasion for that so if i succeed i take no damage i'm going into his guts so first attack is a 25 second attack is a 20 and the third attack is a 26 one two three oh and i'm going to turn the poison on for the poison dagger which i'm going to use for the second well it just drips so nine for the first eight for the second plus the poison is-- shit i didn't copy it down here i think it's 1d12 let's say it's 1d12 because i can't remember if anyone wants to correct me they can five points of poison added to the five is 13 and then the last dagger is nine hello that's it i'm out we're six seconds in taliesin wisdom which i have advantage that is a 20 oh attack him yeah it's a 22 eight no no yeah but i'll use uncanny dodge yeah so half that or all of that half that okay so seven that hits yeah all right i don't remember it was early 20s i'm vax oh you're from california i have one healing potion left and i'm going to take it and stick it into this girl's mouth and empty it and maybe drip a little on her neck as well it's 2d4 yeah regular it's the lowest of the rung moderate i think it's called moderate so four six and then i want to step in front of her between her and that one and then stab the one so is that the bonus action or is that the action action okay by the way i'm realizing i didn't click my boots so i did one two three before and the third one missed so luckily that worked out but i'm not clicking those so i just step between them and that's all i can do yeah no i mean between her and the closest one to her i was hoping to stand in front of her yeah like that welcome to the party forearms go (explosion noises) (laughter) mr anderson come on baby one more time why advantage i'm just curious give it to me but what's the advantage from because they're in flanking got it i'm going to use disengage and i'm going to hop over cassandra towards anders and stab him in the other eye first attack is 21 second attack is 17 okay ten on the first ten on the second so question i asked if i could hit the eye did i hit the eye okay and i'm squared off right in front of him yeah i am on my feet but i am swaying back and forth i'm bleeding out my mouth do i get an attack a reaction attack no i don't have that that hits i'm down that's it and i-- there wasn't even any rolls for that right yeah and just to understand the whole breakdown but where do the three rolls come in oh if nobody hits got it got it acrobatics that's good it was amazing i'll never forget it how close are the suits of armor to me i can't tell right next to me and am i still prone so how much movement does it take to-- half my movement no i'm going to get up and i'm going to use disengage yeah and i'm going to skip back into the corner and at this point i can throw one dagger at that suit of armor so i'm going to do that that is 19 i have no voice left that is an 11 classic rage we call it you're scanlan shorthalt roll two d8s (clicks his teeth together) good to know i'm just going to walk as far as i can so 30 feet am i within 40 feet then i just stand all right yeah i'm going to move around that table and get by scanlan stand right next to him
