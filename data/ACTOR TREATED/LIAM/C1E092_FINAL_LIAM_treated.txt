no i have one last announcement i would like to announce that my father is hiding six feet away from me over there from my skype window he rolled very high in his stealth and while he may not understand what my career is he believes that i have one (laughter) lady demon with pit fiend well how far are we talking about me in me why all right it's the first i'm hearing about it trust me well do you think that's because of the raven queen or is it because of the choice of appearance i picked i mean we've met an albino tiefling before it didn't seem like that outlandish a choice not that i noticed no this is just an extra wrinkle into a larger problem so what's the move now yeah it's got yes-bait right in we saw an imp back in krieg's house did it look like that the little bastard in the library at krieg's house no oh that's right that's right that's right the slaying right the slaying was in the basement but the imp was in a library upstairs-- -- in our house and he was just a little prick what's the one thing that's older i caught it (laughter) vex you're being awfully quiet what do you think we should do right now (laughter) i mean i don't know what the deal is with the people who are interested in me i can't tell if one's better or worse but we're just going to go waltz out into town and see what happens is that the idea kiki the prison that you saw did you get an idea for how big it is the prison that we need to break into or get arrested and pulled into-- well well hold on i've got one more spitball idea vex that gate stone that we've used so many times does that only work on the material plane does it work-- right would it take us off this plane though or no so that's a dead end all right while you were standing two feet away yeah i mean also if we want to get y'know pinched and put into this prison what are the chances that we-- if we start shit here are we just going to get killed in the streets or dragged off it doesn't seem very solid to me but i don't have any other idea jeez tary you've gone straight gangsta in so little time i mean i really don't see the harm in spending another day here and getting the lay of the land what is doty the center that breaks the tie come on trinket do it i mean she's full mystique she can pretty much do it all at this point i just want to update my iphone jesus so like we went in to buy a car and he's also offering us a condo and land in florida at the same time is that about it one of our souls or all our souls oh that's not so bad tell me-- how much time 25 minutes what can we do in 25 minutes we could fast-talk a couple of people were there any last little bit of hotis grit or funk in my belly button where he shanked me no hotis i mean he had knives but that's the only thing i remember yeah i mean he was just a-- like a cat baby wrapped in bacon when we saw him wode you can call me wode wode wode and wade this is insulting skip the small stuff what have you got that's it now you have our attention what can you tell us about that tary is that thing working right now okay before we leave i want to hang back just for a sec and hey slenderman you seem a nervous type you keep to yourself do you where would you not go to stay out from under the noses of your betters you hide in your shop where do you avoid so you don't get stepped on thanks same 30 so the man on top has cast a wide net over this city there's no way we're unseen yeah that's a good idea thanks wade did you zero in i'm going to accompany grog yeah you know i'm going to watch-- you go first and i put my hand on his arm and say let's just see how you do and i don't take my hand off hey you all right you feeling all right what's the aftertaste like huh he legitimately seems fine he's all right he's not like-- veins aren't popping out nothing amiss all right yeah i grab a small just a small piece and put it in my mouth and i spit it out immediately immediately yeah hah yeah let's go back up yeah we're kind of eatin' it in here i also think freddie that you're more capable of resisting temptation as you say sorry yrat and besides you have us around you friend i mean yrat we're still easing you in freddie has a little more experience than you and i think that we can put our faith in that with a red pen fred get that sign it i push yrat back away from freddie you're here enjoy the ride freddie has this thank you but he was extremely frightening 16 that's like super nintendo lingo can i have half a boar meat and he's doing that unfortunately you're going to introduce us to your little friend there i

share some of my 37 with percy do the rest of us see this by the way i'm going to quietly follow behind the imps oh never mind can i trail this thing i got a 46 on stealth can i-- it looks like a
