grand scheme of things keep your mind on honey all right peddy las vegas you're the best at what you do bud but hold on the big bears are talking business you seem like a hard motherfucker to me once we get the honey i get the sense that you've got ties to these people what say you run free with us we could hit vasselheim we could get all the fucking honey of every temple in that city the good stuff after this i like this guy waffle i'm all right i'm feeling pretty in control so let those in need scoop the honey first you know how you can tell a panda bear is a vegan it never fucking stops telling you about it no vegas we do bee-90x he talks a lot of sense come on we've got to keep our eyes on the prize we've got to get to this inn you got a scent on it waffle snake snake i failed big

outskirts of kraghammer i had to talk you out of that tree took me three fucking days do you have yourself in control moderation moderation i'm going to run out and help him i'm going to jump the other kid i failed hard son of a bitch do i have a kid on my back by the way i trip one of them as they run run you stubborn prick you (manic laughter) kid how would you like to be an official bear bandit (bear sounds) this kid i like this kid no you had your fun for the day all right i remember this one time in las vegas all right you got the smell of honey in your nose and we're going to the sunkist inn we know the head of security is up a side stairway what the fuck do we do with that how close are we to this tavern waffle what does your nose tell you is it like three glens or five two glens over okay well let's get close i want your nose and my nose i have a pretty good nose the best noses you'd be surprised we get outside that tavern and try to figure out where in that building that honey is it's probably in the tavern probably in the basement of the tavern probably in the back in the larder-- but let's check it out come on some bad breaking news this just in laura and travis actually tripped and fell into a giant vat of tim tams in australia and were smothered to death there was no coffee nearby our miniature superman capes this could be yours trinket forever and ever and always hold up i take a whiz on the wheels to silence them i do it yeah how's it sound now the people do that here is there a picture of the sun on the sign this is it peddy peddy i love you but this is not your natural environment even you're not even a bear that's from these parts you're the strongest bear in the group we love you we need you but come on let's take it one bear paw at a time all right listen when we need you to crush somebody's skulls who are we going to ask this guy no you only you we don't insult your integrity what are we animals all right cool your jets johnny cash let's case this joint okay waffle where's the honey smell coming from in this place the last five years of video games have prepared me for this moment point of order excuse me bm bm bear master bee master take your pick can you please paint a picture of the outside of this building for us humble bears where we did our expert plan yeah okay what about a side entrance to the security guard i didn't smell that i wasn't there all right all right this is good you're telling me that the honey is not right through the main doors of the tavern they've probably got some dipshit upstairs guarding it around the back that's good this works in our favor we can see the stairway up to security guards i've got an idea brewing let's get a closer look fail brian and who the fuck is that may be too good to be true we go in there-- people right they're tricky they've got brains and stuff their intelligence is at least eight or higher if we just go in there it could fucking blow up in our faces maybe that's what we do maybe we have no other option here's what i'm thinking-- that's going to blow up the honey though you can't eat burned honey like that it's not your fault you're vegan you have very little experience with honey yes the honey will burn i'm not saying there's anything wrong with it i'm just saying it's real stupid okay what's above the door there are giant doors on the ground floor right there's no stairs up or nothing no i don't i want to understand what i'm looking at is it brick stone the building is more than one floor is it possible for a honey badger to climb up the side of this building this is what i'm thinking and we could rush in there it wouldn't be the first time we've done that waffle but here's what i'm thinking one of us gets up higher than the door and waits and you trinket you speak people pretty good you could fool people into thinking you're a human so we send somebody above the door you knock on it draw them out invite them into a conversation and when they start talking bam honey badger on their fucking head you're practically dead 27 don't eat the honey rub it into your flesh hey buddy have some honey you've earned it i need him to find his mojo again let him have some honey we're going to be swimming in honey any minute now this is a foster badger (laughter) liam liam what are you doing up there great the plan is you've got to
