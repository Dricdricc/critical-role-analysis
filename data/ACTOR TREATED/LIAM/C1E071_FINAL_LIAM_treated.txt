put it on oh my god it looks just like tom cruise's oh my goodness that's what's inside the black spinning marble underneath whitestone we've got to slow you down or loot crate is going to poach you for ads florida yes i am continuing to be doctor strange in various marvel animated things and on digital hd they've got a new animated feature called marvel's hulk where monsters dwell and i am still the sorcerer supreme where i say things like eye of tamagotchi and sphere of esperanto and other such spells check it out are you can you say who you are who are you my name was in a press release laura will play some confident kickass someone or other like you do literally just got back it could no but we don't know if she has or not they've got their necks on the line i know they're not to be trusted but they're in a precarious position as well i've said that and he's ignored me so you don't get to say shit jeez we're all about to die tomorrow or the day after also when we were there we weren't allowed to bring any weapons in so you're going to have to dump-- yeah don't bring your best i'll take it i'm not going to use it i don't know how barely woo-hoo scanlan feels the same way don't you scanlan i'll go with you if kiki wants to turn me into a crow or a fly or something i'll stay back and watch something white yeah but then if you guys get fucked i'm dead as well so it'll just be like every day all right yeah yeah can you make me an albino crow a little bit this isn't percy's but (caws) (laughter) (hacking spit) as they're leaving not wanting to get left out i fly down from the air and land in my sister's hair and like a cat (growls) into the top of her head five or seven or 12 times (caws) big bonus speaking of which hold still there's a little bit of bird shit right there sorry bye a minute passes this is so great now we can all die together we're all about to lie down for a three-hour nap what are you talking about jeepers you all right you look white as a ghost the door is easy to see wake up and it's two in the afternoon all right yeah we could get piled on also when shit goes down we don't want to repeat the mistakes of the past a) we don't want to teleport inside the dragon's belly clearly b) we don't all want to be all grouped together i'm eating one of these magic candies yes there's chicken we want to spread out so we're not all blasted at the same time separately though so you can hit from different angles cubby-holes up high for anyone who can take to the air down low for anyone who can't and as long as we're not synchronized swimming in mist form and spread out then it should be fine while they're debating i pull whisper out and i chuck it into a wall and teleport to it i pulled it out of the blink-back belt it didn't go into my belt i went into the wall and i'm holding it still i was a shadow for half a second and i traveled with the blade i am fucking nightcrawler holy shit and i throw it again across the other side okay sure that's 27 aw suck it haters this is the coolest dagger i've ever had i throw it right next to his head and i don't go anywhere 24 does it go to my belt we can't all be all things grog you are the strongest thing on the planet you are going to take vorugal all by yourself-- you shut the fuck up you trouble-maker you bust my balls on a daily basis what is that about what is that about what have i ever done but support you throw my dagger at the ceiling travel with it can i land on my sister i rolled a 27 quit starting with me 30 she beat me worth it (groans) i like how excited you are about this but we're not in the middle of a fight hopefully the animals kiki save it for a rainy day yeah we probably all will be dead tomorrow but it's a really cool idea i didn't follow that either we should do something this is the quietest you've ever been natural 20 it's east so from vorugal it's an earthquake the trees fell down keyleth your spells are too powerful he's been carving it this week curved away we just traveled about a half-mile wind fingers for vorugal check for critters vax flies around them weather forecast is not a bad idea where's the closest erewhon aside from vorugal not near us right now no the ice is only a foot thick coating what is normally a temperate region but it's one spot no because we can use your mansion and when the time is right we can all scatter in different directions quickly many of us can fly i would rather have these cubby-holes as well but it's too risky and it's too risky to let you go running your little ass off around and get that dragon to eat you in one bite you're overruled yeah there are no elves here my mother was a human do you want to go right now those are some birds ashley's got this away from us we're east yeah half-bubbles almost spit some lyrics girl is there any point to having you sharpshoot from behind that wall down below if we're fighting i'm not bound by shit man i can be anywhere well maybe yeah we kind of have a plan but fucking dragons what's your style yeah told you it was complicated yeah the only one that's here scanlan what are you going to do you going to pop this thing out and then hop in the mansion that's true if the mansion door is open and hidden behind that outcropping of rock there you leave the door open but behind it keyleth could take to the sky i could find somewhere low and be hidden i can dart inside i can be inside in a second snack yeah we should wake up before sunlight also we've no fucking idea where raishan is or what she's going to do if anything it's me i'm the last one i had no idea it's half of us laura jeez 15 worst-case scenario we'll pull back towards the mansion if she starts whaling on us you can get all 19s you have to do it right because you're the one releasing this thing and if you're doing it does it take any more mojo to do it to all of us or just yourself it can't hurt to do it to all of us for larkin i mean if we trust tooma to hold up her part of the bargain that dragon is coming here i'm going to hide behind the stone that's in the bottom end of the screen i'm looking at nope opposite side nope opposite wall sorry behind it and i think i already said it but the deathwalker's ward is set to cold natural 20 i'm going to go meditate on disguised dwarves goodbye with stuart smalley oh sam (groans) bamf to the door and go in make all the action figure sounds matt natural 20 on my stealth how high is he can i attack him right now can i attack him right now vorugal 60 feet i'm sharpshooter he's 60 feet away from me pop out the wings fly within 40 feet of him throw whisper at his ass that's what i'm doing assassin do i need to roll for stealth though so finally this is advantage and an automatic critical hit assassin trait all right i rolled a 28 this is whisper i'm using whisper i'm going to cast divine smite on the attack as well here we go two hold on no so all the dice first two plus the psychic damage which is 1d8 nine plus the divine smite which is 15 yeah here comes the sneak attack damage (counting) 38 plus my modifier which is 46 no we double the dice first so 38 times two 76 plus eight is 84 oh i went with the blade i'm hasted that's action number one action number two is to throw whisper down toward the trees closest to you dm and bamf there and use my bonus action to hide i'll hit the ground right i'm going to push off him then yeah i know that what did i use i used 40 feet of movement okay i don't know how much i have left if i'm hasted i would have 120 total but that's halved so 20 feet because you said rough terrain but i'm in the air so ten feet that's all right i'm going to keep moving away i'm going to use all my movement to get away from him and go away from his butt i should have a bonus action that i can use the rest of my movement plus dash i have advantage on dexterity saving throws that hits okay can i uncanny dodge this is this melee which is halved because of my armor so 26 down to 13 and seven 20 total okay so i'm down to 95 i want to use bonus action to dash i don't know if that gets me 60 feet away flying it's 120 hasted so 60 feet halved yes yes sir okay so it's an 11 well you guys saw it people inside can't hear me hey b-t-dubs i've just learned that whisper can only bamf me once per round right to stick within 60 feet got it don't roll you get advantage right oh jeepers we're going to die oh i am i would like to throw whisper to the rock i was initially hiding behind and bamf there yeah sure that's 25 i would like to use my bonus action to hide behind that rock that is a 25 can i hold my last action i'm going to stay put stay hidden i'd like to think of you driving and cutting someone off on the 101 and going plus five necro hi could i use evasion for this all right i'm going to use luck first luck of the day all right 13 big grog wait i'm sorry yenk knew where i was did the dragon know where i was too holy shit yeah i'm going to take to the air holy shit i'm going to fly within 60 feet of vorugal 55 feet away all right uncanny dodge okay so how far did i just go 55 feet i can go 120 in one action so that's my movement halved but 120 so that's my movement total i'm going to throw whisper in his face i'm not going to bamf there i'm just going to throw the dagger vorugal's face that's halfsies so i'm going to roll it again that's way better that is a 32 one that is 12 plus the psychic damage i don't think so not since waking up 12 plus two is 14 and i'm going to cast divine smite-- no i'm not no just 14 of damage so that's movement action my next action i'm going to use to fly under him halfway between percival and the gang and land on the wall yeah now that wall is higher up than it looks so i'm really flying straight right yes and then for a bonus action my last spell slot i'm going to cast shield of faith on my fucking self for a plus two to ac action figure is down get that epic loot drop what where did that dwarf come from did you hire more mercenaries when are they showing up hey i'll own it it's fine it's been a long week all the trees are down rolled two dice hold for him to drop oh sad grog can you yank his shit down oh jeez really okay so i'm right there am i within 60 feet i'm going to fly 20 feet forward through the storm toward him yeah dagger dagger dagger they come back man first is 26 second is a 17 but i'm going to use my second luck so the second is a 21 and the third is 19 okay so the first one was really high the second two are mediocre whisper hits no i didn't think so that is terrible that's just ten and i use my movement to fly directly under him say again no no yes i am could i have hit him in the tail i got the blade on his tail and i'm there that's where i am is that melee can i use uncanny dodge shite yeah uncanny dodge wait i want to use my last luck to make him roll again which i can do wow it's all right uncanny dodge thanks matt that hits and i'm out of uncanny dodge right you've hit me right now yeah that hits thanks heroes' feast cards on the table he's going to take 15 percent of your hit points did he move away yeah no sneak attack because it's just me and bigby right right because there's nobody here with me 27 hits so that is a three plus eight is 11 plus my psychic damage is 12 that'd be great cut him in the butt i'm a field medic i'll get you out maniac here it is get it this is a rage spanking right here mighty yenky has struck out i know that from here to here i'm 100 feet so from the angle am i 180 feet away to pike i want to save one action to grab pike and yank her so that means i have an action and a bonus action and movement to fly a total of 360 feet halved which is 180 feet to pike like a rocket grab her and roll into the door of the mansion i can arc and roll us into the door that hits do i have momentum grabbing her i would imagine i did this that's the intention up and over i'm out dude i've got five hit points but he bit me right 20 go earth elemental it's all right i'm fine at the zoo you weren't trying to call satan blow everything you've got blow it he's leaving unleash 17 a ten and a three
