year ago or so but i don't know i missed him i think i missed him i let simon crawl down and form a belt and i give kynan just a gentle little clap on the cheek and say i'm glad you're fitting in i think you're well on your way to being that hero you dreamed of when you were younger happens to the best of us you got all your toes all right (whispers) do you think grog and i could shoot a gun yeah grog we're gonna shoot guns yeah but i like i don't know i throw things can you show me how it works all right (shouts) gun please you're fast i will let percy load my gun plus dex modifier 17 vax who was really giddy a minute ago takes the rifle and hands it to you these are dangerous there shouldn't be too many of these fuck you don't shoot with your gun you shoot with your heart i'm back in security guard mode a minor thing as we're walking back i sidle up next to percy and i don't say anything i just do that friend thing where you just go-- and i keep walking other than when i was shooting the gun i've been watching them like a hawk as well 29 there's a curse on you listen buddy you just learned the letter 'u' to say 'u-shaped' i think you should call that a win don't let these people tear you down grog and also i mean if we take you at your word and of course we do so the curse you-- you're very in tune with divine things and with curses and things of fiendish nature you don't sense anything in yourself it doesn't really add up is it possible-- i mean they're family and i know you love them to a degree-- but is it possible they're jerking you around am i remembering that incorrectly you could also do that now it's pronounced av-riggle also do we really imagine whatever trouble they might be bringing to pike's doorstep is something we can't handle i mean we've dealt with pretty terrible things i have a hard time imagining it could be worse-- i'm not saying it's not dangerous it should be-- oh i got a nosebleed we could just do-- i mean keyleth could do her trick of turning us into ladybugs or flies or whatever and we could all hang out and follow along i mean mind-reading first we can just be there they don't care oh i was shooting guns today that's not bad what time is it right now we could also just take them out for a drink and get their guard down i mean you are dressed like a faberge egg let's go with that i don't think so i mean you're the holiest person in this city kynan's on it the best i can do-- i mean i can cast divine sense and lay on hands and-- i mean i can-- poison and disease are things i can help with but not-- let's find out if you're a fiend or undead and i do it you're welcome is there some embarrassing thing hidden tucked away that you don't like to talk about like are you afraid of pickles or you don't want to be-- not in town on your level i mean and vasselheim is chock full of clerics so maybe we could find help there can trinket and doty ride in your-- i'm sitting on the carpet right now let's go glamping do you have any inkling of what would happen if you do nothing pike does nothing i have the lavender i have lavender with my armor i have a pound of lavender with my armor (laughter) it's not in my-- i keep it in a box with my armor so the armor won't smell like shit anymore people it's not-- is there a problem with a man having lavender in his possession yes i do it does now man i've had 12 months of downtime to figure my shit out my armor is tight now take your guilt trips and bring them back to dad i don't need them that's good that's a good one strength of seven in my-- nah right here in my-- nope i'll go with vex and percy right on the edge looking down i am yeah we left we packed up some thoughts i just have inside my head i think the twins will probably look around and make sure that nobody has been here recently other than us or see if there's anything hinky eight come on rogue that is extra i'm gonna play lookout and go out towards the edge past the arch but sink in against the wall a bit and hide into the cracks of it yeah common elven and abyssal 21 if it makes you feel better i rolled a one and used luck 21 best you can tell before i decide what is the thing doing to pike what am i looking at okay i'm gonna click the boots of haste i'm going to flip out the wings and then i'm going to fly-- not through because i don't wanna go by the thing but around towards keyleth and around towards pike and grab pike and fly her up next to percival i don't make those 17 no yeah that's the end (whispers) where does he get all these wonderful toys okay i'm gonna shoot up and do a small little loop-de-loop and then slam down right next to percival right up against it so that i'm in a flanking position opposite doty and then dagger-dagger-dagger with a little bit of smite first one is a 33 second one is a natural 20 third one is a 30 yup right okay one-- and this is smite on this that one's a seven-- can i put the smite on any attack i want i'll save it for the crit then yeah seven 11 17 19-- 24 27 33 plus the psychic damage 33 plus-- 41 48 for the first hit second attack four plus one is five plus the psychic damage-- is he a fiend is he getting anything extra from this okay five plus eight is 13 14 15 14 so 28 29 for the second hit then the smite i did oh wait i didn't-- hold on hold on four four plus-- there's no bonus so it was four plus-- then i got an eight and a two right it was an eight and a two plus 12 14-- yeah that gets me there 28 doubles to 28 and then one little--- then one little itty-bitty-- for four points feathers feathers what's the plan rush it do the thing grog voyeur gently i'm blasting off after her wait-wait i already said i'm winged and hasted i'm already there she can't go anywhere 19 yeah i'll take her 100 feet up and give her a good view i'm way up high and i say i don't know what's going on but it does not look good here (laughter) wait in that second i can go 500 feet in six seconds so can i blast down towards the cliff and dump her ten feet and keep going safely safely safely i will go (whoosh) and let her take a little damage and hit the bottom you know i'm not gonna-- i can go like (plane sounds) i'll take a little turn up and let her-- she can take some damage or we could let the dude die but i'm already doing it i've got 400 more feet to go bullet train baby saving throw okay okay i have luck i've got one luck left 20 sure and the haste is gone by the time i've gone through all that old bugger looks so sweet when he's sleeping windmill and they were so tore up to hand over jb it was like les mis what to do what to say can you carry our treasure away you're a liar
