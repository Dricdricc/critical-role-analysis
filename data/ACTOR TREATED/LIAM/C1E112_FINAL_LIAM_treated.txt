it's cute can i get it on my zune we knew we picked the right people for the job but even so it far exceeded our expectations it came together really well i palm scanlan by the face and cast lay on hands how bad are you buddy medium i'm dumping 29 hit points of paladin power into your face yeah it's all but one we like you handsome that's a tunnel that goes under the english channel wherever that is i'm pretty good sneaky fucks in front always for traps for investigations that is 18 want me to go take a look you've dusted me i'm pretty quiet i'd probably be good without it and we could go together about 50 feet away from the group and then i could go a little bit further and see if i can get a better look you still have silence i was about to ask we see flickering light far away but i don't trust anything i want to specifically see if anything besides twitching fingers and toes are hiding closer to us 24 which are how far away from us i volunteer as tribute by the way what direction is vecna from us now seeing which way keyleth is looking vax stands a bit on tiptoe and puts his chin on her shoulder and looks in the distance and sees the armored figure are we close enough to tell if that armored figure has a sword 26 yeah through skype it's like my niece sat down at the table to start playing how are your magical reserves he knows we're coming there's no peeling around the sides of this there's too much rubble and shit this huge space that we're in wait a second scanlan could do that but he can't go by himself we all have to creep along with him or be found out we all have to go together so we don't fall out of range of her ring we're all stuck together unfortunately send who additionally we can play monkey in the middle as long as vex is in the center you can be 50 feet or so ahead and everyone else can be either with vex or back vax starts quietly praying to the raven queen in a corner right now i stand ten feet away from her and give her a plus two oh that's so low plus two i'm going to stick close to vex in case she needs backup but also if scanlan needs backup ready to run in natural 20 47 somewhere in the future there's an acquisitions inc game going and my head pops in from the side and then pulls out again that's pretty good so we part like the sea how spread out are those three groupings convince it that the people we sent away need it is that the dm's face or the creature's another option you said that these three passageways they curve this way and that the two on the sides don't have a really good look at each other right on the left is a bunch of undead fuckers right and on the right we've got a humanoid and two little crunched over guys right so you've got that silence doohickey and us so we could bet it all on stealth-kills and creep in and go leave it all behind one in the middle's now empty one on the left over around the corner is undead humanoid and two creepy-crawly guys if it pans out we take them out and the skeletons over there can't see over here if we are quick and then we go all right but kill them and then make a loud noise because as soon as we start shit rumbling everybody gets paranoid and upset can we say that the twins and freddie have been ready to go as you cast and make our move on these three on the side yes stealth-kill them and get the drop that's what i'm saying i guess i'll start with her then the ghasts i'm going to assassinate this woman hopefully flick-flick on her yes that's 25 and 23 here we go i'm going to dump a smite into it as well first dagger to strike does 88 yeah i threw two daggers as part of the surprise you fired to the left or the right i'm going to fire at the same one that my sister does it was earlier i did it they both hit it was 20-something just seven for me though and that's all i'm going to do stab stab stab 40 for the first second one is a seven no it's 17 for the second one and the last is a crit and that is eight i take whisper and the venom dagger and lift it by the head off her if we're all running together he gets plus two from me if he's within ten feet i got a new 45 stealth check so i'm going to go peek we're level 19 i'm level 19 y'all i was about to assess that couple of questions one how far is the tower from where we are right now am i able to tell if this is a giant domed-in city are we in a little corner of it or are we coming up somewhere mid-range okay so not right against it how close are the nearest of the gloomstalkers flying around and do i see any motherfuckers on the streets yeah use the colville die the meteorite it's pretty good it's 29 is it dragon-shaped is there any color to it other than dead do me a favor and stay down there it's a real party up here and everybody's dead there is a dead dragon in the sky and there's a lot of dead dwarves and other various types and those things that scanlan charmed a few days ago it is really shitty up here so stay put i don't believe so i back slowly the 15 feet that i traveled you can scry on people can you scry on things yeah but you saw it but i didn't see it you have the spell yeah so you should do it do we have the gate stones both of them do we have them i have a great idea but it'd take a little time i have a little tub of oil that makes you ethereal and if one of us-- you me whoever-- travels through the ethereal plane and walks down to the sword and waits with it and then pops back into the material plane-- finds it and then waits somewhere no i'm on a different plane parallel to this one do you have any sense of if it's buried very deep or is it sitting in a puddle of shit we don't know though she would not be able to hold onto it they're two different dimensions it's two different planes but if you or i with locate object douse ourselves in this oil and we locate the object we know exactly where it is and we move toward it and then go down there it might be encased in a ton of stone or something we don't know we could go toward it find it and then go sit 20 or 30 feet away from it wait to pop back into this plane go grab it gate stone up here also i should try to do it because if i come back in a wall of stone it doesn't matter an hour why we have the gate stone ethereal will take me down toward the thing i wait by it pop back into material pick it up gate stone back-- it takes a minute to do we don't know that we're going through solid earth it could be sitting in a foot-deep puddle of muck in a cavern somewhere it's not like it was teleported into a solid mountain we've been stealthing for not too much space i think that i could get pretty far well i could do the same thing that she did if you hand me that bauble again i can do the same thing that is hilarious let's try your idea you thought that i would be able to locate it by you telling me about it so what did it look like awesome i'm going to cast locate object right now no i'm not upset at you i'm upset at laura because this was my idea on the break and it got yanked from me but what are you going to do i'm not upset it's fine i'm taking my marbles and going home what's the range on the earring wait the ring within 60 feet of each other all of this was a waste of time it's within a thousand feet a thousand feet is not that far it's more likely that this thing is sitting in a pool of stilted water it's probably not encased in a passageway of stone because how did it get there and vecna knows where we are i'm not that stealthy 31 37 the lion the witch and the wardrobe greetings time traveler that's a good call you can get back on your own pretty easily yeah tunneling through stone do you have that left or that's done i feel like maybe vex should carry the stone then she has less of a chance of getting back on her own (singing) empty chairs at empty tables does my luck transfer to anybody no fuck a duck do you vaguely remember the direction it was in so maybe we go vague for a minute 40 just roll high she can't talk i think so yeah you just can't interact it's for saves not checks and you can still see everything yeah you just can't interact with anything okay so i start slathering her up wait laura marisha and no we've forgotten about the 60 fucking feet again if you take the ring further than 60 feet away from me we're blown but the proof is in the pudding because if that ring were gone from my presence vecna would be bending me over a barrel right now he's doing everybody back to chicken town chicken town and i click the boots of haste and i start booking back you're staying i'm hearing this over the earring i just heard that i heard it vecna whispered to me and i said that to everybody through the earring she shouted back at me does she still hear me but i heard that so you're not going to go i can't talk to you anymore i realize keyleth's not going anywhere and i plunk down if she screamed i stopped once i realized she wasn't leaving i stayed and nobody replied and i stopped because i doubted it and i'm waiting yeah of course but vecna's whispering in my ear 33 and pass without a trace so 43 i lost the paper but i'll look it up yeah i think that's what it is one hour we've got to bail on it and come back for it later if at all it's ethereal i'm paralyzed i don't know what to do so i'm hiding not doing anything but how far away have we traveled from the building we started at with the mansion in it that's fine i don't say shit she is on another plane she's in the ethereal plane we did the oil thing we didn't think it through vecna's whispering in my ear by the way where is he still in his spot no she slipped down into the ground she's probably near you somewhere we lubed her up in ethereal oil and she went down your direction keyleth you know where to go i have to run and i click the boots of haste and i start bolting towards the mansion i'm going to stealth sorry i'm freaked out 35 am i still pass without a traced at this point 35 no i'm going to keep going as i'm probably getting farther away i say kiki stay underground please and keep going i've stepped in the door by the way of the mansion not well not very well it's fucked he knows we're here he doesn't know where you are or where i am right now but he knows that we're here no not anymore he did probably no we wait a little bit i think that they can get back that's a big risk oh my god i run forward and hug the big fucking stone giant like a cat we are blown he can't see us anymore but he knows-- really cool we all see this right he's not snuck off right i'm going to come and sit next to him and watch what's up buddy just keep doing your thing i'm ten feet away i'm not breathing down your neck you all right i'm going to assume i have deduced somewhat what is going on here hey man you do you i'm going to bless grog right now it's all over you buddy plus two from me plus 1d4 from bless plus two plus 1d4 yes wait i'll use my last luck of the day to make him reroll that to hit doesn't hit i disengage and jump back 15 feet we can get that for you just not from inside us why are you not attacking us anymore (shouting) that's a novel big man why did you stop attacking after you cut my sister blood he wants blood could you do me a favor then do you think instead of attacking my twin sister next time-- and i take whisper and i go-- can i feed him for you i've already started (dripping) goddamn it travis then you and me have an agreement here rather than wait until he comes knocking in the meantime could i feed him once an hour or so that seems extreme vasselheim is getting fucked royally now or soon the straightest edge basically it also describes you so i feel like you should be understanding it's too much of a risk to go back normally anyway we might as well find him a series of bad decisions how do you mean he also might like a naughty doodle the new york yankees that's terrible (laughter) give me 12 minutes and i'll have this armor off 11 minutes from now i'm going to be joining you percival and what is your idea of a good time unbutton unbutton it's been a hard day i'm unkillable for a while (high-pitched) well it's real dicey at the moment wait grog i'm sorry come again okay okay okay i have one further request on our end can you send us backward in time can i tell if he's lying 18 never strangled someone before all right with a couple of provisions here all right one you cannot say shit while you're doing this that is correct two and this includes the rest of you lot everybody leaves except for scanlan and grog and they stay i don't know how to feel about this oh vax is okay that was liam just now (laughter) i'll see you soon ask him i don't think he does probably i'll be back guys go go on percy take keyleth out of here please i want you to laugh your fucking ass off all right you keep an eye have him drag me somewhere safe and keep an eye on me let's stop talking folks could you look after keyleth please see you tomorrow hey grog all he gets to is strangle me to death that's it no neither artagan or scanlan are able to do anything to me once i'm out and then make sure he doesn't lose me in the woods or something okay it's been so much fun until now don't speak i walk up to artagan all right fucknut let's do this (clicks tongue) no fear remember you could have asked for a magic wand or a unicorn a pony preach david bowie nobody knows that it's like a vegas casino it's always the same twilight spells yeah two scanlans could you give grog wings right i didn't expect it oh my god we came close to fucking up that ring proximity thing seven times and then finally we did fuck it up post that shit check their myspace
