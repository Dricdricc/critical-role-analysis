a little bit ahead you follow behind by about 50 paces and the rest of the group behind you they're not coming from where they're from they're going i'm not far ahead but i'm ahead i'm like 30 yards ahead okay so i saw that okay but they're still a ways off right how far back are we all right well i turn back to the group can we go around the sides-- flank them ahead of time scanlan you create a distraction-- -- closer to here you want to get that guy down to the treeline and get the people out well this may be it for orcs this could be all of them or it could be just a forward camp so we need to keep one alive and find out if this is the end of it or if there's more i've lost track of all you've done in the past 24 hours could you send everybody through a tree even back to where their people are yes that's good that's good they can go down to the workout room so they don't soil the other chambers you need to go full burt reynolds out in front of that camp and get the bulk of them running towards you blow your shawm but you're the only one who can make a hefner mansion out of thin air we'll all go together wait keyleth does the distraction as soon as she goes you go so once those guys start running towards her-- but you know what you're doing right wait let's get in position you and i can do a lot more hurt to these guys if we're closer to the position we have to go i'll take the long way around this way yeah with an eye for the shithead who's tormenting that guy in the tree 45 i turn to grog i'm moving a little closer just a bit stay there the opposite of that this

to use luck that's a point straight up in the air fuck okay the first one probably misses 16 and i was using the minus five so the first one probably misses 11 yeah all right second one second one is

please i'll take that carefully thank you i'm going to make an insight check on grog yeah 16 i've never had a whisper before on the show scanlan maybe not black birds for a while all right it's a touchy subject stay away from black birds for a while thanks buddy lead me in as far as you went yeah where you flew over yeah in the entrance and down those stairs 20 no 17 checking for traps i should know this but is that separate from perception for me but is it a different roll traps or is it just perception and investigation it's only my third year doing this i'm pulling out flametongue dagger i did an investigation check yeah i'll do it again here i'm going to use luck 18 common elvish and abyssal i walk up with my dagger and hold it underneath there's a fairly good chance we need to go down through this grog and keyleth you're probably the best suited for this you because your fucking chest is so big and you because you can turn into water grog go with her ninja sharks up the stairs behind us is stairs up part it an air tunnel for us so we're going through water to get to air is it covering like a rug all in front of us so are we able to pick our way through i'll go behind grog right where we are i'm going to take my flametongue dagger and go in a circle and detect traps detect some traps 18 if it's in celestial and it says those who made us i highly doubt that the dragons are the ones that made the architects of this structure careful please pike does this mean anything to you i use the flametongue dagger scanlan grab your horn call out say that osysa sent us don't you have a cone scanlan can i borrow your horn your cone i grab scanlan's horn osysa sent us can you hear us i'd like to use acrobatics to ignore the rope and use the sides of this little tunnel to do that going up that is 25 25 again 25 acrobatics i have a regular 50-foot rope and i'm tying a loop and i'm going to throw it down towards grog and try to get it down so he can hold onto it and help pull while he does what he's doing i grab grog by the beard and pull i'm pulling on his beard can i cancel his disadvantage i start shaking out his beard and getting all the crap out and it's like fwang traps i'm looking for traps yeah that's good that is a 27 i'm going stealth 30 for stealth deathwalker's ward i'll have resistance to fire let's sit and let grog catch a breath shall we take 20 paces back and wait for me to open the door and look in all right i'm a little better at being invisible but go for it it was great do i need to make another stealth check at this point all right so i'm going to-- just stay back there's no point in all of us getting with something and i move 20 feet ahead of everybody going to use my second luck today because i rolled a one that's better perception you said 22 does it remind me of anything i've seen in my dreams i don't hear any eight-legged friends around i could be grasping at straws but i'm getting a bit of an arachnid vibe in here i'm not sure there's three passages there's webbing of some kind to the left and to the right and some sort of divot or bowl on the ground i think you can all come in quietly 23 shorthalt come here look at this thing look there and there these are like the-- yeah do you still have the doohickus do you want us to shove it in the hole that's why i called you over man eenie meenie miney mo catch a druid by the toe if she hollers let her go eenie meenie miney-- i push scanlan a bit up ahead of me get that silver tongue of yours ready all right would you like me to do that 24 look at the fire (laughs) how are we supposed to know your name is it osyso i'm going to click my boots of haste can i use a bonus action to hide and then hold any stuff where am i in there so i'm going to hide i'm going to move backward around the corner and hide yeah okay 25 and i'm going to hold for the moment he attacks any of my friends shit 17 yup is it charm by any chance and does it have anything to do with charm or sleep nope okay 17 17 three legendary actions can i attack him now while he's casting because i held my turn okay so i'm hidden and grog's next to him which would normally put me at advantage but he's got me afraid which puts me at disadvantage which means it cancels out and it's one straight roll right on the attacks okay good so i'm going to throw-- i'm hasted i'm going to throw two daggers at him the first one is probably hits where's the freaking page 23 for the first 18 for the second do they both hit or just the first i'm only doing two 18 okay so the first one is seven the second is seven and i want to use the rest of my turn to as i'm hasted to run around to the back of that obelisk and start reading yeah i'm going to use evasion okay dexterity so 14 no eff it i'm going to use my last luck of the day ugh barely any better 16 mm-hmm yes with evasion if i fail i take half damage so i didn't hear the number because i was reading what was-- had a little flicker fey spiders you son of a-- oh god i keep hitting that we got to fix that i'm taking a quick look at the obelisk that i'm right in front of i think it's in elvish isn't it there's nothing on it nothing to do i'm going to throw three daggers through the web is that the one-- so percy's over there i'm going to throw three daggers through the web over there 13 30 and 17 13 30 and 17 ten and eight and i can't move any closer to the sphinx at this point right because of the fear so i'm stuck here am i i will do that i'd also like to take one step to the right this way yeah and no i rolled an eight for wisdom ocho time slippage man the code is critrole and you will not have to pay for any kind of shipment in any way shape or form the wood still costs travis is flexing his boobies and then time shifts and we're back in it was a circle heat don't hurt i think we should stop there we should not go into the wind center yeah his name is probably jamal porter squiggly lines snake shape and a box (grog voice) six it said six keep it away from pike and grog yeah instinct buddy yes it is come on can i try to make my wisdom save before i do anything or does that come at the end all right then i'm going to come around the corner i know can i walk over yeah ten feet that way and see it scowling down at pike and put three daggers in its flank first one misses it's a 13 24 and a 15 yeah eight eight points of damage i'm going to try to shake off the fear but am i at disadvantage because of the fear i thought i was at disadvantage i did three attack rolls but i thought that to get sneak attack damage i need advantage but if i'm afraid i don't have advantage all right i thought that meant that sorry all right i'll take it four seven 13 25 added to what i said before which was eight so 33 i don't know what i rolled so i'm going to roll again 20 can i use the rest of my movement i'm going to run up to the side of the sphinx don't do damage to yourself seven 11 mup and i'm not afraid but i'm deaf karimaljika i'm going to use my bonus action to disengage from the sphinx and i'm going to run around the whirlwind and as i move i'm taking the rope which i already made a loop on and i'm going to throw the loop over grog's head on one end and i'm going to jump into the whirlwind holding tightly-- i'm going to into there i'm going after scanlan and i was hasted and i ran at the whirlwind it's really quiet in here but then again it would be really quiet out of here as well i deftly roll my eyes so fucking hard i don't see or hear him so i assume he is healing my sister right now and i feel comforted i probably look really good with ten years on me i'm not here aw he softballed you with that one bye guys i can't hear you what did you say hahaha good one that was a good one hazing who doesn't love hazing right dwarven forge obviously for scanlan hey we're friends with your girlfriend want to give us some stuff percy that was made for you (singing) it's the last midnight
