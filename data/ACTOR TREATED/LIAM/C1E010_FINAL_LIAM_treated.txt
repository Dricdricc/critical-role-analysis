999 gets nothing a really strong 13 age ain't slowing them down nothing wow hi fellas i feel so popular is there one specifically oh good yeah yeah hell yeah okay (grunts) okay 15 plus nothing it's all in speed man 15 six 19 (strained) feels like rigor mortis send a fireball right here laura and how much bludgeoning damage am i taking okay right okay that was more substantial give me some sugar i'm alive good job badasses i didn't do nothing (others laugh) is that chest ten feet away from me as well i have a thing i can do too this is a dexterity check 20 as a rogue with evasion if i succeed it's nothing my thingy i don't know where it is what's that mean is that a reference what is that ever since we were five you look weird what's up how's my foot doing these days it does look like a flying manta ray cheeky bastard natural 20 25 command us run (all laugh) what the hell is it called my quick action to dash yeah can i grab her by the scruff and run that's what i want to do grabbing my sister his knees are really high in the air nothing's free (laughing) you've got to roll for everything it's a good thing we ran we just gave up a turn (squishing noise) it is poppycock d6 times something i think depends on your level that's for a low level it's a contest it's like an arm wrestle it's like arm wrestling with dice okay so i throw a dagger at the mcray there plus i had a one on the first one no it was a seven plus 13 on the second oh mirror images come on beautiful human 14 we can't sail away-- does it cancel out the disadvantage all right dagger dagger thunk thunk but at disadvantage because of the dark i'm not afraid okay first one is 26 second one is 26 sneak attack all right okay 23 i saw where tiberius pulled the eye out and that's what i'm aiming at its eye socket so i flip it in the air and when i catch it i immediately let go and fill in the blank it's a cloaker because that was a cloaker's eye and i'm going to look for bad things on the beach how far away are we from the main island is it like dumbo to manhattan distance 29 and there's caves i'm going to creep up just to the edge of the cave i'm not going to go in is it a separate perception check for the inside of the cave as well all right stealth check is good it's a 21 31 and that is 19 manufactured or made or just paved floor it's very hard to know though it's dark in there so my stealth was at a 41 no if anyone's going in send me i'm at a 41 stealth and if we stay on the beach we're in view of the main island tiberius my dagger do the dagger i would lose stealth non-magical yeah throw a torch in do the half-elves and the gnomes see anything when there's light going through forget this forget this cave keyleth can you do that thing you do where you make the beach look like an empty beach or something other than it is can we camp on the beach instead of going in there here's what i think all right we don't need to whack every problem over the head and we have something far more important than whatever's in there the only question is do we want to try to rest here under some sort of illusion or do we go to the island we can see we could sail there to the northwestern edge of the island there's some sort of structure there can i ask one quick question before we go regardless of what happens if there is something shitty in here or not are we camping here afterward we're sure okay then i click my boots of haste it's a gate that's familiar take the stairs though it is pretty funny we're all just on the beach people were still laughing all right or a shortcut into the-- tibber-hoods do you have any fireballs left in you am i silenced well i rolled pitifully so it probably doesn't matter (yells incoherently) i didn't know he was going to dispel it one-two punch no we can just throw it i'm not trying to get it into a basket it'll ignite the bomb once we finish this math this explosion is going to be really cool that's going to attract some attention 15 something funky in here well let's figure it out clarota what are we looking at in here i wonder what would happen if k'varn was cut off from the other side of this or collapse it we can camp but it's only been 6 or 7 hours since we woke up really 8 hours all right spill it girl spill it it's lembas bread scanlan she didn't say ant-dick she said antic your friends are going to be watching the show in under a month oh so it's really dark all right also i'm sorry if it's this dark in here we lit up the cave anyone on that island would have seen that i don't think it's very safe here i know that but no one camouflaged the explosion of fire that lit up the cave he knows we're coming what does keyleth look like to us right now i'm walking up to keyleth and i'm grabbing her by the shirt and i'm going to slap her across the face you were in pain are you all right are you all right the iconic creature there's dragon then beholder it's a magic fun bag we know that it's acid if you keep making that face it'll freeze that way clarota keyleth has scried the top of the building right now it didn't look like it was part of the original structure is she mistaken is the top something that was built by your people would that be as strong as the rest of the building not much like a wizard times 50 well we either have a 10% chance right now for her to tell us what to do-- he's in the top of a pyramid it's not letting them out we have to get them out of k'varn's control so how do we do that it's the only option that seems open to us unless we keep stumbling around and looking for some other way i think can scanlan mercilessly mock the top of the thing question you built a bomb before if we could hole up for-- months or weeks was it laura and now that you know how to build one would it be quicker my sister says that island is crawling with nasty shits inspect the top of the building see where the acid would be put to good use we're guessing that k'varn doesn't want to leave his little cubby-hole so even if we fly down on top he gets pissed he could fly up but we could fly away he probably doesn't want to leave the top of the-- well we've been here and we've been here here or here or this little nubbin right here well that's true but my sister studied the island and she sensed the presence of things everywhere well i am curious about this can we see this from the beach we're on what is this we can also do two trips on the carpet well i tell you what we don't know what to do so why don't vex and i and scanlan go for a little ride and check out the tip of this island let's let tiberius and the twins and scanlan fly ahead of the boat quietly carefully see what we see we have the earrings that tibber-hoods crafted for us so we can tell you what we see and we don't want to rush in we're probably going to go here but let's not rush in let the quiet ones go have a look you need to take it easy for a moment you just went through some shit keyleth you know that thing a dog does when it pulls its butt along the floor yeah that sounds good yes team clarence and team kima-gibbler he said no it would take a while all right let's do it quiet ones let's get on the carpet tiberius we're saving the world here people let's not twiddle our thumbs for too long sorry i did a quick scrying spell and i know that we're 50 shirts away from the total so keep going get your mother a shirt keep going is there a larger one behind those smaller structures but as you're from this island what wildlife can we expect to run into here fuzzball it's really good clarota that was rude very rude all right yes everyone wait here i grab scanlan by the scruff of the neck and nod at my sister let's go take a peek yes we'll take a peek just wait a minute 28 for stealth do the twins outweigh him but it looks twice the size of what i would use for a fire or what i would use for a bedroll giants question bigger than grog stealthed i'm picking up scanlan and moving backwards you're right there i was holding your hand the whole time nowhere near k'varn marisha and nowhere near him it's k'varn if you sell those 20 shirts come on guys 20 shirts i'll buy a hoodie if you guys buy 19 deal here we go we did it (all cheer) yeah (all laugh) wow thank you guys a thousand years of dungeons & dragons can i interject for a second and thank earl davis @wheelyfactoids for buying 8 shirts thanks dude give them out to seven people start playing dungeons & dragons with them on a side night-- on a side night we'll play another game on a side note we love fan art we love it we're going to try to find a way to showcase it on the show perhaps we'll see it and we're looking for a way to add it so do we weeklyfactoids is the guy who bought 8 shirts wheelyfactoids don't fuck with grandpa illidan all right what was it that is an amazing donation thank you so much ah tsch√ºss you said thank you he said excuse me he's saying good morning i said see you later see you next time ta-ta the two of you are extremely generous thank you and the charity's going to have their mind blown and thank you everyone for supporting splattercat which should be for about one more episode 1034 presently keyleth's or marisha's we could expect trinket plushies it might not be next week but i feel like within 12 months there will be a trinket plushie how we came up with vox machina is that the question we used to be the shits we used to be the super high intensity team the shits someone is asking what matt whispered to me when i insight-checked marisha it's not what you think it is and i'm not going to say laura and it's moving too fast chaotic good you've got a wicked streak on a related note somebody wants you to say fuck you dylan for some reason aww tiberius is chaotic inattentive it goes so fast hooking and then you met the right person while training to be an actor when geek & sundry arranges that with the beard you did yeah i was a spaz i was so shy i'm going to be blind as that manta ray by the time this q&a is over the woobie he's right over here this goes right we're playing d&d once a week any interest in turning critical role into a comic book yes who will draw it from the chat room yeah like an fao schwarz-size bear high school either high school or my birthday two and a half years ago it was my birthday request to play a one-off and it turned into this not me i'm the oldest no i'm the oldest light no i know that you're an old soul i'm may 28th and you're when what month i think someone asked about my birthay laura and my birthday the whole reason we are playing twins is that we share the same birthday it's may 28th she's older than me though i want to know the answer to one someone asked how did travis and laura meet were you good sam is my favorite ninja turtle that's more commonly known as rock out with your cock out will critical role continue after the boss yes if you replace ashley with liam it's true i've got an idea that's a good one yeah go for it it really is a short story and not a blurb it was long there's a short list for guests and a long lists for guests for down the road carrot top sam and barack obama tim burton my eyes are bleeding eliza dushku elijah wood pfft troy didn't know what to make of this when we first started it what is this an anime episode someone requested as a player zac eubank zac did you type that somebody's going to die eventually but if it does happen it's your fault throw up the laura emote if there is one is there a spirit in the room make it known if you're there we haven't encountered any tieflings yet matt someone's asking what's good to roll as if you are brand new to the game fighter someone asked for fan art do we want the characters to look like us i think how we really look i think either would be fine a lot of the stuff that's coming in is based on the artwork of a woman named kit buss she took input from us on what we were looking for and she did the initial art and people have riffed off that which is great if you want to make a dragonborn that looks like orion with his face pulled out that's cool too could someone draw scanlan with the illusionary growth and the illusionary wang yes i mean the donkey dong could be in pants or something it doesn't have to be pornographic go to geek & sundry then click on shows then click on critical role and that'll get you there it's as easy as that yeah for my birthday i said i wanted to play d&d for a night and i asked the people that i wanted and they came and then the next day i sent out an email going oh man that was so great i feel like we should do that again and nobody responded for a day and i felt ashamed and sad because i thought that i was a dork and nobody wanted to do it but then slowly everyone trickled in going yeah yeah yeah and here we are yep for a day i was like oh god i just outed myself as the biggest dork in the group marisha laura and yes that's very close matt's writing plot points but he's improvising too and we have no idea what the hell's going to happen i don't know do you guys want to watch for five hours sam i saw a question wondering when you're going to make a weird al yankovic-esque compilation of songs next month nothing but net ashley scanlan or steve rogers scanlan has fudged a bedroll we probably talked about this in the last q&a but i'm sure there's a lot of new people here they want to know about pike's death keyleth looked at her and thought she was a kid and then-- matt and outside of ourselves oh it's so hard scanlan is really hard to beat for laughs but tiberius is so quirky i love that i love how klutzy keyleth is with raw power at the same time i'm very partial to my twin trinket is pretty great it's hard to pick guys there is no god and it is the cold random chance of the universe orion and of the universe there's no magic dice it's chance hogwarts houses everyone ravenclaw bullshit hufflepuff sam what the fuck are you talking about someone continues to ask in the last q&a i referenced going through a rough patch and they want to know if i'm still going through it and how d&d helped yeah i had a problem with one of my ears it's like two years in no one has diagnosed it correctly in the beginning it was wildly disorienting i didn't know what was going on the symptoms were way more extreme than what i'm going through now so it's not gone but it's managed and i've found that running helps a lot which is why i run like a madman now and the most important thing in my life is my wife and my two children the second most important thing in my life are the people on this couch and this bench it's kind of eclipsed my job for me in the last couple of years looking forward to these nights was huge for me both when i was in the thick of it and still and i look at everyone here as a second family that's not how you do it though you just have the universe printed on the inside of your skull oh (all laugh) this all exists somewhere else doesn't it that was one of them what about when grog decided he wanted to vet people to guard greyskull keep that was pulled out of your ass right very well done not since we left the last private game before this tony roberts billy mays here for the wizard's academy maybe in '89 i might have been yeah i started when i was 10 or 11 in grade school which was the very end of the '80s i see a good one i have an answer i'll start there it is someone wants to know what our favorite moment has been since we started critical role mine was sneaking into the illithid captain's room with scanlan holding a bucket of poop i was scared to death i didn't know what was going to happen and it went great it was electric that was mine anybody else board games anything i've been playing the board game dungeon which is d&d-inspired someone also asked what's a good way to get your wife or your kids or friends involved i yanked my eight-year-old son in by playing dungeon with him and he totally got into it because of dungeon and now i am dming a game for three eight-year-olds it's like d&d-light in a board game and if they like the board game you can say you know if you like this we can ratchet up a bit it's now in 5th edition in one of the added books we didn't want it to turn into a reality tv show there's a light goose to the energy because it feels like we're doing theater which is the one added difference that i like because when we played at home we would have moments where we'd go into lulls or get tired or something and that doesn't happen here silly yeah one of our favorite things about all the feedback we're getting through social media is how many of you guys are starting to play the game somebody asked what each of our favorite thing about playing d&d is the people we all do a decent amount of gaming in this group so this just feels like the most social friend-oriented-- it just feels real because we're hashing it out together instead of doing this which is great we all do it but it's a nice counter-balance hey it's scott white happy 10th episode hey scott actor scott white i love that we have percy in our group that's what i was going to fucking say yeah i save it all i have a process it goes into my iphone folder and then right into dropbox pile of shit has a thousand eyes (all laugh) thanks to that guy ukraine definitely i change my mind about that every day i think about what to do once he kills me off i don't want to say because i'm convinced matt will kill me eventually and i don't want to spoil whatever i cook up can we hear your dwarf accent again (similar accent) welcome to ikea i said that months ago live a video game while drinking with your friends laura and and playing with someone who's not a crazy talented voice actor is still better than not playing so find a dm and start a game start your first game now we're thick as thieves
