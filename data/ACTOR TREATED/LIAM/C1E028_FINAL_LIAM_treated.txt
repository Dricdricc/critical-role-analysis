it's the granny grinder marisha and it's preoccupied so i just leisurely walk backwards about 30 feet looking at the same wound that i started before no back up the chasm here even further away yeah and i'm just going to throw three daggers into the wound i already hit so i'm going to do that again i know that hits because it hit the last time that's a 23 and that's sneak attack because he's occupied that's 11 plus-- 11 plus 17 21 26 29 34 39 for the first dagger next one doesn't hit probably that's a 17 just barely hits yeah that is an eight of damage and just wait a second and go-- and

everyone and creep along cloak up it's my job 22 tibs you brought along a sack of mirrors i think you've got enough what do you need tiberius tiberius you are a heavy hitter we don't know where we're going what we're doing he's strong you're strong in a way maybe hang out a little bit longer more than i do you're stronger in frame than i am sure you want to go (whispers) i know but i'm just trying to give you a hard time (all laugh) (whispers) send an ipad with pike on it (all laugh) he went to get an army i think i can do magic i do this great coin trick thing where i flip it on my thumb and then it lands in my hand that's the end of it it's right here 40 feet out yeah yeah man as we progress i say into my earring scanlan i've seen some of the logs she's left behind they're not small they don't sense anything just flip that i'm not sure i understand we see a drop-off some sort of outlook or something something that was not formed by nature here can i hide scanlan under my cloak can he use his invisibility on someone else no on somebody else so i'd just hide him all right all right that's not that far do you remember when we psyched out the duergar-- can you make some shrubs to come along with us yeah we lured a bunch of duergar into a chasm that the ground extended over giants like to throw fucking boulders yeah we were all using climbing gear or just-- all right well i got 19 yes i do i need it (whispers) i'm not gonna tell you could i have given the climbing gear to trinket i've been behind him the whole time pushing on his buttocks can i use passive perception well then i get-- 26 yep you could also be a sparrow laura and grog sacrifices the gnome (all laugh) do it batwoman stealth 17 i want to ransack the joint investigate or perception for me investigate or perception i'll investigate 17 here you go what are you going to do with it shoot yourself probably shoot a couple dummy arrows out of it i'm following grog and i'm doing the same sorry she's taking the bow for a spin seeing what it can do i'm out there too and i rolled a natural 20 yeah it doesn't matter you can't add shit to one yeah yeah we're gonna hobbit this shit yes you want me to jog into town if the coach driver was any indication there are going to be people-- -- in town everyone get your own tree i already did those are good rolls so we're stealthing again in the tree i'm already at a 32 man let's do it let's roll again what do we add good i rolled 20 i miss pike hopefully he lands on his lute i just want to say that i pulled my hood down and put on my calamari hat and pulled the hood back over it it tingles yeah dude i have a question the only reason i have this question is because i posted that video from a couple of years ago do i still have the unending rope why don't we reinforce with the rope i'm sorry i brought it up i'd love you to fall on your head aerodynamic isn't it maybe that's why it's protected maybe-- keyleth would you be able to revive the tree we can please pelor i have a feeling we can revive that tree somehow it may weaken the briarwoods' hold on the psyche of the villagers here it's known as a lemon party (all laugh) i'm telling you they looked right through me invisible they saw me no but i was heavily stealthed when i beaned the guard they should not have been able to see me question what time was it when they were doing their little scouting thing they've just told us about the sun was going down yes we get there at sunrise take those fucking beasts out and you start at eight am the tree is called the sun tree it's pelor's tree i'm not a cleric of sarenrae but these shitbags could not have set up camp in a temple of sarenrae because there is too much goodness there as there was around this tree in this town and it's why it is dead it's why it's being surrounded by a bunch of giant undead things as you described you need faith scanlan shorthalt then you need to shut up and let us fix that tree i don't think there is any sneaking in thanks to those birds so we make a stand out here i throw five or six pine cones at his head at once could we throw in a scanlan grenade and be able to see through it a scat grenade scatlan marisha and you shit in your hand and you toss it all right we're off the rails question for the assassin path of rogue at 9th level if i have seven days which is way too much time i can impersonate anyone i want in half a day could i just be a dirty nobody this is the time we don't really know what we're going to find this morning those big guys could still be there we don't know we don't know if there are people in the pocket of the briarwoods here i think that's a good idea hole up let's find a place you would be a freak i'm wearing a natural 20 i did had a little help with luck but i got it i'm walking 50 feet in front of everybody else i'm 50 feet in front of everyone else real talk real talk scanlan my sister will cut you bring the bear i walk over to just one random person on the street and say anyone hiring hands on farms that is a four-- no hold on-- i'm gonna use luck that's the luck no it's not 40 so it's 14 yeah i know we just need some work where are we what are our surroundings right now there's a larger building isn't there i can't see-- 26 the body or it's a message they're in their keep buried deep did we see this big building right here as we walked by yeah that big one there was no cleric when we faced them before all of us who stood against them in emon those birds might have told them we were here yeah what am i stealthing right now or checking for-- oh unlock okay so that's a 22 yeah come with us keyleth come with us i've watched you pass through solid stone and earth how long can you do that for can you get us close to underneath the tree but just in case i think i'll hang back i'm not going down to the pre-made tunnel i'll just keep an eye above ground 20 20 20 haroom haroom it's ent voice haroom haroom that's all they say turn and cough it was like eight in the morning-ish when we found that building yeah was it around eight in the morning when we got to that house that's what you call a giving tree
