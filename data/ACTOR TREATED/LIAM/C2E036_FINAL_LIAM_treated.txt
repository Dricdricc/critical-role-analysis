yaas queen she's working her butt off working her butt off we're going to jump in the chat we're going to jump in the shat we're going to shat in the chat tomorrow night during the show do i see the shirt waiting in the wings right now we do that fish looks so disturbed well you know all told i think that went very well it could've been worse they attacked us unprovoked i know that we were not exactly normal-seeming to them but we did not get threatening with them they made the first move and it just unraveled from there what can you do sometimes you just have to follow the cabbages in front of you what did you say i will go down as well is it better to pull it out or leave it in place we're just going to leave hole in his head like phineas gage i'm just going to move the axe head a centimeter or two as soon as cad's hands start to glow i yank the axe out of his head caduceus is america tonight jester this is your axe ja well buddy we're at sea now we are not at the dock any more you are trapped with us we have questions and i don't want to alarm you none of us want to put an axe in your head or anything right we want to just get along we're all tired i'm tired but i'll go to work if i need to 18 the easy route is what i'm talking about good decision we have a lot of questions so tell us everything the squalleater gesturing to the desk and all the burned papers what's all this then what was this that we can't read anymore like take care of him i pull out the book and i begin to do the ritual for comprehend languages to see if that will help with the code it's a long shot but i'll give it a shot i'm doing a ritual spell for 11 minutes d&d oh wow so it spread out blank from-- that's cool the code was where you said there was a code i thought yeah it takes ten-ish minutes to do comprehend languages and if i'm touching-- it is ten minutes plus one minute as a ritual so yeah casting time one action plus ten minutes you're talking about a place an island a building and you've made this trip yourself what are the risks one would encounter trying to traverse this area oh did my spell trigger yet only because i want to say the name as it is is fairly appropriate we might want to change it to change up our appearance and stuff do you know what mist means in zemnian it means shit yeah manure crap it means crap it's pretty on brand for us honestly you've been doing it for several months now jester we're going to add on to-- mistake is funny too i like that can i read this code okay see these squiggles here this is either just supplies or maybe they are trying to make booby traps for their island i don't know little ridge that he's not used to do you have any weapons left on you does he have it now or has he chucked it that's water under the bridge we just don't want any new problems yeah and there's a lot of us here so it would be foolish to do anything right you just got a come-up you got a new pet thaddeus klossowski von musel then you'll have two balls you recognise those specific points there we came here for the two of you what are you after why would we not want to go to this place yeah north is that way and i point north or you could put zemnian and common together and make it the shit-ake if it's the mistake does someone need to man the ship at night when most of us are sleeping can we do that without any sailing experience how far off the other thing we could do is find a place on the menagerie coast a good ways away from where we departed and some of us could try to find a crew also we left the cart behind (whispers) saved by the bell style i wander over what do you mean that they started it no i'm good today was not optimal by any means but we have helped our friend's mother and she is better off the things on the dock did not go great-- no one would use the word great-- but we did not draw a blade on them or do anything they attacked us we kept ourselves alive we kept our friends alive i did not expect us to be departing jester's hometown quite so quickly but here we are we're all alive we're helping another one of our friends this is not our home i would not say that we have shit on everyone else's which part specifically troubles you most is it the fact that the town might be without power for a little bit they can adapt they have to adapt people have to adapt and that creature down there he's doing better you can't have a society built on slavery well there were a lot of innocent people in that death hole and they're alive because of you jester's mother is better off because of you alfield is better because of you-- you have done a lot of good well they attacked us well we can't leave without a crew this works out for you you were going to get a boat know where you want to go these crackers are terrible that's why it's a bad cracker who here cannot change their appearance you that's it okay you've got the boat we would be exhausted what about pulling into a cove outside of the city a couple of miles and walking in we can either pull the name off of the boat or alter it marisha and i am too quiet subterfuge instead of loud subterfuge which is what we've been doing maybe the crew turned on their captain and killed him on the docks and fled with his ship ja fjord can the boat just be adrift if a couple of us stay up in shifts to make sure that there are no enemies none of us know how to steer this thing except for fjord i think we just need to cool it why are you talking so funny sit up with me for a little bit we'll take the first shift you nott the brave laura and yeah late morning can i just take a moment with my goblin friend while they're sleeping come here look i want to show you something you want a piggyback skitter up you see the sun is coming up but you can still see one or two up there you see that one that's a planet that one that's another place today was a major clusterfuck everything went wrong we did all the wrong things no but do you know what worries me more is the feelings i'm getting from everyone in the crew they're a little despondent all of them i know that it didn't go very well but this is our new family right we want the family to stick together i think we need to-- oh you're over here i think we need to lead by example keep their morale up i think is all i mean we have done good things i know that the day was-- it was a day but we want this to keep going we care for these people ja we definitely need to think more than just wing it you know this group we get under each others' skin and we all egg each other on and we like to wing it so maybe we need to slow things down but i am serious the thing that i am worried most is they feel like it's fracturing and we cannot let that happen also are you mad about the swimming thing tell you when i'm going to mess with your head a little bit i thought it would help (whispering) they're losing their cool i don't know if you're joking or not but i'm going to do it and there really is another world fine independently it's a perception 22 that was good work i don't know couldn't the name of this boat be on a ledger or something somewhere but also the mist is printed on the side of the boat we have not changed that have we you're an artist how close to the shore do we get with the ship the ship proper you picked a sailor man jester has fixed the sail also the fireball went off the side of the ship so the edge of the ship would be burned okay the dockmaster is the one person who's in charge of the whole area how about mac 'n' cheese i would say that i look like a somewhat plump good zemnian boy blond and a little rounder ja a little bit don't make me run i'm full of chocolates i saw fjord talking to the wharfmaster so i will wait until fjord is finished and then i will go up and talk to him as well excuse me we have been doing very well on our travels at sea and we are looking to share the duties and want to hire a bigger crew i know there's many docks around here but why wouldn't i start here of course do you know-- is this a good place is there anyone who's looking for work right now we're going on a journey oh you know three or four or five or six weeks perhaps one-time job oh i'm so sorry did you cover that already excellent for real though like a real-world cap'n crunch carpenter captain so we need a boatswain what came between boatswain and navigator okay seafloor bounty do you know what this is reminding me of though is getting the crew for our keep in the last home game the rumor we're trying to spread is what they already think yes more often than a hundred years rumors only grow find that navigator did we find the rest oh 14 i do not was it within the last month then you have to tell me who it is she said orly you didn't confirm it yeah we'll walk there we need turtle power ja offer money from the get-go no just say your messages you put it your friends from the other night that's it eight left do you know who you're talking to we all look different from the last time that we have met we came to see you we talked about that we-- a man named-- we like the look of you we have a good job and big money a week yeah it's-- well i have 20 gold a full scottish send off when we leave it breathes better in open space nice nice nice rose gold roads it's just like roads off roading it or roading it sure there's tentacles on the map tgif flair is all that is ja of course we are the mighty nein not to be trifled with welcome to the mighty nein caduceus no she means your hands could it just be talk for instance there is a rumor of a ghost girl on the docks back in the menagerie coast we heard circulating this thing that you want to do this mission-- i'm sorry i overheard last night-- is there a place that it needs to happen or is it something that you will do wherever you go on the road beep mutiny wow this quinoa's pretty good 17 the perception check was for at night during a shift all throughout the whole day okay could we say that beau and-- look at fjord he is the captain now one quick thing you know i want to thank you you could have told any of these people anything about me and you have not i know you have every right to i hope you don't i don't know how all of them would handle it be that as it may i have something for you i bring frumpkin out in his new speckled elf owl form which is the smallest owl on the planet he weighs one ounce the tiniest little owl that ever existed this is a loaner you can have him for roughly a week no this is the way owls are supposed to be i place him he's going to listen to you yeah a couple rules he will listen to you will you listen frumpkin frumpkin nods okay if you need to get him out of danger in a hurry you say split that's what it will take you'll need me to bring him back but if he's in danger and you want to keep him for your week loaner you say split okay he's yours thank you yeah oh hey rub a little phosphorus on and-- send a globule of light 120 feet in every direction from the boat four of them to see if there's anything matt'll do it we've been doing therapy talks for two and a half hours matt has to wake up now we're on combat nein oh no i was saying no in german excuse me i did not roll a nine ja five 16 i'm sure some stuff was added to the ten how far up the mast could you say i could climb with my movement is that half speed okay how high does the mast go nevermind i will stand at the mast and i will pull a white feather out of my coat and trace a baleful glyph in the air and cast fear and they must make a wisdom saving at 16 anything within 30 feet of caleb enemies 16 wisdom save yeah that's it auf wiedersehen they have to be out of line of sight if they can see there's me on the boat-- that's what the spell says see ya you motherfucker max damage bop bop yeah high rolls come on beauregard caleb clutches his chest and cries out and falls to the floor of the boat (gasping) ja sure it's pretty good 20 (strained) that's not what i was expecting oh thank goodness you know i'm such a fearful person i'm always getting scared of things and that one was too much for me i look over at nott caleb is beet red beet red face matches his hair no we just need to not be attacked by anything anymore we need to just stop pursuing our pursuits and pick an island and stay there i feel pretty good i feel like-- this is feeling like it's going too far nott is it hot feels hot some bone broth maybe i rolled for him last week and he appropriately only has one hit point take a huff (pirate voice) dead men tell no tales i am not able to do that i start working on leomund's tiny hut it's going to take some time ten minutes 11 minutes yeah correction for me not 11 minutes 20 minutes still doing it i'm making the tiny hut but i don't know how much time has passed while i was peeing a ten-foot radius immobile dome of force springs into existence around and above you and remains stationary for the duration environment or weather can't get in so that's up to you if the ocean can get in or not it is totally transparent all of us can look through it and see into the ocean sam and eight hours i can certainly 20 minutes in advance get it going again as long as i can focus indefinitely the white flag yeah no more grog (excitedly) yeah boats in new york just lost
