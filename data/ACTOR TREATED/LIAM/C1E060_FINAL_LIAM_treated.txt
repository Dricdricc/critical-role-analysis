where we're going right because it's all the same as it was well i imagine we'd go to his home our home his home look at all those elves maybe we should do that first actually no he's a bureaucrat all right let's go see dad then it's this way and i start walking off towards dad's house fucking hate this place how long has that been no your accent is perfect don't change a thing it's easier than the actual name it's a little bit further than we thought we'd have to travel why the presence around the city we're seeing we understand why you fled but what's going on we've come to the feywild for something specific he and i are wearing fleeting rumors that one's got one hidden up his butt (laughter) syldor we have killed two of these dragons already nothing could please me more to hear that you are amassing forces here to go back that is possibly the greatest thing i've ever heard you say to me him or me don't worry we're not here to look for family that would entail some amount of investment on either our side or yours there is clearly none we are here to do business do you know where the bog is well some people go this way and some people go that way and some people go both ways honestly nothing we're not here to be friends or rekindle anything but it seems like we want the same thing in a roundabout way we want to end these dragons we want to return the world to what it once was any help you can give in spite of our past in spite of all the bullshit between us will be appreciated by more than just she and i it will that's right blitzen brimscythe you should've left us to be with our mother when she died look we're never going to be a happy family but if you want to make reparations help us on our path it will only help you on yours (stage-whispering) we're playing pretend now get in the canoe darth vader where did our sister go come here yeah just for a little bit though i know listen do me a favor keep scraping up those knees will you you crawl anywhere you want in this city the higher the better and listen to your parents some of the time but not all of the time listen to us you are not our half-sister you are our sister shit's a good word

politics he's not anything all that fancy tomorrow did we it's like northern alaska yeah we walked past some i think we should talk to some people and ask a couple of questions around town first just drop it in passing but you know blow a couple more spells just save it you can stay like that just walk close to me i don't think we should lead with that maybe work our way around to it well i would like advice other than this little hairy man for how to get to the bog yes g'day mate throwback thursday that's a good way to lose a finger buddy buddy (laughter) you probably recognize the two of us even if you don't know us we're syldor's children this is my sister vex'ahlia i'm vax'ildan thank you bog of eternal stench i believe it's not on a lark we're not a bunch of fly-by-nights we've already stopped to see vex's and my father over the last several months we have been dealing a little more closely than most would want with the conclave these dragons we know that you are struggling to do the same we have felled two of them and i don't say that to brag just to impress upon you how serious we are we've come a long way and we are in need of help thank you darling i think that the city's intentions are in the best possible place brings me a great deal of personal satisfaction actually i would like to offer our aid in service of the very same purpose and that bow in my sister's hands will go a long way to felling more of these beasts we know we're strangers but we read much wisdom and experience in your eyes and it would seem that you have encountered this place yourself or have experience in the past with those who have and we're just looking for an edge really ooh listen we know we're bastards clearly look into my eyes we share the same goal half of my blood is yours i want to kill the threat to your city and to all cities i ask with complete humility i know what i'm asking please using luck ouch i rolled the same thing low number twice no that's a big five no
