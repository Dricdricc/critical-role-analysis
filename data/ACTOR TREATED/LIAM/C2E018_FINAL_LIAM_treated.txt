still alive mom wait what what what i know it's so exciting it's so good it's so pretty it sounds so good it plays so good i played today and i just got my first dose of kaiju-god taliesin not regular-god taliesin kaiju-god taliesin it's good you face planted on the couch it's funny you go and try to pet her dice they shrink back they shy away (squeaking) just wear him down 20 i see this giant behemoth and i start backing up to go west around the stone under my breath singing we are the mighty nein the mighty nein the mighty nein and fire off a fire bolt as i sneak behind it no that is no good that is a 13 that is a one ja i am leaning crouching against that stone hands on the wall just listening and working on keeping my gourd from rising i'm behind the stone pressed to the back of it though presently correct it is at 14 at the moment well bring it on here we go what did it do it did to 19 i can do a reaction can't i i cast shield what did he roll travis and still hits because that only gets me up to 19 okay good that really hurt charlie i was considering going out there but i'm not going to do it i'm going to bend around the side and fire off another fire bolt at it at charlie that is a 12 to hit yeah i'm going to use my movement to back up behind that column ja ja (farcical czech accent) two wild and crazy clerics what's your max it's a quick thing tal full hp yeah you'll get advantage you have to intimidate his dick this is a long shot but i have no way of damaging him i'm going to pull out some sand out of my pocket and mutter a few arcane words and trail it in front of me and cast sleep back behind him here so it does not touch beauregard ja ja i know this is probably not going to work but i can't hurt him fuck good better 23 we're going round by round don't touch the giant yeah i will start moving towards molly and yasha as far as i can get i call out medium volume not to the crowd but to my friends that wasn't even supposed to work yeah don't touch him until we touch it so we need to get in a goodfellas circle around it to decide who's going to beat the shit out of him and don't touch it before that moment caleb says yeah i'm going to move back by where fjord is right now behind that column stand me by fjord to the north yeah i'll form the head whoever hits big hit first whoever can do the most damage with one attack should go first you gave him the die i pull my hood further down over my face what happens now do we just go home after this or is there some sort of soir√©e afterwards who is invited to the party are they totally visible to us what are their physical appearance the people that are with dolan what do they look like caleb they were the two that were just pointed out to all of us through the gates i think for a day or two everyone here is going to be very preoccupied in the city if there is anything you are thinking of doing it would be a good time to do it what i am suggesting is a compromise not leaving immediately but soon dm can you remind me what time of day it is on past days has pumat's place been open this late i am already hanging out by the door to this place i left 30 seconds ago is it really crowded in here are there a lot of people i am going to send frumpkin dancing around people's feet to follow yasha and beau and take a seat in a chair on the side of the room as close to the door as possible hass or ikithon i'm taking all this in first person that's all i can take i get out of it i lean forward and look at the ground maybe where you are from and how short a time you have been here yes you did yeah but you also dropped a horse apple in front of them as well she mentioned a little insight on the pending war when no one knows about the pending war during this whole talking i look in and see where my cat is okay i tell him to wait there for me how quickly are you thinking how about 24 hours from now yeah one more day just to get supplies and get ready for the road again i think what my friend is talking about is can you recommend any good ways to get into trouble what you will fjord's work are we talking about rolling at the pillow trove this evening is that what i am picking up on seven eight nine wait we're getting turnt up before we go to pumat's do you think pumat is going to be open at two in the morning we don't yes taliesin and very obviously holding and petting my cat and looking at all three of them as we walk by guten abend abend yeah that's-- excuse me apologies i pull beau backward by the arm and-- no long enough until we fall back a bit and wait to see that the group is not paying attention can you get me into that library tomorrow okay okay but the library is a thing that we can do before we leave this city i am just hoping to look at books is that all right good great no i mean spells you can find you know digging in 1000 year old laboratories i want to learn i want what is not readily available to all i don't know if that is something that i would be allowed to look at what kind of clearance do you have history okay this is good oh that's two times i've tried to bail out of this conversation uh well are you going to set the books on fire i'm going to read them is there anyone around but the handle gets-- i do the same thing with this cup i grab it by this the whole time how do you do it sam can i ask an out-of-character question as a citizen of the empire how much does caleb already know about the cobalt folk right you're a librarian their political affiliation what oh that's fine i leave the room and actually run downstairs and ask the front desk if they have another room how much is that excellent ja here you go i rolled a one are we done taking donations you know for 826 that's all done now right so now they're just straight-up bad about when this is happening i pull the wire out of my coat and hold it into my palmed hands and message to nott nott will you find an excuse to bring beauregard and yourself to my room you saw me go into if i eventually catch it i give nott the room number come in potentially you know we're leaving soon and beauregard has an in at one of the bigger libraries in the city and i want to go there before we leave yes but beauregard has given me a condition she had some questions for me and i would like to answer them but i don't feel right telling her and not telling you so i would love for you to stay here for a few minutes beauregard may i ask you a question to start how do you feel about the empire are you in favor of how things are going here are you comfortable with business as usual do you approve of how the empire is going is she lying to me about being not invested do i have to shout insight check or-- oh not super invested about how the empire is going i would like to get if my reading on if that is genuine or not yeah okay so liam asking a question and this is your choice it's just an idea that popped in my head could i request that everybody but sam and marisha leave the table yeah well i really want to go to the library tomorrow this may be a very stupid decision of mine would you be willing to leave with me tomorrow if i asked you to just the two of us i am going to tell you the story of how i murdered my mother and father when i was younger i grew up in a small township outside of rexxentrum called blumenthal my mother's name was una my father's name was leofric everyone was very excited about me when i was young i was bright and confident people used to say that i glided through life and everything just worked for me as i got older it became clear that i had a knack for the arcane everyone talked about this soltryce academy maybe i would go there someday the way they do things at that academy they don't take all comers they look for the diamond in the rough and every couple of years they find one but when i was a young man adolescent really they found three of us another boy and a girl and-- ja from blumenthal and we were accepted i was young yeah anyway we went there i studied for a year i worked so hard it came easier to me than the other two but they were also very accomplished there were other students from other parts of the empire there and a little over a year of learning all they had to impart i met a man named trent ikithon he became our teacher earlier when earlier tonight earlier a week ago what do you mean after a year of studying in the main school trent handpicked all three of us again and we left the school proper and went with him to a home out in the countryside where he trained us it was a good time we believed in the empire we were going to keep it strong he was cruel he hurt us a lot made us go through extreme circumstances but we got strong i also fell in love but that's another story yeah we rose through the ranks and it was the empire over all and eventually he wanted to test our allegiance so strangers were brought in-- traitors disgusting people traitors to this empire and we killed them mm-hmm we wanted to be yeah a few months of studying of a little bit of torture a little bit of murdering dissidents and traitors and deviants no we were ready to graduate and the last test of our allegiance was-- i'm getting ahead of myself i went on a trip home and visited my parents and when i was there in the middle of the night i awoke and overhead them talking and went to the stair and listened to them talk about revolution and tearing the empire down and i felt disgraced and shame for my family my mother and my father who were so wonderful to me when i was a child and were so happy for me to go to the academy and believe in the empire so much i went back to the school and when the three of us were summoned and told what was expected of us i knew what had to be done we went to this other boy's home first eodwulf and we stood by as he killed his parents we went to astrid's house and had dinner with them and she poisoned them then we went to my home and we grabbed a horse cart and in the middle of the night placed it against the door to the home and i set it on fire well yeah but it didn't exactly go according to that plan because as soon as i heard my mother and father screaming inside i was so sure i was so sure until i wasn't and i broke a bit no i went to an asylum for a number of years i broke i don't remember so well what happened to me there it was quite a number of years years later a woman was there and she another patient put hands on me and she took the clouds away she took it all away and not just my madness but the fake memories that ikithon put in my head of my parents wanting to betr-- yes yes but it doesn't matter because i still wanted to do it when i did it so what so what doesn't matter i should have-- i'm a disgusting person it doesn't matter anyway all that gone just like that i ran not right away i pretended like nothing had changed for several weeks she was stark raving mad 15 minutes later herself the woman who helped me i killed one of trent's people there and took this i pull out the necklace this has been keeping me hidden for years for five years they can find who they want but not with this they cannot find me i would really like to get into that library because i would-- hmm no i like you all well that all depends on you beauregard if you can keep a secret anyway which is well that's precisely why i want into this library among other things anybody can make lights anybody could send a message through a wire i want to bend reality to my will yeah well i told you why i am afraid of fire so you are going to bring me to that library both of those are appealing to me okay good i think nott and i are going to retire now maybe you can go get that food for the others yeah but you don't have to leave the table i'm not asking you to leave the table (laughs slightly hysterically) goodnight beauregard (door slamming) are you and i good i have an idea that can make that happen yes it will take a lot of hard work and a lot of books i pull out the silver thread and i start putting it around the room and go over some notes i have some ideas already some ideas i had and i will stay up another hour or two before going to bed we're still pre-sleepy time no i want to go to the bathroom thanks dad yeah we have to take a trip to pumat's for supplies and then-- pumat library we'll do library first then we'll pull matt (silly voice) hey you got your chocolate in my peanut butter it's a party girl did we hear that though the library that would be helpful i'm going to do the same thing that i did the other day i am going to cast disguise self and make the gigantic glasses and change my cloak to a similar shade of blue they would let you bring a mother and her baby into the library normally when we do mother's love nott stabs people hey this city's under lockdown can we go into the library me i am interested in the history of the greatest arcanists of all time ja caleb widogast i am looking for histories accounts of people who pushed the boundaries of what can be done over the ages the firsts i am interested in more than what is typical at least as much as can be known do you follow me ja that is true i am a magic fan what about the unexplained questions there is a certain amount of knowledge in the schools of this empire and then there are questions theorizing philosophy of the arcane excellent i shall go there next yes i start reading i will start with the first the oldest this one i am absorbing it i will read it cover to cover i'm a speed reader and an average novel takes an hour to an hour and a half for a speed reader to read i'm holding three tomes correct if i take a moment to skim ten minutes through each one and get the barest idea of what i would find inside each no i'm trying to figure out if i were to look at a couple of pages at once from three different books-- i want the furthest extent of transmutation and changing reality this was in one of these tomes then i will focus on that because i'm interested in that you know my main interests do i find anything of that in here i spend all my time with that book can you give me two more hours what about 30 more minutes i skim the book on the cerberus assembly i could say i'm muttering it under my breath similar name okay i will say that i got my fill i can feel this one's radiating-- i want to stay for 17 more hours but i'm ready to go i am good i am done thank you thank you caleb looks at the thousands of books that he did not read and leaves let's go find the others do you have any of that paper that i have been purchasing so much of could i purchase say 200 gold worth of it beauregard does not either i defer to the group i think we work well together and whatever you think's best what about your interests in the hall of erudition here and the academy yeah you know coasting is not a bad idea either there is not as massive a gain but there is not as high a risk for whatever this 10000 gold target is play it safe ointments which spelling are you using for that word a-w-k o-c-k you just made it three times as complicated in seven seconds i rolled a four four plus i've a constitution modifier what's everybody's hit points at what are the new totals the best thing ever where we're leaving off are we going to come back because it's the end of the day are we going to come back at the end of the day or are we going to come back next morning they're engrossed in leveling up this is the joy of dungeons & dragons
