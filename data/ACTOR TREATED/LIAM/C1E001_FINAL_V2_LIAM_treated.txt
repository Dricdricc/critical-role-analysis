bullshit our way in here or did-- yes you're getting ahead of yourself let's look around are there any dwarves in the vicinity tiberius make with the dwarf-talk please this is common that's all she does it's a nervous tic really how high is the ceiling here can grog fit in here i take a sack of gold out of my own pocket slam it down on the table-- gentlemens and ladies ladies and gentlemen we are traveling from far away we just arrived from emon we are fascinated to see your underground city and to celebrate the occasion i would like to buy every dwarf in here a round bartender let it rain (cheering) i'll need your largest bowl of ale for this one here we're pretty flush i think we can handle it sorry our dwarvish is a little thick near the-- save it for a rainy day adra may i ask obviously we have no dwarves in our little party sorry about that you're very welcoming we appreciate that how welcoming would you say the city is to outsiders would we stick out like a sore thumb we're not really interested in that we just want to see the city our business is elsewhere sounds like a dirty business anyway nostoc enjoy gentlemen and lady first die rolling nice yes i don't think we should try to go directly to the mines and find nostoc no i think maybe we should enlist the help of a dwarf here in the city to introduce us to nostoc i mean we're not trying to raise hell or bring down a thousand dwarves upon us you're the connoisseur steady as she goes ladies i disagree heat it up pay the dwarf we'll check out the house sure you can come with us just a moment pike you seem very distant it's very strange are you all right well the cleric's away the bard shall play oh percy is wonderful with calligraphy you've shown me yeah we'll pretend to take a stroll pose as a married couple just for the purposes of sneaking around the house i want to see what the area's like you come on to every human orc and half-elf in the entire kingdom but pretending to be my wife for 30 minutes is too much you're probably right okay so we'll take a stroll shop see what the area's like okay yes no we just want to look at the house i mean we're not going to go sneaking in in the day yes the architecture is divine lovey would you look at this dwarven home we definitely are visitors here sir no one has explained the rules to your city we were just taking in the fantastic architecture and history of kraghammer come along trinket there there's nothing to be scared of he's completely trained he does tricks doesn't he do tricks he's a sweetheart he's fine it's stunning we only heard about the building itself what can you tell us about the people who live here not liked by the rest of the city then nor us we prefer the company of good hard working people like yourself we're very impressed with the work the carvers do in this city from what little we've seen so far so hats off to you thank you we follow for a couple of blocks behind them for a bit yes -- split off yes we can split off are you making a sex check 20 i wave off from the alley that i snuck in to you do your shit that you do then i head back through the shadows you don't know what's going on there i've just arrived to new york city i'm going to smash the doors open yes just going to watch that's all do i see any security details see who's guarding the place no carvers or any sort of guard detail outside the house anything like that okay heavily heavily guarded by the looks of what's inside and what's outside the gate okay i'm going to head back to the inn then i'm not going to poke the bear hickies is that a gnomish std i definitely think we should take the diplomacy route the place is heavily guarded there seem to be lots of carvers i followed my sister downstairs i'm pushing my way through the crowd a one first one of the series everybody first one in the fog i somersault over some random dwarf and pull out my dagger but turn it around in my hand and whack balgus in the back of the head as hard as i can just to try and knock him out low light oh thank you 21 no oh that's no good oh i have advantage on the attack roll for this that's much better 26 plus regular 27 right in the base of his skull fuck bonus action to disengage disengage as a rogue oh no all right oh that's fine that's a 30 yeah look at that a fucking bear dance i beeline to the bar and say a large mug of ale please as soon as it's ready bring it right over to balgus i can fix this quickly looking for balgus in the crowd arm around his shoulder take this you are an impressive specimen my good man i have never had a fight that amazing in at least a week that was something to see here take this and after this one there's three more yeah persuasion you say 15 oh 15 i grab a half a mug of ale off the table and say dwarven compatriots we could not have expected a better welcome here in kraghammer we'll see you tomorrow night for round two thank you one and all it's just a misunderstanding i'm sure he's a lovely gentleman that's all right neither of us need a blanket now maybe we should-- go ahead i'm sorry perhaps we should all go to bed and the humans back in north hollywood should take a pee break at some point you you and you and you and you and me never entirely welcome in the company of elves or men vax'ildan learned at a young age to skip past formality preferring instead to invite himself in your door along with twin sister vex'ahlia vax was born by a chance encounter between elven royalty and human peasantry raised by their mother in their early years the twins were eventually sent off to their father in the elven capital of syngorn but their cool reception among the elves there never warmed and their time in the capital didn't last the siblings stole away one autumn night and set out on the open road after a few years of wandering they eventually decided to return to their mother and journeyed back to the lands of their youth but instead of finding their childhood home they returned to a pile of rubble their mother was gone their home burned to ash pressing the townspeople for answers they learned of the day the dragon came with their ties all severed vax'ildan and his sister set out to find their fortune together in tal'dorei an outsider since birth vax quickly learned to solve life's challenges in his own particular way often by sidestepping them entirely and when his knack for circumventing adversity isn't enough the way of blades the elves schooled him in more than makes up the difference i want a traditional dwarven breakfast what is going on as you can see we brought one of your citizens with us to show us a tour of the city on our father's good name we will bring you some of this that is a promise scanlan perhaps a little ditty on strings will ease our introduction as well as our dwarven compatriot to introduce us i think he's still listening to what end we all do matt i have one of the earrings and i say scanlan what exactly is the purpose for this little escapade and will it be ending shortly i would like to stress again that none of these dwarves are our enemies at all we just want to go have some words with greyspine well we do but she's very distracted and is not feeling herself she's feeling awfully bafta today so let's go get this drunk dwarf let's just do this directly i think in her defense they probably don't see flowers too often it's a nice touch okay work your magic i give vex a little push forward tap that motherfucker we've come to correct the wrongs that she's done and come to bring her home we are here to right wrongs and i promise you our business is finding her and returning home while he is talking i take a flask out of my cloak and approach the barrel and surreptitiously pour a little bit of it into the flask 13 i carry the flask up to his cup and refill it and say in my kingdom when a deal is set we drink together i would like not much but to pour us all a drink and agree surely this cask is weeks' worth of drink-- i can see it is a cultural difference my apologies you're one to talk i throw a dagger it's six with the plus it was a sudden attack man (sings) decapitation my sister's right in the face of the ogre correct excellent i'm going to take a run towards my sister since she's right close to him he's distracted so i'm going to turn just as i get to her so my back presses against hers and swing around and sneak attack two daggers up in his belly all right one then the other one i do a poison dagger gets a (singing) 20 that is dagger of venom 1d4 three plus two is five and then is the sneak attack damage go with-- critical hit too as well wouldn't it five plus- and the double goes to the sneak attack damage nine 15-- so 30 plus five 35 plus poison i'm running right now diagonally towards the wall and i press against the wall okay i start jogging backwards can i sneak attack while prone okay so that means one throw instead of two all right i feel so inspired by scanlan's bardic tunes-- okay 19 plus 11 is 30 yeah oh yeah the other one the other one is a 16 plus plus-- is a 26 i meant to say i was aiming at its eye the main head's eye all right four (counting) 20 20 times--is 40 plus four 44 that's the first dagger 44 that's just one four plus two is six is that sneak attack no okay just a reminder the daggers folks blink back to the belt on my waist it's gone for the people at home we live to hear matt say
