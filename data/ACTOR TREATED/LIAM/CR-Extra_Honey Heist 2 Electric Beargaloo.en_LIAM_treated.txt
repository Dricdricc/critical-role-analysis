to send them on up the road we'll leave the dicks alone can't hammer the dicks in gameplay terms is there any way to get the dick back up it's an age-old problem oh careful that dick is moving it's just like waffle and my grandpappy said jiggle it a little it'll fit got to be tender sometimes and sometimes you got to be hard oh so you're game devs as i'm standing here watching my friends play

than a bear getting stuck in a hole i love it so much oh my goodness so it's a five-digit code somewhere between salmon and bamboo all right and that's whole of what you know well we got waffle he's pretty smart so i'm sure he's going to figure it out direct who's rufus this is-- this is not-- this is not proper roleplay this is not proper roleplay it's pretty accurate it only could be more accurate if she was reading it off of script papers taped to our chests i bet you wish you could control me like one of your fucking muppets with your hand up my ass huh it's an emotional day it's cool to partake he offered for us to get some more honey i mean i got some but you can never have enough what about something to beat a bear over the head with who're talking to the who like a

badger don't give a shit you got a dark side tuxpin sure enough yeah strip this bear i want to put on his clothes oh yeah between salmon and bamboo that's it this dumb fuck has got it in his pocket instead it is salmon bamboo salmon salmon bamboo it's true it's hard to tell which side is up i think this is it maybe it's that there's four options that's only in their comics keypad so-- i mean i think that-- you're the brains by the by do i look like a ninja and shit now is there enough pieces to put together something like that like a tandem bike yeah and trinket's been hanging out with

all those beauregard comic books i read as a kid and i'm going to take him around the neck i'm going to bear-kour across the wall and then try to slam downward and bring him down to the ground so that waffle can question him that's a success i was in it matt i was in it he's all yours bro-bro don't worry it's just the tap you will if they meet their goal we good here waffle i tap him in the nose
