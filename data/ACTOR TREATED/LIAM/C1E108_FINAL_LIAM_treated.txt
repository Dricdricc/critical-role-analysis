you look handsome in any hair wow look at all that white and pink oh the artist ioana muresan who is a long time critter and has done a lot of art for our show and we love her and she did such a amazing job thank you look at this it's got gilding on the sides everything shines i'm not going to play i'm just gonna look at these they added horshack back into the cast that's a reference that nobody in the audience got yeah i know how much older than you i am i know that i had just poofed the wings out and i think i was inspecting one of the big metal men before it came out of the wall i don't really remember which they didn't man-e-faces around i'm misremembering that maybe i just really like man-e-faces oh sorry i was looking at a book 18 sorry all right to start am i within striking range of him if i back up a little bit yeah do i need to disengage okay so that i'm that close okay i'm going to use my bonus action to hunter's mark him and then i'm going to stick him in the face is what i'm going to do so that's 30 for the first and for the second 30 for both yeah because i'm at advantage because i'm going before them all right so the first one which will get the sneak attack fun is ten plus psychic damage is 16 plus sneak attack damage (counting) 38 for the first plus hunter's mark 44 for the first and for the second is one that's it is one plus the hunter's mark again right so it's only for one attack because i don't use it all the time every time so five for the second just five wait that's not true sorry 11 because it's not an offhand attack it's my second paladin attack i'm going to risk an attack while i'm not hasted i'm going to risk an attack and back up about ten and go up another 15 18 plus 12 just barely hits escher man is down i love being able to see everything percy's turned into rambo but he got pushed what a fool yeah hide yourself under the coals this combat just got a lot sexier all right i want to slam down right-- yes all right slam down right by that one's head straight down to the ground take a split-second to look up at the watery druid shake my fucking head stab stab right into its face yeah okay so the first one is a 33 yeah and the second one is 28 all right so he's prone he's at disadvantage i'm going to dump smite into both of these yeah (counting) 36 plus the smite which is 32 39 for the first and then for the second hit is two six eight plus the smite eight ten 12 then so with the way hunter's mark works is i can move it to another as a bonus action can i get it over to the one by grog oh jeez 90 feet okay so i should have a little bit of movement left so i'm going to shoot back up high-five my girlfriend on the way and go as high as i can in the room i'm only 60 feet because i'm not hasted wings okay awesome the tarot cards but coffee and wyrmwood are the two best things so you're mixing the two best things (yelling) i'm going to land down next to the other one and start looking in the same fashion across the room 27 oh that's how you do it i push on my sister's shoulder blades (groaning) i barrel-roll out of the way hey scanlan you want to use your dragon fisting friend to put that pyramid in the coals and heat it up and then shove it back in do you want to use bigby's hand to take that pyramid shove it in the coals heat it up and see if that makes a difference shove it back in hot well maybe the pyramid heated up could make a difference finish my stupid idea and then we'll move onto the next stupid one i fly over i'm deathwalker's warded to fire and i'm going to start helping why don't you make their dreams come true and rip their groins off that is a really good macaroni art you've made it's so good that's a boat right i am i creep up past my sister and place a hand on his knee which is in my fucking face i can get in there sure you want me to get a look thanks for watching everybody that's the end of tonight's show oh my gosh can you add any of your secret sauce to my sneaking never mind i'll be fine do i need to do an additional stealth creepy is automatic it's a given okay natural 20 if he's here and i'm over here can i fly up just there so i can see the front of him a bit the angle of his face if there is one anything to see or is he facing out towards us never mind then shoot nice float in space and do that no from where i am i'm not making noise i'm not flying closer to him i'm just doing this whatever you want to do okay i'm going to fly back to the gang could you pick this fuzz off my face i couldn't get it off the whole time it just keeps re-affixing i don't know i flew in and out so what do we think we're doing here are we talking to this thing can i get another quick re-rundown of the room so he was up at the top of the stairs facing out not moving and was that wall behind him or does it go further past him at all and when i got in there i didn't get close enough to see if there was any good hiding spots beyond him 24 do the talking thing i'm going to go back in and dm how long were we in this room it's been an hour my wings then are-- actually i'll throw out that i crept back in ahead of that so in there hiding i'm going to down a potion and then a quick question too hunter's mark has a duration of an hour but since that last battle lapsed am i then not allowed to slide it to this guy come on vacation scanlan that's all right we did our due diligence we poked it and we prodded it it's the best shirt this very shirt this one i know you so i'll ask you later too he's going to hit you like he is at a driving range 20 jeez oh jeez you know what i tell you what i'm going to do i'm going to run over right next to keyleth right i know what i want to do here is percy within 30 feet of me okay i'm going to cast bless on scanlan keyleth and percy you're so capable you bless up to three creatures of your choice within range whenever a target makes an attack roll or a saving throw before this spell ends the target can roll a d4 and add the number so you three that's my action i have a bonus action this is an intimidating map matt i am going to roll backward and sit underneath my sister and her judgemental ass yep fuck yourself wow nope it's so exciting wow that was fast and this is a straight-up attack yeah i believe that hits yes it does wait i'll use my last luck of the day on him and he has to reroll wait ooh do you have a big dick too that demigod does not exist in this universe oh the golem is dead damn it what where did the big guy go there he is can't get the golem but you can get the cricket making up for the last time fine give it to me i can uncanny dodge yes just uncanny dodge so maybe i can cancel out his doubling yeah uncanny dodge halves the attack so it'll be right where it's supposed to be uncanny dodge not good 14 okay i would like to cast vow of enmity on this dick which will put me at regular because i would get advantage versus the disadvantage of blindness so now i'm at regular oh wow i've got it here okay instead i'll use my bonus action to cast hunter's mark visual on that as well okay got it never mind it's not his turn yet wow okay i'm going to use my bonus action to disengage i can move five ten 15 20 25 30 and i'm going to get the fuck out of here five ten 15 20 25 30 there and that's it i'm fucking blind and i ran because i can't see shit done he's coming to finish me off look at this motherfucker hey you're blessed so add 1d4 plus 1d4 well he's strung us along on several battles to get all of our juice out man boy it sucks doesn't it buddy good go to the 250 hit point guy good call this is such a shit-show love it hey that's my magic trick oh he's dead he's dead matt game over blessed hashtag blessed bigby's hand where you at big guy oh i love you so much holy shit captain planet ac is 29 hashtag blessed though he's already at a negative because of bigby he's on death's door guys we got him your hair is so white you're like steve martin without the ukulele i'm just so turned on by you if any of those miss you're blessed (whispering) yes yes percival you broken bastard bring it i have no fear hits uncanny dodge halve it okay halved that gets me to 18 i hate holding my turn because i don't understand it if i hold my turn i can only attack when it gets back to me right can i hold my turn to cast vow of enmity until i can see again i'm going to hold my turn until i can fucking see to cast vow of enmity and attack i'm going to do fuck all without it yes that's what i'm doing this guy can get anywhere he has shown us that he can get anywhere on this map there's no point going anywhere no i'm going to stay put that's what i'm doing i've already called it can anybody do an attack of opportunity and then can i get an attack of opportunity even though i'm holding i have no idea okay so i had him flanked with grog right because he was right between the two of us so down to regular attack good that hits that's 18 plus a lot plus 14 that is 11 plus psychic damage is 13 plus these fuckers (counting) 35 yeah maybe because i cut a bit can i see now so now i can do my held turn am i within ten feet i'll move forward a bit okay but he's near-- well wait is he within ten feet of grog would you say his foot well i'm going to save it then i understand that i'm weighing multiple options dear no i will cast vow of enmity i'll cast it on my bonus action then attack attack to attack right to attack which was to cast vow of enmity and not to attack as well vow of enmity (scoffs) yeah and i've already used my uncanny dodge in this round i think yeah so mine is 44 for me blind wow that's you and you and scanlan what's your save what did you roll is grog close enough for flanking for her yeah that hits this is within the same round by the way low hits don't even bother i'm unconscious there's a lot of rules and a lot of math it's a big book travis has a job another job must be nice good natural 20 am i at zero hit points and stable or one hit point and stable love it but we're not at the top of the round right we're still mid-round correct kick a gnome movement dash action to grab him i have had a jackrabbit knee under the table for ten minutes point of clarification we're at the top of the round so i just went from one hit point to two hit points safe at two no one can touch me yeah right it makes remote play not quite as removed let me do a little roleplay here oh baby come on captain planet kiki it's yours wait i don't need it wait the massive gash across my entire body as you stand there for 30 seconds starts to close that's gone as soon as he's done fighting that's a half hour yeah that was hard do i with the fire on the deathwalker's ward 25 back at the temporary 137 due to the feast going with her to do the same investigation why don't you and i try shorthalt you got any bigby's left in you he could do one we could get him up there can you bigby one and maybe vex can slowly pull grog up to that thing on your broom this just turned into an aerosmith video grog if you do this i will give you something really cool really cool yours work that play-doh come on i don't want to do that with everybody here i'm not lying to you it's really cool later i promise edge yeah 18 for me i dropped my travel mug do we need to do this right now can we take nappies and come back you would have a whole other batch of inspirations in the morning it's a big iron pendulum swinging around
