sam riegel you are against the law friday there it's just 12 tracks of whale song (whale song) (whale songs) after we choose them on the break he's an og d&d player though right like decades of dungeons & dragons always checking me in my rolls on my choices in the game who i talk to on any given afternoon it is all i hear about i'll do what i want brian it's d&d welcome sure yeah we have met a lot of dead people no i know who you're talking about when we left the orc camp and we headed out into the snow-- it was close to when we found tyriok without an arm it's d&d it is a dungeons & dragons game i listen to them read their notes this is like when you're on a level in a video game and you run around and around and around you can't find that thing that triggers to the next section of the video game well he knows a lot of people shaun could you send one of us there is that possible by any chance because if one of us goes with the gatestone keyleth can jump over she can see trees there she can tree her way back here i mean i don't know i'm spitballing yeah all right where's your great idea chickens with our heads cut off eh now's as good a time as any yeah one too many though isn't it i swore she said eight or eight along with her you know we always take her and leave you why don't we flip that best you can tell it's shit-balls it's not a town it's-- we're protecting the world do you want to hold up pike as we walk closer (air horn) did we just find your achilles heel man of a thousand voices animals creatures-- can't do horns i don't do horns they sicken me you're the worst yes but i mean scanlan until we are ready to pull the trigger-- once a day yeah that makes sense that's time well spent (laughter) you'll get a swirly forthwith yeah soon now that you've brought us there do you think you could get us closer stuff and things well that's not a bad idea we're thinking about tomorrow though as well in the morning yeah could you take the two of us keyleth to see if there's anything of use see if there's anything to be gleaned from a bird's-eye view (shouts) what (shouts) sure not enjoying the view i start to look down around is there anything is there anything we didn't see coming up or is it all plain to view 23 at the 59 minute mark i fly over and sit on the back of my sister's broom yeah they could throw out one of those flare-like gem-y thingies ring a bell any of those you want to take us down this broom always rides up my ass when i ride on it yes they are ow getting close though yeah what yeah kill 'em or die trying 22 shirtless covered in soot syngorn it feels like it's a risk but the most bang for our buck our gold piece is syngorn there's the most people there yeah that's what it felt like when we were there allura did you ever meet with our father in emon tofor long white hair syldor michael j fox when you write to our father will you tell him his children need him it's like she's putting on a vr helmet that's not a bad idea we're hoping to tempt him here can we go back to the plan about how we intend to get thordak here we were playing with the idea of fooling thordak into thinking that raishan had been killed and that's it we think that's going to pull him out do you think raishan would be willing to let us hack off a little bit of flesh to send asoon and you can't leave because you're building or can you go something like a claw or something to drop at thordak's feet it'll help with the bluff i think it's a bad idea i don't think we have time if we're all alive in two weeks i'd be happy to go and get armor for pike but there's dragons on top of our backs right now we've also totally spilled our spaghetti with raishan she's not going to wait she's going to push things forward i don't think we have time i think that we talk to raishan these two chuckle-heads convince her to let us take a pound of her flesh or ten somehow dump it insultingly at thordak's feet and brace for the worst i mean there's nothing else we can do today is there gather ye rosebuds while ye may vox machina is dying yeah and you said we can instantaneously jump over grab him and shift-- scanlan can you turn us into a bunch of hummingbirds or something i should feel bad that's a big if i have a sweater i've hidden it in manhattan go find it (laughter) the gatestones no of course we'd have to get a message to her to tell her that you big lovable lug i still think it's a very bad idea i'll go if you all want to go kind of hot i'm setting my armor to fire resistance it's also i amass everything and i couldn't get in all the awesome even into what we put into the slideshow in the episode and in the gallery on geek & sundry today there were so many good costumes and we're blown away by-- i mean it was a massive amount i'm going to cheat i'm giving mine to @missbelletrist and @miss_riahne for doing vex and vax throwing money around and flipping daggers and climbing trees great photos great costumes great attitude laura and straight out of central casting so those are our personal picks and we also all picked a third place a second place and a first place (dramatic voice) overall winners here they are number three (normally) @kwwins who is also an artist for us all the time was chosen for number three for her minxie/keyleth transformation pic number two goes to @norfrosch who did the amazing victor with crazy eyebrows and in first place-- loot crate yeah so for an amazing percy in bird mask both an amazing photo amazing costume-- amazing weapon @calahammer is our first place winner (cheering) so jenga means i fucked up my name is vax and super jenga means we have to link hands and bounce 27 genies because you have the gift of gab this is the weirdest day (stan lee voice) greetings true believers i'm patting scanlan on the back and wiping his mouth do we see anyone who looks remotely like us who's not from the fire plane here we are in a city where everyone is going to despise us the servants the humans and i don't know if there's any elves dwarves halflings or anything in the mix but people who are not from here how does their health appear are there any humans around right now who look like they're not slaves who look well-off relatively i'm bringing you a new shirt for your birthday man travis and holy moly bring it back people i'm specifically looking for a human who is not a slave who looks reasonably well off anyone who looks like they're not a servant who looks like they're maybe getting by well 22 so it's these two strange beings with strange eyes and a tiefling oh okay so one is one and one's another thank you i'm going to walk up to the tiefling like ten feet away excuse me sorry can i trouble you for a minute i've just come to town i know that sounds ridiculous it is i'm a stranger in a strange land could i borrow you just for a minute that's a 20 they're together right all right so i trip along behind them and then i turn around and to the group i go-- yeah where are they leading me i'm going to wave them away a little bit just put it all out on the table roll high come on (clears throat) yeah i was hoping for a little bit of advice about town this is starting to feel a little kinky where are we going i don't need to talk that bad where are we going yeah follow you to talk right now okay yeah what the fuck are we doing percy we're going to go in the alley up ahead to the right i'm going to stealth before going into the alley i mean i don't know how dark this is are we in broad daylight yeah okay (laughter) okay so no changing in lighting in the smaller alley and how far away from the other group are we at this point all right i stop her and stop at the corner and look around do i even see them if i look around the corner yeah we saw them dart to the right i don't know what's in there i go running in with my eyes closed that's how i do well what i would have done was-- yeah there are fights on every corner is it tight enough that the two strangers are smooshed in as badly as we are this is a little more than i think i was asking for but what is there to see in the city of brass so we're out of sorts we're not from here obviously hi that's my sister you can tell because she looks just like me you don't look like many of the larger folk-- thank you dear-- that we've seen around here either are you from here are you strangers here that those aren't pillows maybe we could do a bit of business percival you were looking for a jeweler right all right it's really starting to smell like grog in here so why don't we go-- all right i mean everybody in this city wants us as slaves so it's not really any more dangerous in there than it is-- you have a distaste for the wyrm sure go for it if this goes south we can just wrap it up you don't even want to hint at what you're looking for you cheeky bastard matthew mercer i'm going to slip on my ring of invisibility and spend the next 20 minutes attuning to it my boots have gone slack he didn't chain me though right am i chained there's no invisible floating chain is vex chained i tweak her nose and give her a wet willy and then dart six feet back we'll grab ashley run into the fire plane the armor will be right there for her visit and then it'll be done one shot it's better when you're here
