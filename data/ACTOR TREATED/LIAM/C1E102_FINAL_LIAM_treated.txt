sold you heard it here first why limit myself to just one did your character in the time jump go to the feywild or go sailing on the sea we need to share it with the world laura just leveled up and her attack bonus went down figuring it all out yeah shambling zombies and we learned that it does something too from ghouley deads specifically and stay low-key we don't need to go marching 18 too big does it look like it's just happening in our direction or is it coming toward us or taliesin jaffe so this is osgiliath right it's wrecked ruin no complete buildings or are any of them we've seen long-dead people this is fucking creepy in the upside-down (airplane noise) worth it these bodies compared to the ex-champion of the raven queen do these bodies seem even older more decayed do we have any sense for how old these fuckers are how far off are they i'm not going to go i'll wait yeah no one poking out ahead for this i'm feeling foresighty can i creep up behind and do the same would that be an even roll then since i have advantage on everything oh that's going to fail ooh 18 24 (grunting) 24 cursory trap check even though it seems unlikely 19 wait till you see the sprinkler system you summoned cosette (singing) there is a lady all in white are we talking dragon size you are a terrible stage mom by the way is it still after her or has it given up on that ghost still a cat and a flashlight yeah we can just go hopping from building to building 39 building to building toward the tower well we'll find out let's make a break for it and are we without a trace and dust of tracelessness that's just a one time why don't the half-elves go real quick just to stay small and quiet no clanking no crushing you take a look at the wall and then we just call everybody up just two seconds if it's the way to go so the change in the wall's about 60 feet but the wall from our hiding spot is how far away from us i think it's fine we're good we found it looking through the door can we tell how deep and the moment he makes a ruckus the air squad is coming down on our location immediately one question is if these stones are used to pull this tower into the main realms is there another purpose to them here or is that doorway safe is what i'm wondering i feel like we should go through the wall or over it just on principle kiki would you be able to great escape us underneath this wall i think so we're not trying to get all the way there just past this if i don't look he can't kill me you're running come on i'm going to say that i didn't leave the other side of the wall when i realized that she wasn't coming through so waiting right in front of scanlan i'm three feet away from you welcome back scanlan shorthalt i could probably ride him and if shit goes south i could get away by mr mistoffelees we don't know what we're talking about which is why i think the idea to go scope it out is a good one the tower is it obscured by all this shit happening on top of it vex can see there's no windows can we see if there's a rooftop to it at all is it this is it this or can we not see and we're walking and we're walking three times for a bunch of days let's burn down manhattan how do you do that for what what's the plan here man you're really far away from anything fucking nice pike got dragon aged wait there's a little bit of skull right there all right yeah what do you think's going to happen in an hour everything's going to kick off in an hour where's your pet let's go find some shit out time's a-wasting scanlan let's go i nestle in behind scanlan let's ride maybe the prettiest wyrmwood box ever i squeeze the gnome tighter that's okayish 34 a low 34 now that we're closer i'm looking for windows that she might not have been close enough to see doors holes anything yes sir hey it really just depends on the day 26 mother bitch but some are left a lot of motherfuckers just died on the top of that tower you felt that how much time left on that hour buddy we've got to go no we should not do that we could i just don't feel like freeballing it right now and i'd really like the group clearly we are the most as the kids say op let's get back to the group saw a lot of fucking people just die on the top of that tower i can't guarantee it but i think it's a safe bet that your girl delilah is up there yeah there was some sort of massive pulse of energy 20-something hooded figures just dropped dead on the spot a wave of some shit blasted through us what else are we doing here we're weighing risk here what do we think would happen if we spent an hour having that feast right now no there was a ringleader but we were too far out yeah precisely three (laughter) we were 100 yards out or something also the idea that we're going to sneak into that tower is farfetched even if it fails the fight will still come to-- either we bring the fight to them or we rip down the tower and bring the fight to us i'm just going to throw my vote in the ring here that i think we should take the time for the feast you know we're not killing piles of rats in the sewers here this is serious it is largely gofibepo it's also unsettling as fuck right probably for you all yes beeline to the tower is it concentration and you can still fuck shit up while you got that earthquake going right are you just doing earthquake the whole time or are you just standing there staring at the ground but you're not lightning anybody's ass not doing anything like that you're focusing on the tower that's really big all right all right let's teleport inside that dragon come on that's the plan mythcarver you used mythcarver to pull a little rascals hey guys it's the third time scanlan has used mythcarver (laughter) i'm also going to say some time in the last several hours i don't remember what the armor is set to to necrotic you all look like my sister it's fucking wild fuck the normies also wondering how we're doing in the gloom stalker department but it's delilah briarwood tower still needs to come down no one walks away start walking we're not sneaking up on shit i'm going to shoot up and past by quite a bit i'm going to say that i'm about 80 feet in the air just off-center towards vex and keyleth but just off-center i'm going to say i'm there straight up someday we could have a game with two beholders on our side those are my platforms i can take them back anytime i want when was the last time we went to bed no i mean like right before coming i can't remember the last time we had a full rest okay i think i have all my lucks that's why i'm asking not 100% sure i know it girl 16 16 sylas broomstick-up-his-ass death knight briarwood guys we've got to start the new campaign sometime we're going to die yep that's hot god damn it 18 it's paralysis it's a big fuckin' headlamp flipping those pages and i said biiiiitch vax on the ground just starts going (unintelligible yells) i'm shaking guys got to squeeze my spiky dice to wake up holy shit grog to do what all right so i'm at disadvantage but i have advantage so it would be one straight roll oh so no it is 21 when the daggers are out and my daggers are in my hands i mean i don't know this is kinda loosey-goosey all right then i'm at 20 familiar gotta fucking attack that bitch fuck you sylas i'm going to attempt to roll a natural 20 i know it's not a natural 20 though which is what it's going to take i'm going to use luck 18 and a 19 plus two gets me to 21 i need a natural 20 luck no okay jesus balls sounds good (singing) we'll fucking lead as two kings it sounds like she can't cast spells too well he could just evil monologue a little bit tell us his plan good night i can't it's an automatic fail because i'm paralyzed she probably kind of likes it where did sleep go vax is watching frozen well we weren't technically dating when we killed her so i'm not really sure if she'd know yeah but that fireball was super low halved from the deathwalker's ward it's set to necromantic oh well then i'm down i said this was the last episode and i meant it the initiative is grog pike vax right now let's get a god in here light or dark meat i don't care one or the other get one of those ladies in here pickle time i was just about to say this is revenge for demogorgon disintegrate you can find him i'm gone there's no finding me i'm gone (vacuuming noises) (laughter) plus the inspiration i never did a single thing in this fight there's also a superior healing potion lying on the ground amongst all my shit boots his voice says from beyond the grave he'll be finger of deathing me double-time your extensions look good but i feel like that is i love you so much like a dog at a fire hydrant eat a dick feywild spring break motherfuckers do it scanlan do it shorthalt's back (fake crying) you sadistic motherfucker you cut it right there i was okay until right then i was okay until right then what else were we going to do set up an orange julius stand by that tower of course we were going to go into that tower number one lesson the one takeaway tonight the one takeaway is just how op vax'ildan is (laughter) you did great you've got one chance to do something fucking amazing last thursday
