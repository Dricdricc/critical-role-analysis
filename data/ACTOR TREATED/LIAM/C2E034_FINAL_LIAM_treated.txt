i liked long-haired sam we hold hands the whole time what are those things coming out of the shell green tubes what do they do caleb widogast (makes farting sound with chair) (laughter) tell us a story orly it's just called the sluice i'm trailing him yep trailing do you live in these parts or are you just passing through apologies did we catch your name oh my name is caleb widogast caleb widogast and this is my friend fjord well not specifically to fjord but to our group we are an odd bunch a collection of people so you know we tend to get our noses in things when we need to be at sea we have fjord when we need to crunch numbers we have me and we have others as well ja two only do you have room for-- well it's just six right now this is certainly possible you are heading back to marquet you say we'll keep it in mind oh also i'm sorry if i could round back for a moment to that tower i know you don't know much but it sounds like you've been here longer than we have have you heard anything about it it's so odd agreed yeah we sailed with her vox machina sailed with her yeah have i ever heard of this boat in all my readings completion the full set what are the odds pretty slim what are you doing here immediately you need to get on a boat today tomorrow or-- could we get a couple bottles of wine over here please fine wine you know i've changed my mind the price on that-- give me the two buck chuck please for the basic bitch wine correct you're feeling a calling it's probable it has not been verified yeah you know your standard angry creeper oh no i'm still struck by the fact that you have walked into this tavern where we are it means something is what i'm saying ja he was crucial in us getting the three of you out it is funny how you keep showing up though like a bad penny as soon as the animals come out i go to talk to the barkeep from the bar it seems very doubtful excuse me you know i'm still working on the first one but i love your establishment-- ja i will take a backup you are correct while you're pouring i had a question for you my friends and i we have just rolled into town and while we were walking through we noticed this very strange tower here it's so bizarre what is that place that grows and shrinks when you walk toward and away from it don't know the name just being casual you know i ignore her like usual well it's just that it changed-- oh thank you-- it's just that it changed proportions the closer we got or further away from it it didn't seem natural whose is it that's it he's a mystery to the city i suppose you have to be a jackass to climb a tower like that it's just ripe full of danger she's you know a crass idiot don't mind her but-- this close good job asshole well thank you for your time he pours his glass out on the ground out of the bartender's view subtle thank you very much for your time you're yelling at me from across the bar not in a german accent marisha or sleeping perhaps also speaking from experience sometimes when you're very focused on a task it can create a blind spot that's the worst shit that's ever been said on this show this is totally the diner scene in pulp fiction now that's true you could piggyback maybe ask a few more questions in a few other places besides dive bars have we been led to the boat yeah i'm leaving them and i'm going to sit in the boat i'm pulling out my book and i'm slapping it down and i start to mutter to myself this is going to take a while with all this dicking about how long would you guestimate i've been muttering in the boat ten minutes okay a fucking stick up the back although to be fair i've seen this many times at st patrick's day parades in new york-- (slurred) excuse me officer this is so painful i feel like i should make a concentration check on my spell i'm casting find familiar and i'm changing frumpkin's shape octopus nott the brave are you coming with us come on i saved a seat up by me and frumpkin i have frumpkin slither his way onto nott's back and do a cozy hug from behind over the shoulder not on the head no because that's weird so just over the shoulder and then the tentacles tickle her face and stuff that's the joke can i assist by throwing frumpkin into the water and looking frumpkin go take a look at that if you wouldn't mind (splash sound) down towards it and i have my hand on nott's shoulder doing that thing do frumpkin and i see anything alive or moving down here pretty good 18 how far apart are each of the bars i think my octopus could probably squeeze through that (plopping sound) yeah did they seem rusted i'm going to urge frumpkin on further to see what we can see frumpkin has dark vision up he goes darkvision yes yeah crests up and pokes his eye nubs out of the water looking for anything moving here while we're up here so he's come through a second set muttering all this as it happens this is all water i'm going to speed him back to the first grate and have him took for the locking mechanism if there is one that's investigation or through an octopus that's a 14 i think you said last campaign that you can hold the air for one spell possibly okay so he will swirl away and go back to the second and do the same look around ja okay all right buddy i'm sending him forward and i do past-- you said it goes now straight that way not able for frumpkin to squeeze through that i'm guessing i'm imagining i am not summoning a gigantic octopus and that would be strength-based yeah because it doesn't say on his thing that is a nine that's true it's only his second time okay buddy forget that back it up is there anything unique about the pillar down here or is it just basic stonework are frumpkin and i able to tell if this goes water all the way to the ceiling of this chamber or is it water with air above or it's all water okay is there anything out of the ordinary if he pokes his head up out of the water 17 you could always punch the wizard in the head at any time okay so back on the boat i just say i have gone very far with him and it just keeps going what do you guys want to do i can't hear any of you so tap me if you want me to keep going one time tap me or two times if you want me to pull frumpkin out i said one or two i don't know what that means what are we doing pull him back then i would tell him then to swim back if we in our game are allowing connection as long as it's not broken i would just tell him to come back i mean i could also if we want to hang a little longer i can just send him you know i don't want him to be squished but i can send him as far as he can go to see what he hits it's up to you yeah of course frumpkin is now like a backpack on yasha's back that really sounds like a euphemism while they're rolling i grab nott's shoulder and turn on the jacques cousteau camera on yasha's back my constitution must be low mine's three yeah just like i told you they made it through the second grate i can see i think it's a better idea for us to stay together nott you know this is a recurring thing and i think we should-- what is going on what is this yeah but what if we need to go through water mostly but right now we need to let me make a suggestion and i cast suggestion i think you should just try it one time and see how it goes and if it goes well then we know that you are good for the future yeah we are-- and all she does is eat fish and do push-ups i think she'll be good underwater it's the booze talking it's technically it's slightly cocked it is cocked so this is a bit of a problem because nobody thought of the dog and that's why i knew it was a bad decision to purchase it in the first place because now we are stuck with a dog so what do we do caduceus what do you think you're speaking in sylvan correct ja i'm listening in sylvan in sylvan caleb says if it goes wrong pup you know bamf out and in and maybe that'll buy you a little more time i don't care let's go (splash) oh yeah i'm here i would have beat caduceus here because he was struggling i'm so proud of you you made it all this way do you know what the good news is you're going to have that feeling for the next seven hours and 50 minutes make an insight check (laughter) also there is a small grate just down here frumpkin was not able to get through it but maybe one of you two ladies could bust that open it's right over there octopus yeah i did while they're discussing i point at frumpkin on yasha's back and snap him out and then submerge myself by that small grate and look and keep my hand above the water and snap again and frumpkin is past the gate on the other side of it the small grate that we couldn't get open so he's on the other side (singing) best lay ever 13 what did you get ash no i have the transmuter's stone set to dark vision caduceus you can see yeah okay so i was looking down towards this grate under the water and i heard the room go to hell behind me and hear the splashing where beauregard is so i move in that direction yeah i take it yeah so i stumble forward and i'm reaching into my pockets and i pull out the iron powder and i throw it into the air again and i go (whoof) with my hands and beauregard enlarges within the grasp of this thing yeah but with advantage on strength checks now and i will go as far into that corner hiding between fjord and the corner if i'm able to what about fjord his swim speed is his movement speed added damage she lit it up (effeminate voice) what's that travis what's that bde what you numb your own tongue with that one okay i'm going to move into that corner and i'm going to rifle into my pockets and pull out a small snake's gut peppered in powdered rhubarb leaf and i stick my hand out and point at the one messing with my human friend over there and i take the snake's gut and i pull it back like i am drawing a bowstring as i mutter and i let go and cast melf's acid arrow ja that is correct melf m-e-l-f you love it that is a 23 to hit yeah (counting) nine points of acid damage it doesn't say anything at least in the d&d beyond let's look in the actual book doesn't say anything about splash attack don't do me wrong d&d beyond i'm going to tuck my snake gut back into its pocket it's six though (breathing heavily) ja i cast dancing lights and the four globules start floating around in the air ja okay frumpkin would you like to-- are you still there and he's still on the other side i'm going to have a quick look somebody-- and i send frumpkin further in at this point i can't send in-- i can only watch but i did tell him to go so what would you-- well it's up to you what frumpkin would interpret that as well i think what we've established-- i can view but i can't give commands but i said to go in so it's up to you what-- that is-- oh for frumpkin so i need to go to a different tag that's a three okay who knows maybe fjord could swim down there if we could get this gate open but yeah but you are a bean pole stocky how many stones do you weigh they're a pound each what are you talking about i'm talking about-- remind me it just keeps going forward oh no frumpkin no in the same way there's another large grate at the end of the passage so a tunnel going forward you're done i will go in the back but i will send frumpkin 80 or 90 feet in front of all of us and conga line behind whoever is second to last with frumpkin looking when i'm looking through frumpkin i'm blind yeah where's little beau little beau is missing yeah i think beau is offering to not let me fall faceplant also you have to train your animal to harass mine you doubled down from the last campaign didn't you caleb is laughing quietly in the dark ja okay ooh that's good 18 i would whisper that into beauregard's ears not being able to hear her and tell her to hold the group up for a moment i describe the room i don't know what's in there yet but something's changing three water passages and then two hallways that are dry dm you're describing those platforms but then there are passageways further leading in i mutter that to beauregard this room looks kind of fucked up we should not rush into it it's eerie but do i see any living creatures or threats my cat doesn't see anything but i don't trust that there's-- are you listening to me tap me on the shoulder if you're listening to me okay ow god we don't see anything but i have a bad feeling frumpkin come back the room ahead is not good no there's something of a magical nature up there frumpkin would have seen that as would i it's glowing well yeah but you're assuming that nothing's going to happen when you get into the room or close to the room i am hearing a lot of what ifs i'm casting mage armor 14 matt i'm putting frumpkin in this corner yeah that was our lineup yeah got to roll for initiative bong rip this shit yeah definitely 21 and we got plenty of light in this room correct oh 13 sorry go for the sky ash oh man (singing) here it comes sick matt sick we're so happy we won we won 16 i get pushed even though i saved flipping somersault up in the air like zsa zsa yeah what's that power tal grog is gone okay so caleb springs up out of the water and i think from where i am i have a direct line of sight to that corner that he just went around yeah because they've got light up there yeah i am pulling out the bat shit and the sulfur and i am going to slap them together and throw a fucking fireball and yell fick ihr alle a fireball is going to shoot across the room into that square just to the left of him my left which means it should get all three it is a 16 (counting) 34 fire damage i will walk 15 feet backward into the tunnel i'm in (bane voice) i will walk 15 feet backward oh surprise motherfucker (chainsaw noises) are you a fan of matisse here's a question nobody called dibs on the dodecahedron today could one of us since nobody did so we just got to say every game we just have to make sure that we spit it out okay so i fail i got a seven i'm out oh i'm not out because i have molly's necklace although i'm underwater plus two right i'm unconscious and holding my breath i think that's the way to go yeah i also have a question about the periapt it says that whenever you roll-- oh it's rolling a hit die to regain hit points but it doesn't count when anyone heals me cthulhu's dick so what do i do concentration check death save i don't know that is a six so that's two mm-hmm just do whatever feels right all right well there are dragons in this world sure i have faith in you jester he was dead no that's at a melee attack yeah he's a big guy wilhelm scream that's what i'd do oh fed him a potion it shoots under the water strength saving throw natural 20 thanks pike die yep just deep-throated it just got to relax hey i got knocked for failing and what's the initiative order it's fjord then could you clarify a rule for me because i've never tried to do this as a new magic user newish but to do a bonus action first-level spell could that be done in addition to a second or a third i know there's a version of being able to cast two spells at once if one's lower than the other but i can't remember what it is and a cantrip okay so forget that not interested so caleb pushes up and if we're in difficult terrain what can i move like five feet or something two squares uh i can't see shit i'm going to move-- i'm going to press right up behind jester-- right here what i'm hoping to do is to pull out the same batshit and sulphur and rub it in my hands really quick and then set my hands down on her shoulders to help me aim and careen a fireball to hit-- there's no wall there because it's invisible but to hit the ceiling above-- can't reach hit the ceiling here so i can go bip bip bip to him but hopefully nobody else yeah from the ceiling down to him back corner of the room yeah i think i'm at 16 let me just double-check okay yep (counting) okay so ten points of fire damage also frumpkin is going to go five ten 15 20 like that underwater so he's thinking about it 19 half of a lot caleb's out (laughs) oh my god (coughs) the water's going (splash splash) yeah what do you want to do oh shit
