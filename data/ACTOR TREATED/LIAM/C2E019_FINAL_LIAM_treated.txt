go yankees the jim henson studio was mad to let you go it's gorgeous on paper we've got to round one i cast haste on beauregard it's licorice i just need licorice i didn't try to hide it caleb is stress chewing on the licorice root that he used to cast the spell an extra attack action beat that practice dummy is what jester thought oh no i'm just being my same awkward self it's fine definitely the mushrooms i send frumpkin over to start lapping the blood off of jester's face ja who are these friends of yours up north complications predicament do you have any more specifics than that perhaps no we are interested in more of a buffet here today as a sidebar should we be worried about our friend that we sent north to that area return of the vex does that contraband include high-quality paper and ink high-quality paper and ink just pacman table are you all of us and hey dm knowing the empire how direct a route is it from fabron keyess area berleben to shadycreek run we have to go around some mountains right yeah (printer noises) berleben hupperdook is over here-- we're down there and shadycreek run was what area again did you say quannah breach there it is we're very close to berleben and then it seems like quite a-- stray yeah a trek to-- xhorhas is over there if there is a chance to look in on horris if it is easy if it doesn't put us out you know if it's put right in front of us i am over zadash well quite frankly i am a little more comfortable in quannah breach anyway yeah yeah for a round it's gone it's just a pain in the ass in combat not in out of combat no yeah i will as well well we'll hope we can do both can we do both when you say underground are you speaking metaphorically or do you literally have a way underground to get there the river goes that far yeah we took that for an hour not 70 miles what would we have to be wary of in the river paper and ink i've used it sure caleb hangs back all by himself and says (stuttering) paper and ink ja danke okay i am going to run over to pumat's to buy some paper and ink i'm gone ja this is a quick stop i don't want to take up too much of your time and we don't have much we have a busy day planned i was wondering if you had perhaps maybe 100 gold's worth more of that good paper and ink that you have supplied me with already oh ja i am sorry also i am in need of maybe 20-30 gold's worth of fine incense if you have that as well is there anything that you wanted to purchase while we are here holy shit pumats you don't want to know how much i have we are very appreciative and i don't know if you have already but you should look into some sort of membership card or frequent customer points thousand gold's worth of paper and the 11th ream is free we'll go now you know that little boost you had back there in your fist fight with the blue one you're welcome i cast-- that was arc-- that was a spell you scratch my back i will scratch yours the others are on a mission let's go loaf how about loaf i want to be on the cart yasha will you hold this for me i put frumpkin on her shoulder and start transcribing it is a real cat frumpkin can be here or frumpkin can be there and right now he is here he would like you to touch him yeah but respectfully no i think it's pretty instantaneous and honestly i am so glad to have him but i think that it is probably nicer on the other side does your mother ever read stories about the feywild and sprites and blumpkins that's not the word of the feywild it's another plane of existence that is a mirror slightly off of our own with us but apart from us at all times that means he likes you i tell frumpkin to nestle in and he starts doing that thing where they claw their way in when they're getting cozy it hurts but it's also lovable at the same time then i stop talking to everybody and i start transcribing things sometimes you do make them bulletproof and we get mad but most of the time we can crack the code we're going north i donate the paper that the gentleman gave me i'm taking this silver thread and making a 20-foot cube around the cart perception check at disadvantage god's really cool right right right wild and crazy guys that was the best sleep i have had in a long time my father used to tell me that they would steal children ja excuse me nott are you taking the piss right now with all due respect she is smarter than that frumpkin goes back to the feywild why don't we send my cat if it's of interest we can turn around a mile away (reluctantly) yeah all right for you fjord i will make frumpkin a bird you are more sensitive than i would have imagined you're so tough but everybody here likes you i was just about to make a really cool owl are we really okay wait she's going to the shack i put frumpkin back on her shoulder i'm going to start looking through frumpkin in an attempt to let yasha know i am with her i make frumpkin do this to her forehead (knocking) with his paw oh that's a good question i know that we were loosey-goosey with familiar things i know that we've said that i can see this far away but i probably cannot make him do that this far away 100 feet i take it back i would say caleb has been narrating this to everybody back this is our kingdom small shit keep silver thread i found poison oak you guys i got it i am i have (popping noises) with advantage or straight straight roll i will still do it oh i think it's 60 feet i bet that's wrong it is 120 feet ok i'll roll the twins hey really good that's a 22 nott there's something something whack i just smack beau and then-- i cast mage armor the second does not hit but the first one obviously does not great ten shit i wanted to talk to nott matt's wood there's big people there's little people 18 12 does not hit does not hit (vomiting) there's an arrow sticking out of my ribs i'm going to push through the pain in my veins and reach into my satchel and smear molasses on my hand i'm going to cast slow on this batch here they have to make a wisdom save against my dc 16 is the dc speed is halved takes negative two to ac and dexterity saving throws can't use reactions on its turn it can use either an action or a bonus action not both that's okay i'm going to use my movement to get closer into the fire maybe over towards molly and yasha yeah slow is that half of his movement yeah okay i'll take it because shield won't match the difference no i did well concentration is-- i've never done this before that is a 19 oh gottsverdammt ten i'm looking through my eyelashes where's my percy die deception you say it is an 18 ja but really i'm up to full yeah because i have no hit points she's re-dirtying me for me this is what dungeons & dragons is all about what happened to me i haven't gone in a while i'm poisoned so any attack rolls are at disadvantage correct i'm going to struggle to my feet and i'm going to cast sleep over and away in that direction so it falls way back behind the ogre and these two wolves the goal is to get the ogre and two wolves just on the edges of it so it doesn't hit any of my friends i'm aiming far behind them to get them on the perimeter the wolves are the primary goal stopping short of jester they are the wall the outer edge bad roll 13 hit points total i got to standing which would take half my movement so i'm going to use my last 15 feet to get exactly opposite to the other side of the wall by sliding around it and killing jester haha funny joke yeah okay i'm going to start muttering under my breath and stretch out two hands and send two magic missiles one at the one that ran that way and two at this one and two at the one that ran that way i'm casting it at level two okay so the one that was near nott is three and seven for that one verdammt two three and seven for that one as well i will just stay put it would've been about 60 feet away from you if he used his action to dash i would have said if we'd gotten around to it that if i could go another 30 feet in this direction if i could still see the last goblin that went this way i would fire off more magic missiles to finish it but that's only if i can see it terrible six magic missile no let's do level three that's 20 yeah who wants to go with me to go get our stuff caleb in celestial says no but really are you an angel it's a secret nerdy language you wouldn't understand continuing in celestial just laura well i figure you're going to have to explain this a bit either now or later do you want to do it now or later there's nothing around right perception check just a ten besides you in celestial the blue one is getting pouty we better switch back to common well-read was there anyone you were close to what if we went with you did you see what yasha just did though i think it is a good idea to go there when we are finished i do not care i know who you are now if you don't want to go back there we don't have to go back there but if you actually do don't be afraid to ask i will go with you you told me it was cherry wine we're arguing about who's going to take the first watch we could finish the watch that we didn't really finish why don't you take the next one can i say something short to nott before we switch to the last sitting in the rain you know i never talked about my past for obvious reasons and i didn't want questions pointed back at me still no pressure on you but if you ever want to talk more about it the door is always open for you nott when you are ready who am i to judge i fall asleep in the mud and rain more ogres and goblins five more hours
