i just got a text alert they just revoked his emmy (laughter) you can see the bits of food flying out of his mouth oh man i am going to play that game that is saying something because i have no time for my own physical or mental health it's going to happen make it happen nah it was timed about how i wanted it this is the content you tuned in for can i ask a retroactive question caleb and maybe beauregard read all of siff's journal was anything more to be gleaned from reading the entire thing okay and then the only other question i have is i don't remember what time of day the party ended the day if there was time i would've used paper and scrolls to transcribe into my book if there was time okay good that sounded like pooing my pants right around her titties the titty area once you have a child i want you to turn on a dime like a tartuffe character and be matronly and severe i wonder if the new proprietor knows there is a dead person in the basement that is exactly what it is well there were no horns and when you're a skeleton your ears are rotted away so i do not know it could've been do you know that there is a dead person in the basement here i don't think that's correct actually i think it's both things at the same time i am pretty sure that's incorrect you can eat anything if you are determined enough i want to be at ren faire i'm going to start walking towards the other one the king's thing don't worry if she falls they kill her cha-ching come on one yes yes yes yes yes that's all right you got them out of the way when we fight a basilisk later all those ones are gone yeah what sort of game is it that you are running well i just so happen to have three silver on me it takes one silver to play at least well i am feeling lucky today and always here it is does my keen mind help me at all in this situation natural 20 (cheering) i will go with the center one i think it is this one right here i will go with the middle one i think it's probably the correct place two silver well you know i just wanted to play the game i'm not trying to make any money did you want to do anything here i give her my two silver do me proud i am going to back up like five or six steps and also do the same thing nott did i got a total of 20 do i get a chance to whisper to her what i saw because i want to do the same thing yeah okay oh that's not so good that is a six oh i am a funny guy yeah but you know also the other day you gave me 200 gold so it's not really a problem i give her the stink-eye as we walk away i intensify the stink-eye did you have a different kind of dream beat again it was called king's crown that's what i said she was very quick yeah that'll do pig about seven feet away out of habit caleb just went (counting) i haven't had one of those in such a long time while i start to enjoy my apple i would like to look around and see if there are any book stalls or book barrels perception you said 15 okay while i was looking round is there anything besides games and food huge long shot probably a no but do i also see anything about the cobalt soul here well you know i tried to do a little stuff on the sly a little while ago and didn't work out so well well if you can keep eyes off of me for a moment i can do that if you like i'm trailing about 40 feet behind molly did you want to play this game no she is an excellent shot she's trained sure how much to play your game my daughter's crossbow you want well you know i'll tell you something if you want to have a laugh let's have me do some physical sports so that should be pretty good just a question for you should i hit the one in the back which is highly likely could we have the doll's weight in rats instead is this an attack roll let me show my daughter how it is done watch my form and technique i pick up the bow and i take the stick thing i pull it back like this yeah (sneezes) the farthest one obviously oh aww no not at all that is a three hmm the fretching on that one was probably not very good let me try again listen i have read a lot of books i know it is fretching nope dang it the second rolls are always really good that is an eight this is not well-crafted i grab my wire that i use for the message spell and i put my hair into a little ponytail (pew) okay oh no ten full disclosure i have no athletic ability that went as well as i expected it to i slap down the silver for it yeah it was two right i put down two silver now go home and get your fucking shinebox it really depends on what you have at your disposal yeah a little granny painting furiously this is like the king of kong that's the wang those knuckle hairs are like fly legs oh caleb is going to sneak off while everybody is involved with this fist of the north star put him in the body bag do that speak at the same time-- hear ye hear ye i am on an errand oh well i'll wait until they wind down perhaps it could be a while well back at the righteous brand when i snuck out would it be possible for me to find an alleyway or somewhere secluded so i can cast disguise self on myself around myself not as myself yeah okay then i would like to look exactly like i do however the clothing that i'm wearing is a shade of blue that is similar but not identical to the robes that i have seen people from the library of the cobalt soul a similar blue and very large coke bottle glasses my eyes go all fish-eyed everything else is the same i would like to find one of those people who was dressed like they came from that library that i saw that day with beauregard it's investigation you said it's a 24 i would like to approach them yeah excuse me i'm sorry may i trouble you for a moment i know this is untoward in the middle of a festival oh yeah again i am very sorry i am a traveling writer i am writing a history of the great cities of the empire and i have heard wonderful things about the library that is under your stead and i don't know-- i have viewed it from the outside it is a beautiful structure but i don't know what it entails to visit it i was wondering do you allow outsiders i don't know if it costs a fee or if you need some sort of letter of recommendation but i am very eager to learn about the library itself and the city and everything that i can learn about it so i can write more extensive-- it would just mean so much to me it's all true though (laughs) it is a 13 the entire library oh of course it is far simpler than i had imagined thank you so much forgive me this is forward what is your name it is a pleasure this is a different subject almost entirely but i was wondering i mean to make a stop at all the great libraries of this city i was wondering is it a similar situation at the hall of erudition what was the headmaster's name oremid hass oremid haas is running the halls of erudition okay apropos of nothing i have heard about this tower attack that's terrible i'm amazed it did not fall do they accept-- oh no they don't accept visitors there well i have taken up enough of your time i'd like to say thank you have a wonderful festival i turn a corner and fucking book it what do you mean i was sightseeing where are we right now are they all around us or are we off to the side okay so i lean down to tie my shoe and let the cloak fall around me and i get down between yasha and fjord and when i come up everything is back to normal it gives me a headache so i took them off exactly what i was saying i was sightseeing i was asking about their libraries of the city not so many what (sniffs) i'm also curious is it a bare-knuckles thing or is no-holds-barred do whatever you want dm could you say that crazy-ass name again caleb beauregard can you front me 16 gold there's four more for you yeah and beauregard is the family name kitty where did my cat go the last i see of frumpkin is where okay i count to six and then i snap my fingers and pull him off of this plane i have a leather thong or a string wrapped a couple of times-- i'm going to ignore laura bailey-- wrapped around my thigh and i will grip it in my hand and say a few arcane words and cast mage armor and out from the leather strap around my leg a light shimmer goes up over the entire body for a split second and is gone you have not seen me with my clothes off yet secret warp zone to level eight miss that do i notice anything it occurs to me that starting tomorrow it would be more important than ever that we stick together all of us what yeah i talked to some people from there yeah actually it was not the exact same color it was a similar color but not the same color beauregard is there something that you are after here nothing pertaining to what we have just learned if that is what you are looking for no i want to enter that library although tomorrow anything goes i don't know how will you get me into the library would i instantly recognize that as the same as the people i spoke to i mean there's probably enough to go on here she's also dressed in blue she's basically going-- well if we're not all dead in 48 hours maybe we can talk about that again i drop a little bit of spell components through the box caleb is popping his hood up over his head and face ten 18 would i have been able to cast a spell as we are pushed forward into all this mess blur matt i take that back i'm not going to cast blur sorry my apologies as close to the center as is possible liam knows what that is grody to the max 18 what if they are like police batons i pull out a handful of iron powder and i throw it into the air so it's a big cloud and my two hands go (sweeping noise) and yasha grows to twice her normal size then i will use my movement to get over to the corner near fjord if i could get around it i would but i'm sure i don't have enough movement yeah so you're at advantage because of your size and all of your attacks have an additional 1d4 she's 14 feet tall no you're six 12 feet tall 12-ish feet tall doubles it your weight is eight times its normal weight who do you choose and your 1d4 for being gigantic matt is that ring for what concentration all of the male players are 40 feet back and all the women are right in there i am very aware of how many people are in this arena especially high-powered ones as i wrap one hand around my forearm and i cast scorching ray even though i feel nauseous and off they go 26 ten 16 15 points of fire damage i'll take a step five feet that way and as i do so i look over at fjord and just-- and that's the end of my turn a minute so probably the time it takes her to cast that spell and you to run into that hole yasha that should probably end right about (magic fizzles) natural one hundred dollars i rolled a natural one so-- four you can certainly try i pull out a cat's paw and say (stuttering) bad dog maximilian's grasping cat's claw comes out by that one there it has to make a strength saving throw ja but it has to save 15 und i will move that ways to make a triangle with the two dogs and myself to get as far away as i can get everyone gets advantage on it and it's at disadvantage to hit us oh also sorry it takes bludgeoning damage from the attack that i gave it six super buff and not just in the game 15 oh strength that's its action correct to break free it felt its gooch almost rip out (sympathetic groans) ah couldn't see her behind the wall is this the same sword we've always seen i don't remember the word-- liam doesn't remember the word wastehunter ja just deadpan i do this around my hand and i cast three scorching rays out of it at this thing the first does not hit at all it was a two plus something the second one hits 19 plus seven is 26 the third one hits 16 plus seven hits (counting) four five (frustrated noise) total of nine fire damage i call out as i walk backwards slowly fjord you got this good i walk deadpan sideways behind that piece of stone (laughter) i think that's it oh get it finish him that's good i'm pretty shit i could get knocked out by a crownsguard right now i am snapping my fingers and bringing frumpkin scarf-like around my neck under my hood just to have him with me i will stay with fjord all right this is how much time we have to plan in the moment as this is happening this is about how well we do-- it is hard to walk on two legs maybe four is better yep
