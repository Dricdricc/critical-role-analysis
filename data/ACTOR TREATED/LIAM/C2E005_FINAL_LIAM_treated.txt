we're that good (laughter) twill pillikins bathtub stealthcat kenku's a bird dagon henry kissinger i've read the whole thing i've seen the pictures donut hole donut hole donut hole she has a ring of power except when he doesn't i would also like a donut please do you actually have donuts i don't understand oh there it is are they pretty new three days new or-- forget it i don't actually want to know the answer mollymauk is this weird for you to not be traveling with your performing family some things don't change we didn't have much of a chance to see you perform i saw you do a card reading for jester but things got waylaid at the circus what do you normally do if anybody can do it it's you how far away are they yeah i send frumpkin ahead and see it and go blind and deaf here so i can get a closer look at them frumpkin's a sparrow at the moment i don't have the components to put him back to the shape he prefers which is a cat charcoal and some incense a kind of incense you have to use i'm all out i used it all no money well you have to pay money to get the things to do it he's been a couple of things before he can last anyway off you go don't fuck me scanlan oh that's not scanlan that's percy but you did fuck me percy that is very low we'll just say it fails because it's a two yeah i rolled a two 18 horses i started muttering as soon as i could see that what they were what i saw i would've released it yeah he's not back but i released the sight perception check zwölf wakka wakka that's a pretty big matzo ball there yeah but i would ask are you asking because that is something that you have no experience with or are you wondering maybe is that something that we could join you in mostly whatever we can walk away with always go for a sure thing no we should take it off the road where are you going to do okay i have a bird that can go probably higher than the tree if you want would you like me to do that or you could i don't want to rob you of the joy of climbing a good tree okay well i will sit in the field then and give him a little chuck under the chin and-- oh wait before i go away am i looking for anything specific people coming they do as the bird is flying just for a second i say you know ordinarily-- i can't hear you but he's a cat almost all the time so this is a rarity you'll be able to climb many trees many other times but we should take advantage of him well okay feel it i can feel stuff we worked out that he could-- okay great there's bugs in my nose shove it all in everybody in the middle of the field you hear ooh look at that what do i see that's a nine okay i keep flying for a little bit longer the treant eats you how cold is it out now hold on i pull a rag out and i (poof) one of the dancing lights and make that hooded lantern again so that you can see while they decide that i'm going to pull out my silver thread and i'm going to start winding a 20-foot circle around the fire everybody hears a little (ting) as i hit a little bell that i have that's part of it and that's it i will stay up for a little bit yeah oh that's pretty good that's a 19 am i the only one awake at this moment i slowly jiggle nott awake (whispers) get up i put a hand over her mouth there is a thing out around our fire a ways off no i saw the shape it's not dark there's a fire here because we want them to die i think we should probably wake everyone i shake beau awake she said most beautiful there's a thing out there in the field something is moving no wait here as soon as i see her do that i start swatting fjord on the back to wake him up i'm so proud i don't know that spell so i cannot talk back what who said that if you can can hear me-- i don't think you can-- come back with the group is that how message works for one round so six seconds oh if it's a cantrip you can do it over and over again it's two soup cans with a string is she back i scoop her up look at you you cast a spell you spoke to me it's as simple as that isn't it oh i'm so proud of you we need to calm down and go back to bed (laughs nervously) got you no i thought we were all going to die but it was just-- what was it echoes in the field (echoing sounds) well shit i guess we're going to look at a buffalo 16 silently ruffle nott's hair on the way back to camp turd watch are you okay we're fine everything's good you would tell us if something was wrong can you speak you just spit a lot of water out and you were sleeping i don't i want to make an insight check he's talking about acid reflux but he just spit a bunch of water out yeah okay that's 22 does he seem full of shit to me is our group going to be all about puns and that stuff yeah how long ago was that what about the sword you said you found it on the ocean you found on the boat you were on you were on an island what do you mean dm when i cast detect magic in the first game in the tavern did that sword light up i don't even need to touch it but would you trust me to study it for a moment i'm good at figuring things out i'm clever ja you can understand that we would be curious but i don't want to push anybody i mean we've just met when he says he doesn't quite understand is he telling the truth is that the same insight check 11 you wouldn't have to remember that far back you said that this all started just a few weeks ago when you met this one i was wondering the very same thing actually all night i was wondering what we would call-- you were going to butcher at winter's crest and that's a special treat have i ever read about it i pull nott over do you know what wc means in zemnian toilet i give her a little fistbump vasquez must be nice travis liam and how does that affect us again did that look arcane to me is it a walled-in city or just parts here and there not fortified at all we leave the toilet behind and we run in i would be pressed against the wall of that house okay so i have advantage on stealth thank you 16 maybe amble more than dash i mutter a few words and my form starts to blink in and out of view there is another caleb next to me and another caleb next to me shifting blinking flashing back and forth and it's hard to see where i am yeah it is the old fashioned swirly kind oh scheiß that was worse that was already bad mm-hmm it's all part of the plan yeah what'd you get oh all together at last mercer-ful g-n-o-l-l (sings) g-n-o-l-l bobobo-bo bo-bobo at the bitch who attacked you yeah okay i will move along the table over here to this spot i think i have a clear view of the big gnoll correct from there i mutter a few arcane words under my breath and a circle of flame spins around my hand and three beams of fire shoot out towards this big guy i cast scorching ray each one is a separate attack first one is a 16 second one is also a 16 the third one is a 17 so 6d6 on him because they all hit that's four six-- nine that's the six this one oh thank you (counting) that's a total of 19 fire damage on him i probably have ten feet of movement which i would like to use to move back to where i was and try to not hyperventilate against the back of this building dead center yeah okay good no i'm like this i'm doing this she doesn't give a shit about that bear apologies to my friend so sorry guys there you go we're losing subscribers in europe right now halt den mund okay i start moving back towards the same vantage point i had before and i see jester above me and i see a guy over there covered in ice and i whip around and the diamond comes up and i go (sizzling) and i was about to make it acid but there's ice everywhere so it's ice now chromatic orb off to the big guy in the middle of town square yeah it misses entirely then i use the rest of my movement to press my back against the wall and go nein nein nein still behind the same building get out of the city okay i'm just going to do my same dog and pony show trick i'm going to go to the corner i should be able to see two or three gnolls i think over there yeah okay so (sizzling) starts to burn in my hand chromatic orb out to hit whichever one-- then that's the one i'm going to go for come on oh that's good that's a 17 thanks keyleth that is 3d8 so where is my eight-sided die there it is this is fire and it is 11 points of damage okay and i inch back again and say (singing) if it ain't broke don't fix it and hide behind the building i would like to think that he does laugh hideously and despises himself for it doves go everywhere swing it high beau swing away all his friends are running away and he's going me and my friends are going to kill you yeah if he's still around when she's done i would have done my same single-- yeah no i would have leaned out if i had seen it was dead and no enemies i would use my movement my action to move further up to the corner not much besides that but join where fjord and the duplicate are that's it nott this is simultaneous it's dark too you beat me to it you said 30 minutes went by i wanted us to be doing that already i was just waiting for you to pause that's fine i'd like to think that we leaned down to the same gnoll cutting and went same hat same hat we have seen these things as far south as trostenwald further even i have a question after listening to this for a while i start looking around the town would you say that with all these burnt buildings everywhere that if i start picking through the rubble i would find enough charcoal to reduce the costs i would need for find familiar eventually because i still need the incense and the herbs but if i get a lot of charcoal from these burnt homes-- yeah yeah done and done that's good and i have a good investigation too that is a 23 yeah good that's good i've already got the silver thread out and i am looping it over any open window and by the door you're not the only one caleb is going one gold two gold three gold 60 gold this was a good idea we are hitching out stars to your wagon (laughter)
