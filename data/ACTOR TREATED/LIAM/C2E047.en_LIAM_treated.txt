we're really glad to be back and also sorry (whispering) it's all titties we were at the gallery yesterday looking at stuff blown up we're going to be back tomorrow looking at other stuff blown up and it was overwhelming to see the art that you guys have made blown up larger than life it's going to be emotional wait i don't have an announcement but i just want to thank a couple of people first i want to thank @chaotic_redhead on twitter-- not marisha ray a different one-- for sending in this great hat right here we got this one that's not the last one there were four octopus hats sent in today two were for me and two were for brian foster look at this amazingness this one-- this one oh i tell you this one is from knitting batman on instagram no i cannot see no i can see yeah as you were matthew i forgot how to play oh i rolled a natural 20 i did it i remembered yes i did this is after lighting up the inside and then backing away from it is that how it went down that was earlier 21 i am going to use my movement to get behind this rock and i am going to about 30 feet away from nott hold the haste spell for the moment i see her starting to attack something no to nott yep i was a-scared and frightened trigger caleb casting haste on nott if i saw her attack 15 i'm going to move half my movement so is that three i'm going to go one two three to here and fire off magic missiles at this one by yasha at a level two all terrible rolls it's eight points of damage yeah that's it yes i do plus 12 points of damage yep yeah with spiritual weapon yeah is everyone attacking at disadvantage like yasha was it's okay it's just my teeth and we're underwater i was backing away from the action but seeing how the things are turning south i start pushing back towards miss lionett through the water i make it that far and i'm going to cast magic missile at level four (counting) 22 the one that's backside is to me this side no the one on beauregard here that's the end of my turn it's short it's 20 feet i remember character drops fuck this bullshit double that cocked it's very cocked you're able to read people's thoughts after that i've been on my way over to the scrum over there trying to help and i begin to weave magic missile again and he is about to cast it and the thing comes behind him and he goes whoa and unleashes on the one right behind him magic missile level three yeah i need one more (counting) 15 total i'm not going to move because it will claw me in half no that hits sorry i was going backwards yeah yeah ten what if the roll had actually been-- shite 13 would that have changed it because i have the transmuter's stone which is giving me proficiency on constitution saves if i'm remembering correctly proficiency in constitution saving throws that's what i have there's a slight crooked little smile peeking out from underneath frumpkin on my head the queen caleb pulls up and there's claw piercing all along the ribs caleb sits down in the muck (npr announcer voice) this is grass talk on kcrw i need a short rest yes please i am dropping and leaning against beauregard did one of you do healing and i missed it you would advise coming she wants us to rally below it is gross on the way down but okay-ish i crawl down there is no guarantee there is another temple somewhere with another person with dreams like you and avantika who has already done this this could be the final piece of the puzzle if we understand the carvings we saw correctly even we don't actually know do we i'm going to start looking around 27 an empty standalone sphere agate a-g-a-t-e potion sphere feather-shaped stone and an agate stone that's four things plus the coins it's a stone shaped like a feather does it look like this sphere that i've found is the same shape as this i will alert everyone that this stuff it down here i gathered up all of the things that are not coins no are we going to take the time do that now i will need some time i heard you whispering about this bauble so i will begin on it well if someone has seen us through it they already have in theory i sat down on the floor-- oh shoot i cannot do it now because my books are in your bag if i take them out they would be ruined yeah yeah too clean to be normal caduceus can you talk to this dead person by the time we clear the room there would not be much time left to that spell you know him pretty well you still mean to veer away from all this once we're done here i'm going to expend a use of expeditious retreat on myself which will a make me a little bit quicker i would change the nature of the transmuter's stone to let me see in the dark and i send frumpkin to glomp onto fjord's arm and shoulder he's on his way we should already start moving i'm swimming quickly ahead of everyone because i'm expeditious retreat i've shot ahead a little bit if it's under ten minutes since i've cast can i ask a question watching through frumpkin's eyes as he did everything down below other than hearing fjord talk without his twang did i see the tendril that appeared or was that all in his mind so just heard him speak and heard him wedge a sword in the ground that was my first d&d character no don't open that you were only warned six times before you put it in your mouth looks like someone who waited for us to do the hard work into the ocean he said at advantage oh my god it's cocked you don't get to keep it but it was like 20 fuck you at an angle and they are more than four times further away than that i'm the boatswain what are we doing captain for everybody with a thing to do because i don't think i have a thing to do so i could just hang out i'm going to start identifying spells i'm rifling through jester's if they get in range in six-second rounds-- i don't think we're in traditional 15 what are you eating to maintain distance how long is your water so if we maintained speed with that and they're a fast boat well it creates a wave for sure that's what i was worried with avantika about it's a 25 percent chance of capsizing three zero roll the dice what do we see in the way of survivors swimming about they're very far away eight do we want to grab one or two of these people so we know what was going on in the first place we got a boat now baby this is going down that boat is as dead as a nothic (laughter) 23 i can kind of do that you have to get them in a circle and keep them at bay for a moment the cock gobbler yes they attacked a ship after a gigantic geyser of water spewed forth from the ocean i'd say they stuck their dick in it yeah we could try to turn them in and they could take them and us at the same time may i have my books back please before you draw googly eyes in the pages did you already draw googly eyes in the pages i certainly do thank you beauregard i will go back to nott and my quarters and pull out the book and take less than an hour to-- there's five things now it was the stone shaped like a feather it was the orb it was a potion it was the agate stone and the studded leather armor busy busy you guys are on deck right i'm not there caleb wanders back up at this point and starts listening i'm sorry i'm coming into this midway am i to take it we are headed to the mainland oh that's good news oh that is a good idea so you don't mean to pursue this any further right now i was going to ask you does it concern you to turn away from this thing's desires do you worry it will abandon you leave you a mere mortal again but you intend to leave the sea for now you don't even know do you i've been in the ocean for days and days first i want you to admit that i have been washed from top to bottom for a month you are a nice fellow you see revved up it was very interesting i'm so tired there is one of these things that i am going to keep it's a lucky rock there is another thing here that i probably should keep but i don't have to this bauble lights up and floats and lets us see in the dark yeah hovers a bit i set it floating five feet above the deck of the ship it is tawaj not exactly but-- it's dark at this point isn't it so if i say fajar very specific use cases for that i pluck it out of the air and it should dim one of you could carry it but since i am normally blind as a bat beauregard has her glasses-- all right so i will take both of these things a lucky rock yes no it does not let you reroll things this is a potion that makes one extremely strong for a short period of time fjord yasha i honestly was thinking yasha and if not yasha then you jester i stick that into my pocket that's just a loaner in my pocket i don't want it caduceus i thought this would be good for you i'm holding up a small stone leaf i hand it to him don't put that on the deck please because it will turn into an actual tree it doesn't say on here i assume-- oh one time only and then beauregard this armor you found is quite exquisite but you don't wear armor do you no it's a bit hard to do all the flipping around that you do yeah it would be good for any of you this particular one was a little better at protecting you but also you can speak to this thing and make the armor look like anything you like it would be yeah but it doesn't work for monks you can make it look like robes or the fanciest golden armor you can think of or a clown's outfit or you can make yourself look like fjord's clothes it's an instant change of clothes it's clothes though it's clothes yeah that's the first thing i said it's above average studded leather plus one and it's endless it's limitless am i reading that right should we give this to yasha fjord jester this potion you should take a look at the mote and i will assist you if you care do we want it to be one of us it costs a lot oh you're going up do you like a good book i don't mean for tonight in general but you have one of the books that we found in that ball of fun is about the corruption of plants i thought you might be surely mm-hmm i'm glad you are traveling with us just a happy little scry yeah yeah that it ja if you want to take some time with that and then we could use it sure okay okay no time like the present let's go get to work one of the nights while getting into bed and nott curling up at the foot of the bed as we customarily do-- ja i'll wait in the dark and before i think that she has fallen asleep nott how do you feel about returning home so we're just going to buzz through there's nothing you want to check in on or-- sometimes it sounds like you don't have much love for home one of your clan not one of your clan oh okay no well not besides you not besides you that clan is all right with you was there any friction that we should be-- oh so you want to go home briefly but not to see the clan but just this one fellow you are very-- so we're going around your home is what you're saying ja whatever you need whatever you need we'll do it was pretty interesting though you did quite well out there i mean obviously you were like a goblin in water but you did quite well out there i am very pleased with that i'm also impressed with you you have a knack you have the knack i would know no magic i'm proud of you good night nott oh my gosh thursday show friday art show saturday live show it's going to be busy
