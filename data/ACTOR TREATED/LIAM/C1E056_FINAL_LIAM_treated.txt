to me or i'll just take them while you're sleeping easily so fucking easily keep your boots then see if they're there in the morning so in the middle of the night i'd like to swing by the kitchen-- okay i go by the kitchen and i get a mug of water and some spices just some various simple stuff-- i'd like to sneak into my sister's room i'd like to check the door for traps it's not very high oh no yes it is it's a 20 okay i'd like to pick that lock 30 you're sleeping all right 30 on the trap on the lock yeah-- i'd like to sneak in protecting her feet right that was the command i walk in they're

hear about my personals what's your choice give me my fucking boots no i can't because they're holding me around the arms-- ask her (laughs) i love you but you are a terrible person and i walk out the door did you just cannonball away we all do it we all do it on a side note i have an earring as well and i heard everyone go down into the hot springs so i went back to the kitchen and got some of that chicken sorbet that they make here and i went back to my sister's room and i pulled the blanket down and i just smeared it all along the inside of the bed and then i bring up the blanket and tuck it in nice it looks perfect goodnight boy-girls here come the artists for science here comes the bellyflop-- is the judging of this up to artistic interpretation like ice skating (snoring) he needs it those gems are going to turn into lead aren't they you smell like chicken yeah we've got to get out of this mansion that was one of the best exchanges of our entire run oh my goodness beer send beer is fine i'm all right with that (laughter) i think keyleth should read it she's trying to lead her people that's a big fat pause is what that is set that dial back to 39 between grog and scanlan we can solve any problem i think so beef him up so to speak i'll just say that i've attuned to all my old shit while everyone was swimming i would just think that meant you love me uh that is a 39 17 plus perception is-- did i get it wrong am i too tired i've had a long day people let's say 29 yeah no i like it it's fine i don't know what you're thinking it's beautiful have to avoid that old magic we have somebody who can do that-- and i said bitch no one at the moment i took it off of course i have the circlet yeah but-- sure i take my sister put my hand over her mouth and i drag her back about 30 feet is it just the remainder of the herd herd leader we trust you will leave something in that cave for the people of this town something to help them recover prosperity on your family he meant well i'm going to go take like five minutes i'm going to kneel down and sort of meditate in front of one of the pyres dead dwarf i'm taking a moment to pay my respects to the dead i know that guy (cheers) it's a huge question yes what do you think personally what is this small group that you're leading what's your plan kerr do you have a sense of how many people are left in the city roughly yeah they might not believe we'd be here but they also might try to-- what about the sewers we could help with that there's whitestone ever been to vasselheim can't they have sentries and a shelter in the sewers they could clear out part of it and have sentries every night and any time a dragon comes they just go underground and wait wait it out he's going to slow us down oh quall we didn't know where you were we couldn't find you we left it with wilhand sorry buddy can we steer them away from the area where we ran into those basilisks do i remember where he is i head off that way i bring him back here yes i'm sure you were that's okay the chroma conclave sends its regards (laughter) i actually spent the night in a field with reginald that's your brain man i sat next to his body waiting for people to come back they never did i piled some of keyleth's flowers on his chest and then i fell asleep in the field six feet away from him party yeah well i don't know i don't know what i thought but that's what i did i wanted some space getting a good night's sleep on a field of grass how are you doing you need some water can you make some just nail a sock on the side of it it'll be great (laughter) percival's suggesting letting them live here building something for them underground-- rather than running exactly you are genuine i think we give them a choice but i think pike i think it's a good idea i think you present the idea of staying and getting word to the people in kymal that some of their loved ones are still here still living the dragon is dead summon them back to rebuild is kymal bigger or smaller than westruun they're better off in westruun we're at wartime the people can live underground for now otherwise what else are we fighting for as all that starts to wind down i ask my sister to point me towards reginald's daughter the one with the nice hair i seek her out in the crowd excuse me young miss i'm sorry we haven't spoken but you spoke to my friends you spoke to my sister my sister looks very much-- i know the news they delivered to you i am so sorry for your loss your father was very brave at the end impressively so and i want you to know that i've also recovered his body and i thought to add him to the pyres that this city did outside the city but i thought maybe you had a family plot or somewhere you'd prefer him to be laid to rest i'll gladly take him there for you or take him with you whatever you prefer to lose a parent before their time is no easy thing i'm very sorry for you that he did i linger for a bit (kid voice) that's a octopus two old dudes i think your nitty-gritty might be different from somebody else's nitty-gritty (laughter) shove that dingleberry in there something i wanted to do last night in all the hubbub that's going on in westruun i spend some time to find my sister and i wanted to stealth up on her 20 stubby and i pull her into a big fat hug your hair looks like shit sit down i start braiding it elaina would be proud of you i'm proud of you saved my life again i crawled out through an arrow hole there's a bit of chicken here one day at a time right there i have to go to vasselheim i have to go to vasselheim now and i will go on my own if i have to i'm not done with her i have to go now whether it's just me-- pike i would be grateful if you would go with me i don't think that this is somewhere that you can go with me yes you can go to vasselheim but what i have to do there i don't want you to have any part of it just this just this one thing i need you i take her by the hand and i pull her further away much further away did the others tell you what happened in the tomb in the sunken tomb i have been avoiding you percival-- there was a trap and vex'ahlia-- i almost lost vex'ahlia and a woman appeared not a woman a god appeared she appeared and i did something i tried to save my sister i did something stupid i tried to bargain i didn't even fucking want the armor that i'm wearing right now i didn't want it i don't think i've ever told you how much i admire you i always have you have a kindness about you that comes with such ease and honesty you have always carried a light her light i think you know i admire everyone in our band of misfit toys but you most of all and when you left we all noticed its absence all of us i think i wanted to find it again for myself hers your benefactor i felt her and i told myself that when you came back i was going to come to you and i was going to learn from you and follow you and follow her as soon as you came back and like so many things that i reach for in this life it slipped through my fingers and i've gone and painted myself into a corner i can't anymore and i think when i saw you it was just a reminder of what i lost i'm sorry for avoiding you well the bottom line is i couldn't walk away if i wanted to because i know that i would lose my sister but i don't want to anymore we've all been close to death all of us and now i'm just a little bit closer it took me a bit but maybe we're not meant to be happy i don't know well i don't know but i know that i can be of use i was i'm doing better it would help if you stayed around i was all kinds of fucked up a couple of weeks ago ish okay i'm going to vasselheim you can go i can catch up it's the only bastion of standing civilization left hey you had two hours to beat the shit out of a goliath sit tight buddy catch phrase catch phrase meme tweet tweet tweet i'm actually scared shitless and i would like pike and you to go with me i would like my sister not to go anywhere near her that's what i would like and that's it you and pike i did hey i'd like to go to vasselheim pike keyleth can you open up a hole in a tree we can go quick everyone can go to vasselheim there's just a specific place in vasselheim that i need to go and i love you but i just don't want you to be a part of it you either hang out with grog or stay outside okay okay
