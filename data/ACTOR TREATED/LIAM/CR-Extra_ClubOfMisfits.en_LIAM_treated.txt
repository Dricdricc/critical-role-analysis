i've looked through it it's a beautiful book and if you've been a d&d fan for decades going through the book is like going through a time warp we're part of the history of dungeons & dragons it's the spooky-ooky one creature just creature nutterbeer is an acquired taste ooh a yorkshire accent my name is allison and i am a horfleporf i drink a lot of nutterbeer probably too much am i sharing my special thing you told me about i don't know what no what all right i don't know any of you i don't care to allison's not paying attention and she's making ivy grow out of her desk and around the chair and some mushrooms up each leg of the desk's table legs you'd have to tell her first oops mushrooms up the front of your blouse natural one she got it from chessex i'm going too it's boring down here are they winged (australian accent) bacon and eggs (australian accent) fairies on the barbie are there any beverages in here no decanters no have you been hurt at all is it locked did you try it all right i go to the desk i'll start on the left at the top yes you do it itty-bitties 20 oh dear you had 500 people down kind of i'm going to use a cantrip and i'm going to make this wand grow into a full-sized staff and cast shillelagh travis and that's a bonus action actually so now i'm holding it can i hold my action to attack this thing if it attacks me that's what i'm going to do whack okay so i would attack everything is brand new that is a very terrible roll that's six no that's all i've got that definitely hits all right that's pretty good where is everything that is an 18 i'm entranced with this acorn hat on laura's head tpk in under ten minutes it doesn't look like a dick and balls at all though i will stay with the same strategy and i am going to swing my shillelagh like a golf club and see if i can smear that one against the wall closest to me that's another a terrible roll that is 13 to hit it doesn't hit swing away swing wide no all right all right we're going to send you to abzkadan did anyone at this table equip armor i'm sitting at a 14 already it's already me that was fast do something to impress me he gets a look and then very frustrated with how that went i walk over to the other-- slytherpin i point this large shillelagh down just to focus direction and cast thunderwave against the wall that's closer to it i was going to try and not hit the smytherpin so i will walk up next to bender bunder blunder i'm not going to hit him i'm going to do it wide of him and you have to do something it just shoots out and it's a con save of 15 she takes 2d8 new classes 14 i turn and look over my shoulder at the jock and just-- proper rude proper naughty these are slytherpin dice can i raid the entire desk while they're all arguing is there anything of use they were all really well hung yep swing away moving can anyone get it open where's the rough one well i suppose you're pretty rough can you get that open blame it on the fairies bob loblaw strikes again guys k j dowling would be so proud (laughter) i would like to also in this room search behind the tapestries to see if anything's hidden there we're just going to sneak out of here what happens when we're not here when they get back no i've watched you do it you know in the back of three of your classes i've seen it people don't pay attention to me much why do you care what we think or what others think i spin my wand and-- it's very pretty but a ring of flowers making you look like a silly lion appears around your face (whispering) wait wait wait wait (normally) i wave my wand and cast pass without a trace on all of us plus ten 28 (whispering) i want to see what the whispers are are you sure you're in the right house 21 yes we are you get plus ten 28 flowers again do you think you could maybe outline the problem you're dealing with so infuriating i mean we go to school here so it stands to reason every perception it's been two three two balls total balls bryan do you want to get behind her i'll be last first of four tonight first of four (as sm√©agol) what is it how big are the spiders we're talking about you're the one with experience plugging holes what is going on and the beacon of hope gives everyone advantage on wisdom saves and death saves so we need to step on the board somewhere i would be a knight i would play on the far side your right no your right do you want to be the broccoli that is broccoli i'll go i will go two spaces forward and one to the right nine for me if sam doesn't put lipstick on in the breakfast club fashion before this game is over i will be sorely disappointed one-shots is for prop comedy in typical ally sheedy fashion i'm going to bite my fingernails and point my wand out and at a range of 120 feet cast erupting earth under the king and queen a fountain of churned earth and stone erupts in a 20-foot cube centered on that point each creature in that area must make a dex save i don't know it's a 20-foot cube so that high mm-hmm i'm a witch it's schmogwarts dex saves they take half damage from the attack that's cocked that's 12 and 12 and two so 26-- 13 total and then now 20 feet in the air on a pile of earth and rubble no it was 13 each 26 total down to 13 halved yeah i will use my bonus action to take on my animal form because i am an anischmagus a large oversized badger-- of course-- is now on the field sorry oh no i have to move like a chess piece that's right so i'm going to not provoke attack of opportunity and come around to the front wait is that what i want to do yes don't give a shit yeah that hits okay natural 20 (growling) badger form lair action can we move me before i get pawned as a chess piece-- it's our turn to move a piece i think okay okay oh boy taliesin's killing it slytherpin you got like five bucks or something oh shit the dice you're a wizard larry right the badger is going to lay into the spider with a multi-attack bite and claws first we'll do the bite that is an 18 to hit okay so for the teeth sink in and do four points of damage then claws that is a six with the claws that do not hit so just (growling) digs to the earth not anymore hits (growling) okay that's the total okay ally stands in her raggedy normal form what was the total did you say seven great what are you saving them for i'll cast mending i got chills ally starts to twist her wand in the air in a big circle and a gigantic cloud appears over the entire chess field and all of us and lightning comes down on the king level three so that is a dex save 15 dang oh that's the wrong die it's all ten sides (counting) 22 so 11 points of lightning damage on the king the storm keeps roiling above us all did you have a wand to your chest like pulp fiction (gasping) come on brian and bryan hits got it 16 big finish concentration check was that what the con was for or something else i need to make a concentration check it was 13 points of damage and it'll be a ten right yeah to hold it up natural 20 isn't it that way okay the storm is still roiling and i'm still swiveling the wand and (crashing) down on the big spider that is another save it has to make what kind it's a dex 15 that's a total of 16 lightning damage oh molly ringwald belching lightning travis and i turn into a badger typical smytherpin actually ally uses a bonus action to turn into a badger and grapples claire to the ground to roll the funk all over her oh it's a badger attack hold on creatures that's an eight super low does it hit the ac so she dances out of the way is it sixteen candles now you have advantage on wisdom saves the badger is peeing down the front of your-- yeah and we have that one moment where they skid around the floor around the corner 14 i cast pass without a trace plus ten with advantage jesus so bad 15 yeah rolled a two and a three there was england australia new zealand schenectady new york
