vasselheim to dispose of it my sister has read it parts of it and-- it's foul it should not be allowed to exist what happens after you research it has that vault ever been disturbed in its entire history oh i'm sorry we weren't clear we came to discuss it we don't have it now and all these many months you've been in possession of the horn you have what have you learned of the one you do have we need to discuss a few things but we'll fetch the tome it's already made one attempt it's only a matter of time or fit in no big thank you for your time i pull vex into an alleyway (sighs) i don't know what the right thing to do is i thought one thing going in there and now i think maybe you were right i have not wanted to go to that temple though she has finally been speaking to me again when i died i saw her i have dreamed of her already and she speaks of some sort of purpose on the horizon and i don't know if she's talking about your promise you made or what but she is with us and i barely know what the fuck i'm doing but i know that she doesn't want that book to exist and honestly i am frightened of going to that temple because i want time i want time with you i want time with keyleth i want time and i don't want to lose that time now i want to be selfish for a little while we've been working so fucking hard by all rights we should be dead well i don't know i don't know and look at this and i start to unbuckle the front of my chest-- relax look at this i don't know i don't know i think so hurts a little bit not really no i cover it back up but i think you are right and i think that they're going to hold that and someone will take it whether it's in a hundred years or a thousand years and she doesn't want it and-- yeah they already have that they don't have this all right yes it was going great that's some name of the rose shit right there then an escalator i think i've read it says you keep the same intellect though right no he was a genasii the succubus and

attack you why were you in danger why what a clusterfuck was there no other choice please save us from this moral dilemma we are skipping past the fact that two men are dead right now do we need to go and find them and try to-- this is upsetting of course he did he looked us in the eye and he said he killed two people we should go find them (laughs) that's it where was this place where was this place we have to find these two men and bring them to a temple or something we can't just leave them-- can you guide me there look listen take me to this place you and i will carry these men to a temple we will-- what happened to me well i can't do that and you can't do that so we need to take these men to a temple where somebody can help them so those guys aren't dead is what you're saying
