another great indie game it's pretty rich we'll be cute in three hours i can't wait to see the old-timey photos of our propped up dead bodies dressed finely thanks obsidian yeah yes many of you have been taking advantage of our code critrole with wyrmwood gaming but not all of you so the rest of you go over to wyrmwood gaming if you use critrole you get free shipping for any of their beautiful boxes mine is gabon ebony it's black i really like it they're gorgeous many different colors make great christmas present stocking stuffers put your dice in them you'll like them i am nervous before anyone entered the room percival do you know anything-- do you know what's just ahead of us award show variant costume (laughter) she can't see you there well go quick i didn't want to touch it i am all out of tricks just about so may i please have a superior grog i'm offering safety for your facial hair for perpetuity now it's in danger i will let you flick me hard hard in the nads should we survive can we take a short rest after that (laughter) i will do this trade wait i pull a stick out of my bag and i put it in my mouth and i bite down very hard on it yeah (groans) (hoarse) there's no sound at all (hoarse) the good one fucker (hoarse) are we going to hold this up for when we go against the briarwoods i think it'll be confusing we don't see a ziggurat yet is it candyland no i don't remember i just got flicked in the nuts i'm not doing that i'll say jenga yeah i'll wait so long as no more of your siblings are in danger i did do it for reasons you know because i told you i don't know exactly what was going to happen but i saw a blade against your sister's throat i would hope you would do the same for my sister if you were to see the same thing scanlan back me up if you were to turn into some sort of three-horned beast and go running into a house full of enemies we would give him a similar talking-to correct scanlan shut up we just rested for 30 minutes how would everyone feel about another seven and a half hours i think we would definitely prefer them outside but what would draw them out i do not know people are putting their lives on the line plus uriel is suspect now he's been corrupted he is not trustworthy there's no point going back to him cassandra i want to say something a little frank i'm very happy that we've found you i'm very happy that percival and you have been reunited we have been burned very badly in the past by seeming allies and i am sure you are in your right mind but past experience has taught us to be very careful and we are all watching you for signs of corruption or control i want to believe you are in control of your faculties i do not fully trust you are and i think just letting you know that a knife could hit your back as soon as the slightest misstep happened is maybe enough to ensure some safety for this group according to percival they filled you with arrows what happened why not hang you from that tree in the center of town like they did so many others i don't think there's anything you can say i want you back in my friend's life but i'm sorry i do not trust you and i and the others will be watching all right so i'm going to go ahead through the hole sure you're very good at that now because of my gift to you 32 me first yeah her dress sparkles too much we're going way ahead percy number four hi pike i take her hand i take your hand pike and i kneel down and i press the back of her hand to my forehead and hold it there for a moment my nut i place my sarenrae hand on her shoulder and say you're here because she willed you to be here she knows that we need you now please hide behind obese percival and i pat my sister on the shoulder and head back into the darkness yeah perception all that shit down 20 for me i lean over to my sister and say i'm not going to do anything i'm just going to look 50 feet down-- all right looks a little hinky i'd like to carefully approach and disarm anything i can detect or find is that thieves' tools that's a 27 there's a couple of stones here that i've marked in the middle of the path don't step on them please 20 i give her the universal rogue movement for scoot back yeah keep going ten feet or so all right i'm going to inspect and try to do the same 26 does it take the whole passage all right people we have some gas trapped under a mound of shit up here something bad i'm going to stay here i'd like you all to bring up the rear and kiki bring the bear bring my nephew up and i'd like everyone to pass ahead and my sister and i will get trinket up behind you all chalk the last one was marked with chalk this one i'm just standing in front of i'm sure you've got something in that bag of yours that we can plop in front of this for now let's just get past it plus anything i am we are i assume oh why don't i look and then scanlan can handle it i'm just going to look all right yeah 23 well probably natural 20 i look back to the group and go it won't open it won't-- (laughter) i pull the door a little bit shut behind me and turn to the group and say this is a room made entirely of metal that presumably did not exist five years ago i think this is probably bad sister dear would you help me look just from the door please just look no in a moment please and perception check the room from here 29 pike keyleth will you come up here we're a little out of our depths here this seems suspect to me i'd like you to both have a look that's a question for you as well percival pike keyleth do you make anything of this you have no knowledge of-- i checked the door but i didn't check anything else can i check the room for traps i would like to rolled a 23 i'll walk up within a foot of the first line you referenced that will probably tell us what this room is about i worry a little about alerting people on the other side of the room but it feels dangerous to go through here i step one foot behind cassandra number two so long as you all will pick me up off the floor i would like to skirt the entire side of the room see if i can make it to the other door please help me if i fall down and i start along in the wall is it one in the middle and then one in the center of each wall just on my wall i've gone into a crouch so i'm very low butt dragging along the floor and just sort of-- leaning my back against the wall continued perception check yeah 23 i check for traps on the door that is a 24 or locked grog doesn't have an earring does he grog he's across an 80-foot room i'm not going to shout down here there's a big heavy thing and you're the best you are at what you do do you think you could shimmy along on your tummy along a side wall don't stand up because there's gems in the walls along the way and i don't know what they do so stay low please and come meet me up here i touch one too who's christ this is our time now where's cassandra while all this is happening i pull the vial of poison that i traded from that hag and start to drip it down onto my blade of life-stealing behind the group now the door's open behind them right if i use perception do i see anything behind them any switch or lever or anything 20 just outside the door then i pull the cape around me and i dimension door outside that door right by the placard and jam my hand on that i have advantage the feast gives me advantage well but it doesn't stack right i rolled a 16 one question and i'm assuming i'm gone but in combat i would be able to roll a wisdom save every six seconds right 24 hours not this time guys the briarwoods' personal quarters are really plush they're sick cold as ice mercer oh no she's muted hanging up and calling you back i am having some fabulous dark chocolate right now it is so good they're feeding it to me motherfucker oh i have a rumbly in my tumbly quick question while i'm with my new friends in any moments that they're not telling me to go somewhere or walk somewhere can i just look at the symbol on my hand that's it just stare at it whenever i can when they're not paying attention where are you we should all be together you should join me here i'm on the top of a thing i can see very far everybody is very attractive up here i think something nice is about to happen i'm afraid to ask questions though i don't want to seem-- to sarenrae with no advantage i'm still a half-elf 13 no i have advantage advantage for half-elf advantage for feast total of 13 what is that yes you're still very pretty me too earring talk can i ask a clarification question the mojo they have on me do i think they're my best friends in the world or is it more kilgrave i do whatever they say but have my own opinion trapped away all right it's a little of both it seems like i trust them surprise motherfucker i don't know why my sister is firing at me but i would like to use uncanny dodge or evasion whichever is applicable in this moment so i don't get hurt so dexterity right that's pretty good that's a 28 i call out and say vex'ahlia what are you doing me too i call it dying 16 is it a bear or is it fat percy wait question am i still percy if she's fooled by a fat percy she's surely fooled by a svelte percy does she think she has percy what's going on so she can see big percy but realizes it's not big percy it's just absurd i see her confused look and i call out we're all percy get it that was ages ago what do i do in this situation i trust them but i also trust them i'm going to do whatever you tell me were i to see her the most important person to me in the world act on lady briarwood i'd be like what's up that's lady briarwood kill her okay and i've seen trinket and i've seen scanlan i've seen percy then i'm going to step right in front of lady briarwood and shield her with my body from percy percival you've got to stop this is madness this is that spirit of yours break his head like a melon get him and there's a pillar between you and me in the middle of a 30-foot stretch then can i look up and stay in a defensive stance and back towards lady briarwood 12 come on kiki is she taking a step away from me i'm taking my blade with the poison on it and i'm going to slash at her that is an 18 okay that had whatever that poison is that i sold my soul to a hag for okay so the regular damage is-- let's deal with one problem at a time that's a ten for just the damage no this is poison i'm not in a position to sneak attack 12 13 19 24 points of poison i just stare with a half-cocked smile advantage because i'm a half elf i don't need anything because i'm a half-elf is she trying to charm me or hold me trying to disintegrate me to death is it a wisdom thing do the daggers then shunt back up to my belt though sure i'm bigger than you the whole world's come undone okay right now 14 it's a constitution okay fucking bastard you're all the way in vasselheim can you unleash some holy fire on any fucks it's all right it's all right you know the astral plane is tricky that freaking wizard woman man that's good chip her down but the last one was good so 23 not again constitution save at this point if only no thinking of ikea instructions he's looking

there's a time to blow your wad it's now i'm seeing this all in slow motion burn him sorry cursed gun he's going to eat a bag of holy dicks is what you're saying right may i ask a question does cassandra's charm come from sylas or lady briarwood from lady briarwood yeah somebody hit her hit her we've got the mvp over here no she's asking if i'm still-- come on big roll 13 plus nothing is 13 nope yeah you said something about a minute before though didn't you i walk up to grog and her and i face percy and repeat what grog said why not i turn towards her and i punch her across the jaw as hard as i can i'm going to walk up to my sister and take her hand and squeeze it as hard as i can and just walk forward with her how far away is she can i see her if i've gone up to her all right i'm going to start throwing as soon as i'm near my sister hi no but i could get closer that's true grog that's true that's a good point what is the relationship to her if i've just gotten next to her no shut up you where are we and where is she are we on the edge of a ledge or a wall so you said jennifer lopez is 80 feet from us 15 can i use uncanny dodge at this moment yeah what is she casting a spell i can also use evasion right but depending on what it is those both do different things okay they do the same thing sorry it was a 15 so half damage matthew you're very good at this that's it i just want to say you're very good at this 20 wait there's an orb coming up from where and we're how high in the air from the floor that she's on if i go to the very edge how far am i from her that's within range right yeah i'm throwing then at her 60 feet because i'm sharpshooter so i take no disadvantage yeah i don't like her yeah so i'm going to throw two daggers at her i don't know if there's any poison left-- i'm sure there's not-- on the life-stealing and the keen first one is not good at all that's a 14 and the second one hits that's a 28 that is the life-stealing that is seven points of damage you flicked me in the left nut are you complicit let's see what happens question did we surprise her she's well aware that we're here did i go before her is there initiative here did i go before her turn i think this is going to be shot down and i'm fine if it is but i know that with assassinate if i go before the enemy does it's an automatic critical if she rolls really high really high yes come on hail mary pass here we go good attempt though sam one 20 come on coup de grace no no no shut up four and-- pretty good that's good 20 and six whose turn is it i'm leaping if you let
