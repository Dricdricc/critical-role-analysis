it's a weird word the winga stage i love it we're going to be on the wikia stage they have to come all the way from kraghammer what (laughs) you didn't seem that excited though iron yeah just two things i wanted to thank every critter who helped out with joe madureira's kickstarter with airship syndicate's kickstarter for battle chasers nightwar they crushed it they got to almost every rung of their ladder maybe you guys could help them raise 100k tonight but joe told me that they saw a little bit of a bump every thursday and that our roleplaying power had some effect so thank you guys thank you very much the other thing is tomorrow is sam riegel's birthday i have a birthday present for him tonight something i commissioned the lovely kit buss to make for you it's vaxmas here it is i'm going to send it across and then i'll tweet it out you guys can look but i made this just for you she's not effing around either such an old trope in fantasy you are the yin to wil wheaton's yang fresh start 15 he has better armor class than i do i'm clicking my boots of haste and i get double movement so i get to go 60 feet i'm going to slink up right beside trinket and stab the shit out of this invisible thing so because trinket's right there this is a sneak attack that hits that is 29 to hit (counting) 25 for the first hit no he didn't-- that's a critical hit one shy so now out comes the dagger of life-stealing it misses-- well does 15 hit just barely hits oh that's better than i thought that is three plus six is nine for damage and then the keen dagger comes back and that gets a 27 so that also hits for nine of damage and trinket is very comforting pressed against my shoulder as i do all that he's supple 28 for me vax or liam roll a what now that is a 15 you turn on yourself those would hit tiamat all right in a split second i'm watching grog take the thing apart i size up everybody in front of me in the distance and i think i can assassin creed my way through the crowd because i can go 60 feet normally so 30 feet if it's crowded and i'm going to use grog's proximity to take this thing apart all right so the first one is terrible it's a 14 and that's where the sneak attack damage is right all right third one is a 21 so there's the delivery system and that is the keen dagger 26 27 32 38 and i slap grog on the back and say you softened the shit of him that's terrible english you softened him up for me asshole you shitted him up for me grog good job there's four more of them stay back i rolled a 22 arcana check all i know is they feel like the briarwoods well all i know is how to stick my face in the beehives apparently jarett are you up for it is he still on the bed i sit down next to him and say listen you are a victim of circumstance we understand that we are to a certain degree as well we're not leaving your side and really there's no other choice i mean you're fucked like we are so we will do our best to protect you i promise you oh wow in a locked cell with grog i think is pretty safe i like all of these things but i think grog as a bunkmate is a good idea there is a lot of history for percy wrapped up in this and he has done you wrong no question but the answer is yes you will be separate from percival you will be protected and you have my word i'm going to use some luck using my luck natural 20 with luck we may be fuck-ups-- but we're not without ability you have my word i promise you on my way up i fall in next to keyleth ask is your hand all right do you need anything is this a frittata at home i rolled a one this frittata is lovely apologies are mine i think i believe you had some sort of plan and i thought i knew better and for that i'm sorry roll high no that was brief i have fair chances of getting in but no ability to cure him of any such thing does he still trust allura he did he did question her allegiances i think we're really choosing between two paths here either we stay in town and tinker and gamble or we're runaways that's what i'm talking about the minute we leave we're outlaws they've told us not to go yeah but we can't tell them 'we're going to check out your associates' we're going to be outlaws we have to clear ourselves by ending the charm on uriel by finishing off sylas sylas briarwood i don't think we're here in this city to become lords and ladies serving uriel as good a man he is i think percival's our ally and this is a grievous wrong done to him and we can kill two birds with one stone started on the bottom now we're here but keyleth uriel is the law and the law is now corrupt yes but you said it out loud it's a strategy chub all right it's an odd choice of words but now 30 seconds later i see what you mean i have another idea uriel said that-- he was resistant but he said that he would bring me in to have his people check me out check out my story what if keyleth and scanlan rode in my pockets-- you're pretty small just as mice magic user's choice can you cast magic when you're transformed he's leaving town tomorrow scanlan and i are in agreement and here's the problem if things go south in uriel's palace we are then forced to fight against people who are good and true or give up and go to jail which sucks the law of this land is compromised percival i agree with you i think this is the right choice so errands will happen after that break because i have some errands that i want to do music you mean (singing) kill the vampire marisha and all right i want to be brief i have four things i want to do but i'll be very brief i promise okay so first thing i want to do is i think at some point i heard tiberius talking about wooden stakes and vampires so i want to go buy about ten wooden stakes i'm going shopping can i get a loaner on that i've got about 230 gold on my own it's a week so i get some gold from these people and i go and i don't even know what they said i'm getting ten wooden stakes for myself that's what i thought and what did you want i'll get to that investigation you say that is a 13 i'll get to that all right so we got wood that was two gold you said all right minus two the next thing i want to do is go to the temple of sarenrae and get my sister's holy oil for her how much is that i'll take both if you've got it holy oil 40 stakes four gold totally happened then i went to the temple of sarenrae and i got two vials of holy oil one for my sister one for me okay got it i can't oh you gave me gold i'll get four vials of that we'll work that out i promise i ask if the cleric who helped bring pike back to life is here jesus how do you do that when i find him i say you remember my friend pike you remember me it is i'm grateful i need a keepsake of your deity [no audio] it reminds me of my friend all right so chore number two down i would like to go to uriel's temple and ask the guards if anyone has seen my belt simon i understand i don't mean to go in i understand that we caused a lot of trouble and i am very sorry and i don't mean to be any further trouble there is a belt that i left inside have you seen a snake called simon or any snake okay chore number four (laughter) perception check oh that's a seven thought it was a one (laughs) that is a 17 excuse me i'm sorry to take you away from your day i'm sorry what is your name jameson i understand i'll just take a second of your time i owe a boy who lives here named kynan i owe him a few silver and i want to see that he gets it is he in town i'll use the meteorite that's a 15 where would he have gone i agree he ever talked about where he was going how he meant to go about doing it i don't know who that guy is if you see him tell him that v is looking for him at greyskull keep thank you are you all right old man that's it what are they i go to gilmore's glorious goods and ask at the front door if gilmore is there understood who's the most knowledgeable person next to gilmore in this store right now oh hi you remember me i have a very important question i won't take up much of your time i pull out a small metal skull cap dented in a few places rusted a bit from the underdark what can you tell me about this sis can i borrow some money how much would that require done are we talking magic against that's fucking brilliant i hand her the gold and say scanlan sends his regards thank you how do you learn if you don't ask aw come on grog that's cutting-edge technology in this day and age well two per foot tibs they're five inches apiece right you can fit two in a foot so you just bought 35 so that's about-- and knowing is half the battle also this will just take ten seconds at some point in the week when keyleth is taking a walk i go into her garden and i clip one flower and i take it go sleep in your money he's spent people he's spent someday we will get out of the character creation menu but not this day give it to scanlan come on laura then it'll be hilarious roll that die come on roll high and it will be amazing you are playing dnd right now all right is she an emperor now that's all ranger stuff wow i bought some sticks everybody shut up and let grog go on a one man solo kill spree (whispers) send him three more letters i love doing this show (laughter) percival de rolo knows where we're going to go i think we need to go on the down-low rein it in we're going to fight vampires matt i'm pretty sure it's si-google what's in those fields yes i think percival you're leading the way use my sister as an advisor but you're leading the way right now let's do this in real time you can handle that i'm going to walk forward sarenrae jeepers i'm going to use perception i'm going to look at it before going out that is a 23 i leave my horse with my sister i'm on foot i'm on all fours really spidering out so i'm lasting what would i make is it an insight check to decide if i thought grog could make it across this thing take that zero off it and you've got it this is fun you swing back and forth grog i think you might like this all right he sounds like a debbie downer grog but i'll go across and you can follow is there anything on the other side i could tie it to i use a sailor knot i double-knot mine jeepers will you warn a half-elf when you're going to do that she's haggling you right now they'll be eaten by something long before that it's fine tell my sister i love her i'm vox wait who oh he grabs me you've got me 29 so you're saying there's a chance while my sister's looking at her shit i bogart trinket and climb up onto him use him like a sleeping bag and cuddle into his softest warm parts and fall asleep sorry not sorry yeah got to roleplay that shit he convinced you let's go slower yes you get ten oh well i got a 40 then natural 20 smurfs stealth it sounds like basilisks but they're too slow didn't see me yeah fuck this thing let's get out of here salamander no it's not it's like 845 who's that guy that's a kobold
