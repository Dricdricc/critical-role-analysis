that's not the laura i know we have the whole gang here three episodes from now he's going to bring in a gospel band wan the glory of grog in that issue they have just teased the first critical role vox machina portrait of pickle everyone else is pixelated but pickle has been revealed you're allowed to do any of those things it's like a real game yasha caleb nott dinghy battle yeah yasha are you paddling yeah so we would be at the front of the boat going-- terrible it is sad when ships sink i don't know (laughter) (pigeon cooing) that seems not like a good idea nice carrot top nice yasha can you use your oar to see how deep we are does it touch bottom unfucked excuse me you could be stealthing ahead at this moment in the boat i had these miniatures i forget what they're called i dropped my colville meteorite oh i got a 20 oh i got a one the 20 would have been nice though ashley and that's so cool und ein oh do i oh sure two no no plus one so now it's two ja of course i'm pretty sturdy though so i wouldn't sweat it but do you see it we are level four eight damage sick mistress of the hunt i went from being able to see almost nothing to seeing nothing i heard nott get scholpped in and then i heard some cry so i raise up the glove of blasting and i'm going to fire at where i think this thing is yeah three strikes at disadvantage that's correct okay good for the first is 16 yeah let me do them all 11 und 15 (frantic noises) plus that is ten the total is 13 okay before it hits me i'll say i sit down on the bench and just go (whimper) i am a monk it's fine yeah of course it hits yeah that's wunderbar does she get sneak attack since i'm adjacent to that one question is frumpkin by the thing because frumpkin is an ally i know that i have read that frumpkin can help me give me advantage whatever you want i would say leave me in that motherfucker this is your jam get it alta√Ør in a split second before when i heard a blunt (impact) oh that was beau i'm feeling pretty good i feel streamlined yeah i clean up well half of the skiff still the only light in here are my four globules correct not so good nine (foomphs) i scrabble back and squish in with nott at the front of the boat bye i guess i am 12 halt wait stop can you fight against the current for a moment okay it's going to get dark in here for a second all right but don't worry i drop the globules and i cast detect magic it is only 30 feet i'm focusing obviously on the rock slide that you just described beyond the rock slide that's on one side of the passage that we are in if i crane my neck in the other direction is there anything on that side all right well in the darkness you hear there is something of an arcane nature in the middle of those rocks that were ahead of us what do you want to do do you want to go scrabbling in the dirt or do you want to keep going forward it could be something beneficial or it could be terrible nobody can see anything right now does anyone have a torch i would prefer to keep this up for the time being do i look like the gentleman right now okay it's not that weird can i see what was giving me the arcane signature yeah what about you two beefcakes can you move these stones out of the way ashley and question because the spell that i cast only lasts ten minutes somewhere around the eight or nine minute mark do i see-- you said it was on the other side of the rock slide so are they uncovering anything before the spell is gone so not a door but just a passageway the torch is still up it's possible that i will want to steal it but can i make anything out does it look like anything that i have read about or encountered before so it's a glow stick but it's in an iron cage let's continue on before we leave this little cage does it look bolted into place it's small maybe later let's continue on which way do we want to go you have one setting naughty yeah i was going to say not the back but i will let the bruiser walk behind me the shaft is (laughing) no has it been that long well schmidt can't see shit but frumpkin-- can my cat see in the dark i would know that i don't know it makes sense for anyone who had gone into their basement and seen the cat go (humming) okay well let's go by the rules then well i have a range on that i don't like that idea actually how about i send frumpkin with you and between frumpkin and you we'll be in good shape yeah you're just peeking who am i behind mollymauk i place hands on his shoulders and send frumpkin down ten feet ahead of nott and i'm seeing-- yeah or listening and trying to listen and see through frumpkin so it gets too dark and hazy past that altar yasha can you hand the torch down and get it to nott so that she can go a little bit further is it spent now are you going to tell everybody about the pressure plates do we have anything heavy to put on them to hold them down we don't know has the party held up at this point while that happened i would like to investigate the part of the room that i can see is there anything dangerous or hinky yes thank you 21 this is where frumpkin is correct through frumpkin's eyes the half of the room or the portion of the room that frumpkin can see are we all going i'm holding onto mollymauk and just following it's down low though get it arcana insight investigation i have that kids' toy that makes these you spin it and the little pen goes around and around something was giving off an arcane aura before we came in here but i cannot see it now so if you indulge me and give me ten minutes i will-- yeah 16 you can tell if you were to rotate it it would line up triangle to triangle that would bring the star to that one there there's a diamond right there caleb is still going through the ritual well i will remember this i have a perfect memory i will remember this exactly she talks about them a lot has ten minutes gone by yet did detect magic reveal what was glowing in here before oh it was just the glow stick she's too drunk sorry 826 you want to deal with that right away yeah here you go big lebowski well here's what i think i can send these little globules of light quite a ways and i can also send frumpkin quite a ways so why don't we let frumpkin have a look and we just hang back let's say 30 feet in front of the group with one of my dancing lights about ten feet behind her-- him him it's all right jester drew it i remember it we're good i'll take second position looking for dangerous shit for me through frumpkin is terrible seven knowing distance space the direction of north at all times with frumpkin in there am i able to tell how far back we are from this chamber we're 20 feet back would you say that detect magic is still cooking at this point are we still under the ten minutes from when i cast in the other room am i sensing anything find one thing you're good at in life and do it for the rest of your life (laughter) i'm going to scooch-- well no i'm with beau so i'm asking if i sense anything of arcane nature a retroactive question-- no never mind anything arcane before it dips out no i'm behind beau i'm dropping frumpkin vision you're also good you point that out as well off of her first comment i would send one of the globules floating up to the ceiling to better illuminate what she's pointed out was that 30 feet above us is there any space between the ceiling and the container no you're good something metallic in the rubble vase above just to clarify your description the container is being held from above chains coming down or no two chains from the ceiling i'm going to scoot up behind fjord and see if i can detect any arcane anything before the spell sniffs out what kind was it yeah i catch fjord by the arm be careful whatever is under there is something of protection something to keep us out or to protect something i think i would have noticed that the circus bouncer looking in the urn did not get blown up but also looked a little puzzled so i'm going to go over and take a look at the same thing yasha is right next to it the dice are doubled not your modifiers but the dice yeah i got another one for 826la i was where yasha was i went over to look at her urn frumpkin would have been just 15 feet into the chamber rolled one which makes me a two i love it they vanish they're gone they're fucking ghosts you punched cotton candy (singing) fuck you i won't do what you tell me go for that natural 20 fucking muscle wizards caleb does what that bearded dude in the gif does going-- seeing that happen and i cast scorching ray myself and i will send one ball of fire at the next pot no the other one besides that yeah that is-- oh jeez everything changed for me so that is perception plus-- not perception intelligence modifier which is five plus seven so that is an 18 to hit okay that's 2d6 for a damage of seven so that did not get destroyed then it got damaged that was just one so i continue to wrap my hand around and a second one shoots out at the one in the ceiling that is a natural 18 yeah that is an eight the other one shoots up in the air and lands two feet behind me just goes (explosion) no i'm standing oh shit that's hot don't strain a hammy at this point we should be able to see the things that the very perceptive people saw which was two faces eyes with holes in them in the middle-- in this room should we do it in this room mama put the coins in my eyes because i sure do not believe what i am seeing caleb doesn't say anything or move at all but he's thoroughly impressed with nott by the way i will send two of my globules down after him how far down is that does everybody see yeah caleb is travelling down the rope that yasha dropped i would've gotten down the rope at this point and seeing fjord examine that i cast detect magic instantly okay what kind ashley and i'm allowed to know it's in the book what's in the fucking potion matt does detect magic uncover anything else besides what he's already looking through oh an hour fjord hold that up for me so i can tell you what it is i will spend the next 10 minutes with fjord sitting in front of me and me looking at it and doing the ritual you want to rest first or do you want me to tell you what it is now okay so 10 minutes that takes identify well i don't have it you have it arcane recovery yeah the eyes were for uncovering all that death underneath our feet fjord you can of course stick that thing in the hole in that bottom room if you want but if you like my man schmidt could do it with little risk to the rest of us if you like we should all stand back better safe than sorry yeah well look here now that we're back peering through the doorway at this we have this star on that corner and if you would rotate-- we don't know what we're rotating is the thing we're saying that's the idea because there's a diamond to a diamond and a star to a star and a triangle of dots to that triangle well i bumped up to 20 edubation it's critical evocation is destruction i'm casting in an instant unseen servant schmidt is here with us fjord hold out your magic whatsit there i command fjord to give that to schmidt schmidt takes it the spell runs out-- (laughter) it is true that's why we're hanging back behind the door do we think we should go clockwise or counter-clockwise schmidt please revolve that staff counter-clockwise please well try it clockwise then schmidt well that's a lot of bollocks then dance it out of there not a gelatinous cube a gelatinous cube oh shit we might need to do all three at the same time guys fucking focus focus no more dick jokes focus on the cube this is dangerous 21 you die frumpkin or-- frumpkin can be oh jeez right behind me is fine i'm going to use all my movement to move back towards the doorway as best i can ja as i am doing so i am pulling a small clay cat paw out of my hand i mutter a few arcane words and i cast maximilian's earthen grasp a wad of soil forms out the ground and a cat's paw rises up and reaches out and swats at the gelatinous cube ja that's correct against my dc of 15 on a failed save the target takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage so that is a seven and it's restrained for the spell's duration so it attacks at disadvantage and you attack at advantage there is a giant earthen cat's claw holding it on the corner restrained it's the restrained condition yes it is i have a question is there any light in here at all okay so there's dim light then from the torch because my globules are gone that's correct thank you okay and then i sit yeah say again frumpkin can do whatever frumpkin will run towards jester and get between-- where's nott frumpkin will stand between jester and the cube everybody has advantage on attack rolls beauyasha do it up jello shots you did it at advantage go for the 20 yeah bones don't step on my cat at disadvantage i want to roll a rogue right now that builds goblin it's restrained low-level rogue high-level rogue eh but low-level rogue is sick one time just for attacks 15 for me gott verdammt it's out does that mean it's not restrained who's it getting my cat you motherfucker (screaming and laughter) i mean i'm assuming it takes like four points of damage immediately my cat three it's gone instantly i believe my cat's paw is still in existence and would like to try to do the same shit so (swiping) (meow) 15 it can move as well it is yeah i can looking it up did it get five feet it was five feet in front of it and it moved that way it would've been right in front of it all right so dc 15 it's strength aw it doesn't do it great i will use the rest of my movement to move another ten feet back in the hallway i'm in she's out was she absorbed is she absorbed laura and no probably you'll die yasha ashley you just destroyed a classic dungeons & dragons foe (clapping) (imitating jester) put your tusk in there fjord (laughter) get my cat out of there from down the hallway you hear now the question is if we do the same thing again will another one come out or do we need to try to hit all three at the same time let me come in there leave it nearby i can do both divination and evocation can you do one of those things well tell me what you are able to do divination and evocation yeah you can do evocation with this one-- but you have to get up there though you have to touch it with that one so you handle evocation i can handle the divination you handle necrotic it is worth a try of course it is i'm pretty good i have not let go all of my preparation for the day is everyone all right jester how are you feeling no not laura but you jester how are you feeling i reach into the satchel on the side i give her my potion of healing regular healing well what are you complaining about then that is not the verbiage that i chose at all sam and necro evo and divination all together do you think it would hurt if we did it at the same time let's do it at the same time identify which is divination okay that was good we checked that box so let's go back into the room yeah okay yeah that's good it's 20 the urns currently are totally empty i know i-- we maybe need to go upstairs and scoop some of the dustbuster bullshit into these and bring them down no i'm saying we need to go collect some of the ashes of the dead from upstairs something is missing here it's possible that we need to burn something afresh yeah i can set things on fire as well do you want to do one yeah it's easier i cast firebolt into one of them just to note schmidt is still here with us if we need anyone to hold anything that's dangerous-- i have transmutation i know enchantment and transmutation all right we'll figure out-- i have transmutation and enchantment and what do you have jester so you're enchantment that means i have transmutation if another cube or something comes out-- that's right we've got these two bruisers here that's good i concur i of course in front of transmutation you're doing what i'm doing maximilian's earthen grasp again with my cat's paw wait i sit down and i start doing the ritual for detect magic again ten minutes five more minutes caleb is super intense on his shit right now going i am helping the group everyone's going to be safe did we wait the short amount of time for detect magic the will-o'-wisps are the dead they are left from the dead give me a second to blacklight the room yeah i'm waiting for the narrator to-- yes good right so i'm walking is there anyone between the bookshelf and me where i am is fjord who's the closest i walk up between the two of them and i have a 30 foot radius on the spell so i'm basically doing this but i'm very interested in the bookshelf obviously i'm looking everywhere is there a type i will ask that every time friendship magic in the wall above the bookshelf zero books jester's holding it how's the girth i obviously can do that and i have a little bit of reserve left but we are still not topside yet so we can either sit for ten minutes and i can tell you exactly what it does or we wait until later but i'm not willing to do this-- it is ten minutes we can wait until later does it have any paper a natural 20 no the first one was right detect magic's still going by the way i know common oh god i don't know where to look on d&d beyond description character details i know sylvan common and celestial then i will cast comprehend languages it doesn't just one i cast comprehend languages don't write that down because only i know it right i tell nobody this i do read it out loud jester while molly is looking around hold that for me hold it still the sword and i will tell you what it is but you have to hold it for a while muscles oh man it's okay i have one spell slot left it's fine all we have to say is we cleared it yeah we need to do some discussion that's nothing i could go for another two hours at least only cool things here only cool things
