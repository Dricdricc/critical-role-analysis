asphyxius see you in five minutes 14 this is all taking six seconds by the way come on gunslinger okay i click my boots of haste and i'm going to-- where's the thingie do we have a thingie here the light all right great how's this work like that if i can run right between pike and this little brain jerk right here does that get me within five feet of elder brain if i'm there i can't tell from the structure yeah that's what i want to do and then i don't know that's not my full double-movement i don't know how that affects the number of attacks i have hasted but i just want to stab it as many times as i can standing on top of this thing where's the meteorite die using my poison dagger yeah yeah i'm going to shiv him in his shank or shank him in his shiv whichever is the more accurate phrase okay do i get two or three attacks first one misses second one is-- oh wait the first was a 17 is that-- hit or miss it's a brain right i'm standing-- okay then i'm using now dagger of venom is 26 okay so that's four plus six is ten because this isn't sneak attack or anything that's ten plus a poison for a dc of 15 so that was that and then the third attack i'll go back to the keen dagger 14 yeah i can probably get up 15 feet and hang there it was a good run folks 20 natural 20 the brains the brains 19 (jeering) i'm smart (laughter) aren't you inspired just say 20 big nine i said big nine i personally can't wait until we roll new characters next show all the fans who implied that matt went light on us the last game-- i fainted if we live we're in store for so much i-told-you-so (laughter) no not there what did clarota do with his hat over behind-- okay i'm still hasted i'm going to run down the center over clar-- i'm going to step on clarota's-- i don't know if he has nuts but whatever's there i'm going to step there run around scanlan and place his fucking hat on my head and then run up behind that third mind flayer who i don't think has taken a hit yet and just start stabbing him in the back i can't get back there i don't think so well it's up to-- oh dear i'm hasted i can run 12 spaces so if you think that i could have run around the mind flayer put on the party hat-- okay great so i'm going to start stabbing him in the back angrily okay yeah so first one is a 15 that's a sneak attack because she's next to him there's nothing in the rule book about stunned or unconscious or anything i rolled a 24 okay thank you all right so that is four plus seven is 11 plus-- okay that's 17 21 thank you 26 30 33 33 with keen dagger and i'm sticking that in the back of his neck that's the first attack okay so good thing i have more knives so i take the other one flip it in my hand and then stick it into the neck afterwards that's a 24 yeah it does that's eight fire damage i don't know if he takes any fire damage and i'm going to then stick him with my poison dagger which isn't going to poison him but that is a 26 which hits as well and that is eight as a bonus action i would like to goodfellas-kick him about eight times in the ribs (laughter) there's still a mind flayer this show is not good for my blood pressure minus from your intelligence it's just the brains just the little brains do what you want it's chaos grog we would like you to rage use that inspiration die man come on he's climbing the cliffs of insanity (laughter) i mean it might get sent reeling that brain maybe if-- we should try to get out of here but maybe if we can frigging hurt that brain it'll stun them or send them reeling or something or make them mad get it big money yeah i'm coming a skillion four out of five dms recommend (laughter) okay i run up the dais land on the brain i'm on my way but before i go i'm going to kiss you goodbye dagger dagger dagger stabbing into the brain before i leap onto the carpet so here i go first one-- misses second one is a 25 which gets nine damage and last dagger is a 13 okay so i'll give him a little cut a little nick and then jump on the flying carpet and i grab percy around the neck and kiss him on the cheek and say let's get out of here you bastard fight the patriarchy oh i'm suffocating in the brain percy and vax ship it oh dear but now it's awake so-- if you can also flee at the same time it's your decision six cubes sam six cubes you could get the edge of the brain well i'm still sitting still kneeling on the flying carpet with percy so i'm just throwing daggers at the bacon brain okay so that means aw man 17 on the first all right so then the second one does as well and the last one definitely does so okay and then percy yelled in my ear so i take some of the little carpet tassels grog (sings) sweet bird of prey fly fly away we're gone man we're gone i jump up to get out of range don't fuck with my sister what kind of saving throw matt and you rolled nine plus two is 11 for what okay 13 a lot of sandmen in there i'm steering us the fuck outta here man greyskull where are we you said we're in a room not knowing what else to do vax is going to go to the door and just inspect it see if it's trapped 24 not trapped okay i'll get to work on it then 32 pull up i'm still wearing my tin hat and i pull up my hood from my elven cloak and i go stealth and i am stealthed because that's a 32 and i have a look around outside the door yes yes yes i just walk forward and pull down the cloak and say hello hands up in the air nothing in them no threat no danger here a little lost apparently yes they're-- i have a very long very strange story every word of which is true and if you will give me five minutes i swear i can convince you-- no ill intent intent yes yeah emperor just tell the emperor that vox machina has returned from kraghammer and we have news for him and-- yes i imagine he would be very upset if we were delayed we come with very grave news yes but don't stand right in front of her when you undo the stone we can probably flag down a wagon too yeah we've got a lot of bling and a cursed horn the sky's the limit we don't want to lose it in a game of cards starting here at geek & sundry for the record i think she'd be fine too but we could bring her around and introduce her it could be like weekend at bernie's (laughter) hello hi it's not cinco de mayo dispel magic i pick up the sleeping rat and just kinda scritch him it's all right he's fine look see his leg's going he's dreaming about something nice you're dreaming of magical artifacts aren't you yeah pretty sure we did first of all clarota was lying through his noodles and second even if he wasn't which he was he's now fucking pissed off-- well they're all one hive-mind right listen this is number five tonight they're angry they were following us you don't think they're going to scurry up the bottom of kraghammer and tear that place apart it took us about a week to get from kraghammer in so we've got about a week they don't know anything about mind flayers they know about weird things coming out but not the mind flayers yeah they seemed very grateful the only person the only person that would remotely know is you tiberius and i don't think-- oh that's a good boy he didn't seem to know anything i think allura is the person to go to right now yes yes we do i'm still cuddling him no i'm holding you i don't want to wake you up she sent us after kima kima thinks that she's in the middle of a fight the moment she comes out she'll be all hot and bothered-- we didn't trust clarota we were using him as much as he was using us it went south well most of us he's not human at all vax shoves another flagon in front of keyleth in the short term scanlan are you able to send it to another dimension for a while when we meet her i don't think we should have it i think one or two of us should take it away we don't all have to be at that meeting you know the other characters can make insight checks too you know that right if we have it then she's she could say you're lying-- i don't think your winks will work on her yes it's fucking simple you and i could take a walk with it and play tiddlywinks or something in the woods that's fine what's wrong with that it's easy just be somewhere else anywhere else vax gives his sleeping sister a wet willie scanlan turn tiberius back into a rat back into a rat you're not a rat though we just don't fear for our lives for the first time i am so sad that you woke up i was just about to go to the hearth and get some ash and draw a penis on your head next thing out of my mouth that's a promise good idea you were right we were wrong you're very attractive we're all quite ugly you saw your mission as a suicide mission but if you had secured it what were your plans what was plan b what were you going to do bummer i think what worries us is anyone coming in contact with it would be corrupted no of course plus he decided not to put you in the magical bag when you were a statue i got an asus computer with an aren't we clever sticker on it with a hundred
