written a limerick i think you'll all approve and then i'll tell you a little bit about lootcrate but first some irish poetry sam's style is not what you'd call quaint let's be honest my man is no saint but lootcrate is happy his pitch plans are snappy singing songs about fisting and taint (laughter) so you gotta go get got and you want to go to lootcratecom/criticalrole not critrole but lootcratecom/criticalrole and the promo code is 'criticalrole' one word for 10% off your first month also taint there are some exclusives we're gonna pick power word kill green dragon green dragon you don't know yeah i would like my boots back and i've been sort of dreading this moment can i have my boots back it's all i've noticed for the last 24 hours when we were fighting i mean we probably would've killed her yesterday but i was so distracted by how good you looked in the boots yeah yeah strategically i think i can actually do more and i think i'm more likely to get a little more bang for my buck out of them never mind i'll use the sword-- that was as painful as i imagined it would be yes it could've been percy would you like this sword back or anybody yeah the sword i just i'm better when i'm maneuverable and i feel like i'm gonna get one swing and a miss and it go to waste sure you can here's the handle another one of those secrets she was telling me about and you have to give matt $20 i noticed you haven't actually given me the boots back and i just wanted to remind you-- it's very important i'm also going-- oh you go well you know what are the chances that she's gonna need to bolt probably more than sneak around probably we're going to brawl it's like changing from one pair of ski boots into another pair of ski boots all right minor thing i'm going to attune the deathwalker's ward to necrotic is that a thor hammer is that thing how far can you throw that thing ugh what's all over the bottom of the table after the show you're a fallout character what did you do that magic sword bit me that really hurt kerrek do you still want it (laughter) can i also say no one's gonna ever try to get away with anything here because we know we're being watched-- people are watching like hawks everything's going to be seen pike can you take a look at your buddy pike got that cloak that fucking hotis glued to my flesh off that's i think what she did yeah it's made from the flesh of a flying manta ray-type thing and it makes you really hard to hit and this is a loaner-- i know that i know i also have a very precious ring which i would love to have back from you once we've killed this dragon but you will not be seen if you wear it and i slap the ring down into his palm a picture of the ring yes i have a thing if anyone has anything better to give him we could do that hey siri remind me to ask patrick rothfuss for my ring of invisibility back once the dragon is dead we're good that was a one-time thing we should just go would you put that piece of wood down please work slips her doc martens over here he's been in every brothel in tal'dorei it's to be expected (laughter) you and i head out 20 feet ahead of everybody and check for traps as we go carefully investigation or-- 18 so you think something's up under the ground there i mean what do i do at this point i'm gonna take a closer look is what i'm gonna do now that i have context context is key as always do i find a trap if i'm looking closer now with her added how much of it looks different continue sinkholes you also weigh a little more-- seems like the closer we get the deader it gets natural 20 no it's not perception oh yeah is 12 so 32 who fucking knows i perceive a rock checking for traps 25 for investigation might as well just wait a moment wait a moment no hang back for a second kik so this is happening it's the wedding all over again don't compare the boots to the deck are you kidding me what do you care what he says yeah everybody saw through it immediately just so you know well you saved the party but your marriage is in jeopardy he looks happy what was that about we zoom in on the single drop fanart please you just got james franco'd and that gap is just this much and does it go in like that like a long tunnel of that or is it-- could i reach my arm through shit why do you say that right now how is that relevant to the conversation at hand i've always said as much one second percy i have a nutball idea that maybe you could turn into a better one i pull out the oil of etherealness that i've been carrying for ages this it's goop you rub it on yourself and you become ethereal for an hour but i can't do it there's not enough to cover me but scanlan could do it or pike could do it and could walk through the rock look around see if there's anything to-- i don't know i prefaced it with saying it was a shitty idea and i spoke to the brain to see if he could come up with something better how would bigby be in this situation pike is laura and 16 to do what help prop it up i immediately throw whisper through the crack and bamf through checking checking checking 24 scanlan and keyleth come up here please do you know what that is no traps it's a theory we already stealthed oh i did 35 while we're quiet here in the dark i pull pike over to the side pike i have a bad-- will you take care of my sister you have that one thing that you do i don't know what it's called but if she falls down she gets back up again do you know what i'm talking about could you do that to my sister now i thought of it i do i do when you're brought down to zero you ping up to one is the math on that it's just strategy man game strategy well it's done and my sister is a little safer than she was before and y'all can go fuck yourselves this one and this one on me out of character matt pooped out this new feature to dying and she's on her last fucking string man no regrets move forward well you said it and the spell is cast listen i help my sister okay i'm always holding two and one of them is i pull out the flametongue dagger and i wave a fly away-- and i hold it so that kerrek can see and i say we might die so try it one more time with me irish wristwatch just once more before we die i feel so much closer to you now let's fucking do this too late now there's a candle we're about to die you're sure that's pretty good that is 29 i can look at these after constantly good suggestion still at disadvantage but if it's gone i can see 15 feet ahead so regular checks if the dagger's out and this is investigation 18 yeah right now i am 22 is the box trapped that is a 22 nah fuck it i don't mm-hm looking for traps thank you for retconning that yeah we'll ask him yeah but i would've read them if i could've i'm not grog i mean this could be crypt shit on the sides i'm gonna focus a little more on the ground yes he asked me through the earpiece what the books said could i read them when i saw them common elvish and abyssal tighter buns in 30 days is the only title i saw looking for traps 25 as a precaution i'm going to as much as i can stay to the stuff that looks natural or fucked-up and not civilized gods damn it what are you doing back there he's already holding it well i mean if anything was gonna happen we're probably fucked already so i don't know i'm kind of for leaving things alone as we go through here percival i think dicking with it in the first place might have already ruined us but yeah let's just set it down turn it around delta lambda again sneaking in aw i don't know enough about that to say that correctly either 22 on the top or out the side of the top how tall is this chamber oh come here come here there's some shit there's some ingredients in that ready to go yeah there's something in that brazier over there that she hasn't burned yet i'm holding i'll do that and i'm also going to do divine sense here 22 there's no undead dragons walking around right how far from the gate to the far side of the room is the first question i'm at a gate that blocks us from going in is that correct right is there a gap like a crack that something could slide down out of right above where we are and in addition to everything we see do we see levers do we see panels do we see anything on the walls in this room luckily no one saw you because of that robe while she's doing that i'm just going to quietly extend my wings now they're pretty cool aren't they no they don't they go out and they slam back into my back i heard percival say that as we're watching grog i just lean over and say you know you are criticizing the size of my wings you are walking around with a persian rug a broom and a longbow strapped to your back oh jeez she's coming are there any holes in the ceiling i can see like there were in the last cave 24 no i'm looking at it man is anyone near me i push back slowly with my wings just get 15 20 behind me i'm gonna bring it to you i'm gonna try to take this fucking book off okay if i'm going to go down i don't want you to go down as well all right i get back about ten feet and i take my wing and i scootch it-- oh it's open percival come here and i light it up just to look at the pages that are there allura will you have a look at this might be that we're too nice we're basically all running around the room in circles 16 and a luck blown yeah i start breakdancing doing the worm underneath the blast jeez all right the luck wasn't blown because the other roll was a one i'm gonna go with grog yeah beacon of hope guys it's fine my ten-year-old son destroyed one of these recently we're gonna be fine (sings) get it on 21 number one all right after you scanman can you point to where i am in that scrum i can't tell i'm going to move to the opposite wall that scanlan just went to yeah and i'll fly ten feet-- i'm winged so i'll be ten feet in the air as well and i'm gonna huck a pair of daggers at-- i hope this is the right way-- the one on this side that's closest to you that's shit and then the second one-- that's true it's a 15 and then a 23 hey all right so first one is with whisper that is four plus eight is 12 plus psychic damage which is 19 for the first hit and from the venom dagger that i'm throwing next that is four plus six is ten ten total that's the end of my turn you boob four separate fireballs wow look at that everybody you crazy motherfucker cleared all of them evasion nice kerrek i saved all of them with evasion that's zero yeah yeah flat against the ground luckily luckily yeah the one that matt just touched get out of the box that's for saves not on attacks right somewhere sam is laughing he's good at cuddles hey you guys it's gonna be amazing when we're level one again we'll go i hit it for three points (cheering) this is a death trap grog what are you doing i start flying with him grog grog grog we don't know if everything has been fucked up will you just wait a second wow you're learning i'm gonna check for traps past where the gate was 20 or 30 feet yes they did yes that was not wasted advantage here we go let's go right now right now is there anything ahead of me as i look with my 19 but no traps do we want to keep moving or do we want to pause okay let the spell go then hit dice for all we know we fucked ourselves with that skull earlier we haven't outsmarted her yet (whispers) tell us all your secrets scanlan helped out with that (sings) when the blight has come and the land is dark and your health is down to 23 hp can't do it can't do it is he going to do a bump or a thing before i think too do you know what that means i kind of do that's the only thing that's within reach of one sorcery point right hey man it's just another version of craven edge (tom waits voice) what's percy building in there i found nothing in the further area right kerr is your hammer still aglow i wanna know if it's aglow right now did you have a chance to pop it out okay so i figured it was probably still on how far down the stairs do i see from where i am put that out please kerr i'm gonna go stealth and i'm gonna go down to the bottom of the steps and i've already checked for traps-- oh no i didn't up to this point so i'm gonna check for traps as i go down the steps which is 25 am i still under pass without a trace 25 natural 20 for that okay so hallway goes a ways then there's nothing and then 20 feet past that-- so a gap and then a wall on the earring team there's a passage down ahead of me there's no traps i don't think yeah catch up with me and then pause and then either i or my sister and i will move ahead did you mean vax or did you mean vex just want to be really sure because people make mistakes a lot very similar all right i know you're talking to vax yeah is it a staircase where i'm forced to walk or is it stairs on the walls and empty space down the center of it ah i'm going to float out above it and look for traps down the cylinder i've got wings 18 at or near the bottom doorway passage over the earring i didn't see any traps going down but there's some bloody spikes down here and some dead things so vex dear could you load everyone onto the carpet and get on your broom and go down and just float down to the center and leave the stairs alone yeah yeah yeah i can come up for pike bring her down we could just take a minute to-- and what around the spikes is there a safe portion on the floor 22 investigating for traps for that passage down behind the spikes all right best i can tell it's okay i'm not 100% sure but there's dead people down here so i just want you guys to float down the middle let's get this done 'kay i'm shooting up yeah i kinda wanna move as fast as we can i flew back up we take the gnomes down i take my little drug-addled buddy not that i know that and i float him down and i plant the gnomes down together oh man i plant him down i give him a big fat kiss right between the eyes you fucking beautiful bastard whack i fly back up right away keep this train moving i bring kima down she's wafer-thin is kima down allura i hope this is all right i mean whatever the time is needed go up grab keyleth bring her down go up-- i just grabbed up kerrek (laughs) best one ever 21 (strained) the raven queen sends her regards i'm sure we just killed ten minutes doing all that shit all right vax does a barrel roll heads back down lands and let's start looking around again all right stealth traps still vigilant for stealth that's a 28 and investigating for traps ooh that's a one and i'm not gonna use my luck on it i'm not seems clear we're good i am badass vax in the front jeez we just blew so much time on that fucking stairwell should've sent you to the marx brothers i don't know ten or 15 i guess zoinks yeah i thought we were cutting it close like it could be five or ten minutes at this point all right should i stand on the ground i'm gonna fly to the other side of the bridge right now over nothing i throw a dagger at the other side of the chasm 60 feet sharpshooter into the side near the top whisper as an attack there's a cliff facing me right yeah just into the rock wall of the cliff 20 22 okay okay now just smile and make the smile as big as manhattan gravity is fucked it was like pole-dancing but in space upside-down no no that's a bad idea grog you are very hefty and the gravity turns upside-down wait what if he took the carpet and hung off the bottom of it on the first side and then as he made his way over he'd be all right you know what i mean we saw that we saw that 26 26 but they look like spirits falling upwards i'm going to use divine sense now just to confirm that's me to you man oh it's a gif you got this oh you got such a bonus come on girl do they both make that roll 13 for pike matt watching this i'm going to pull whisper out and watch to see my sister falling through the air and if i see her falling i'm going to throw the dagger at her down or up i'm watching him and i'm watching her and if she goes-- how far away is she from me and i'm throwing whisper at vex i'm doing it you're like a loan officer i want to sell you this house but there's some shit we need to go over holy fuck this is fine where's the carpet where's the carpet where's the carpet where's grog and the flying carpet get off the rug get off the rug get off the rug now please isn't anyone on the rug that's why i asked back where it was shit how far are they from me i'm on the very edge close as i can get right i don't know where's the rope there's so much going on i rolled a 19 so 21 hand around kerrek's neck pulling him in thank you thank you fucking thank you it's like angry birds if you get the arc right she made it one way she's gotta go back the other way wait a minute are you saying this story only exists in our imagination (laughter) is she within 30 feet of me at this point wait she's within 30 feet of me now i'm blessing her thank you thank for catching my sister thank you checking for traps i always roll well on this 18 statue of a what please is it a dead end i'd like to move along the edge of the room checking for traps ahead 19 i'm gonna stop where i am then wait half a minute half a minute what's the light like what can i see down the way i'm looking okay so the statue's in this semi-natural chamber and turns into more carved-out civilized hey for science besides what you're doing scootch forward to the other side looking for traps looking for traps 30 fuck a duck we've got a fork in the road what do you want to do well there's nothing immediately dangerous-appearing i'd also like to use my last instance of divine sense here at this fork in the road are we all gathering up at this fork in the road bupkis for me should we all trot along or should we send us down this could be it although we thought it could be it twice at least well i mean if it's itching all right look we've got two identical passages do you want to flip a coin or can you see any benefit to either side flip a coin do you pull it out come on treasurer we're picking a passageway do what now do what now turn down for what (laughter) guilty (laughter) going to the right but hold on i'm gonna go a little bit ahead 20 feet ahead looking for traps i doubt but i want to check for traps stealth and traps stealth and traps okay great so traps investigation is 18 and as we move through this passage what do we see as we get closer to it well we're glad to have you
