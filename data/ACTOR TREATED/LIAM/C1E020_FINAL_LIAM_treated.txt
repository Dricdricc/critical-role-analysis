in so i'll grieve a little bit longer it's fine i just have a low tolerance for bullshit and i'd like to get past this little piece of shit that we're being made to swallow not a lot that's what i'm concerned about we lost our meat shield and we don't have pike so i think we probably need to go and get some potions how many have you got can i have one thank you do we have the flying carpet (imitating grog) we took the flying carpet sorry (imitating grog) i would like to bogart the flying carpet and everything in the fucking bag (imitating grog) am i texting you that right now all right let's go to the store i don't really want to drag this out any longer than we have to and i walk out the door and start going look at those fingers fly old one are you still willing to trade today i'm wondering if you have any poisons beyond the run-of-the-mill nightshades this afternoon or morning what do you want for it why not yoink as we're leaving i say that's a good look thank you we're right in the middle of the bazaar do we want to take a quick jog around i grab someone passing by and say you potions where here i did not know that thank you well shit i grab another weirdo passing by and say excuse me there's probably a temple around here can you point us in the right direction i'm getting itchy can we just go to the take please are we going to the temple or the take let's get on with it shall we jesus whoever that is oh he was sweet he had some good herb they already headed out excuse me fantastic not good at reading emotions i don't vax'ildan what's your thing what do you do i agree let's hurry it up merkin shall we i'm not from these parts it's my accent sorry skip to the punchline tiger man essentially storybooks in syngorn does this cat have a name and you have no further information are there any grumpkins you want us to find do you expect us to go out with no information at all to find a man with a tiger's head is this how things normally go around here he's not very good oh he's gone what's your name again i'm sorry kash brother kash are you new to the guild as well that's how we got here all right i'm sorry i'd like to make an insight check on the dwarf not to see if he is lying but he could be can i get a gut instinct into what his deal is three but i'm going to use my luck to try that again 18 plus two is 20 just reinforce the myth man is there a marshmallow center and that's not just a descriptor either in the walls of the city follow the axe why are you jonesing for a horse and where we're walking are there shops and stands as well or is it residential i'm pulling a mask off the wall this is a beautiful piece do you make them yourself they are quite beautiful we're travelers here i've never seen a neighborhood like this is there a festival going on here or is this pretty much the basic fare of the day here here particularly there seems to be electricity in the air almost it's very bustling this is the norm around here and i pull out ten gold and i spread them on her desk oh none i slide one coin away from the other nine and then dragging my finger across those say is there anything out of the ordinary these days 15 watching her i pull out another five and spread them in front of the first nine the bastions what are they mauled and can you point us in the right direction these guys are right here essentially i notice a serpent-shaped mask on the wall i just pick it up and put it on and say thank you madam much obliged and walk off and clap thorbir on the shoulder and keep walking well we're in a rush but if it's easy how do you come by potions in this town my hood goes up and i'm gone i'm circling around 31 everybody talks about spontaneous combustion but i'd never believed it naughty and while he has their attention i'm going to check out his pockets ew that's not good i'm going to use luck that's better that's all right perception you said 28 because i'm wearing a cloak of elvenkind which i know affects stealth checks but not-- that's all right 20 and lord tyrell factored in how we've pumped these guys for all they've got tyrell was passing through i wonder how many people would notice him gone here in vasselheim this killer could be hiding in plain sight at the cabaret could be an employee there the thing is vanishing upon sight my question is we have three days cabaret's the only lead we have how do we draw this person he or she out we have three days to collar it i've spent time with wealth half-elves let's go i jingle what gold i have in a pouch in front of keyleth's face and say let's go shopping come on as the rakshasa bears down on your head they're legit stealth disadvantage on my next five attacks (laughter) that's really weird elivr is nice coralin i will be scanlan

within all parts of the walls we're looking to possibly become members here we hear the entertainment is top-notch and we hear that business happens within these walls but i'm not convinced i'm hoping to stay for an hour to see what you have to offer when i find i like a place i stay for a long time and leave a lot of money i'd just like a little taste using my last luck of the day that's better 15 we hail from emon we're not very flashy we certainly don't do much in public in emon i prefer to make my money and enjoy my money and i don't believe in ostentation don't get me wrong i enjoy the form of a beautiful woman as much as the next man who said i do my wife and i are businessmen and what we hear is that this is where business happens the shoes are the public face but the well runs deep i know my way around poison and i hear you have the rarest of breeds here i have come to spend some money to satisfy my clients 15 again 15 again i'm not looking to sell i'm looking to buy we're here to
