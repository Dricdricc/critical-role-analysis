why did we start with a closer though they're hidden from all the rest of our views right i'm going to start covering distance we're all watching i'm going to attempt to do that thing i've seen beauregard do so many times and foof up my biceps and look intimidating yeah although to play devil's advocate you are right he could change his mind down the line and try to get revenge on you or your mother i'm also curious to know what he is doing down here in the first place i would like to throw my hat in the ring to say that i think he might need to die here ja just put a pin in it and see what we find out here period tortles wear skorts well herr clay do you need healing yeah what about yourself i could use some i don't know if you are sharing on the count of three one two-- let's just sit here until it's crash pandas tomorrow spam it fjord ask him if knowledge of that water creature that was here and is gone now if that is known all the way to the top or is it his bag or-- ja and i send frumpkin who's holding his breath schlooping up on top of his chest he's hungry and so am i (laughter) ja and what happens to the commerce in the city now that you have fucked that up frumpkin starts to lovingly gnaw with his beak on the upper chin of algar i have a cloak no it's a beak i take a good long look at it great now i have to remember that as well it's in is it in and rifle through the papers on the desk do you still look like him i don't know did i find anything ja okay ooh ten are you right-handed or left-handed but two hours ago were you right-handed or left-handed it's very sad so sad that he had to sit down and write a letter about how he had to leave the city and how he had to free the creature beneath the city because it was so wrong-- he's leaving i was joking i said glintshore lay out on the glass i hear opash has a sweet airbnb on an island i'm sick of you people pushing me around-- it's maybe-- it's gilding the lily perhaps lots of middle fingers you'll never catch me alive your city is shit we can take care of the guards a water creature it's like a remote control car that spins yeah we're still in the office are we not while jester is writing i would like to flip this office for anything of value oh just the papers excellent draft number two if you were fleeing in terror would you stop to write a letter but he was the one that had all the sailor tricks to get the boat i agree with you jester i think we should stick with go fuck yourself maybe something like choke upon your woe or eat fecal matters take a hit of the dodec did you roll twice angry writer are we now bane that's unclear at this point isn't it do you have that letter by the way who has that the letter that mentions marius lepual caleb would've remembered that too i don't though i am very interested in that tower but i would love to ask some more questions around town before assailing it have i ever read about anything like this a building that seems to shift in size ten okay don't look at me oh it's fascinating we learned that whoever owns this place owns the district isn't that correct so someone in this district probably knows something about the person who owns the district yeah correct well there was no marking for a tower no idea just raw intelligence that is a 16 that diagram wasn't elaborate enough for me to know the answer to that i spiffed up my clothing again as well this one's name is bluute not bluute but bluude with a d okay oh so we're no longer with marion okay you know i had the same thought really either she believes jester and no big deal or she doesn't believe jester and knows that it's taken care of jester feels like that perhaps she is imposing bringing all of us here and we are trying to convince her that that is silly frau lavorre you have such a lovely daughter she's so charming and such a spitfire it has been such a pleasure to get to know her i've been curious for weeks now almost months-- i think it's been almost months-- what she was like as a child because she's such a joy now so she was always a prankster caleb summons frumpkin the octopus and i rub his head like a bond villain staring at beau perhaps nugget could live here and you could visit him when you come home third time's the charm we're fucking hermione granger up in this shit did orly say specific docks yes yes we've got lamplight on the streets to varying degree wise as fuck episode 30 something yeah while all that was happening i'm halfway through as a ritual spell casting find familiar so i can change frumpkin to something else i'll tell you in a minute sorry laura because caleb is on the ground going-- also has ten minutes gone by you didn't correct me but i said while nott was foofing around so some time passed five ten didn't but you're the dm i know that i am so close to the end of the spell and i am going to push through ja matt before you run off for the thing can you describe as caleb shakes his head out of what he was doing what do i see i haven't paid attention to any of that it's going to all be in front of me i love this game belly-flop shitty dolphin masterpiece theatre whoa holy fuck this is the best map you've ever made i assume find familiar has fizzled it's a good thing we rested up and waited until the following night though spraying_mantis would fit in at our table zw√∂lf 12 madness tell us about your patron fjord (laughter) come on fjordy (groans) yes he's puffy pants on brand i think i cast mage armor before going down to the sluice but how much later is it is it beyond eight hours well i'll cast shield so they miss yeah okay i start moving my hand in an arcane motion and i reach back at that building over to my side there and a crate full of food a wooden crate starts to jiggle and rockets through the air at the held fool in front of beauregard i'm casting catapult at third level he automatically fails his dex save because he is paralyzed 5d8 a couple things 30 points of damage that's a transmutation spell so i can shuttle a little bit of arcane energy into my transmuter's stone and i'm going to change its property from dark vision into advantage on concentration checks i'm going to back the fuck up towards that house as far as i can go yeah there's five people we can see one dude in the boat down below sentinel babes she's going to carve him like a thanksgiving turkey another layer of insanity come on monk come on m aw you didn't come on pretty harsh woman whatever mama wants mama gets just look through our 2000 rules here wait a second do you resurrect him (eeyore voice) i guess (as eeyore) it doesn't matter anyway yes it was that was a good move okay so factoring in a couple of things one is that i see my friend beauregard getting hammered on by them which i do not like also i heard some voice from the boat yell out burn it so out comes the bat guano and sulfur and slap and a beam rockets out 150-foot range to about here and erupts yeah vox machina is gone the point is to get it to a range where i know that it's not going to affect them on the dock it's going to hit the boat yeah absolutely what am i a surgeon i have a 3rd-level spell because i used arcane recovery back at the chateau i also took a poop while at the chateau but i thought i didn't-- 27 i will use my movement to step around the corner of the house and i will begin to count to 20 slowly in zemnian to calm my nerves i don't know if caleb is a firebug or if i am they're still standing the guy came out and said burn all the slaves get it girl oh those are two bad dice rolls fjord pulls out the big guns master plan here it is fuck yeah bone it she's back 24 no 23 we just flip this we're going to jack this fucking boat and get out of here ladies and gentlemen (laughter) life is disappointing eh way far away no you won't no you won't okay i see which way the wind is blowing i mutter a few arcane words and i cast the spell expeditious retreat which is a transmutation spell so i will also send a little bit of arcane energy to the transmutation stone to give myself extra speed as well i can use my action my movement and my bonus action to move full movement at 40 so vax is back i am now on the boat transmutation spell gets my movement up to 40 right (laughs roguishly) action movement plus now expeditious retreat is a bonus action 40 plus 40 plus 40 a red blur goes (zooming sound) and i am standing next to beauregard on the boat are we stealing the boat way to build that tension into the abyss oh man all in one movement that's-- vox machina is dead long live vox machina yeah oh man sure but this is our mo hey matt that white ring is just leftovers right my turn i give the glove of blasting a good tug and i send three arcs of fire up into the air and they spiral around each other and crash down onto the dock about five to ten feet behind that illusion and blast into the dock that's a 24 okay (gasps) second's a natural one other one is way high natural 17 low rolls 12 damage okay i will use my movement to (zip) inside the boat can i use a cantrip oh no i don't never mind never mind getting the hang of it good good good done fuck those idiots (as caduceus) that was interesting that was really great frumpkin is not there ja i rub a bit of honey across my lip and say mein freund i suggest you throw down your weapons and lie under that desk just for your safety and i cast suggestion i would like to use movement to zip up to the top and look around you mean climbing under the desk i use my movement to zip up and look around and my bonus action to zip back down into the boat possibly burning he's got the cardboard arrow spinning it is he kaiju-sized who could have predicted this [music] marius is just standing there held by a goblin going ah oh you want this seafaring knowledge what can you give me that's a bad idea did he just break it is that what caleb saw he's got to do it right i just want to clarify i thought that i had told him to throw down his weapons and hide under the desk for his safety that's not an ongoing thing but you don't go down and then immediately stand up and get out again do you oh he saved from the spell hiding under the table for six seconds is a shitty job at hiding but okay okay that's fine i have to totally rethink everything so give me ten seconds i will use my action to run forward and with the edges of my coat put out the burning papers do i see anything as i'm doing this yeah if i'm looking at it okay that's it i'm done i would say that probably what i would've done not knowing any of that is zip up to go up and then see if the door is shut and go-- and that's the end of my turn a mage yeah i was casting find familiar so brave there's torches for now 40 feet off the dock wow fjord look at that old fucker out there oh it's that kind of city you assume i'm down there i guess yeah i turn to the guy who-- he picked up his weapons by now yeah okay i reach out and use catapult and a drawer pulls out of the desk and slams into the back of his head dex save for that okay it's a failure so that is 3d8 17 points of bludgeoning damage (arrow noise) i am standing next to fjord and beau feels good man he's the only one having a worse day than us (old man voice) hey a miracle heroes oh my goodness okay i will go down after jester and stand behind her to see what the situation is with my movement oh goodness i don't want to set the-- i say hey why don't you put down that weapon and let's talk about this and i cast friends which would be a disadvantage i'm sure you have advantage on all charisma checks yeah so it's very dangerous you're going to die probably sooner rather than later unless you want to talk shop persuasion with disadvantage straight seven shit that's persuasion ten i don't want to burn with the boat this is fucking fun stress of the moment that's all we know is his name what were you doing on the docks this evening i would like to point out that you're trapped on this boat with us tomorrow my blue friend is going to if we need to cast a spell on you and make you tell us everything we want to know why waste that time 21 her reputation keeps her from coming in what is her reputation that is a good question what can you cook that's interesting no maybe you'll earn your way to that we'll see we did not know about avantika or her ship we didn't know anything about her caleb's heading down to start searching we're like a quarter of a mile out to sea yeah it was so much fun nicodranas
