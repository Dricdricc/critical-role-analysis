that's accurate we're about to can we all cry if we can get the whole game tonight (voice cracking) emotional cry and new items new items on sale right now look at this also hi dread singles feel better look at that look at it on paper look at the color we can hold it and taste it and smell it he would totally do that frumpkin walks to the edge of the table and shows his butthole by lifting his tail up i just can't believe he got here oh well we have an hour edubation you want to have a big bowl also i'm wondering if she seems straightforward is the nervousness an act yeah okay it's a 15 okay could go either way on that also why do these people want the bowl that you're talking about this is a very tactless question but you are talking about the scaled tyrant and you also are sporting some scales is that a coincidence or are they related we're pretty cool he's work for hire frumpkin travels over to kiri and starts going (purring) as he nestles against kiri the cat is with me i take a step and a half away from cali caleb yeah this is probably stating the obvious but if you have not picked up on it yourself we are kind of a pack of assholes yeah we are because when we write the name down it's actually the zemnian word for no so even if there's nine people then-- under the lake you always want to stick together you never want to split the party this group is very inclined-- we're very skilled in arcane things what is your specialty gods and stuff ja okay yes cool what can you do with it ja effective do you have maybe one b-side besides the fire okay there's so much quicksand in this swamp i'm feeling trapped i feel like we have a little bit of overlap you know i'm able to-- nein step off tiamat if need be but you know wait for the need to be i like where we are positioned what do you think it was a joke i said hi beaus i know but i said hi beaus the gators come from the left survival this is generally how it goes not a problem bren would you help our friend out baby's in the way get used to it fire bolt 17 for fire bolt okay that is not that much actually that is a 12 yes if you give me six second increments i'm just going to go (releasing spells) which bolt do you cast good rolls well that's one in an entire swamp of vegetation so we should be good now that is correct north is that way frumpkin i'm going to sit on a relatively dry spot if i can find one i'm going to go blind and deaf and send frumpkin in the direction with jester's help towards the sound that she heard i will give the group a basic narration as i see these things my basic perception check is not too bad it is a 16 what was that word how much of it are frumpkin and i looking at it's one little ditty or are we talking true detective here i don't hear shit it's hanging from a tree i am going to send frumpkin up the tree i am going to send frumpkin toward the branch like sealed or nailed in so it's hanging down okay what i would like to attempt to do is send frumpkin up to and stick his head inside and as soon as i get a little peeky-poo snap my fingers and bamf him out into the fey a big 13 remember when i used to get a 45 oh yeah like i was saying to you there is a tree out there and there is something sleeping in it no but there are a lot of bones there they looked like-- they are not chicken bones well they were probably smaller than that yeah there was something in the corner something that was not bones but it wasn't moving it definitely wasn't the thing we're looking for i did not see a bowl i made a perception check yes not bowls just bones save it for a rainy day this one's a gimme a bonus only if we feel up to it north is-- north is-- no it is that way you're pointing over there i'm pointing over here north is that way a compass well a couple things one this is a compass that's not an issue but if you want to know if something's happening here with salty pete we can also do that if you give me ten minutes but it doesn't seem like that's what you're-- i do not know where the safe house is but anywhere we have been we can get to again febron you've been through this swamp once or many times it's a bit late in the game but are you being completely forthright with us is he that is a natural one can i make a suggestion febron and i cast suggestion on febron i feel you should be completely honest with us from this point on because you know honesty it's the easiest thing to remember it's that way if we don't move that's also a little weird i walk in the opposite direction let's go i say as i walk backwards that mini oh the tail's there just pull it over here for a second (as gollum) what is it so you're saying there's a chance (inaudible chanting) that's the first time you're introducing the word cult into conversation cult adjacent so they did this to you how far back is he so if we feel like we want to get into a scrap i or probably our new friend here could kick it off from a ways away the troll also you are very charming but every book that i have ever read about trolls-- they do not make friends they are bitter nasty things it's watching us right now isn't it debatable whether it can understand us but perhaps it can i would in fact like to try to walk behind a tree so i'm obscured i don't know if it can see me or not but i would like to hold magic missile in case it attacks my friends (singing peter's theme from peter and the wolf) do you see it show me good settle in magic missile i'm going to cast at 2nd-level towards the back of the group never near the front magic missile level two four darts total of 16 force damage don't fuck me matt mercer did you speak up yet of course you didn't are we in difficult terrain here although you've got your shoes on yeah i will use my movement first i want to get as close as i can which is 15 feet-- or no you said the closer we get yeah you know i went through a whole range of emotions because first i was going to try to hold it but then the guy was dead so i was like fuck it i'll switch to a fire bolt but then he grabbed beau so i am going to use the glove of blasting and cast scorching ray on it because i can't reach for anything better yeah i don't have that i'm going to cast magic missile on its head yeah no i'm going to cast-- fucksticks i'm going to cast haste on nott that's what i do yeah your ac is up an extra action it's all happening like this wow lie down play dead i mean she's half melted but we got to cut that dead weight man nott is double speed and has a ring on for water walking marry poppins oh cocked super cocked more yes it's in my range i will walk 15 feet forward and cast fire bolt from here it's a 120-foot range oh that's not the d20 hold on that's a natural one matt we're still in the middle of nowhere at this point or we're-- we don't have our guide anymore ask this one which way to go as far as we know it's cursed hiccups i'll say while jester was doing all that caleb sat down and took out his spellbook and started ritual casting detect magic well maybe after i do that because i'm tapped that's very wildemount the_bowmeister scorching ray on beau i told you everything you have to die yeah well it's like blacklight so on everything on what they were looking at is nott glowing in any kind of way that i am not used to 30 feet i believe you my good friend would you walk with me in the direction that the dead person said that this entrance is in before my magic runs out you're right person that i work with would you walk over before my spell runs out so that i can use it to help the group caleb knows exactly what time it is liam likes to burn his friends towards the 100-foot mark that the-- so it glows would i know about this 13 obviously not part of the okayed deities of the empire she's talking about herself it seems like a very large task for one person the tree is not giving off anything no no i do not know how to do it nott i have limitations i can do many things like you-- is the water up to our waist now she's as small as a tree knot you know so-- cute you don't know any of the fact that i almost killed you marisha ray yeah what i was trying to do for us maybe there's two branches this is all meta conversation you guys have no idea that liam almost used the wrong spell caleb was on point are there any immediate threats in there fjord outside --and puts light up in the tree out there with her i'm outside with her and i'm casting dancing lights into the trees so that she can see better please we have been around death plenty of times caleb throws up quietly into the water yeah i can do that yeah i am i have just joined the group how are you doing down there what do you see with you and me it goes back and forth all right we can do that just stay put don't go rushing in without us is it one or more than one that's the opposite of what i said it's hard to resist sneaking in it has been a while what would you like us to do already yeah we've established that stay put don't move i drop frumpkin down the shoot no he's not yes they can my acrobatics or the cat's oh great hold on i've got that pulled up right here hold on 16 i don't know oh wait kiri is down here with us in the corner well i think that's a great idea but we should also send bren with you and if you guys could go simultaneous like maybe if bren hit one of them and then you follow right away sometimes i'm able to focus just shy of what i'm trying to target i still think that these two would be good to lead that charge are they still talking does anyone want to try to talk to these things or are we just (cutting) i like how that sounds (like cali) murderous fish men i love it we're glossing over it but we've seen you vomit sea water twice drei zehn yasha and then nott and caleb are equal caleb and nott got ten ten for six seconds big three scheisse how high's the ceiling here that's how it works you want me to go yeah sure i'm going to move forward until i can see-- no frumpkin's going to go first i'm going to pull a shakäste and use frumpkin to help me see in here i have to ask you as a dm can my cat see in the dark i don't know it doesn't say i don't remember but i know that my cats could see in the dark growing up i'm going to stumble forward in the dark i'm going to say beau i cast enlarge on beauregard so that she's ten and a half feet tall if that's the case then i wouldn't go that far forward i would stay as far away from danger as i can that as soon as i see beauregard cast enlarge there's amazon women singing right now you got to pull a vega position 20 feet behind you hear this is all i wanted that's an action caleb is going to walk behind cali so he's got a good view of merman over fjord i'm going to use the glove of blasting first one is a natural one so that does not hit the second one is a natural 20 against the one right over fjord so that is scheisse 12 total since it was a crit is it still up and the third ray is not good just a ten careful of your head 19 add that d4 motherfucker cocked haha good show (twangy singing) i got friends in eldritch places roughly a minute later i say so you have been somewhat charmed by a circus carnie it's going to be okay you seemed a little angry he didn't mean anything by it just trying to keep everything copacetic and in order i mean you have a lot of scales on your face but look at this one look at this one look at this one that one as well i'm going to investigate yeah i've got a high stat in it cocked well it was on a magnet so it was stuck to a magnet at advantage we'll call the first one which was a three on a magnet and the second roll was a 17 plus my eight is a 25 i can do this for the future so 25 distribute that equally however you would do that i put a bunch of jewelry into jester's hands i'd like to take these for a moment or maybe ten moments i would propose-- i just rolled a 17 on perception to see if caleb noticed nott even do that well but you rolled a 28 so it would be super hard for anyone at the table to have seen it is this the end of our task here i'm taking those two purple vials and walking around the corner over this way to set them down and start doing my thing and i'm going to start pulling out my book i instantly cast identify-- it takes one minute-- on the two vials and the bowl i'm over here we might be the third from the worst people but it needs a lot of blood what about the vials that sucks nothing to be told okay i don't want this no i don't know it is not of any use to us i don't think i stick it into my satchel for the time being what if it's beyond even what fjord has just seen we do not know what we are talking about yet you know we could rest up here on the back corner of this chamber i could cast my silver thread across this pool here on the other side if anything comes through it wakes us up we'll be ready we get ready for going further and-- what if you spend one more night with us here tell us again what do you need it for what are your intentions with it honestly look me in the eye what do you mean to do with this thing when you find it how will you destroy it yasha will you come here please i need your help mollymauk will you come here please beauregard fjord will you come here please i start to move away from cali would you come back with me jester please once there is a defensive wall between me and cali i pull the bowl out of my bag no no kiri bren found the bowl cali i would like to help you but this thing is powerful and i met you ten hours ago yeah i do well i have a wonderful compromise you know we can all camp down here as i suggested you included in the morning my good friend jester can get to the bottom of your intentions for good for real what do i do dex as well oh it's gonna be so good that's a two so i think this story is over aw the second one was an 18 aw three why would you not want to wait 12 hours to see if this woman's intentions are true or not what difference does it make this bowl-- this bowl that i am talking about can be used to speak to one of the most evil entities in the history of creation so i think it warrants another 12 hours of waiting to get to the bottom of things i think it is going to be a little bit beyond your capabilities to destroy this bowl yasha that bowl is used for communicating with (nervous laugh) the mother of dragons beauregard you keep the bowl all night so that jester can use the spell she used in the past for truth and then we ask cali and i would love to hear that cali's intentions are true and good if they're not we'll find out friends one minute yeah okay i suggest you tell us the absolute truth of your intentions with this bowl i'm glad for you to take it i'm a little surprised at the rest of you for me being cautious but i'm glad for you to take it are we separate or are we not separate beauregard what if she had been lying to us i told you exactly what i wanted to do and why i don't know what you're talking about and i walk away from her without saying another word highly drama god i can't believe that's already been that long
