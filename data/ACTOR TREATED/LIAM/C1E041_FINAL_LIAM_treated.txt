those are two you cannot use sam's here-- can someone let sam in there are no jokes here is he cosplaying as matthew mercer what's going on yeah we'll do our weekly shout-out to wyrmwood gaming if you go over to wyrmwood gaming and put in the code critrole you'll get free shipping and also over at wyrmwood gaming they're doing a valentine's day lottery where you're getting a mystery box for a lower rate i dunno look at the rules i don't want to mess it up but your dork dollars will go farther if you go over there this week happy valentine's day so sad no i can smell it on you now no i think that they would leave the center of the city at least to the edges if not try to get out though that might be foolish we've never used it but they described it to us when they brought us here the first day we need to see if uriel is still alive he was alone before it all happened that's smart lady allura what do you know of marquet you said that they successfully repulsed him oh well she has drake with her does thordak have any offspring and i do have this-- pulling the brooch off-- this would mask your true nature somewhat no he's the little guy next to jabba (cackling laughter) we need to find uriel we need to go in-- all these are the next step-- we need to see-- we have sacrificed a lot to save uriel before we're not just going to leave him in the city we need to find the tunnel under this keep go in there see who's left and get them out that's not a bad point it's possible they might not have been working in conjunction with each other they could have been on their own all of them or all together i don't know well if we go now we have the benefit of darkness in the city i'm not saying that i'm weighing our options if we go now we can go under the cover of night but we're going to be exhausted well let's lie down and take a nap and last week you said that vex couldn't sense the other three might as well he could have gone to the harbor he could have fled through the tunnels we don't even know about i agree and if he did not make it we still go to his shop use whatever's left it's what gilmore would want (laughing) i should probably rest they're expecting-- thordak is expecting to sit on us like a bunch of eggs in a basket we're fine for the night we go tomorrow we don't even know where the tunnel is we need to find an entrance to said tunnel what are you waiting for (laughter) yeah look at that big pouty bottom lip go get that (laughter) i just saw 100 pictures drawn in a instant (laughter) okay at the bottom of the ladder because she's right behind me you know you never cease to impress me 25 smells like jerky (laughter) okay i will crack it an inch and look through is there enough room to get my hand through to the other side i'm double-jointed matt

brand it's a pretty big organization maybe maybe we need to get to gilmore's glorious goods do you know where that is underground building to building is that a dice game i think it is probably equal to this we've been burned before grog this was going to happen whether we wanted it to or not big if big man i stop stealthing and walk right into it and start shouting (shouting) get the fuck out of here get out move on now now now i'll fucking gut you like a fish-- --and take your innards-- -- out your mouth i will not fireball straight into the sky 12 i'll try it will sink in in a few episodes it's fine there's so many rules guys slap-a the mace i'm going to use uncanny dodge-- no it doesn't hit because i've got both daggers out i have three armor classes depending on if my boots are on or my daggers are in my hands okay so i'm going to take the dagger of life-stealing and i'm going to stab the person closer to you yeah so that's a 23 so we'll do that first that is 11 no that's ten ten and then i'm going to use disengage as my bonus action and i'm going to pivot roll around grog along the south side of him and spin around and stick the keen dagger into the neck of the guy behind him i'm going to use luck that's better and that is 24 that's sneak attack 11 plus this no so two attacks oh then i'm out all right i'm out yeah i'll use disengage and i'm going to back up against grog back-to-back with the big man uh not really only if it's a one thank you pike you're playing jazz man he's gone it was my turn in initiative so i want to walk over to him you're coming with me i lift him up and i'm leading him off around the corner of a building nothing pick up some shit from the ground and prop it up against him a couple of pieces not bury him just hide him a bit and then i walk back to the group and i start picking shit up around where my sister is looters i hear her yelling and wander up as well you've got a happy dwarf standing-- oh advantage all right well that's better
