what can you hear me i'm in the bag of holding i can see you guys on twitch did you know you're on the internet oh my gosh laura hold up my boxes do you have items that need to be put inside boxes when you're not holding dice because wyrmwood gaming makes boxes for your dice and if you use the code critrole-- you can get free shipping don't infect my dice oh wait i got one last thing it's not really a professional announcement but i am sitting in the kitchen that i grew up in i'm playing dungeons & dragons in the first room that i ever played dungeons & dragons in am i up to what what was that grog as long as you're not going to whip out the cube then lead the way i pull scanlan over to the side have you always been able to do this have you been holding out on us man is there anything else you can do that you haven't-- can you make an army of unicorns or a giant in a dancing dress or is this the extent of what you can do i'm sorry where did that cow come from i call one of the servants over to me can you get anything could you get me a small squid is that a real cow scanlan or was that some sort of ghost cow can scanlan cast sad trombone i can't judge i've done my share in the past i thought you were a little overly nice to him i don't think any of us can judge you vex'ahlia but it does strike me as a little bit odd if nothing else what happens when you shoot a couple arrows from up there do it again and i throw the chicken closest to me into the air are you going to carry that on your back you'll look like a byroden chimney sweep time for a family reunion grog i said it's time for a family reunion grog are you ready for that or do you want to put that off a bit yeah it was on the way to kraghammer that's right grog just out of curiosity we weren't going to walk in and negotiate with your uncle he's not going to give us these knuckles he's a proud owner of them yes and how many are in the herd roughly i hold up scanlan's hands and then i hold up my hands behind them so that all 20 fingers are waggling grog are there more than this many in your herd we're doing rakshasa hands grog is there more of them than rakshasa hands i don't think it's going to be pretty no matter what we do but i actually think trying to steal them might be a better angle than going toe-to-toe with six goliaths i just did air quotes we just have to pick the least terrible option right now allegedly all the time all the time all right everybody hop on vex's broom 22 as wind i'll pull in front of my sister and use windiness and wind hands and wind farts to put up a stop sign with my hands and point down if that's possible in this form i'm going to go down and i'm going to motion for her to follow 25 35 the guy you don't know his name what does he look like where have you seen him i'm talking through skype so it's a little more difficult for me the guy who's got your child you don't know his name what does he look like where have you seen him and best we can tell he's the only guard the only one and the goal is to question this guy or to take him out to question yeah i'm going to squat at the edge of the high crops and keep an eye on the other guard who was walking off just to make sure he's oblivious 28 his partner's still long-gone what if vex and i went as mist just the two of us quickly just the two of us 42 no flying buttresses that's when we fought the nightmare yeah i'm gesturing to go get out 44 sing to it well let's put on the table what we're doing here right kevdak has the knuckles we don't know where he is he's probably pretty formidable on his own and in a day or two a dragon is going to be swinging by so it's not one problem it's a very large problem and a massive problem grog i'm curious how tied you feel to the ways of your people now or if you do do you feel the need yourself to face him on your own or would you be amenable would you be friendly to the idea of my sister and i softening him up for a moment and then letting you have at it what do you want to do here i want to throw something in here as well and i don't know what to do in this situation i'm looking to you all for guidance but i do know two things one is that i don't want you to fall grog we need you and i do not want you to fall to kevdak and second if you do fall i'm not willing to walk away without those knuckles not for me to use but for us to use we need those knuckles so if you are to fall at his hand which i do not want i don't know that i can honorably walk away my first point grog i need you we all do sitting pretty grog showing restraint and caution yeah so do i if it takes 17 episodes we will skype is rough guys it makes me feel bad for pike i'm fine (fake crying)
