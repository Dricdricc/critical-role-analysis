sorry i've done a lot of stupid things in my life and i've never had any regrets really i do know the chance you took on me and i've confirmed your worst fears and then some regardless i am sorry and i regret that i'm not outright dead already and that you have to stare at this walking pantomime of a life in front of you but kiki i'm grateful for the time i have left to look on you and i am grateful to fight for your future and i'm grateful for that chance you took on me she offered me a way back and it was the only way back i wasn't coming back not after that not without her blessing i

you give me a hug yeah i don't have any clever closer i'm just going to crawl into bed and go to sleep oh man it's going to hurt not to have you with us though oh well said harvey fierstein (laughter) give us more hit points still shouted narration through it all (laughter) but do i get sneak attack damage or is it also a critical hit pelor can i have one slice of breakfast pizza please (laughter) two regular eyes what pass water under the bridge water under the kraken we're on brighter horizons (raspy voice) how many does she get i know weird right really weird i mean you still transported us a long way that's commendable so we're on cliffs facing the ocean right now i'm not familiar with that reference and there are people about druid's doing interpretive dance again you there little girl oh my bad fellow sorry as you can tell we're not from around here visiting yeah i had a couple of questions one there's a volcano just off this coast somewhere right do you know where it is could you point to it are there boats for rent for hire all right thank you i think that's all i needed from you okay oh shit we never have before why start now smooth operator (laughter) a large danny devito

front to back i'm sorry do you-- do you talk ever i don't wanna waste time on the gnome business let's just go on in the water going up our noses i will go ahead vax and i said sorry at the same time so i'm peeing right now is what i'm saying (garbled noises) 28 28 it sickens me (laughter) and we're just seeing little glows in the distance the anvil is probably too far away at this point yeah it's probably not right here at the top what about these colorful plant things floating past us are they going to sting us and paralyze us said the fantasy heroes pissy vax swims down towards the cone and i think the last time i talked about the deathwalker's ward i'd set it to fire so we'll say fire okay that's what i'm best at athletics natural 20 thanks matt colville i know it's probably fuck-all but i'm going to pull out the flametongue dagger and try to use it as a shitty-ass-- use my first luck of the day oh not good same thing just a six 20 total okay i'm ed harris sinking down and down and down 16 yeah i'm going to push it just a little bit more okay that's not good that's a seven and i'll go with it up back into warm piss water instead of boiling hot nope i mean you can't really understand me though can they right it's all shit it goes forever i think we need to look elsewhere i don't think all of us are going to make it down that fucking tunnel (sighs) that would help it was getting hot as hell down there i don't know i mean maybe a quick look around the perimeter of this thing we're not going to muscle our way down well i think we're either druiding our way in or looking for another way in somehow no what were you thinking were you thinking of umbrasyling this shit were you going to black dragon dig your way down i mean we got a little under 24 hours fuck it let's look anything that looks not-natural 18 how does heroes' feast factor into this heroes' feast doesn't that guard against poison flametongue dagger is out so i can see the non-water portion i'm going to go stealth that's fine 34 i think i'm pretty stealth all right yeah i just turn to the group and i'm going to-- so there's a walkway but there's also lava i've only gone about 20 feet at this point is that right i am going to go around the bend continuing quietly i'm going to double back to the group it goes a little further but i just didn't want to go too far on my own just goes further but i don't want to get separated completely so come up a bit and i'll go a little bit further i don't think so i could do it but you have to be familiar with it being told about it doesn't count does it i'd like to lead them to where that jump is shit get back in the water and i'm going to solo go where i wasn't intending to to see how far it is to get to the next bit of water you said it was a jump over magma i walk away from her and i go down the hall ooh better use one of my lucks for that that was a one ooh six six burn baby burn yeah total of six already used luck it's done and yet vax ain't sweating it not anymore so i see water and i shove my face down in it and breathe it who knows with me and i go back to where i burned my fucking foot and i go into the earring-- i'm not going to fucking jump over that shit again-- tell them what i saw yeah two minutes so deep fucking breath yeah and when you see me run towards me and follow me how long does a fish live in a fish tank the biggest i hear you can do this with a non-magical jug too we're going to try to water-bong every combat scenario for the rest of the campaign oh shit everybody hold still for a moment 40 the fuck was that it talks it's a sentient bulette we could attack them see that's what it was that's what it was don't worry about it every time every time i do it yes fuckers i was near the lead 17 17 there's the mama and two babies i can touch my miniature whoa click the boots hunter's mark on mama so all that's left is dagger dagger dagger so i'm going to do sharpshooter throws with the three daggers that are left am i within 60 feet i think i am all right so negative five on attacks the first one is total shit the second one is 17 23 on the last okay because grog is right there it is sneak attack (sighs) one this is nine plus that is ten plus this 13 18 24 30 33 35 36 37 and because it was a sharpshooter attack it's 47 and then for movement watch this shit right here folks (counting) 40 because i'm hasted 45 50 55 i did it my fucking self oh and hunter's mark six dr manhattan in the house he's dead i'll do dexterity at advantage because of the boots so that is a 27 what was the total on that matt you got a bunch too he's hitting it with his dick but we're along the path to the water that i saw we're under two minutes away from the water i previously made it up to and didn't go into correct we're 30 seconds away from the water i've already gone this way and come back to you guys unless something has jumped in the hole while i was gone in that time i've already covered this ground of your hands while he's talking i turn to my sister and go-- and they shall know him by his cube this is because of the planetar not ioun planetar this is how you must stay always you don't remember it but you remember it it was a flight down yeah you're motorboating a gravy bowl i'm going to save those i'll get on the broom you're offering me a ride on the broom we've got a god-made doorway in front of us something-made door right natural rock around it or is everything carved how long a drop was it 22 18 for me grog what do your elven eyes see i'm stealthing i'm stealthing down the steps yep using a luck but yeah three of my four according to your campaign guide well that was my third not my fourth i did buy the book i bought the book in the first hour to two inches yeah i'm 60 feet ahead with my 47 stealth right now god-sized you don't know travis willingham's fatal flaw all right i'm going to use your pelor die hey that's good perception you say 27 is it exactly rhythmic precisely i think there's some sort of god-sized machinery ahead of us i think we're getting close do you know binary one zero zero one zero one one zero one zero one are they standing free or are they carved from the wall i'm actually going to hang back i'm also going to dump 20 hit points of lay on hands on my own damn self did you say there were two metal warriors and are they separated from where we are by hot coals or can you walk right up to them okay so i'm going to check one of those out see if it's any different than what we passed in that hallway 24 i'm shooting my wings out as i walk up to them as well it goes inward like the big one
