think of the gigs of erotica that could just exist out there is there any other shitty bragging anyone else would like to do what it what came out it was a bear i go over to trinket and i surreptitiously start feeding him biscuits-- you don't know-- biscuits that i took from my father's house good boy that's a good boy good job i will always give you that shit don't forget we're not here to go spelunking why are we going to go in this cave plus do you know there's a theater here i understand but just so we don't accidentally go there where is it in relation to this tree is it on the way i don't trust anyone who doesn't like the theater what exactly is your issue with it i don't think that we should do anything it does seem like a bit of a double standard that everybody threw poo at keyleth for picking a flower are you dead yet i don't want to take that bet no i don't want to take that bet because i agree with you 100 seconds have gone by you're going to roll a 20 and decapitate him this guy wants to go to the theater oh man that sounds scary hey how about that chroma conclave eh we should move toward our destination no more stops unless it's for the theater we're not stopping again i was wondering the same thing she's duchess of the grape hunt so she's very good to lead he's a bit of a sneak too the only reason we have him is because you spotted him because you're awesome we're so much cooler now he eats her hand are they way ahead of us or are they just up ahead is he taking us to the theater right now we don't need to stick a stick into every beehive we come across is it the theater you said we have to get across regardless garmelie i don't think it's a good idea but if we're going to check it out you and i should go ahead yeah let's go all right 39 our mother read us stories about shit like this yes she did fairies grumpkins i don't know it's probably going to end badly do you want to go have a look why start now you want to break our stealth if i do not see a mummer's show from this there will be hell to pay now let's go i will go closer 39 stealth yeah is it because i have advantage if it's a charm effect and i'll use one luck for the day first luck all right 17 i'm on man i'm lit fucking werewolf guy look good oh dear okay because i have advantage against charm oh then i rolled shit it's just a five first conscious person to go in here grog was unconscious she just dumped me out it's not my call i'm in the necklace krumping right now the woods are full of irishmen that was 35 episodes ago did we see a play yet half-elves have advantage on charm is the footing here precarious i know she's leading us through but is it all viney and shitty i give scanlan a little boot in the butt forward a couple of steps works for us i don't really want to fight a group of werebeasts but we have much better chances if we're going to pick a side against them with their brute strength than against fucking pixies i am charmed at the drop of a hat well they are cursed they seem very unhappy they have to sit in rolling chairs at all times there are scary fairy stories though growing up we really bollocksed up the musical instruments scenario and i don't feel like the pixies are going to be much better than that yeah we ran in for 30 seconds shit the bed and then got the hell out we didn't try to end them we didn't finish anything can't we just thread the needle and play them both you also wanted to hear the music that didn't go well we've got a bow to get you we are idiots and vex is the only one that can see it i'm going to go stealth just because 25 all right that is kind of fucked up what was the goal here to grab part of the circle desecrate it is it an open area over the village it all depends on the definition of desecrate i could fly you 500 feet in the air and you could shit upon that circle it just depends if that is desecration in the eyes of the fey the fairies or the fairy circle wouldn't it just destroy the circle how long does that last just to give us a day's head start we think towards the bog the horror the horror i grab keyleth by the wrist and start running away from the village go run faun run natural one i'm shouting the way is clear well i rolled a one but then i used luck and i rolled a 20 he's basically good against anything except one of the ancient dragons you want to go to the theater what's your problem with the arts man did it feel like a theater the wall of a theater what is this thing garmelie never ever see what we did to those pixies wrecked you took off before we shook hands or anything would've been a good incentive for us to destroy the pixies we can't proceed without destroying the pixies got to love it when the crew laughs at your final death crack the pixies are bitter little assholes do we want to waste any time trying to take your broom up and see how high this barrier goes no when we ran into it it felt like a brick wall they're certainly no meaner than grog is they're just scarier i agree with percival i think all our options are shit we pick the least shitty and see what happens shuffle shuffle flip page flip page flip page just start pissing ow why did you do that what do you mean i take off flying can i spider-man from tree to tree like the werewolves did using the wings a little bit 28 i'm still fucking asleep is the problem are you shorter that's impossible i know all this she told me two hours ago do we have any concept of what time it is in this perpetual night yeah stay up with me stay up with me don't offer that 27 do you see that no well sort of let's watch them i don't think we should go out i think we should let the group rest no your friends we'll let them sleep unless those things come closer are they coming closer or are they keeping their distance don't move i go stealth do i have that camouflage 25 come on grog come on i'm staying still we have to talk about your diet your diet do you eat any greens at all i crawl over to my sister and shake her and say wake up don't fly away like i did oh wait your broom's over there all right they are watching us they came in close and then they left so i don't think we're safe anymore maybe yeah that's it you put him back to sleep you go back to bed then you're letting whitey go back to sleep then yeah i think it's apt fuck it i go back to bed i spoon keyleth and fall asleep yes pull out all of your cursed items hair is shiny eyes are bright what are we talking about is that temporary is that going to last we misspoke to destroy this circle honestly we're scared of both you and the lycan and we just want to pass through we want no harm for you and unfortunately them either we just want to walk on out of here their leader is massive we were scared this one wet his leg and he's gigantic we just didn't know what to do we've got a tea set oh that angle is not going to be kind to those trees the werewolves were honorable these guys are assholes 13 what about just a comb shit (gollum voice) nasty aw that's sad passive-aggressive dungeon master oh that's so sad oh damn it bobby that's scanlan's bag man i've got advantage good i got a 19 being a half-elf oh it's not charm is it then the first one was shitty ten or 11 somewhere around there can i use luck to take my second roll i have luck left i have two luck left after sleeping okay so the second was a 17 plus two would've been a 19 no i really would like to be a kitty cat i asked if i could use one of my lucks instead in my heart i am a kitty cat there's worse things than being a kitten right we should have all been pixies from the beginning click go the boots i'm going to run 12 squares and squat down just north of grog i'm not going to shit on you i think i can make it all the way around to the other side of grog and i'm going to dagger dagger dagger at queen of the pixies there okay first is shit second is a natural 20 third is an 18 all right yeah but it's not anything fancy that's the weakness of the rogue where's my pyramid there it is so the first one which was the critical is big 11 for the first one on a critical and the second one i'll put poison on it as well seven for the damage and it's a dc of 15 for poison that's 2d10 14 with poison the grace and poise of the ashari umbrasyl in the can fairies dead as shit so add six to what you were saying originally you said 20 so it'd be 26 if you're doubling that die they could possibly turn on us though y'all ready for this which one i was next to go but that's still good it actually rolled when you moved the paper straight up 15 fuck it i'll use luck i've got one more another 15 i was about to but not anymore am i restrained or am i slowed so i can still do stuff what do freezing up and haste do mixed together anything cancel out do i have a third attack very confusing feywild man i am going to dagger dagger dagger the pixie in front of scanlan so i should get sneak attack i don't have advantage so i don't get sneak attack that's three attacks first one is shit 19 all right second one is 19 the last one is a 15 yeah whatever 11 and eight 19 total no and i say (strained) no i used it all up i didn't cross it off two eye squint says no big swollen hand fucking fat veins on the back of the hand i do i literally do twinkies i don't think that's the term you're reaching for scanlan i'm going to follow close behind grog yeah but if they had any good in their heart why would they be trapping travelers of any kind
