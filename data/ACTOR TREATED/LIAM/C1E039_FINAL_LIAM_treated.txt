'critrole' the code is 'critrole' yes i will i am very excited that's emblazoned on the inside of my mind wow wow oh nothing wow it's beautiful thank you that's included that's a good pitch hi sam all this time you've been trying to kick my teeth in and your real enemy is right over here and it was pale and icy too i think you were describing 15 did you get that in yug'voril yug'voril is it from yug'voril in yug'voril at the bottom of that pit when he headbutted the giant yeah ding click the boots of haste and i want to go stealth and scoot to that column past grog but closer to the worm not that one the next one yeah i think i can make it there do i need to roll stealth i want to throw a dagger at it yeah that is 28 i'll defer but let me ask going stealth and rolling a 28 on stealth the footsteps were still enough to alert it to where i was i didn't attack yet no it was a combined 28 just to go stealth and i should have one attack i should have an attack right because i did the boots i ran over here-- two two yeah two because it was double the speed because of the boots all right first one is shit that is 14 and the second one is-- i'm going to do luck on that the second one is 20 that's not a lot but it is seven points of damage first blood first blood everyone 20 can i use evasion or no oh with the boots on 18 yeah i know so tell me what happens oh well uncanny dodge right evasion is for spell effects-- that's okay all right so okay natural 20 plus or minus this is all happening in less than six seconds i want to do an evasion that's an area effect yeah all right (laughs) do i do the dex save first or-- oh it's not an area effect all right whatever you say natural 20 evasion on dex save-- i've written an abbreviated version of this it's area of effect if it's like fireball or anything that's in an area oh but you're god what do you want me to do wait 40 or 20 can i do uncanny-- this is a new round can i do uncanny or not yet shake that hangover off kiki she just learned it yesterday and i'm made of wind i can begin to revert so it's a minute-long process that i have to consciously decide and i know this i'm going to use disengage and i'm going to fart over towards my sister and pike oh then i'm going to dash towards my sister and pike oh scanlan and vex sorry i want to land and then start thinking god i wish i was not made of farts and start trying to undo whatever this is dispel magic little man i'm crouching fog of war man everyone who's a cloud we're floating back to emon let's go let's solve the problem so to get out of this form we have to stop and like meditate in one position for a full minute what does it dissipate without doing that how long does it take eight hours good here comes the one we still take damage in this form right she could be our saving grace let the man-- keep your head in the game get it get it girl get it and i can't remember evasion has nothing to do with this okay i'm going to use luck my last luck that's not good so constitution save seven why don't we let him say what he was going to say okay i look around really fast run up to my sister give her a giant hug and (magic sound) dimension door over to where grog is oh it's so far it's like 500 feet i believe i'll find it i'm hasted do i have one or two attacks at this point one attack okay action okay well then i'm going to throw a dagger at the back of the frost one it's 60 feet sharpshooter no disadvantage i had armor and i gave it to someone i don't have it anymore all right i want to see if i can use the haste to do double distance to get behind pike in that little alcove if i can't go that far i'll use dash to get behind her without the dash i'm standing right behind her and i say pike i'm a little banged up dagger dagger dagger 17 for the first 21 for the second 18 for the third all right so first one is four this is doubled so that's 15 plus 16 21 25 28 36 for the first second one is nine and the third one is ten done question pike probably doesn't but do i have any advantage being that i'm in this little closed-in bubble of course that hits still hits uncanny dodge please to halve the damage unconscious 21 halved oh yeah okay no i'm still on my feet (dazed mumbling) hold on 16 still conscious (muffled) i'm still in here (muffled) i'm in acid in here hits i mean i'm unconscious unconscious-- i'm unconscious huh oh yeah and i clap my hand here and i leave a big gory slimy smear right on the half of her face thank you pike shh i speak quietly into the earring and say could everybody shut the fuck up please and can we get out of here quietly yeah let's call another two worms let's do that they fucking hated each other they hated each other i'm meeting trinket and i'm going to lay-slash-nap on his back 20 anything left or is it just where i we-- there were traps left still still the same all right we've probably earned a bit of trust at this point that thing is trouble though that thing is trouble i start running after him and i'm hasted i'm running out stealthing after him says who who's in there i want to walk right up to grog right up to his nipples because that's as high as i go that's two episodes from today will you come down here please big man couple of things first and this is a smaller detail i shaved half your beard correct it's correct you've cut me open at least twice right now pike come here i would say that makes you and i even you've been acting all kinds of fucked-up for a while now and i know you don't want to disappoint her your best friend something's going on with you and it's time to talk about it you're talking to yourself you're talking to your own asshole you're talking to that fucking sword you're talking to trinkets we're picking up in houses what is going on and she's listening and she knows when you're lying and she knows when you're telling the truth i walk away i walk off i leave the fucking house gone stealthed laters do you need a scroll surprise matt's got to be using botox because he didn't move (laughter) no i'm not nope (laughs) well-remembered there was another 20 or 30g there probably marisha has a high clout score cold as ice i'd also like to point out that grog's single nut-flick did more damage than your two full-on punches (laughter) probably should check the silverware though in the keep and where would it have been hidden on their person it's just radioactive material in the basement it's fine i mean i'm assuming-- i didn't go there to find anything but i went just to think and i didn't see anything by chance no all right well i guess i'll go back to the keep and i will sit up no one's there i'll sit up in my sister's room stealth please i'm not walking in the open 27 not now kiki and i just keep going look everything's fine all right everything's fine i just don't know what we're doing anymore i don't know what we're doing i don't know why we're doing it i don't know i've just been thinking about it i mean what is the point of our lives yeah it's fine let's go i don't know what i missed i can go wherever everybody wants to go no when it was just you and me i knew what we were doing we were just trying to survive (sighs) we're running into this shit on purpose now which is all right when there's reason i don't always know why we're doing the things we do it was fun breaking into that house i'm good at it i don't know why we did it i don't know why i'm working with a large fucking beast of a man who seems to despise me day after day the fuck he doesn't i don't know why we're doing it i don't know why we're with most of these people and i love these people but i don't know why we're doing it and i just want you to think about a little bit too and i walk out the door i'm going through my vast array of cloaks (laughter) fecal matters he's currently like this 15 again chickens come home to roost 14 that's enough for all of us i click my boots and i-- shit where is everybody i yank trinket by the fur on his butt and say come on trinket and then start running backwards and grabbing at my sister's cloak as i go towards keyleth matt probably too late but can i retcon-- say i'm holding my attack since i didn't do anything fine if not i just thought-- if it bears down on us i'm not going to leave the group i'm going to pace with them thought we were going to be starting a brand-new shadowrun campaign next week that was frightening man
