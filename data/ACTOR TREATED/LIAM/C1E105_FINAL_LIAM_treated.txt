here we go did they win the war hey we're so proud of you she does on the daily it's like a metaphysical screen door that keeps flies out can you also remind me where my vecdar made me feel vecna-- where on the prime material plane yeah we talked about it but i can't remember and that was yesterday oh she doesn't get to have it now that's how that works he's calm but indifferent like the dawnfather either here or soon we need to sit and work this out power the trammel does the little seed of light given to my sister look anything like the little seed that scanlan and vax saw from riding the shadow creature in the sky i can sense him he's still really shitty though you did have one year-ish where you were on the skids you did your prince and the pauper bit for a little bit runs out the door do you all ever broach the area or do you just stay clear of it once this is all done grog you and i will go on a long trek together can't predict this one i'll set the deathwalker's ward to acid yes yes i'm still naked i start putting on the rest of my armor of course you can well they're going to be yours anyway i am covered i mean i'm on bonus time but i'm not bobby drake right but look (slashing noise) i mean look oh i didn't know it did that (laughter) thank you i don't know this is the dumbest conversation this is bonus time i shouldn't be here it was the long sleep or come back and help well i'm just following through on a promise made there isn't really a handbook when vecna is destroyed she will call me back to where i would be right now i expect everyone-- keyleth and i have barely spoken-- i expect everyone to be sad but i wish you wouldn't be so sad not exorbitantly so because i-- i read not as much as some but i read this is the path that i have chosen for myself and i did it based out of desperation at first but everyone dies and i think our group has become a little spoiled we're not your ordinary group of idiots we have blessings blessed idiots yes and i know that we've gotten used to feeling like we can overcome losing anyone but your average farmer or seamstress doesn't come back and everybody dies and all that matters is what you do with what you have and i have done a lot and i've taken great pride watching all that you have done and i have good friends and i have fallen in love more than most i've had that i don't really know i imagine she'll keep me close yes she's necessary and she's of use and i like that i don't have a lot of time they really are my favorite thing physical thing dear every stitch on my body is yours when i am gone i slide my feet into the shoes and i wiggle my toes around oh i'm sorry i also have a confession to make i don't exactly have your shoes anymore i think that i left them in the feywild yeah i think i dropped them into a bog they didn't fit me i'm still me you have very cute small feet that fit in the boots that you gave me that did not fit my feet there's probably shoes here i pull out her shoes and i put them down must have been inside your shoes how many fingers am i holding up grog you are our extra muscle i'm not dead (mispronouncing) wil wheaton i want to start eyeballing the ground of the house for any kinds of traps set out is that investigation yeah 18 nothing perked up my spidey-sense i'm going to go as well and continue to eyeball for traps is it easy enough to walk around well i could attempt to dicker with it but we could just knock the door over it if we really are going on manners the door's going to blow up if we knock on it i mean we don't have much luck with doors do you want to do that yes i am let me take a look at it please i've already detected it i will attempt to disarm it with thieves' tools correct that's fine that is a 29 percy i'm sorry i know you like a good rube goldberg does the door look hinky at all i said hinky 18 yeah well i don't want to pick it so it's like an ostentatious gnome door little more than is needed hey chaotic evil necromancer gnome i stick my foot in i'm really very sorry to bother you although i'm delighted to make your acquaintance i'm having a very hard time not just smiling like an idiot could we trouble you just for a few moments we mean no harm at all we do need to talk to you we've come a very long way as farts that's got to count for something we've done a lot we've seen a lot we could tell you all about it (stammers) sorry that's infectious we have a really big guy are you all right with him coming in grog are you all right with coming in have you not crawled on all fours before the first thing that i do as we come in is i scan the room or rooms for more macaulay culkin shenanigans that is a 21 did you used to be obnoxious because i'm not picking that up were there no other gnome folk in your party while listening to all that vax slid his hand into keyleth's and quietly listened to the whole thing is there another name that you would like us to use like a nickname instead of ioun you know i was just saying what a good idea i thought it was but i thought you were talking about the entire deck grog i think the entire deck is a fairer thing than to have him pull a card because that seems unpredictable to me we're all in a small enclosed space together grog and i like this fellow sprigg you're seeking power we offer you redemption collaborating with us grants you the power to fell a would-be god i'm not an elf not an elf we have vaguely pointed ears not even fully pointed ears my mother was not an elf i thought we were talking about redemption i'm also gently steering trinket away from the floorboard in the middle of the room as he walked by sprigg would you like to be needed again maybe it's time to stop running sprigg the world is on the brink right now it's worse than hobgoblins we've come here in great need and the world is in great need and the power that i offer you is making a difference make you believe fuck this is the sound of bolts no there's crates of apples i would be right next to keyleth because i was holding her hand it's all right it's fine and matt could you touch on the map where the bad man touched you no where the bad floorboard is none of you know this there over by grog on your right rarely i have but i got my matt colville meteorite 20 quid pro quo okay let's talk this out click the boots of haste i think with 120 feet of movement i can blur up the stairs to where percy is in probably 50 or 60 feet and then finish that movement and go past the guy out the window with all of my movement in 120 feet or less okay so i'm doing that definitely understand blur up the stairs shoot past percy shoot past that guy out the window do i already see those guys 19 plus 14 is a hell of a lot i stealth hide bonus action to hide i'm going to use luck that's better 27 all right then from this spot if they're in range i'm going to throw whisper at one of them but i can see them and i can ignore three-quarters cover because of sharpshooter so the one that i can see hidden i will try to throw whisper i'm going to hopefully sneak attack him and bamf there that is a 28 right natural 20 okay (counting) so that one is 60 on that guy yes and i bamf there so i did movement i hid for my bonus i have action-action as a paladin and action attack-attack as a paladin and then my bonus action that was the first of attack-attack so now i'll just do a regular attack which is a 20-- 30 that is a ten and i'm going to pump him full of poison he has to make a dc check on 15 so he also gets that was ten plus 14 total 20 total between the dagger and the poison and there's another guy there who can see me right whisper that is 31 yeah okay so that is two plus eight is ten plus psychic damage 18 i'm going to bamf there with whisper but you guys don't know that yet natural 20 you fucking dick necro guy it's still a lot all righty hey matt i realized i never shot out the wings so i shouldn't have had as much movement as i did so i think we should take the damage back from my last attack i have evasion right at advantage because of the boots what do i have to match oh yeah way higher than that we're good yeah dexterity save man area effect i would like to retract my bitch please it's a quick jump though end it quick we can save it flames flames less of a thing flames on the side of the house (bane voice) your punishment will be more severe with the vecna eye i'm going to bolt to that window no other way so i have a view of keyleth the creature and grog i'm going to throw whisper-- i've got sharpshooter-- at that thing and bamf there fine whisper goes to the window at that guy there and it's flanking right because of where grog is or keyleth okay yeah that's fine that's 32 three plus psychic damage is four plus this junk (counting) 33 doubled to 66 plus psychic damage is 74 bamf there okay so here's what i wanted to do so movement-- and i have action-action action action-- action-action action bonus action travis laura and guys it's the rules in the book you can bust my balls all you want-- so action-action for my regular attack right it's just semantics attack-attack hasted action bonus action so that was the first of my attack-attacks and here's the second one 30 i'm dumping a level two smite into this against an undead that's seven 10 11 ooh it's cocked 17 for that hit with attack-attack into that one whatever i just said it was like 16 okay i'm going to do the old crouch not that she needs it but crouch in front of keyleth and then i have my hasted action for an attack and bonus action for an attack into the other one 29 and the second one is higher than 29 i'm going to dump smite into it three-- you're making me mess up the math laura (laughing) i can't keep track of the math 25 on that towards that guy with smite added and then the last dagger with smite at level one is two plus is 10 14 19 i dumped a ton of smite into that i don't know so why don't you just minus six 19 so we'll call it 13 some people might have been catcalling me while i was trying to do math let me enjoy my last two months of life threepio where could he be why not both yas pelor queen (laughter) also we can take it send all your complaints to mike mearls and chris perkins at wizards of the coast splitsing van damme-ing it let's do it she stole them again how did you do it if we're retconning that in i'm retconning (blows raspberry) when i see it to be fair we've only been here 12 minutes that's good advice inside matt's brain watched her the whole time and quietly walk up behind and give her a hug from behind and don't say anything keyleth and vax heard the (wedding march) so we had a very different silent scene over in our spot because we don't get that thank you vacation scanlan it's the debbie downer snl sketch leaning into each other imagination clarification because a silence effect went off there did vax and keyleth hear you're married or was that all covered by silence so we heard the song but that's it good to know noticing that we're totally alone silently tug keyleth down after them you're engaged you don't have to-- can everybody watching still at home give a round of applause for darin
