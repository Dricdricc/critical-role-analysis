i'll have to figure out how assassinate works we thought he was the diamond in the rough we thought he was the one the one that was different than them all was that in the little side cave where we saw that i do i do a little bit yeah the dm told me that keyleth seemed unsure and scared if i'm remembering right and feeling cut off from topside and it might've been the first time-- like the twins all throughout the home game and the beginning of the show i think our most common shared response to a lot of your decisions was like-- and it was the first moment where i stopped doing that i don't know something about being on the show and the way matt-- whatever he phrased into my ear made me look at your character in a new way it might've been that i don't know if it was that it was after that i stopped being so snarky 100% of the time which allowed me to have different i don't know-- there is a little bit of a historical record of it though because there is that video floating around of you breaking the news to us and your question after he finishes telling his story is do we have to change our name from the shits and you have travis from off going no deal no deal and you've got to imagine being linked into that elder brain system probably feels real good you think when you left you think (laughter) just a skosh next question well i don't really know the ball might have started rolling from that whisper i think that's probably likely but i don't know where it happened i do remember-- what's going on laura (exaggerated sneeze) (laughter) sure and again still had all that stuff brewing in my head for months after the kash kiss and didn't want to show my hand and we had to go deal with stonejaw-- gosh i mean two shopkeeps are beloved on this show gilmore and victor yeah a lot of little things came up just by chance or from art and then we wove them backwards in time into the story so much happens by accident and that's the magic of the game no no that lost relative went on to be the nothic that i shanked underground (laughter) next campaign will be better next campaign will be better optimized our combat decisions will be optimized you get to reroll things what was it burning a grit or something that's still rolls so luck is all-purpose but that was like a more-limited version of they walk alike they talk alike oh well great episodes but it wasn't the beginning it was a midpoint i don't think i realized in the game how furious travis was it was magical i figured it would just come back he'd already fucked with my shit plenty of times i thought it was just tit for tat i was wrong for making that happen i thought i was out just like i thought i was out in the raven queen's tomb there were things that i wanted-- the game because we were playing it so often it was already evolving heavily i hadn't worked up the gumption to say anything in the story to keyleth so i was like i'm getting it out here also at that point it was starting but vax's world was still 98% his sister i don't know it was just a chance to vomit out my inner monologue before exiting the game i thought there's also no mistaking taliesin/percy's utter shock and dismay at that happening it was not manufactured it was real that tesseract thing you can make another one of those right (laughter) not gonna lie i wouldn't mind playing in their campaign also can anybody correct me if i'm wrong i don't remember any whiff of any of that from the home game at all it just percolated under the surface until we started the show who are you who am i i'm real glad you didn't make a new character can you imagine percy 30 years in the future being an old happy fart and just going out to the window and seeing beautiful whitestone beautiful tree and just the invisible imagination of that she brought sarenrae's faith back to the continent didn't she i used the cloak of the mountebank yeah i thought i was hitting the door open button yeah that was a rug yank moment don't try to get with her the scanlan shorthalt story reveal it it went missing when i-- that physical belt buckle is sitting on my treasure shelf what would have happened if he had blinked what if he had tried to fight that deal such a strong decisive leader moment at the end of that though when you chose to get out with as many as you could and the way that you did it yeah also keyleth that's interesting i'm not sure i know the answer to that he definitely wouldn't have left without his sister i think the challenge and the fun of it would have been having to come up with a reason despite-- it was similar to your moment the way i thought of it was i'm really going to have to do some tap-dancing to figure out why i'm still here i think he would have been conflicted and dealing with it i guess eventually it would have reached a breaking point there was a lot of butting heads at that time in the lead-up too and i think part of it was off the stupid prank war i don't know and i often get questions like what would have happened if this hadn't happened i don't know that's the fun of this game may i ask a follow-up question for matt was it always your plan from when we were at home to get to that and playing every six weeks would we have gotten to that conclave attack this weekend i love freddie he is a darkly fascinating character i think grog would have turned him into a skid mark i also think it's important to say that the last time we had dealt with death was way back before it was a show we were in our home game and it was that and then vex dying in the tomb were our first real brushes with death in the game so we didn't know how likely it was we didn't know the rituals were this strange thing-- i thought it was just this one-time thing that happened for that moment i didn't realize it was going to be this mechanic that you implemented into the game so both finding gilmore and when vex went down at least for me i was like oh my god this is the end it's all over and when i went unconscious too and we got more used to it as a game mechanic i don't want to say we got used to it because every time was rough but it was very new and unsettling in the beginning was there a name for the old beau that she would have found on the letters can i ask a connected question to the armor to matt senokir's box that's later okay it's the other horn of orcus that's in there man i was strongly considering it i hadn't made up my mind but i was leaning that way because i was already forming this new branch of friendship with pike and being fascinated with the things that she did and i was feeling like such a-- the same vax who was saying what the fuck are we doing here this is stupid there is no purpose to our lives he saw that in pike first people were like i think liam's going to go cleric and i was like nah this is just part of the story but then i started believing it myself and then when everything eh and without dragging everything out of the store rough time in my life and when that happened i remember we had a meeting the group got together like a week later and i was not happy about how that went down i wasn't interested in the armor i didn't want the armor with everything going on for me i was like this is so heavy on top of my heavy and it turned into this i don't know i wouldn't trade it for anything at this point but boy it was a tunnel no none of us know what we're doing follow-up question fate-touched always going to be a thing or do you think that just sprang out of that moment this fucking game such a ride though that night on my sister's behalf i'm shocked that vex's alignment changed and percy's did not because this guy is a fucked up motherfucker who did fucked up shit left and right he gave a sword to this dude he shot a kid through the hand he's a lunatic dani carr just ascended straight to heaven off camera (laughter) no you took it initially a lot of disappointments in this game laura those were 21 headaches i saved you all follow-up question did tova live but it was in a bear context those three episodes was how long it took for us to chill the hell out neutral good folks neutral good follow up grog did or travis did how was the wedding where was it taliesin jaffe oof probably one of the biggest heartbreaks of the entire campaign massive if circumstances had been anything other than they were he would not have known what to do with himself there was just too much going on massive heartbreak he was reconnecting with his daughter no shoulder-mounted wait go through it again you lost me i super hardcore remember it hardcore remember it he would've done neither of those he just would have asked why it would have been different even though laura doesn't remember it if she had not so specifically said don't go off to zephrah and get married without me there i know but i do and factored it into all of my thinking what am i supposed to do loot drop smite doesn't count because it's not a spell bless lay on hands is not really a spell it's like a feature i have a name how dare you delilah seemed like the brain oh that's a huge question thank you for that consideration if he had a week to go on a tour and see people he would have tried to make an awkward peace with his father he would've said goodbye to korren at that point the band korn he listened to elvis costello thank you he would've said goodbye to his friend gilmore everything was so quick his little sister he barely had any moment with before he was gone i think that's it these are the most important maybe i'm forgetting somebody but these are the most important people in his life it's his family 100% his family not even like this is my family this my other this is his only family vax would never see that as a failure never see scanlan as a failure also to both of those questions if either of them had tried to get the wish spell off i don't even know how it would have played out it's complicated because in my mind as a player the only way i was going to live is if the raven queen said you pass the test go live be happy and have a handful of years that was the only way in my mind no i thought it was a 5% chance (singing) and a troll dick in some mage robes in the final moments i don't think there's an answer for after this is similar-- mystery is better but in the last moments no he was not bitter it was very heavy he felt very full as well and knew that his sister was taken care of (laughter) i don't know what to say saying goodbye cows gilmore stabbing me vax was pretty impressed i was pretty impressed in that last fight when we realized you'd been fighting with your hand tied behind your back the whole time saving that spell
