takes off hashtag blessed 31 if anybody survives goddamn it with my hasted action i will cast lay on hands on scanlan and bring him back up he's got the book right am i within 120 feet of vecna's face i'm going to latch onto vecna's face i'm going to fly straight at his face that's all my movement to get there on his face i'm flying right in his face i will use paladin action to dagger-dagger him in the face hasted action that's fine so i use my regular action to lay on hands and my hasted action to attack him once in the face maybe more we'll see i'm going to use my first luck of the night bad rolls 24 up top and i'm going to dump 2nd-level smite yeah he is motherfucker i need to write this down before i forget it so before the smite it's 44 and jesus i'm forgetting everything 2d8 plus additional for undead which is 12 so 56 and how much extra for the undead i can't remember 1d8 2d8 seven travis and bonus action i will whisper to him no fear and stick one last dagger in his face oh do i that's fine that hits that's 36 yes i do with whisper but it's not whisper wait so it is a crit it's nothing though the damage is nothing but he does have to roll a save he'll be fine or be afraid of me six big points six big points wait that's whisper plus-- 14 big points 22 points i'm sorry i'm sorry i usually throw daggers i usually don't get up on people yes buy me a beer uh-huh here it is okay i'm above 100 so i have no idea if that has anything to do with what's going on here i'm going to use luck it was a good roll but i'm going to use luck sam yeah no con save 24 i've got the necrotic armor on okay that's fair ah this guy (yelling) could you aim for his penis and you're on that side we love you ashley yeah question i'm probably out of range am i in or out of range by his face probably just out close to pike-- am i 60 feet does she get to choose vax is doing real well the temporary hit points don't come back right yeah vax is doing real well i'll take a skosh a peppering she can see how fucked up we are none of the temporary hit points but your regular max love your healers folks are you thinking of blessing grog and keyleth or something like that the face ashley just made did you just kill our guests you're a monster oh yeah okay sneak attack on my advantage because of vow of enmity i have been tweeted at by eight billion people saying that on attack of opportunity on a reaction i get sneak attack thanks eight billion people i rolled a 34 to hit so i'm going to start rolling damage and i'll dump smite into it as well i didn't do any damage yet (adding) good i'm calculating shit i'm scared to death well i just hit him for a total with smite for a total of 65 they're going to splat for holding zahra and kash and the monsters because i stabbed him in the face or in the ass as he ran dex save right dex save yeah you're blessed so add a d4 34 okay so with a split second and that erupted all around us i have a moment to appreciate all of this angelic fucking flexing and taking all of that damage i take out my superior healing potion kiss keyleth on the cheek and feed her the potion that's my action my regular action then i'm flying eye-level with vecna yeah am i within 60 feet there i'll get a little bit closer and then i will use my hasted action to chuck a dagger at his fucking face yeah natural 20 with whisper (counting) 64 plus the psychic 69 with whisper and i will bamf there i do but it's weak i'll use my last bonus action to stab again with whisper 28 to hit (counting) 20 129 oh no oh death saves handing out death saves they're getting ready to do the finishing move on him take him out and then stab him while he's down vox machina this is your life 26 you've said that like 17 times screams of thousands you're carrying the football man once a year i can do that it takes a year to rest how excited we were not in my experience but you still get to fuck him up natural 20 plus eight so 28 i used luck to get it 41 do you like it we've dropped a lot of damage as well wait what's the total for me nine ten and 11 all to me okay every time we hit him i'm at 78 yeah 26 don't worry about it question for the i pull out the trammel do you have a free hand or a belt yeah you've got a belt so no free hand can i use the hasted action to shove my trammel into his belt or anywhere the raven queen's trammel i did a perception check and got a 28 yeah and then i'm going to-- (sighs) fuck i'm going to get in his face again and use paladin attack-attack that's 29 to hit the first keep him hurting (counting) 33 for the first attack second attack is a 21 so i think that misses and then i've got a bonus action left i'm going to stay where i am and i have a regular healing potion i'm going to down that that's 4d4 plus four right we are picking his scabs i'd like to point out that we have two barbarians and two paladins up here right now one of my die i feel like my luck is tied up with the existence of the world so could i give her one of my lucks she barely even gave that shit to me keep going you can hold it out to him that's key that's great it'll buff you a little bit on your strength check d4 on a skill check oh shit now i am the master mass cure wounds getting each other ready where's pike do i in my knowledge in having watched this crazy motherfucker with polymorph know if striking him and taking away his little bit of life he poofs back right okay so bonus action to disengage from vecnards and i'm going to fly at that fox and i am going to strike him with the flame tongue dagger (cheering) thankfully it's not sneak attack but i rolled a natural 20 and rolled a one so the dice get doubled to two plus my modifier of six on the flame tongue is eight so he gets hit for eight hit points of damage do i see a gnome or a fox it's a fox it's like a cat or a dog it's nothing it was eight total and we'll call that my hasted action and with my regular action i will put my hands on the side of ioun's chosen and use lay on hands to give him 20 hit points back and then i will use the rest of my movement to fly back into vecna's fucking face and i have no attacks left but i'll stay there jenga removing resistance back in the game he's the most important i'm not important hold for pike this is the giant dragon punch we saw in the past no fuck you i love that we are working on miniatures at the table oh it's very calming working on minis on his utility belt yeah we've been hurting him pretty bad the ark reactor does reaction work like attack of opportunity to keep him here yeah he's running away oh yeah that's our grog it's reading rainbow time i'm going to use a bonus action to look over my shoulder and see everyone that i know i'm going to see my sister and her husband i'm going to see the woman that i love i'm going to see grog i'm going to see arkhan i'm going to see my friend scanlan and then i'm going to dig into vecna's eye and stab away it's too late no i will use it to grapple should i reroll two rolls here unused that is a 22 all right that was my-- (clattering over skype) (laughter) that was my hasted action i'm going to stay here and fucking hug vecna's face trained in arcana oh my god burt reynolds do it close your eyes close your eyes okay i would like to cast compelled duel on vecna it's a long shot but i'm going to do it one creature that you can see within range must make a wisdom saving throw on a failed save the creature is drawn to you compelled by your divine demand so i would like to do it sure okay so that didn't work for my action i would like to steal a bonus kiss from keyleth of the air ashari every different form-- male female big tall small whatever-- i'm in love and i would like to use my regular action to fly in front of scanlan shorthalt five feet in front of him and splay my wings as wide as they can and flip the double birds to the biggest dick on the fucking planet in front of scanlan good that hits i'll use uncanny dodge to reduce it to half yes i grab scanlan like a football for old times' sake and i come up behind keyleth and i kiss her on the cheek and stare forward see you in the next campaign motherfucker power move lucky and smart i didn't use two of my luck i saved them real bad we would have had to have done five more games for this thing to end sam you were trying to save a wish for me
