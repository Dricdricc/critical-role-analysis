in person they look about ten times more vibrant - oh that’s easy wait wait wait is it a sports mascot it's a sports mascot marisha and i have a lot of interesting ideas that will go out the window depending on this roll possibly i don't like his reaction i'm going to use luck i have two lucks left i'm going to use one of them (groans) it was on 18 and went down no 16 oh well it was going to be really interesting it went 18 it hung like a half second 4 i'm wearing my boots because it's cold i wouldn't go walking barefoot why wouldn't any of us trust gilmore or matthew shush uncanny dodge oh okay misses (funny voice) uncanny dodge now i can do my crazy-ass shit so out of instinct the heels click together the boots go on the world slows down as i speed up and in that split second in a millisecond i think he's gone to all this trouble to get me here the door behind me could very well be locked also he knows everything he knows about whitestone if he leaves he can tell the conclave and if i run he's gone so instead he's right in front of me yeah okay i would like to grapple him okay last luck of the day 14 okay that's action number 1 action number 2 i'd like to grapple him (all laugh) huh say what it's a 7 okay i will cast lay on hands on myself that's an action okay then i'll stay where i am no sorry sorry sorry (mutters) at the top of my lungs i scream not just in my earring but loud enough for every guard and person in the castle i scream assassins western tower and the courtyard jenga yep where did my thing go okay yeah uncanny dodge on it 20 natural 20 (groans in relief) i did use uncanny dodge i lost track of what was what okay golf clap how about a howard dean i can’t see through the corner of the wall there is scanlan like 10 feet away 5 feet away all right i’m going to skirt along on his side the rakshasa’s side and shout out it’s not gilmore it’s a fucking demon at scanlan and then i’m going to use my first action to try to disarm kitty-cat what is that all right uh 16 and this is the next action 15 that’s still acrobatics right what’d you say this is athletics same thing sorry yeah 15 15 okay then for the rest of my turn i whip my head to scanlan say follow me down i’m going down and i want to drag him off the balcony and go with him half-speed i’m hasted 12 squares full this takes two seconds to go down i looked it up 80 feet is two seconds really hoping the guards are awake that was 3 points of damage so happy happy i assume what i said to scanlan was heard over earring as well you’re in a slip or nothing so monster heal and run heal and run heal and run that’s why i never take the armor off guys still love me scanlan fuck him up fuck him up quentin tarantino joined he didn’t redip though i don’t remember you saying he redipped right he used his poison last time and i made the save right okay sorry one more time yes that’s just a bonus to do that i’m unconscious for my turn i’ll be dead so in love with you right now so in love with you it was just my turn in the initiative can i go oh okay okay okay i totally - i trust in you matt and fear you always naked question grabbing a weapon off the ground that’s a freebie right is that a bonus action i feel like that’s - i think that’s free part of an action all right great i’m going to thank the raven queen for my family and cast lay on hands on myself take back 5 hit points i see mythcarver on the ground i’m going to grab it and use my movement to stand and i also noticed that we’re flanking hotis so i’m going to sneak-attack the motherfucker up the back yeah i’m hasted the bonus action was - oh no the action right the action was the spell oh okay that’s okay i have one action still i didn’t even - no no no do it the real way man i don’t want any mulligans well let me ask you this because if i understood that i wouldn’t have cast the spell so i’m happy to skip the spell and then cut the - so it has to go with another attack now i understand so if i had understood - thank you thank you i’ll take that mulligan for understanding so now i’m going to stab him with mythcarver through the back and flanked is at advantage yeah an ally nearby was it not all right that misses then so i’ve used an action but not the bonus action so i’m going to disengage and i’m going to dart back as far away from him as i can get ashley laura and 12 speed - the boots are off 6 got it yeah got it by the way the whitestone guards are shit don’t they stand on the wall don’t they stand on places whitestone whitestone i know what it means i do sort of sort of this shit ain’t my fault so cruel so cruel so cruel (laughs) 1 yeah no pressure okay okay okay run steve martin run consistent take it dicaprio he's going for spells rakshasa he does want to join vox monica well he reads thoughts but he gets them backwards sometimes vox merkernerkerk at advantage being a half-elf okay okay okay ah we’re good it was what he did to me the last time we faced him yeah now he does nothing at all yeah (sings) we’ve only just met rakshasa cannot be jerked ah haha petition to chris perkins to rename it “rakasha” yep hey i’m in a lot of pain 6 big hit points i’ll take it yep how do you get the beans above the franks yeah that’s what i said okay and the first thing i do is shout out blades i think blades are the best way to go here folks and i’m going to run at him i think i should get there with 12 no oh no boots and i’m going to try to grapple that fucking dick 19 okay and before my turn ends i’m going to pull him in and say fool me once motherfucker and whoever steps in steps in (sighs) girl… (singing whistle stop) (all join in on different parts) (starts singing mortal kombat theme) i liked ours better (record scratching noise) damn it’s like watching the olympics 5-9 5-8 6-1 do it girl i’m going to let go of him now just back up a few yeah we’ll see you next time shitface that’s how we did it last time i think we might need to have a discussion with vanessa at some point for not alerting us to the fact that this is a -
