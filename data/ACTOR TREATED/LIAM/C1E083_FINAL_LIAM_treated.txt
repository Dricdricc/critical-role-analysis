a couple of warriors in there i'm playing the knight the chivalrous knight in that game you got a major renfaire boner playing that game today yeah ages ago i just don't know how long it lasts flying up on the broom all that just roll another 20 never mind 30 yeah i thought you did what the fuck was that can i look at the ceiling every other part of this room except for where she is to see if she's also somewhere else 22 i would like to move across from my sister and move forward up to-- i can't tell from the overview but a little bit of rock's right there and stay hidden yeah (posh voice) hello (all laugh) i've got a mastiff i'll donate it same hunter's mark no the paladin checked for undead 25 and we see nothing and two eggs all right i'm going to cross back across north to the-- i mean i click on the boots of haste i'm going to move straight towards you matt across the hall so i'm by the corner there no not that far no closer to me right there and i'm going to throw at the eggs and it's i'm going first so with assassinate i get advantage on all these because i'm the first to go in combat yes yep starting at third level you are deadly so you get the drop on your enemies you have advantage on attack rolls against any creature that hasn't taken a turn in the combat yet that's great and i'm going to use sharpshooter so i get a negative five on these yeah 21 for the first okay (laughing) the second one is 18 okay and that is-- oh that's not that good is 14 do they all three hit or just the first two first two okay so the first one gets sneak attack damage that's right what you want them to take less damage yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah 32 for that one and what the heck i'm going to poison that egg so that is (laughing) seven that egg has to make a dc 15 success against poison (all laugh) so does it get half or half right or none i don't know i've never killed an egg before not poisoned so give it another seven hit points of damage from the dagger itself seven for that second attack the earlier one was 32 isn't dungeons and dragons fun yeah i'll stick with it i don't know if it makes a difference i called sharpshooter on my shots before but forgot to add the additional ten per attack okay (nerdy voice) raishan (all laugh) it's kind of always doing that a little bit though can't you put that drug pipe down for like five seconds j-e-l-l-o i don't know if we're going to kill raishan but we smoked those eggs that hall looks dangerous right where he is there's two magical columns right there it's not a natural one though the room was empty play-date but he's only seventh-level divern smert oh good roll the way that cloak goes is they're at disadvantage if they hit you once then it goes away until the start of your next round it keeps resetting maybe oh we got three paladins (laughs) silver lining silver lining did they come out of the cages i think they're like gauntlet generators and they're just like-- savage (pike voice) i'm going to-- (pike voice) in the shape of a-- can she move druid's going country uh shite are there still dead things with groggy i'm going to attack them i'm going to throw but i'm going to go one dagger at the one above him yeah on this side okay they were both roughed up real bad so the one that's fucked up i will attack so i'll throw one at that that is good that is a 31 yep and i'll throw-- yeah i'll throw another one at that one yeah that is 18 can i wait and see how much damage i do oh then yeah then i'll just attack one at a time i'll save that roll though for the next so that is two plus eight is ten plus oh grog is so it's flanked so it's sneak attack thanks buddy you're also my buddy 16 i mean it's got to be gone okay then the next two-- the first one gets 18 and then the second one is a 17 okay so there it goes i'm going to roll this one that's three plus eight is 11 plus the psychic damage has gone missing-- where is everything where's my dice 18 for the first eight for the second without the attack oh sorry so well if i rolled a two okay so then just two so 18 plus two 20 okay and i see that grog is in pretty good hands with kerrek so i'm going to use my movement which is hasted to slide around this way and crouch ten feet in front of keyleth there ahead of keyleth between raishan and her yeah smell that dragon liam and so sorry since i'm new with hunter's mark later i can take my floating hunter's mark and bring it over to raishan sweet that's good 32 that's okay you will be a golden god if this works higher than her hit points yeah well that's-- yeah no way you might what so you don't need the grit necro final fantasy natural 20 there is no negative he's just down you have to surpass your total-- natural 20 hip hop hippity hop yep a skillion hit points yeah perce de rolo just went full peacock he suddenly has a giant cowboy hat on am i good with my hunter's mark our relationship is very complicated we need a scene with the dog and trinket commiserating over a bowl of-- constantly getting blasted up it's everything he deserves disintegrate toward pike pass it fuck i'll roll it one of us has to roll it here's what it is this is what it is it's a 14 yeah she gets like one hit point i think she's up she's up she's not dead okay she's not dust 16 it's a constitution saving throw straight roll seven do you want to do it i'll do it go for it new campaign next week (all laugh) now with the boots of haste one of the extra actions has to be for an attack right i couldn't do-- yeah it says the extra action can be used to attack dash disengage or hide shite so i'm going to balls i'm going to go to the gnome on the ground and i'm going to cast lay on hands-- pike is up isn't she conscious is what i mean to scanlan and one hit point just to get you up i'm going to use a little more movement to move to the same spot that bigby's was before it was gone maybe into the-- the cloud's gone right maybe i'll even go ten more feet forward-- vow of enmity as a bonus action and i will use the extra action to disengage and get the fuck out i'm going to go that way back towards scanlan i should have 60 feet of movement hasted disengage i will actually go along the wall yeah yeah yeah you would've seen me go-- get it nerd get it the dragon doesn't blow up this could be the difference between-- because one or two death saves three death saves this is down to the wire dude that was the bite wasn't it yeah can i do an attack of opportunity as it flies by all right can we all see the hammer fly through the air sorry sorry i'm sorry so sorry 27 zero is it close ah oh okay i'm going to use one luck what does that mean if i use luck disadvantage and then i rolled a six and-- say again that's right it does so that cancels out so the first one-- but i'm still using luck so the first one was a six the second one was a 31 nine plus psychic damage ten 25 she's looking pretty rough look out perce put a counterweight plus her wisdom whatever you roll plus the wisdom marisha what a beautiful moment get it get it poetic justice motherfucker that's right matt that's right wow wow i'm just going to unload on her i'm unloading dagger-dagger-dagger at advantage on all of it and can i do-- i've got two spells left so can i do smite and smite because it just says on melee attacks it doesn't say how many a round or anything i don't know i've never tried to do it all right so first attack is-- hits it's 32 second attack-- oh okay well let's just say i whisper onto her neck so that's the first attack and i get smite second attack is a 27 i'm just going to do dagger-dagger actually and the first attack-- that's all right i didn't ask for that so that's one plus eight is nine plus the psychic damage makes it 12 plus smite is 22 plus sneakies yes yes yes (counting) 53 is the first attack second attack is also getting okay so one just one okay plus five and eight all right and i'm going to use my bonus action to disengage and just leap away from her and just tumble-crash to the ground okay 25 and i have 60 of movement so leaping off and rolling does that use it all up or can i move against the wall just keep going after i disengage from her thanks tuck and roll i already get advantage i got the paladin eyes on her that is the most perfect poetic moment could not have been better in character in character no no no in this state she's just going to mount you not like this not like this just put your head down on the desk student heads up seven up i mean an eight-foot drop on your head is pretty bad stand up pacman through it yes level seven yeah yeah yeah i start stumbling over towards scanlan i pick him up i start walking towards grog with him on percy i'll do it i don't want you to have-- i don't want you to-- get out of your head i'll do it i'll do it i'll do it it's just dice it's the universe that's low plus six the big one yeah it's a shield grog i've got him in my arms i just start to rock him like a child you know you're very funny but this is not very funny grog take him take him all right i head over to where keyleth is and start looking for traps i'm going to use my last luck of the day i just used my last luck of the day and i got two ones give him back give him back but it's not trapped i checked it eh that's d&d man i walk over i'm going to try-- i kneel down and try lay on hands on him because it can cure multiple diseases and cure poisons with a single use sure five is he cursed we can ferry back and forth on the carpet yes destroy undead let's find a tree do we see any trees everything was dead the closer we got to the central-- i mean the amount of talking we're doing it's already closed at this point yes we just start walking grog and i start walking drowning gilmore yes that's right that's right yeah one thing at a time vax is also listening to that sometimes you cannot get them back while holding scanlan to the temple of the raven queen i'm already 50 feet towards the temple no can we get the other gate stone and find shaun we have both of them we have them yeah doesn't your sister have the other one yes find the other gate stone and find shaun it's a little more complicated kymal all this time i have laid scanlan down in the center of the temple and with a wet rag i have cleaned his face and combed his hair out and laid mythcarver out next to him while i'm cleaning i start talking as well you know if it is his time then i can accept that it is his time but he just did an awful lot for you that dragon was tampering with your ways and without him we would have not gotten as far as we have he has done a lot for you and this isn't even bargaining anymore i am yours i'm not bargaining but this little man has more heart in his chest than any man i've met and if there is anyone who deserves a second chance i don't know i don't know your will be done i wasn't expecting-- that wasn't part of the ritual high rolls he's going to be so pissed sorry all night long man all night long push the narrative all night long like lionel ritchie come on if we wait he's going to write us off also feeblemind natural 20 on scanning the ocean pretty amazing
