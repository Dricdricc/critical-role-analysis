it's going to be great we need less than 300 subs for that bear i think we can do that i think that's pretty likely ohgreatlampshade we thank thee for thy mercy are you sad that you will no longer be the tallest member of our group he's shitting on a bed somewhere it's his thing asp hole and i got shit for talking about bears today perhaps we could sit on a nearby rooftop and watch pike work the beauty of this game is i have no idea what the shit we're going to do right now why aren't the priests going to shovel that shit up what's cellular oh you mean little flakes of poo moving on let's go take a look at this statue don't change scanlan a man human did you say storms tiberius war and combat and storms there's a big gate or door at the front are there any citizens out right now or are we alone in the dark i'd like to walk over to the nearest one and ask to a passerby excuse me good sir my friend over here the dragonborn he seems to think that this is some sort of temple or edifice to the god kord i just want to know is he correct yes absolutely this is our first time we literally just rolled into vasselheim what can you tell us of this it's an impressive structure and does one need to be a priest or cleric of this faith to challenge oneself or can anyone-- that's this neighborhood of vasselheim not the city as a whole just in these parts i don't start running but i'm following behind him and i take out my keen dagger and just start sort of dancing it across my hand as i follow after him yes exactly i'll fight him i said i'll fight him i'll put a thousand down right now that i can beat the big guy of my own money yes i can't rules are meant to be bent and stretched am i right it's a contentious relationship i put a thousand on the goliath 1000 gold on the goliath plus kitty you did that once and it didn't work out so well you got caught with your hand in the cookie jar nobody fucks with phil would you like to use my spiky die so these guys both potentially have like a hundred hit points have an ale and collect the money what an asp-hole i believe that's pronounced ma-choman rand'savage i take the flagon of ale that i've been drinking all this time i slam it down on the ground and push my sister out of the way and yell at the top of my lungs grog your father was an undead piece of shit and your cousin's going to make you his bitch coldstone i take five of my remaining gold and slide it over to that bartender and say just keep it coming all night please thanks the third floor i believe might have problems grog if it's any consolation-- as i had no idea that weapons weren't allowed in there if you and i had fought you would've beaten me to a bloody paste pike would have been proud of you grog i slap down another five gold to the bartender and say that's for that barstool never entirely welcome in the company of elves or men vax'ildan learned at a young age to skip past formality preferring instead to invite himself in your door along with twin sister vex'ahlia vax was born by a chance encounter between elven royalty and human peasantry raised by their mother in their early years the twins were eventually sent off to their father in the elven capital of syngorn but their cool reception among the elves-- hearing yelling i run up the stairs and say hey has anyone seen a-- oh there you are come on snibbles come on we've got to go back downstairs i'm really sorry chews through her rope all the time come on snibbles i start going on the tummy morning big guy have fun last night i think you need an ale yes but he's named after beer (laughter) can you feel it you can feel it right you can totally feel it are you a dwarf again i would feel it very hard to leave pike behind in the city are we really going to leave and go to kraghammer i don't know what either of those things are does the poop talk like my earring because that i understand it's like a poop earring why didn't you say that in the first place you talk through it you talk to poo how far are they from here family stuff can be tricky do you feel drawn to your parents though do you want to go then we should go you want to go back in there it's awfully fresh the braving grounds we were just in the pub i mean that was just a backyard brawl basically he's talking about going to the temple this is what i think grog it's too fresh you need some time away from it we should absolutely come back and you should break that guy's fucking face no question you almost did we've come a very long way keyleth is near her family she needs to see where that road lies and once we do we'll come back and fucking kill that guy yes i yank two daggers out flip them catch them and just start running come along percival we don't see them yet clever girl (laughter) i don't see it anymore i think it's gone back into the woods how frequently are these attacks coming that money's not going anywhere let's help the city out then we'll go on to see keyleth's parents we could easily get a head let's go right now grog's doing something let's go how we're on the carpet he's flying scanlan's riding on an eagle grog's been fighting for a long time he needs rest let's go whatever that thing is it's getting away we're losing time yes exactly let's keep twiddling our thumbs peter pan and wendy most people just say thank you dick don't worry my sister's a ranger she can track anything i don't know why am i the critters will figure it out just like the old days so it was killed by civilized folks and then torn apart by this thing my sister and i are going to check and see if there's any sign of it in the area yes it was 21 for me i'll go down in the bushes thanks i'm going stealth with what now oh 30 i'm scooting forward quietly 30 i'm pulling out my dagger of venom if you box it in we can't get inside keyleth when you shape the stone can you make it lean towards him in a ramp i can run up it would still box him in i could just traverse it i rolled a 30 i want to get down in a crouch and just run right there just headbutt a tree or something as soon as vax sees that he starts running through the grass up the slope of the stone yeah and i'm clicking one boot against the other as i run up it so i'm going faster run up and i'm going to jump and i'm going to start stabbing into that head okay 17 shit and 27 the final one hits 17 one okay so does this count as sneak attack all right so i roll a nine for damage plus eight 12 14 15 17 of sneak attack damage with the first attack that's poison and the poison is dc 15 with 11 points of poison damage to its head that's just the first attack that hits and then i take my keen dagger and i jab for the eye and that is a ten of damage both attacks first attack i gave you was sneak attack oh i thought i hit and missed and hit all right well then erase the first numbers i told you it's just ten plus-- it was 17 so 27 add 15 of poison to that add 15 of poison it gets poisoned and it takes damage on the first hit and every round i think it takes that poison oh yes dc 15 plus damage on the hit oh i'm sorry dm this is after the fact assassinate on any attack before the enemy's had a chance to take a turn yet any hit on surprise is a crit thank you that's all i get that's all i do by the way we need seven more subs which is ironically the same number of heads the hydra has taliesin marisha and you have a bear 12 yes that was all of dungeons and dragons contained in 30 seconds (laughter) all right so am i still up on the elevated part of the stone the one that's occupied with grog i'm going to jump on it and cling my legs to the side and try to slice down as i go over the side wall okay first is a 28 i'll just do that and it's a sneak attack because it's occupied with grog obviously so that is a two-- this is my keen dagger that's a nine plus nine 13 16 19 24 nine plus 24 is 33 and then the second dagger flametongue nine ten 19 okay that's a regular old four plus six is ten and then out comes the venom dagger which has already spit its poison and that is a 26 which also hits and that is a four plus six is ten so (dagger noises) down its neck can i ask do i have a bonus action at this point i'm hasted and i've done three attacks is there time for a bonus action i don't know okay i'm good i'm going to do rogue's evasion i'm going to use matt colville's die made of iron from a meteorite hopefully not die what kind of roll is this saving throw i've rolled a 17 everything in the area it's done i rolled a 17 is that a success or a failure just makes it for the first fireball do i need to roll again we're all going to roll again in a moment oh now that is less it's done this is why this is interesting so i succeeded the first time i failed the second time which means i halve whatever the damage is which is high that's okay where did all that math go from the last game come on trinket die oh my god okay no it's good oh wow it's not either it's really on an angle with casualties yeah vax is rolling down the corpse of the hydra to stand in front of these strangers i think we're killing a hydra what are you doing today listen we don't know what the fuck you're doing take the hydra we're not here for a bounty we're trying to help the city which one is talking otherwise we're going to go right now can anybody heal it can you kill it again i suddenly remembered my charlemagne i'm sorry not at all listen we were about to come to blows you and i are going to work this out words are mightier than the sword right you don't have to worry about that we're out here helping the city for the sake of good not earning a paycheck that's how you roll certification is key i've got the naughty bits let's quit while we're ahead we've come from emon we're not exactly familiar with the customs and traditions of your city we were merely trying to help my friend may have slaughtered the hydra-- unintentionally of course we're hoping to somehow fit into your society not sure how that works maybe you can help a hydra attacking your city we were merely following our conscience see they're massive careful where you're walking little man i feel you that is fucking awesome perhaps you've heard of us we understand we've broken the letter of your law but perhaps not the spirit of your law which is maybe more important we're very grateful we're tourists basically we're friends with the emperor thank you we've taken out a beholder and a handful of illithid we're not really worried about your contract give us your contract we'll sign it ex-squeeze me that is bullshit you don't understand we haven't been apart in about-- oh i'm sorry what was your name again thank you vanessa shitmaster
