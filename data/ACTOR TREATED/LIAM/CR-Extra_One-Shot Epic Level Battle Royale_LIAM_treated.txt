to be so weird your kenku druid tabaxi tortle half-breed bard yeah tabaxi with a shell does he immediately start doing one-arm pushups micro-tears troll text coming your way i know damn it went to fix a typo i sent to him and it just did it again it said basted instead of hasted oh okay so then-- i can do that sure no you said i couldn't do the first thing fuck man okay can i reverse that i can reverse that right if you go back to the first thing sure but i have a regular action right so i'll do it on the regular action yes the first thing i said right sorry yep good but yep i'm good on a hasted action i can only attack i can't cast spells which is what i suggested but if i just flip what i do where i should be relatively okay then i'll do the second thing i understand because that's not part of the second thing what am i supposed to do announce every move to you guys while i'm hidden it defeats the purpose dick dick dick i thought you said it was out oh out the door it's fine it's fine so she did it inside the building i'm not worried hold on say that again yeah that's right i'm going to use my second luck of the day oh that's good that's real good that's a 29 i am going to die it's just later you three don't know shit no man that's unlimited i'm not telling you anything about my rules you can figure it out since your husband told you reaction is if you try to hit me with a sword and i can only do that once per round right melee attack evasion is just dexterity saves so use that information you can use that information marisha dimensions finger of death i mean it's inevitable you're going to kill me eventually it's true i never claimed to memorize this book people next campaign i'm going to fuck it up just as much if that bothers you-- where you at girl 20 okay i've got movement bonus action hasted action and my regular action i'm going to use movement and bonus action to blast out of that door everybody sees me arc up into the sky and fly over this tower and disappear here i'll tell you what happens next via text okay i'm going to elaborate that's merciful nah water is a minute or less right i sent a clarification such a question isn't it take me out to the ball game too late that's amazing only because you remembered holy shit sam 20 levels and you haven't got your spells in order oh shit with her wisdom good luck buddy oh wow matt oh wow i'm going to use my 120 feet of regular movement to fly out of my hiding place into the air this is probably half my movement right about there i can't see about there don't worry this is temporary i wouldn't do that i see percival scanlan keyleth i've used half my movement about i would guess and i'm going to use my bonus action to use vow of enmity on keyleth i want to fly within 60 feet of her using still my base movement i will use my regular paladin attack which is an attack-attack to attack her which is at advantage because of the vow of enmity not great i'm going to use a luck i'm going to use a luck that's better not much better that is a 20 right so here we go just a little bit though a tickle for you really (counting) 28 and that's the first attack and then the second attack-- 28 yeah total 28 damage that was a combo there was some psychic there was eight of psychic okay then the second attack is 25 to hit which also hits but it's much dinkier so that is eight so that was movement plus paladin action and i will use my hasted action and bonus action i'll use my haste so i can go another 60 feet and i'm going to fly about there then i'm going to use my regular action to-- you guys don't fucking know i will tell you where i'm using my bonus action to hide attack attack for paladin action and i still have a hasted action and a bonus action one can be used for more movement-- 60 feet another 60 feet-ish for the base movement to there everybody thinks i don't know what i'm talking about so my base movement gets me to probably about here and i use my paladin attack to attack twice right so i've got bonus action and a hasted action left that is 120 feet left on one and then i can use the bonus action to hide i know (laughter) me too i have a great character planned i can't wait but i know that i can use another 120 feet from here to get to there there there or there and a bonus action to hide it's all in the fucking book dudes paladin action which is attack-attack and i still have hasted action which can be used for movement-- it's right hey man send a message to mike mearls about the 5th edition handbook thanks mike mearls i love the handbook the last anyone saw me is here keyleth saw me here going in this direction (singing) what's that blue thing doing there it's about to get real on the field back wow would you know to do that in a frenzy okay i need to ask a question here it comes i'm plugged in by a computer i'm going to use paladin attack-attack that's good even better that's 33 to hit 38 on the first does he attack between my two daggers 38 on the first 38 some of it's psychic but who's counting good 25 that hit that's eight i will dump venom into it you have to succeed a dc 15 bring it i was going to say i peeked up but he's sharpshooter you've only got four chances what'd you roll and i'll use my last luck you have to reroll the 19 yes i can on attacks yes i can and it's my last luck so your next three are clear absolutely can you use luck on other people's stuff and i can't remember if it's my third luck or fourth so we're just going to call it my fourth luck that's a two you've got three more shots of course you're going to shoot me good old 11 lucks vax sure that hits i'll use uncanny dodge on this one since i can see him first blood just hits that's first blood you've got one more shot come on draw blood definitely gotcha question is the green beam still there does it do anything are you going to tell me later just throwing it out there those were my two actions right i don't need to disengage because i'm not within melee right back down that was-- okay you should check hoo-ha did the green beam do anything for me or did it not work this is the end yeah i will use a bonus action to dump all my lay on hands back into myself so that's the first thing and i will-- matt travis and you know i will fucking stay put then i'll tell you i'm using a sharpie yeah so from my hidden position i would like to use ten or 15 feet of movement whatever i would need to peek out and throw whisper at percival's face well i would peek out i'm looking around and i know that i would see you i was in here and i'm hidden isn't it a sneak attack from a hidden position i know so i'm using whisper that's good that's a 25 to hit i'll bamf to him as i do it it's sneak attack damage that is nine plus that is 11 plus all these guys some of it's psychic that's 40 points of damage and this is my paladin attack so that was one i'm going to use the other attack with whisper i've still got it to throw it at keyleth's face which i will do that definitely hits that is a 31 right so not a lot of damage though (counting) that's 15 of damage that was maybe 15 feet of movement paladin attack-attack and i say oh yeah it really pains me it really does i use bonus action to disengage i have most of my original movement and hasted action left disengage you guys don't know where i went yeah that's not where i am i just sent it to you you asked me and i told you you asked for clarification i give it to you so no one would see me as you put me where i am why would she be able to go in there did she run out of movement though kill me i knew it was going to happen nope tonight in this game right i get advantage 29 is it my turn i'm separated with a wall from her a little bit i'm going to skitter five or ten feet i know she can hear me but he can't then i'm going to use a little more movement this looks like a hole so i'll floof out to about here i'll paladin attack-attack percival from the air over the water yeah oh that's not very good that's 18 hits the second attack is not so it doesn't hit but the first one does and it's sneak attack that's 18 plus these guys here we go (counting) 40 one attack hit one missed i used bonus action to hide a little bit of movement to get here attack-attack so i have hasted action and a lot more movement left i'll use the rest of my base movement to go i will tell you where i'm going mm-hmm he projected my position four times tonight it's just the nature of the game man it's my only mechanic you always said it would be grog and keyleth matt one i was about to say i didn't stop drop and roll or anything literally about to say yeah so i didn't do it 13 got it great okay i will use movement to get up half my 60 feet of movement to stand up got it and i will fly low along the ground-- are the boots off okay so it's not 60 the wings are up so 30 feet to get up 30 feet to get about-- i don't know can i perch there flying low i should be within 60 feet of kiki and i have vow of enmity still so i will attack-attack-attack this is here this is here there's a gap there okay everybody hates me that probably hits a lot i can use uncanny dodge on that since i can see him if he can see me so half that yeah you're good yes you are it's still my turn oh wow that's amazing dagger dagger dagger yeah that's a 30 to hit oh it doesn't matter because i've got vow of enmity up i was going to say am i still hidden but i've got vow of enmity that is sneak attack on that that's 30 44 on the first 44 damage on the first does 18 hit you get ten on that 28 on the third also hits that is 12 on the third yeah i'm done because i'm not hasted any more i used half to stand up and the other half to get there i used-- it's complicated folks paladin attack-attack and bonus to do a third attack so i'm done she's not so dumb that she thinks she's an earth elemental forever you have an intelligence of one suddenly five rules lawyers around the table oh difficult terrain uncanny dodge i'm going to be dead i'm a dead man i would like to paladin attack keyleth with vow of enmity twice the first one is a natural 20 let's just calculate that shall we that's one get all the dice first (counting) not that great actually that is 58 for the first attack eight psychic and double on all the dice 58 14 so that was paladin attack-attack i'll use disengage i don't want to do the phone thing i'm going to fly 60 feet but percy doesn't see me she does i fly to about here 60 feet i'm on the other side of this tower disengage and then my movement of 60 feet here she comes percy would have shot me out of it i stay low is it just this island left now matt we're vamping it's your third try at a form dude i'm probably down then i'm unconscious is there water the water's gone i thought you used all your shit to get there okay cool it's two death saves per i'm not going to dodge sleeping i'm two out of three she's got to hit me one more time oh so the first one's two peace first blood oh no she's down to 106 (chanting) first blood first blood all hail the queen i did what i came here to do
