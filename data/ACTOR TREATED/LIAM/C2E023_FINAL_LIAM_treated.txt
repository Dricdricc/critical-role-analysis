wait there's one more i have a thing this is not an announcement one of the artists in our community jason debit who's been with us since the very beginning-- old-school critter has made great art he's made art on his son's sandwich bags for years and he made a lot of critical role art too he contacted me a couple of weeks ago and said something's coming be on the lookout for it he gave me a vague idea of what it was and didn't prepare me for what i'm about to show you guys it's cabbage so this is another example of how unbelievable the people in our audience are so jason had an idea in 2016 to take a sketchbook and mail it around to other artists in the community this book and this box because it's covered in notes i'll let you guys look later but this book has been traveling the planet since 2016 instantly started crying looking at this book the rules when you finish with this book email jason yadda yadda if you use a medium that bleeds-- decorate it send it on to the next person it's been traveling the very first one i'll find some-- kat winslade has done art for ages i can't i just can't yeah mikandii ameera just a couple lloyd i'm not going to do everyone justice and i'm going to take pictures of this every single picture in here i opened this up for the first time an hour before the show and was openly weeping like liam o'brien is wont to do charlotte there's one more that i want to find that i really like that one's really good too i'll take pictures of all of them but i can't tell you how much this meant to me and obviously to all them seeing it for the first time thank you we have the best audience on planet earth bar none legitimately thank you really really thank you i'm looking at the wrong camera amazing we'll pass it around everyone will see it the audience will all see it thank you (fake crying) okay we'd better start the game that is a literal description i defer to the group no okay let's go i do not have a cat in this hunt but whatever you want to do i will support we also had no qualms about sending a highly decorated richter to the guillotine so i don't know why we are getting tied up over a troll i remember the way this way oh boy i am right behind whoever's in the lead frumpkin is scarfing it on my shoulders i'm a couple steps behind fjord saying that way once in a while that is a 15 i'm sorry dm could you say that again because i was busy rubbing it into travis that caleb is stronger than fjord we want the numbers though feed me i was leading everyone back to where this troll was i know exactly the direction of north and i remember where we were that is a nine but i have perfect memory but it all looks the same it looks just the way i remembered it though i would like to be on the absolute side of the semicircle please you just touched his tail you cast pass without a trace on all of us plus ten sam and i thought that-- i will hold fire bolt i pull out the wire and say what are you doing throw it in oh i could light it from here if you just toss it down and dive it's hard to control if i could get a pair of scissors please ooh that's some stale dynamite yes natural 20 i like that the blast didn't knock him down he was just so scared to death he went ah 21 21 a firebolt goes from my hand that is a natural 20 with my vax die we will use this one that is a three-- 11 doubled is 22 i didn't actually even want to come here ah no i'll stay where i am get up there and grapple him and i'll send projectiles it's pretty high i reckon nope that is a seven yeah okay so i'm going to keep it simple i will move as close as i can probably getting close to mollymauk ja i will hit him with some magic m-- no is he within splashing range of you all did you just get hit i'll hit him with magic missile the basic level three four eight 11 total oh this thing is way closer than i was prepared for i take a little bit of molasses and rub it on my hands and say slow down you boys have got this good and i start to back away casting slow as i go i will loop around by our cleric he has to beat a wisdom save against 16 he can do an attack or a bonus but not both it was a cube but caleb knowing that would put the troll in the corner and send the rest of it in that direction can't use reactions ja fjord madeline kahns back to life (laughter) just like blink can it do that if it's slowed but it doesn't anymore oh is it oh goodness this is-- dm in everything that i've seen when fire has been used on this creature did it splurt it seemed to splurt when i used fire i know but fjord is right under it so caleb shouts out should i burn this thing now all right i'll hold on a moment (funny voice) ah sorry buddy i just yell should i burn it and jester yelled wait i'm going to hold the glove of blasting i'm going to burn it the moment fjord is in the clear scorching ray yeah first is a 20 second is an 18 and the third is a 20 they all hit i did a total of 27 there is-- i am with these people and i am going to burn his head off (high-pitched) oh shit oh shit f√ºnf ja shook it off good good but fjord is still here so there is the important thing let's focus on the good things in our lives what is this word bougie is that in common is that a common word the zemnian word for that is like seven syllables long that is a big question mark at the moment perhaps wait until you receive word from him well he has a better eye on the situation than we do he's right in the thick of it now is there anything of use or value here at all you two just became that muppet meme that was made vex is back there is a halfling wrapped in parchment paper underneath the shop are you interested in him no we are on a bit of a time crunch i walk directly up to the bar yeah i'm good on drinks i was just curious what it is that you're reading for a question okay just a nine is it fiction i am so starved for a good book we've been in the wild for a while i don't suppose there's-- i doubt it but is there any place to find literature here that sounds terrible how long does it take for it to get here i commiserate for your thirst for fiction i struggle with it myself how far in are you are you almost finished with it is it a page turner okay i'm obviously just a little bit jealous but i don't want to take you away from your reading time nine no that's fine enjoy i give her a wink and i go back to the table we plan a heist for tonight we wait until she's asleep it's about vax (laughter) no i want to go for a walk on the edge of town for something yeah of course yeah of course no we are not going to get in trouble nein nein be good just going on a stroll ja we're not going to kill anything you're not going to you know just taking a walk you are pretty cute come on this is so silly i'm looking for a good stone no something with a little bit of heft to it not exactly i don't really have anything specific i guess i'll know it when i see it something about yea big you know my father used to tell me that if a stone had a ring around it all the way it was lucky yeah like a natural formation a coloration right it doesn't matter though i start looking for a stone a good one i will make the check with your help if that's okay okay that is a 13 oh that is a 14 a stone about as large as a malformed baseball i suppose is there a ring around it that's a lucky rock i'm not sure exactly i have some ideas cali i mean does an armored bear shit in the woods oh yeah i want to see it let me see it ooh that's a good one ja i mean i could use it right now but that seems detrimental if i had proper funding and materials but maybe later i'm going to keep it safe for the moment neither did i but we're figuring it out ja that was fine she's probably a good egg yeah she's a prickly pear but she's not a bad person i think you and i are a little eh in our own particular way i mean she's abrasive but that has its uses right tool for the right job right kiri kiri knows what i'm talking about you're good you're still good things are looking up i think that's a good name names are important got my rock kiri come on the gimp we were joking about under the floor of that place shittycreek that place is very busy yeah but there's a war brewing and that place is the center of it all i thought we were on a timetable to get these things done for the gentleman ain't no party like a hupperdook party so you're asking if we would like to pool our resources for a handful of these diamonds for a perilous situation i would rather you as an accomplished healer knew where the diamonds were on your person and got them lickety-split rather than you looking through my 32 pockets to find the diamonds but yeah i agree with you that we should pool our resources that is a good idea this is a little diamond i use for that one thing i do no this one i spin it and surround it with arcane energy and no it does not go away it's a very studied practice i spent years learning how to do it could you let her keep the diamonds traveler take the wheel marisha and just a minor thing while we're traveling i'm going to use my minor alchemy to turn a ring of the wood in the cart-- i'm sitting criss-cross applesauce-- and i make a ring of copper in the bottom of the wagon and place this stone in it i place both hands on the side of the stone and i'm trying to channel my knowledge and ability into it i'm futzing with it that's it i slap her hand i will also do it i will do it individually ooh i got a five wait a second i send frumpkin skittering off in that direction as he's leaving i say rub against some ankles and listen any books any books 13 to justify all of this he's been muttering everything he sees bones bone necklaces pineapples frumpkin comes around a corner and caleb sees that the entire party has left him in the cart snaps out of it and scrabbles out and starts hustling over that way oh you did it again that's not percy he's got his head shoved up the ass of a clock right now leave him be yeah what is fjord doing right now i see that you look bored out of your mind same same me either so far so good though right i mean the lot of it we've been together for weeks now there's been some friction but we're still here oh hell that was nothing to when you held a blade to my throat but we're making it work you're a good guy i think what does he look like when i say that no i know what your face looks like what does it mean double rainbow what does it mean okay i am from the north we have brot tomatoes and cheese and that's it what well you teach me good talk okay show me what you're talking about that's a dirty picture no that's a dirty picture burlap it's all burlap what do the faces of the people who aren't talking look like 17 and caleb will tell the group caleb is futzing again with the rock and just sort of massaging the four days of stubble that he has grown back and his facial hair comes in as fast as liam's does so it's already pretty thick except for your eyes your eyes are like blue crayons ooh we're off the rails we're off the rails you're so cool how do you fucking eat gravel so hard oh man 13 there's something deadly out there that wants to murder us all in our sleep yeah it could be do you want to wake everybody up or-- well i can't see shit okay well hold on a second just wear my cat as a scarf and she digs-- dammit my cat was a girl but-- never mind he digs his claws into nott's neck and hangs in and caleb sits between fjord and beau and loses his sight and vision and listens fuck a duck (laughter) it's a 30-foot radius do i get to make a perception check through frumpkin's ears yass it's a two (laughter) no we just saw a hump right i pull out a wire and say you're onto this right this is a possible ambush ja tell your man to check the cart probably but give it a moment tell him to do the running man ja i can relate but just do it no no no switch to the cabbage patch and i start punching fjord and beau in the shoulders shh quiet be quiet i start quietly handing over everybody's mouth wake up there's an ambush i'm scared of yasha but i do it anyway wake up there's an ambush caleb will at this point once everyone is awake-- yasha was the last one-- go back in to see what is going on oh shit (stammering) nott's being attacked let's go and i jump out of the cart i am doing my best vax impression and making my way through the grass still stealthing i'm trying 14 and caleb heard fjord say that and just went (fwoof) and there's four globes floating above us they're really spread out how spread out roughly how far apart are those two okay i'm going to hold slow for one side of the group if i decide they're a threat if they sound like a threat yeah that's fine caleb lets slow fizzle also leave one gift for us before you go because you're living ja we have a cart we're good is there anything in the cart that is more interesting back away from that cart please i am not taking their clothes but i am interested to see what they are carrying are you bullshitting us are you bullshitting me now i'm looking in his cart that's a 15 how's this working out for you are you better or worse than when you started yeah head to the cities work on a dock learn from your mistakes what the fuck are you doing three strikes and you're out this is two that's fine the next time we are going to turn you into grease puddles so maybe find yourselves a job in a store or a dock or a restaurant even at least be good at it if you're going to do that i walk up to this guy and i take the stone out of my pocket and i place it against his forehead and i mutter a few words under my breath and now i know where you are at all times and i will know if you are still doing this kind of work and i will come and i will kill you natural 20 oh my god no he's a warlock no they're going to leave him we've got one more of your-- this one take him judging by the map how far are we from any town oh this guy's going to die how far away are his friends i'm going to pull my wire out and message the one who i intimidated and say you left one behind he's here it's 120 feet i think i'm going to check it out it's 5000 feet i just talked into a wire you don't know it's fine the good news is we're in the middle of the wilderness and no one is going to find him i have a dagger and i'm going to shove it in his belt so he's not totally alone he's pantsless but with a dagger correct oh i didn't see that i take my dagger back he's fine he's got a blade this is so dumb what color is it it is oregon trail let's count the grains on a scale of one to ten one being like a shit-ass swamp town and ten being like rexxentrum what does the civilization of this city look like but not podunk it's builded illiteracy he did it not much better especially at night during all of that yammering on the way up i look over at yasha and sigh out that's it (whispering) i am crazy do we as a much taller united colors of benetton pack draw a lot of attention as we walk through rissa you mentioned culture are there any libraries here in hupperdook the walk-ups are tough what do you do now well we are a traveling group of hired guns who can get shit done we are a varied group of people some of us learn and some of us are good at smashing skulls we would do any kind of work if it were presented to us that's who we are we're a motley group of assholes i was trying to defuse-- steampunk burning man
