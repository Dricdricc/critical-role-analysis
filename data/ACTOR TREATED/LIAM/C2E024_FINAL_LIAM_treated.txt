bb i want shaved ice bb gobble gobble not to be confused with webmd no you throw it yeah throw it in the air fire bolt pretty good that's 19 plus something how did you do it for shits and giggles or what do you have in mind sure it went very good in the swamp with that little one are we just in an ocean of gnomes is it like 98% gnomes all around us i'm traveling with my hood up minor detail as you were when people have libations they get up to hijinks at night and that seems like the main activity here i pull out the silver thread and i start going around the horses i want to listen i'm going to sit close by on the other side of the bar i cast haste on jester while she is playing the piano i toss one gold in and say this one's for the lady very good well the odds are that you are not going to even see him in your room tonight so i wouldn't worry about it so much he's like a coyote you know what that is (funny accent) diplomatic immunity (laughter) yeah they like to fuck a lot is my point but if you want a quieter evening you can certainly share the room with nott and i for once it's probably not as raucous a room but you're welcome to it i'm watching nott and as soon as i see that she has found everything that she is looking for i've got the copper wire ready and i mutter through it to the one on the ground they're going to kill you you have to run now honestly the name really sells this place we have been fascinated with it for quite some time she's set in her ways they are almost as nimble as you will it be dark where we are doing this i worry about-- you know what i worry about no it just depends on the situation this happens all over the city outside everywhere ja it is almost like a drunken crossfit gym i'm sorry it is almost like a crossfit gym i have two gold perhaps our feathered friend is a little more important than the horses and i could leave my threads around her room and she would be safe there i would know if there was a problem no but it does matter because you are a young child and you need to get your rest and we are going to be doing things that are quite frankly not for your eyes we could get a babysitter are you all right are you sure i was planning to go out but it's awkward for me i thought you would be going i thought that we could give each other moral support you know what i mean i think the child will be dead by the morning no that is not a thing that is happening you could ask beauregard that's not going to happen ja yeah that is the key if i want to no perhaps beauregard is fleet of foot she could round you out i played with mommy and i played with judd and now i going to play with you i will take a rain check on that no thank you jester it is tempting but no no that's truthful it's obvious how dexterous you are you're just gruff ask if there's a cancellation fee also you have to embrace yes and fjord yes and not no but are you honestly okay you seem very perturbed was it someone special predictably i would like as i follow this group around to keep one eye open for a bookstore i rolled a 19 for buch it is hard to believe but i was able to do the-- i danced the waltz and the tarantella it's been many years i am very much out of practice and-- it does a little bit i believe it is there anything else that you're hiding from us any other quirks or skills what are three more wait hold that thought so that's two things and the third is and was that skill learned or innate yeah study is key that's true i'm done here i walk towards the store is it open oh my gosh i press my nose to the glass and try to see what i can see is there a lot of books in there or just a few books or-- okay that's a 16 from what i can tell does it look like a technical place where they are just making books or do they have books for sale i cannot tell if it's a happy or a sad bookstore 13 that was 13 one please just a second nott come here for a moment are you going to dance yeah but later it seems like you want to i think you should well you should try it you should enjoy yourself but make sure that either jester or i ties your mask on very tightly yeah i mean it would not be a bad idea all the same maybe stay away from direct light you know if you can stay a little bit away from it ja and some people are smart and it won't work that is exactly what i will do you should enjoy yourself i am not dancing so it is not really an issue i don't think i should go late in the game but i feel capable of this challenge we have eins zwei drei vier und f√ºnf yes barf saves snap come on beauregard ja hello my name is caleb (laughter) it's a pleasure let's enjoy a good game did you just say may the best gnome win i am a very skinny man let's do this do not let me fall asleep face down in the gutter

like it might go out the back exit instead of the front aw 14 i swat him on the side of the face i do it again it's good it's good for you drink natural 20 (cheering) i nod cooly for a second and i just turn and go (spitting) that is one smooth seaman i like it as well but only if you can match this diamond worth oh about 100 gold give me something like that or there's no deal oh you could use it now get it von bismarck there's three of you you-- you are very-- you are-- you are very drunk am i also very drunk i assume i take one hit point of damage or 1d4 from a monk okay (singing) oh the

stumble away you are blue (singing) one of those things is true and you are blue all five of my gold do i have my motherfucking books we are not going to start with the spell that will lead us to it of course i would just a boulder parchment shears reference it's simple if you're within 15 feet i was at the door i don't know how big the place is i was going to do something before jester did what she did how could they even use them because only the winners that everyone saw won them do you give a shit about our problems how many gold is that toy are you speaking of an automaton so they have it penned in but it is out of their control fucking hupperdook bureaucracy pocket a bolt i wave my hands a little bit and say i suggest you help this one find the things that we are looking for and i cast suggest that is 16 wisdom one of them fitz fitz i suggested that you do everything in your power to help my friend fjord and for the next eight hours that is what you will do how much do these young men make in a day here i want this one particularly working now why don't we stake their salary for the day we take care of that double it even we need these two we pay for the loss of their work today octopi in a center spot yeah the tokens we should probably keep our voices down in the street-- do we want to send nott or a cat in no open windows there was a back door too it's not in character no parents at all how much have you hoarded up here just us or more throwback yes we are haven't you been working for the circus for two years does that mean that your cards are bullshit i am asking mollymauk i want to say insight check so bad but i won't say it dm will fill that information in we already have a job it depends on how altruistic this group is we already have a job i mean i will defer to the group but we have a job and we are on a time table ja so much for sticking to the plan i would like it to be predicated on us coming up with at least a respectable plan not willy-nilly fly in with our balls out that's a lot of money string theory eight hours yeah do we have any food we can leave for them so they don't have to-- i think she has a sleepover-- they are very capable children kinder this is a thread i am going to put around the chamber that you are living in and i will know if our little feathered friend or you all leave you're perfectly welcome to i'm
