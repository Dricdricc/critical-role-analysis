that was strangely manic and desperate did you literally write that in the bathroom six minutes ago burn it not the book laura's die i'm going to be at bak-anime this weekend two days only in bakersfield california i will talk and i will go out in public i'm really shabby at the moment that's good let's go back and talk to the cops what about just its head it's all you blue the imps burned away because that's what you want to stick your finger in caleb just retched into the grass from watching that if it will help tomorrow or today-- what time is it it's the middle of the night isn't it i know exactly what time it is don't i yeah it's something i've always been able to-- why is everybody looking at me like-- (vomiting sound) (fwoosh) how far away are they from the rest of us i was just about to suggest covering that up but you know all cards on the table i pull fjord away for a moment about ten or 15 feet away this man in the boat has seen all of you who are supposed to be under house arrest we cannot have him talking to the authorities jeez come here oh that's very trusting oh you're here too now great it's a party i'm not suggesting that but it's either violence or giving him a little something you want to leave it to chance molly do you want to join this conversation walking up to the boat-- collecting it as i go the thing of it is we've just done trostenwald-- what was that never mind --a great service there was an unsavory element-- did you know the circus was in town doesn't matter there was a bad fellow-- that's his head-- with them it's no fault of theirs you pick weird folk up on the road in the circus isn't that right mollymauk that's going to rile you up that's a bad idea but the situation in town is a little political we're going to take this thing out of here and i'm going to report it to the authorities we don't really want to create a stir and frighten people here i hope you will take-- try to focus on the gold i think fjord had a good idea which is if you can disguise yourself as a crownsguard again you wait with it you guys get back to the tavern yeah now here's the thing i may be speaking out of turn-- i know i don't know you very well but it feels like the thing that we all share in common here is that we don't wish to make-- maybe not you-- make a big splash here okay so maybe i'm 70 to 80 percent correct but we're all in this together i don't want to make a big thing i'm going to go the authorities to-- my keen mind tells me that woman's name was-- yeah the one who wanted to go eat norda i want to go to her and citizen's arrest kind of thing keep it quiet don't need big accolades will take gold and then i'll bring that back and we can divvy that up that's no problem right and if nobody recognizes you-- do you remember any of the guards that were in town that you could make yourself look like specifically dm question the two zombified back at the circus tents were they burnt to a crisp beyond recognition yeah but was he recognizable did we leave him looking like that dude at the end of the last crusade after he drank from the wrong cup okay well the jonas brothers it is friends they already believe that the circus is terrible i think they were just going to confirm their own suspicions well that's a sticky situation because what if she talks about my friends who were there with me it looks like she knows how to go off like a siren i'm at one hit point i understand can you explain to us maybe your relationship with kylre if that was his name let's talk about the killing part though child how did you grow so close to him did he communicate with you in some way what did you talk about i am sure this is painful for you you are young sometimes people we feel we know can be someone else regrettably this is one of those instances he was a dangerous thing it is very important that this is buried here you want to travel on with the circus and with mollymauk and your friends that thing tried to kill us it did kill things in trostenwald who knows what it would have done to you child oof no it's not good it is only a six rolled very low rated t for teen i talk to him while you do that you have your wine you have your gold thank you very much it is much appreciated it was a lovely trip oh i have felled a beast you will not take credit for my kill i have killed this thing and i want it to be watched i am going to the authorities we will bring them back and get this sorted monster calves yeah but at level two you need to roll higher than a three that is correct take her and sequester her with the family so not a peep gets out you're going to stay with your new friend you can't come to-- not this time it's not-- you know why if any problem should arise i'll send frumpkin straight away to you i'm almost dead already nott this is what i talked to you about the other night these are our friends and we're going to sort this out and figure out what we do next it has been you and me now it is you and me and them okay you're with your blue friend here i'll be back i'm just going to have a conversation we have gotten out of prisons before you and i i'm not worried about that well she was just holding the throbbing head i don't need to cause i'm just taking a stroll yep that's my girl look at him no i'm not waiting i'm going to see norda so i'll see you shortly be ready excuse me and i lurch and prop myself up against a wall and push back excuse me i just had a very harrowing night you get me norda this very minute and i will tell you what has happened with this circus and in this town and don't keep me waiting another minute i'm bleeding out here arschloch oh come on i wish i had gone with that because it was great there but it's not great here that is a nine excuse me there are very good people being held under house arrest in a tavern right now they are innocent i have evidence that i can show her this whole thing can be solved now okay i look him in the eye i will go away get the message to her that the head of the circus frog is at the docks waiting for her inspection i remember the height (shouting) there is a circus toad's remains at the docks i would like to put this town's fears to rest i am looking for-- what's her name yorda norda yorda's at the inn right liam's memory is really spotty but caleb's is rock-solid thank goodness thank you gentlemen forgive me i can see that you're trying to get yourself home to bed you are very aware that there are people at the nestled nook under house arrest by your order they are innocent and i can prove it and i would like to end things as quickly as possible i have killed one of the circus folk this evening funny story yes these are the people i was talking about nothing has changed however and i am only asking to take another ten minutes of your time to walk to the dock one of the performers has been killed this evening and i have done it i staked out the circus because my friends were in trouble and wrongly accused and i knew this so i staked out the circus this evening and watched as this toad thing left the grounds there it did this to me and i in a rage followed it and destroyed it and i will show you the remains of my work we'll put it to bed i'm either a clown or i'm a toad-killer let's see what it is come on you fucker 11 you know that's probably agitating the issue let's go to the docks i'm good with these terms follow me please i am not going to answer her i'm just walking very firmly with purpose to the docks moment of confusion-- here it is right here where i left it nobody has tampered with it i turn around and i pull back my clothing and show a huge slash across my body and say you see this it was done by this thing (whoosh) it is as bad as it looks and if you have any holy people in this city they will confirm that this thing is fiendish i hope you don't believe that i slashed open my own body and then went to the police i sit down on a crate and i stop talking no it's good that you try so hard to protect the rights of giant frog creatures i'm very impressed just me yes it was difficult but i prevailed in the end the city is safe what library was that that you mentioned here in town oh sorry one last thing watchmaster i pull out the book that i read about the nergaliid here this is a gift for you this is folklore you will find i have marked a page in there it will describe this thing it's just a pot you're the little girl here you're confused it's been a night (singing) breaking the law breaking the law well first a question are you familiar with occam's razor i figured okay that one works for the circus do i look like i work for the circus no i'm a dirty hobo and i reek like yesterday's garbage yeah this one does he look like a circus performer is he filthy like me but he's right here look i can touch him the sardonic one right with the shit-eating grin does she look like she works for the circus i am injured within a centimeter of my life this one is a nincompoop that's you i pull the mask away this is my good friend she's a goblin i step in front of her she is my friend and colleague and you will not lay a hand on her while i am standing here fucking right i will that is an 11 (chanting) level two she's looking into my chest because nott is behind me i'm sorry i'm confused why you're going to such lengths to defend the rights of this large oversized frog skull there's a big conspiracy to make undead crownsguard here in the city you know when she's nervous she aerates her bladder all right still sucks i invite nott up to my piggy-back position on my shoulders i scoop her up just let it happen can i have my book back please how much do you think the circus has what happens to the circus because you know you can't do the same show for the same people for a year we don't know we didn't see him the nestled nook yeah we're just like tieflings we're all alike well if it is this thing that we've read about in the book then perhaps he needed to feed more or was impatient for some reason and i'm sorry are we also taking the bouncer into our little coven of weirdos is that a thing that's happening i'm too tired to argue let's get that drink that is a very sick burn i catch nott's eye and silently mouth the word 'lunatics' a what they generally run from crystals i've seen that kind before yeah there's no balloons though what's a balloon oh a dirigible dirigible i've heard of but a balloon i don't know what that is you don't know you know just out of curiosity what's everybody plan to do now you were never wanted back to my question-- straight there yeah took the words out of my mouth i don't know you know nott and i have been travelling together for a while and two is better than one although still very difficult uh you know it was six months ago about five six months ago i'll do persuasion that's uh i don't know where on my character sheet is that's also a 14 well first of all she's being modest it was not just me at all i could not have gotten out of there without you i don't think you could have gotten out of there without me either but you know that's why i said two better than one one is the loneliest number yeah you know normally i wouldn't feel comfortable talking about shit like this but you are all very shifty no no no you're shifty as well yeah no nothing serious at all really i was too curious she was maybe a little thirsty you know petty stuff we all know how this country works (clears throat) you know i wouldn't go west maybe yeah and they're pretty terrible in the north that's no secret mollymauk you're comfortable leaving the circus you are very-- you have a lot of flair that doesn't make any sense at all i mean it does but it blatantly obvious and simplistic (laughter) i mean technically this is a group you mean groups bigger than this group or is this group too claustrophobic for you or--  yeah (clears throat) yeah i'm good thank you (laughter) do we have time to-- look at this we're making plans with friends that's amazing do we have for errands in the morning i have a couple stops nothing major yeah way up after nott has gone i go over to norda is norda down there no there's two people with rhyming names this is revenge for vex and vax i find the purveyor of the establishment mork from ork that's what i said excuse me is there-- i know you have a bath here but is there a hot bath place like a bathhouse i'm bruised over every inch of my body and i'm in a lot of pain i know but how much are we talking about that's expensive northward you say okay good i'm not worried danke and i head up there the writing only shows up if you throw it in fire (laughter) i'm sure everything went according to plan ah-- (blood gushing) is this one of those dreams where nobody has their clothes on well you know this is very fascinating but i have some errands to run nott would you like to run errands with me we are totally coming back and not leaving on our own undercover travis laura and bring it on persuasion i rolled a natural 20 whatever i'm being very honest we're not going anywhere but i do have errands to run so we're going to leave soon have some breakfast i grab some bacon from ford/fjord's plate and grab nott and head out the door i have two places to go the first we're going to the burnished bibelots the second is a surprise but i know that i whisked you away in a hurry the other day and you weren't done browsing maybe that's the third place that we go i will point out your point which was that these crazy bastards are very distracting and strange yeah so they could be my healing potion you know we'll talk about it third place so drag her off to the burnished bibelots boom in the door good day to you sir i give nott a little shove over towards the shelves and walk up to him right up to the counter what are you eating there that looks good all right yeah that's what that is you know i wanted to thank you for the book i don't know if you read it yourself but i read it cover to cover quickly it was fascinating and very useful [aside quietly] i hope you're doing stuff over there well here's the thing i have read this book and loved it and if you would like to purchase it for the low low price of one gold you can sell it again you sold it to me for three you have it back for one you can turn a profit natural 20 that is a good decision and it was a good book i am grateful for the knowledge you have imparted upon me oh of course it's right here on the table sorry grandfather right you will not sell that back to me for sure that's a good price nott how are you doing all done for the day what is that little dancer toy between the three red mushrooms on the shelf behind you is that a music box there it's lost the magic how long would that take okay well i'll come back and see your work in three days work on that and your breakfast hey nott are you ready all right good day to you happy sales sure out the door i'm going to head in the direction dragging my goblin friend with me to that fancy bathhouse that was described to me last night at the nestled nook charisma check well something i wanted to do before we got there was going to do it maybe in an alley but you tell me is i would like to cast disguise self on myself presumably gone into an alleyway so no one sees me doing this in the middle of the road i take the form of a man in very fancy green robes beautiful blond hair very handsome man with a vomit stain down the front of my clothes i drag my little friend along with me you are going to like this this is something very special oh charisma check straight charisma yeah it's 11 dew dew there's a liquid u in that all right let's enter this establishment yes one moment (quietly) stay close to me and let me do the talking (louder) hello please don't focus-- my daughter is shy i've had a terrible day some disgusting derelict has vomited all over me i smell like filth and i would like to spend a couple of hours in your finest bath maybe not your finest a good bath for a couple of hours my daughter and i i will need adjoining baths if you have that for modesty's sake my daughter and i (humming) there's a 12 that's fine i definitely have that i take out the eight silver i slap it down okay come along dear yes it is that's meine liebchen i'm hoping for a hot bath for the both of us it has been a long bit of travel are they separate though excellent this is called a bath a hot bath we have been pretty dinged up for the past several months and we might not get back into something like this for a while so i want you to enjoy it go over to your side and i will be here nott i'm going to do a bit of reading yes yes i will be the same caleb trust me i will not once she is clear of the wall i'm going to start actually disrobing although i guess the illusion stays nott i'm probably going to go quiet for a little while enjoy it i find the second book and examine it am i able to read this so all my actual clothes are off i'm going to take the book and set it on the edge of the basin i set it down i sit with just my legs in the bath for a moment and i look at the book [exhales] on my side while all of that is happening two things one is that when i finally get into the tub i dip my whole body almost entirely in but not my head or hair letting the bruises soak in the hot water which feels wonderful the second thing is while flipping the pages of this book very still i can hear all of this and it is extremely endearing but i go completely still completely quiet and read in peace [old man voice] why is this crowbar seven gold shut the front door i pack up i said we're staying for an hour so i cast disguise self again to keep the illusion going i'm done you look-- --refreshed did you like it though i wanted to repay you for all you've done for me for the past couple of days the brief moment that i was in my own guise nothing changed up here so i look exactly the way i did this morning who said that you wanted to do something right let's do that then you lead the way well wait you lead the way outside let's keep our little schtick going here and then off we go yes but we have to go sorry i'm late for a very important appointment i drag nott right out of here because i saw no doorknob on the door sorry i will say that on the way there that i dropped the disguise somewhere all right marisha said that not beauregard that's a slam dunk at level two this guy went from the simpson's safeway clerk to the shadiest motherfucker in a snap of time because of your question yes can i help you good sir yes i can help you you fucking badass what's the matter do you have a cold i will take that as a compliment thank you what are you guys doing here are you shopping what do they have in there how much do they run for 70 we have a plan for the day do you have a strategy for that which one would that be because i was thinking about it on the walk here and i can't think which one applies no i wouldn't be saying this out loud if you're close here's the thing i have died almost twice in two days we have our friends and i think that's a good way to start i mean you know we almost all got pinched yesterday you and me all right okay where are we going first is it this big how far off does hupperdook look do i have any knowledge of alfield will you share your map with me for just one minute it looks like somebody was very nice to you the night before over and over again sure let's do that what's our goal in zadash unless you're a foreigner everyone knows about rexxentrum zadash is medium or smaller how far did that map say when i looked at it 200 miles you said to zadash well i think it's good how many horses a couple of weeks on the road to a city bigger than this one two weeks is not a bad test run for companions if we don't like it we part ways in zadash you have something else to do while everyone is getting ready i wait for a moment when fjord is on his own and everyone is busy walk over this group seems rough around the edges but you seem clever hopefully we can make this work i mean full disclosure i'm a little rough around the edges but you catch my drift let's make it work yee-haw oh my gosh and sneaky mcsneakerson over here oh boy bunch of assholes that's the name
