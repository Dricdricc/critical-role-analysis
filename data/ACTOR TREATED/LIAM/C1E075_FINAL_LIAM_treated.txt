pass 'em down pass 'em down (thumps) oh same thing that kills us all around here dust poisoning as we all know the dust bowl's full of radioactive dust it melts your face clean off of the bone oh lord what will we ever do with this dust well it's not really an announcement i'm just a willing accomplice with one of my favorite artist buddies sedona parnham has sent something she has made specifically for sam riegel so it was sent to me on the sly because you're so dear to all of us so dear so charming and now you will be well-rested please accept this gift no don't read-- it's nothing to read just open it up and show us all what you find there's only one other copy of that pillowcase and it is mine (laughter) yeah i mean we need a blanket as well so that was from sedona who is known as @anodesu on twitter she's done a ton of great art for this show she's one of my favorites she's a buddy now i feel like you're working some shit out here (laughter) like charcoal we're walking out in public at this point right and there's people about we see other beings about so question because i put on the ring of invisibility before we left but senokir i think might have chuckled when i gave my sister a wet willie so as we're walking and i've got the ring on as we pass people i'm doing this and looking to see if anyone is reacting to that (fart noise) (coughs) (softly) yeah i will stealthily pick my sister's locks get behind grog well i'm going to luck that sucker it doesn't matter it doesn't matter it's a 20 okay okay that's fine as well that's 25 as i trail backwards behind her you hear twins motherfucker (laughter) i thought the same thing it's a scratch no pick you could also chat with him and i could walk over and take it what's the guesstimate on this fella's height how high up is that side all right that's pretty tall that's pretty high i have two vestiges no way pull a hammie who was that as we leave i give the saddest puppy stare to that wallet on the side of his belt and wish upon a star and then i leave i wave at a couple quietly this guy likes to party she won it in a card game and hung it on the wall as a decoration i don't want to do anything i want you to win this in a game of cards but i'll be a plan b they're not going to see me yeah and then you pretend like you tripped so let me go i'm already climbing would this be acrobatics athletics dang it bobby that's a 16 i think there might be a lot of giants potentially in here at any one time but nobody in here now are there any other windows along from where i am i know they would be a ways off yeah that's a 19 yeah cool i'm just hanging so fast but so weak i have little indoor fans like i'm a baseball mascot is it transparent so it's just cloudy can i check for traps okay oh good 27 looking at it do i think i could disarm it from this side or is it something from the inside of the room okay and i can't see shit natural 20 oh perception a total of 32 any armor on the walls well my arms are starting to do this thing so i'm going to start going down does it get stuck with the dent 25 are there any pieces of armor with a sun on it the cards are going to be like giant novelty cards how many feet up the wall while you don't recognize them as letters they're like little characters that you're familiar with the burly guy and then the cross guy he's holding swords stone-cold gnome so in this room let's say you're her and we're all where we are and the giants are behind the group is that about right and how much room is there behind her and the wall i'm going to slowly tippie-toe around the side of the wall carefully avoiding giants i want to stand not directly behind her but off at an angle 30 so there's three rolls in a row and she's done two can we see them from where i am yeah i'm at an angle but i'm a lot lower than she is luck that's fine 22 can i (mutters inaudibly) in the earring as quiet as a mouse can i just breathe it with advantage is it three rolls i don't understand the game yeah i'm going to wait i'm standing there but i'm not-- at the respawn point did it get dark out at all or no who's that guy what is that guy i mean are we in a hurry do we want to try to make this happen tonight i'm not talking about him i'm talking about doubling back to the house and trying to get through the servants' window if we're in a hurry i mean we've killed some pretty gnarly things i know they're big so are we yeah and i'm sure the other thing will be super easy it's on the table i mean whatever you know i'm going to follow your lead yeah that's what i was suggesting you seemed to be able to talk yenk into doing whatever you wanted do you think you could do that with this guy i meant convince him to come inside could be what about this this is a terrible idea could one of us goad him into following us out of his abode or some building somewhere and you plop the mansion door outside the actual door so he goes to try to leave the tavern or whatever the fuck he goes into our house i like the mansion idea what if we pitched the mansion as a traveling magical boutique slave shop artisan slave shop we lube this guy up in a loincloth and this guy after a hard day's tinkering and we sell them this guy can sell anything this guy could sell a hunk of shit to the emperor of emon that's the plan we're septuplets sextuplets and you're the salesman i mean we're fairly attractive i feel like six of us would be worth the price of admission it's got the word sex right in it sextuplets sex sells sextuplets sell artisanal half-elf slaves one addendum our sizes don't change right we could be the matryoshka nesting dolls from biggest to smallest that's unique oh that would go to shit anyway so far only cinnabons here has been able to see through my shit scan-man can you rearrange the inside of the mansion to look like whatever you want-- could it be a theater for presentation or a ring to show off amazing skills wings arrows can we build a stage out of chickens (high-pitched) flames liam taliesin and smash cut to a year later where he's going see kevdak run there's ac in here isn't there three vex's i mean it's kind of the same which one can they be gold delayed later when they pop out oh shit well in my shoulder blades yeah well it feels that way the seeming on us-- we look like us already
