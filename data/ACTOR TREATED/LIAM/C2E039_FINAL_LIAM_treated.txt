not even paying attention bts monday marisha ray she's seriously working all the time it's a special one incorrect i'll only say one word butts yaas yuan-ti [tv static click] [groovy critical role theme] do i get any jump on that slow spell i tossed out at the last second of the episode yeah i said i start casting slow and you said that's where we'll pick up next week had to ask shut up six here comes that slow spell fastball special mm-hmm what just happened head's off that corpse you can't put it back triplets down to twins you can quit barbarians any time you want tell me when the nein stops screaming clarice things you never want to hear matt say i was rummaging in my pockets for the molasses but everybody is dropping so instead i pull out a burned twig and hold my hand out and cast witch bolt at 3rd-level through the twig towards snakeman that is a 21 okay so that's 3d12 which i have never used in my life i think it's this one the fuck is that that's an 11 plus six is 17 25 lightning damage which i did from the ground i guess so i will stand up now am i within five feet of that guy hey i'm going to run for it i'm going to go toward that pillar there yeah am i able to use shield as a reaction if i've already cast a spell no correct because i've not tried to do that so i don't know if it's allowed per round because as a rogue you could do sneak attack damage and then on an attack of opportunity you could do sneak attack damage oh that hits ooh that's not too bad did all caleb hear with comprehend languages is swear words okay slide that a little bit down yeah not at the moment wait a moment nott have a look around this room do you see anything problematic ja is there anything arcane in nature to the writing on the sides of it or can i ascertain the purpose of it this fountain there's all kinds of people in this world tune into all work no play this friday what holes what are you doing over there i walk over and i nudge her thigh and butt with my foot what are you doing shouting in holes i don't think that is what that is nobody noticed it's a simple thing if we have any kind of wood or maybe some silver or copper coins to shove in like arrow and crossbow bolts and things like that use your noggin or some coins and i could turn them to stone and block up the holes copper it would be stone swords i would imagine i don't know we could shove as many-- i was thinking of jamming it full of a material so it's like a clot and then turning that into stone i can't do that to dead people you know that's not a bad idea because i could burn the flesh and it would fuse yeah well i could definitely inspect this do you want me to do that now though or maybe we are pressed for time we're hanging here because i'm pretty beat up (whispering) you're a dead man arcane recovery i have looked all around the fountain and i'm not able to make anything out are they any seams or visible machinery or cogs or anything maybe matt forgot the quality of lesser restoration that's the fastest way up your butt caleb looks around at everyone doing absolutely nothing and sits down pulls out his book and starts to identify this ring to see if anything's happening five more minutes please there's a yuan-ti woman hanging by her arm off the wall i could do that do we want to do that what's down there eh let me borrow this frumpkin flies just down to the fountain i want to see if i bamf into frumpkin if i can hear anything below at advantage because he's an owl and has advantage over hearing terrible both terrible rolls eight frumpkin's back on your shoulder okay four globules of light lower down to the fountain and look over the side to see what that lights up did you say how far to the bottom it seemed well fjord is nudging at caleb-- in answer to your quiet question i could take the silver thread out and-- i could have helped okay everybody's doing things too quickly that thread will take me ten minutes that's ten minutes if we want to take it travis and jump just down the 40 feet you two are down the two of you you're up at the top of the tower i cast feather fall on him and me and him and yasha on five people choose up to five falling creatures within range i guess i push the two of you as i fall i see him fall and i shove these two off and i go (casting) that's a good one does it burn when you pee your eyes are normally like tea saucers but now they're like full plates are you all right how much have you had from that bottle of yours there's already a merry go round of lights going around nott's head it's like the sun in here five-sided still natural 20 what about entrances and exits nott will you come with me please never mind beau will you come with me please ja they're pouring bloody water down here entrances exits stonework writing i think you said investigation 18 is there any blood in the wicker basket let's hold on a second it's been less than an hour if i put my hand-- oh wait no it hasn't i'm going to start casting comprehend languages again feed me while i'm casting give me ten minutes that's on the tablets right that would punch in the ten minutes i need to cast comprehend so i will retrace all the steps and place my hands on that writing to see if it reveals its meaning to me (foomph) lights floating around oh i didn't know that she sees it because-- oh i didn't know i do a lot of reading of spells and not a lot of paying attention you guys so that's how you see it hey i stole this ring from you oh it echoes in here that is a 16 total that is a 12 eastern wall i feel really good but i know-- wait wait i know that i am not in a good position so somebody come with me to make sure-- blueberry come on yeah i always know where north is so it's one of these ways he said south just now i thought you said south east was the one that we hadn't checked out yet but i don't know which way i am going at the moment so dm which way does my keen addled mind tell me the direction i just went south south this one says the fountain feeds the garden oh we knew that part okay let's keep looking at the-- okay what's this one go to the west ja the garden feeds the warden the warden sounds like a sentient-- ooh i feel good i always know which way north is so let's go east oh this is like a chain and if i wasn't high as fuck i would get it the sacrifice feeds the fountain ja so this is part a of the equation feeds the fountain the fountain feeds the garden the garden feeds the warden the warden feeds the snakes let's go to the last wall the warden guards the false serpent travis and false serpent so there is a false serpent that lives here and we have yet to meet the warden i think we have yet to meet the warden oh you're hurting my ribs i can tell that things are going very poorly so i reach into my pockets and i pull out a bit of iron dust and i go (blowing) and jester doubles in size hey oh you get advantage on strength checks and strength saves right now so you can bust if you're grappled at advantage because of enlarge yeah technically there is vines on jester down below correct i'm just sort of being shaken back and forth by the blue giant and i'm going to-- i'm super high-- throw a fireball down at the vines below simple spell bolt not ball i don't have fireball (combustion) that is a 25 to hit but it's just one so i was scared to go too big and i just go (small zap) it's 2d10 oh level five thank you oh now it's three (panicky drug trip groan) quickly before this runs out also enlarge runs out and we crash on top of jester one minute ooh i will turn your hand into gold that one says-- your toilet guarded by the hemoglobins wow that's almost a matt mercer callout (intoxicated) absolutely (huffs) i can feel my hair growing is there any writing or anything in there they're not-- the warden can take care of itself pressing face against the crack on do you see-- jester wants to know if you see a switch do you need a globule or an owl wow wow wee wee wow wow are you trying it ja anything could happen right here ja let's go unleash the big snake what who who is somebody's dead fjord and yasha are the tallest we put them-- perfect (singing) natural 20 i need to drop acid all the time going into a battle high as fuck is it pitch-black in there or is there a light source a quick pitch would be really good no i'm so high right now but i know that that is not a good-- what is it what is that i cannot do that right now one i have not prepared it two i'm really messed up i could also summon schmidt to carry the keg over-- (growling) i did not bring anything nasty like that i came to be a team player today like i always am captain do you have any-- philip do you have any ranged abilities as a sneaky one ja anything that walks through there has to float above the water or it's going to disturb it and alert-- are you more coherent than me so that you two can attack as one because i have seen you do a lot of damage when the enemy does not know you are coming could you go simultaneously yeah you watch her and when her dupe goes you go and then-- oh there's so many of you right now both of you same time ja caleb yeah (singing) my anaconda don't my anaconda don't wow does the dupe count as an ally though unload it 14 14 in your hand i'm going to push forward through the passage and peek over jester's shoulders i can see this guy partially hidden behind-- it's too early i give a tug to the glove of blasting and i am sending out three scorching rays is it pitch black still there's no-- it's pitch black i have darkvision because of the transmutation stone oh it's totally dark because of what you just did i don't see it at all shit i don't like this balls i'm going to cast-- no i don't know where it is at all yeah so i can't even aim at disadvantage okay what i am going to do is peek around the corner and cast haste on beauregard you're hasted i will step out back into the passage so i'm not in view your dice look really good tonight yeah totally just waiting for the other shoe to drop here not knowing how hadar's works it doesn't pierce that area though right a hydra because of the hadar's speed is doubled what about your extra attack disengage and bolt is each head a creature or is each head a-- never mind ah gott i'm going to lean around the corner and do what i thought i would do before which is to tug on the glove of blasting and fire the three scorching rays natural 20 for the first 18 for the second very high for the third 16 26 35 total i will jump back into the hallway because i'm a coward your ac is two higher she didn't want an attack of opportunity she's not oh i thought she was right up okay fastball special i'm going to do a little bit of a gamble here i peek out again and i drop haste on beauregard and smear molasses across my hand and cast slow on the hydra and his little snakey friend slow they have to beat a 16 they've got bane or the hydra's got bane yeah 16 the bane's on hydra come on motherfucker (whispering) fuck me part of the slow spell is that regardless of the creature's abilities or magic items it can't make more than one melee or ranged attack during its turn it's lost all its head attacks it gets one attack cad i've dropped haste on you i've slowed the hydra it worked yeah with caduceus' bane we got it it almost didn't make it but with bane it made it (as bane) oh hydra caleb's hiding (quietly) don't roll a one can it do that because it can only do one action it's 16 each target must succeed on a wisdom saving throw or be affected by the spell for the duration i'm not seeing that i'm going to look in the book i don't see it it just failed because of bane right 16 he is slowed still so half speed no reactions and it can only do an action or a bonus action not both and only one attack touches up your undercut get it f-jord yes caleb leans up to throw some fire at-- oh fuck fucking-- he pulls out some more molasses and just does the same thing again slow so 16 i only used one 3rd-level and i used it and got it back with the arcane recovery that's two so there's one more so slow dc 16 with bane slow but i only cast it on the hydra so the roll would have been for the hydra because the snake guy was still slowed so i wouldn't have cast it on the snake guy could you say that i only give a fuck about the hydra and that i was aiming at the hydra because that's a hundred percent true the hydra is the big target here okay no i don't want to look at the dice you're the dm whatever you say yeah that sucks i hate to do this can i ask one last question you just tell me to shut the fuck up but i really don't care about the snake guy because he seems weak to me and the spell says i can choose the target so if i only chose the hydra i really don't care about that snake guy he seems on his last legs he seems like a weiner dog it's not radius you can pick whoever you want so if there were like six guys i can say those two guys and not get the rest but if i only aimed at the hydra and didn't aim at the snake guy that roll would have gone to the hydra never mind it's too nitpicky i assumed that it would carry over but you're right it drops and you start afresh good i it's okay now i understand how it works beau's low oh and she's all by herself over there you're with jester's clone but you're between them wow oh jeez okay i'm not within range of it right because there's a tunnel here i killed it you saw it i'm backing up as far as i can go i need to see it i'm going to cast fire bolt at one of its heads what if i stand next to jester instead and risk my life half cover that's fine that's what i'm doing okay so that's regular and that is a 21 to hit i'm using fire b-- yes fucking dragonballing that shit does the hydra have nads when i'm in melee with something well i would know that let's pretend like i knew that so it's disadvantage no matter what right disadvantage so i got to roll again the first was 21 the second was much worse 11 not a good day for caleb i'm in range now right okay i'm good yes i'm staying if i run it's going to hit me so i'm just going stay put nobody's allowed to learn at the table he's focused on us i have this hydra miniature at home and when i get home i'm going to go to my office and i'm going to throw him into the neighbors yard there's the oni the giant red dragon just a few more decades and you'll have mastered this game that's the game save us yasha she's so strategic fucking swede one very important question-- am i still high as balls i had some words for jamedi in the middle of my drug high but it would have been glorious so like a medium range roll like a 1516 17-- hit the hydra killed beau
