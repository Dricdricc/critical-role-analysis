elves or men vax'ildan learned at a young age to skip past formality preferring instead to invite himself in your door along with twin sister vex'ahlia vax was born by a chance encounter between elven royalty and human peasantry raised by their mother in their early years the twins were eventually sent off to their father in the elven capital of syngorn but their cool reception among the elves there never warmed and their time in the capital didn't last the siblings stole away one autumn night and set out on the open road after a few years of wandering they eventually decided to return to their mother and journeyed back to the lands of their youth but instead of finding their childhood home they returned to a pile of rubble their mother was gone their home burned to ash pressing the townspeople for answers they learned of the day the dragon came (roar) with their ties all severed vax'ildan and his sister set out to find their fortune together in tal'dorei an outsider since birth vax quickly learned to solve life's challenges in his own particular way often by side-stepping them entirely and when his knack for circumventing adversity isn't enough (knife scraping) the way of blades the elves schooled him in more than makes up the difference come on guys one time offer you're going to let it slip through your fingers it's just so crazy it might work classic dwarven fundraising technique make me a glass of that grog what about a steampunk rocket pack for the bear oh he fell right off the front look at the guns on that gnome hey dm since vax has nothing really to prepare ever and he's in obviously peak physical condition i'm going to spend the trip helping keyleth and if she needs any ingredients for whatever she's doing i'll go get them i'll hold things up for her i'm just going to hang out and try to help her get things done i'm hard to pin down that's the best part (garbled) 26 26 aw i've got to turn on twitch so i can see it well the twitch the twitch is up (gasps) this is like that jabba's cruiser game that came out anybody anybody 20 20 all right i'm running up right behind my sister's shoulder and because of my assassinate perk i have advantage on this because they haven't gone yeah so i'm going to click my boots of haste as i come up behind her and dagger-dagger-dagger over her shoulder i'll use my brand-new dagger of life-stealing for the first time that was a 19 which is a critical hit for me okay well i had advantage for assassinate and disadvantage for the distance so that brings me down to even my first roll was a 19 which is still a critical hit for me they haven't gone yet throwing over my sister's shoulder so-- so here we go rolling dice in jersey it's wonderful that makes ten so that's a 20 for that and i'm going to start slinging the other two daggers first one probably misses it's a 14 well i don't know do these all get advantage all three are before they go all right so then actually that was a 20 okay that is an eight and the third dagger goes (wa-shing) right over vex's shoulder for a 27 this one is the poison dagger of course so that is ten of damage and then it's a dc of 15 for poison i'm happy not simon come on tiberius it all sounded like enya to me come on tibber-hoods buck buck thanks easter bunny he's falling so slowly getting flashes of holy grail here sprinter's boots

sneak attack damage 13 sneak attack damage so that's 11 plus 13 first dagger second dagger gets a 26 hits that is a ten of damage and the third dagger gets a 16 it does it does very nice oh well did
