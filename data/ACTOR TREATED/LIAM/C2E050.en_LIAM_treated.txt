splice it all together the nose hole is right in his sternum matteo is a mad genius that's not happening here he is a cat no but i have this rag over one of my-- it's dim but maybe you and i can stand near the middle yeah but we need to weigh the risks we are facing and nott's husband there are also people behind us topside who'd kill us for this as well if we are lucky we will overtake them before we return to their home i have a question for you jester you know how you have just turned yourself into the oversized honey badger could you do that to a giant worm but say turn it into a cow ja rather than trying to whack away at a gigantic worm maybe you just make it harmless but not so little that it loses its new form yeah a goat i think something small is likely to get smacked and taken out of its newer form it would need to be something that could take a bit of punishment like that or a cow everybody's doing it well i will tell you it's in the book has any of the crystal been broken away by the worm's passage through here does any of it look of value as a rare stone 16 i'm going to scoop up a handful of them make it the same color as the crystals that are here and then i can also set an alarm around us for us yeah but not from the outside i can camouflage it to match this room yeah so it's not such a perfect round surface if we leave an area where we can pop our heads out if need be did you say you were going to carve a hole to put it inside of or should i make it against the side of the chamber okay i take out my book and i slap it down on the stone surface of this chamber we are in i take about ten minutes and then there is a hemisphere that is the same color as the chamber around us as soon as that is done i then take out the silver thread and i start making a little white picket fence that's not actually a picket fence in front of that i also send frumpkin out of the hut to sit in the shadows of the chamber and i tell him to come and wake me up if he hears anything coming further than the perimeter of the alarm legitimate question because i don't want to dick with the story you're weaving but does keen mind cut through that it won't mean anything to them they'll be-- frumpkin also skips up nott's back and snuggles in grips her clothing with her claws-- his claws damn my original cat-- and scarfs around nott's neck mage armor 30 we've been traveling for miles though that's true i know which way is north it's that way no but the whole time we've been walking i've been conscious of which direction north is in from where we are-- i don't know if i can because i can only see from this little bit of dim light but where from this chamber the worm continued on straight through can't see the other side maybe gave it a run-around in here like a dog in a dog park ja but how much time do you need to dig up this cave ropers oh my gosh we are in the kill zone y'all i would be by the largest grouping of people because i'm scared of everything this is real bad well you don't know i don't know 12 for caleb yeah shield does not hit yeah that hits caleb says (whimpering apprehensively) and she's smiling on you is that all the 12s is that all the 12s in a row one handed caleb gets the molasses out and starts smearing it and casting-- i'm going too late and i cast slow on both of them 16 wisdom yeah he can do one thing per round now while that's up yeah it just brought all those tentacles down to one thing per round fails a negative two penalty to ac and dexterity saving throws can't use reactions it can use either an action or a bonus action not both (pained yelling) i'm getting the molasses everywhere ooh it was almost a one and then it was better negative two ac and dex saves we're on the move ja hup hup hup i'm going to keep my eyes behind us where we just ran away from it's a minute duration okay magic missiles i said magic missiles but i don't have that prepared so i'm going to throw fire bolt at it natural 20 18 for me 18 total say goodnight grimace everybody's in a line shaking their heads at this thing should we look for their babies how's that tunnel coming need it a lot did i mention i'm a monk and pavement dancing lights is up we can do the same oh it's-- hold on a second i can't remember almost there ten-foot radius yeah we'll repeat everything and i will send frumpkin up ahead of us 50 feet to stay up all night as a guard to come running back in if need be 17 for frumpkin also all throughout the day once an hour caleb says it's 200 an hour goes by-- it's 300 an hour later ding-dong ding-dong it's 400 you took a lot of courage to go in i was not very helpful in that regard either you did not tell us what was going on why would you you still went in for a long time so sorry oh it's nine o'clock ah six good cat you're bored really look at this frumpkin gets up onto his hind legs and does a little-- (laughter) you know you are a very good reader you give it a lot of character do they bear any resemblance to the giant hole that we were following oh behind us how high off of the ground is that hole we can bail if we wanted to perhaps well not going to xhorhas and getting murdered by far greater forces-- -- but i think we're going to xhorhas there is really only one reason to use the side tunnels to leave you can do that anywhere only if we wanted to give up which we are not doing so we go forward quite a ways but if he gets too far away i no longer have the ability to communicate with him ja okay sure ja but advantage with smell if there's anything stinky put the ribbon on the backside so it's not right in his eyes for the first ten seconds frumpkin goes-- (laughter) but gets used to it and then trots off i did i rolled twice so it's a 16 perception is there any immediate reaction to a glowing cat entering into this big chamber i can't hear anybody how many chambers are-- is it just many many-- i'm just watching i can no longer send commands i can only go along for the ride to watch am i seeing anything like mining equipment okay okay i leave him there and come out of it well it's a good walk a ways and then there is a larger chamber with many different exits to it and my good boy saw some sort of creature in a cage wuh hard to tell yeah or this is an old abandoned place you know i don't know what the right thing to do is because if we keep following this tunnel we could roll right up into their backyard where they ended their journey walk right into them however we don't really know where this place is going we don't know how far it is from where your husband is going to be we don't know what dangers are above us however we could come in and try to find him not walking directly into their line of sight right into their face or their butt or what-have-you i don't know what the right thing to do is that is a good point we didn't take the side with frumpkin just confusion that's fine well he knows to come back in five minutes if he does not hear from me so we have to wait about how far away from me has frumpkin gone at this point 30 or so feet (snaps fingers) pull him back i don't know if they saw him or not he is glowing matt and (fwoomp) little lizard people down that way and they saw my cat i will take the other side of it and do the same thing oh a 17 i pull out a small little stone pyramid in my hand and mutter a few words and then cast tongues and speak to this little thing that's the best did i hear something like look at these motherfuckers out there wait just to specify from up where frumpkin just was from that direction or multiple directions they're in the honeycombs in the ceiling right yeah mage armor we have come to speak i say in whatever language i now understand and speak oh i made it very clear and held my hand we have come through to chase a large serpent through these caves and eradicate it easy we are here looking for a scourge in these mountains oh boy we mean you no harm we wish to pass through in draconic saying-- well through the spell i am one meal but my friends can make more food than me i am-- i take two steps forward okay two steps forward-- that's an 11 i only take this as a minor setback we can still work this out you do not want to tangle with the spirits i command i snap my fingers and frumpkin appears and four globules of light float in a circle around frumpkin intimidation that's a 19 you will be cursed for decades you expect me to hand over one of my own this cat will burn you-- burn you all no it's in drac-- well i don't know i'm speaking through a spell so-- so we're all on the same page oh that's excellent frumpkin stands and does that little-- the fey king is growing angry with you and the globules of light start to spin a little quicker is that 1d6 do you know who is caged up aways down this tunnel oh it's in this room oh i see got it i tell you what do you want this creature i will make one last offering to you i will give you the fey king in exchange for this creature here deception you said 16 he will bring blessings to your people okay take the f-- okay telepathically i tell frumpkin i'll bring you back in one day buddy in my head and he trods forward we have food the creature in the cage i pick it up sure but i'm not zooming into him right now (swoosh) oh i just jumped into the fey king really quick to see if anything was happening let's lead them away from the pack i have not done that yet-- point of clarification are we travelling through worm tunnel at this point okay which is how wide again ten-- ten feet across ja thank you i don't think we need to pull up the dome right now is nott out of our sight playing the long game the long con oh my god long con 79 walking towards the noise ja the second one ran off down the hall a bit and simultaneously i am casting enlarge on nott the brave show us a demonstration and we will induct you to the mighty nein leeches come on no damn it yeah i have a question for you my little friend do you eat enough under your current leadership we will keep your belly full if you travel with us you will have never eaten so much in your life but we do need a guide down here and you could be that guide oh that is less appealing not the bees not the bees and in your 11 days what is the worst thing you have ever seen down here plus he's near the end of his life we might as well show him great things going to eat better than he ever has we could let him look at the dodecahedron or leave it in the bag i'm just kidding forget it that's a bad idea it's funny but it's not wise d&d happiness and sadness tied together this is the best this is the best it's like a dune suit man you can't let that shit go to waste reduce reuse recycle you said citadel we are seeing a fortress down here okay caleb starts walking slowly back through the entire walking formation that spurt was quick but potent well fuck y'all because i rolled a two that's a four for me there's a delayed reaction out in the lobby because he's so awesome does caduceus see that or everybody have i ever read-- i've read a lot-- about fire giants under the earth yes ja my grandmother used to keep me up late at night reading me stories about things like this no i don't know anything i don't know i know about the history of the country i grew up in not about underground fortresses let's put a pin in that and get back to it i was speaking in metaphor perkins you are such a fun player jeez such a 180 from shale when you were here the last time yeah that's a dude double fisting full on-- maybe they will go to sleep eventually maybe we can come back a little later yeah if we are crazy enough to start a fight with these two-- but if we do the bubble is a good idea although i have to stay in the bubble for the bubble to be in effect what about this what if fjord does that distraction we talked about across the fire you banished that stone creature i know how to do that as well if you and i both take a shot at the one on our side one of us maybe will succeed and while they are all debating this i channel a little bit of transmutive energy into my stone and change its focus from constitution to fire resistance for myself not today i didn't study that last night yeah it's you two you are the quickest a plan i'm the odd man out no there are many things i could do but i did not do my homework last night that would facilitate those things jester bring the haversack over open it up so that beauregard can focus on the mote of possibility just look into the bag just like huffing gasoline it's in the bag beauregard's face goes into another dimension for a moment yes you keep all your thoughts look there's the creative lead of dungeons & dragons over there you take all the stat adjustments except for your brains in there so all your decision making is the same but dexterity saves and stuff that's the creature's stats right just imagine if jester had teleported away and went with sprinkle and caleb is just going uh beauregard is now noah's ark very heavy metal one 20 aw they're clanging it's probably ten or 15 hey i'll do it caleb leans out the passageway and casts polymorph on the giant it is 16 i believe 16 wisdom it's a cow you call yourself a dungeon master jesus oh my god one well wait no there's no natural ones in initiative that's a three if anyone attacks the cow i'm going to beat you up in the lobby tonight don't do it (like yasha) a cow killed my wife yeah it's concentration usain bolt just comes (swoosh) (barking poofing) princess bride moment holy shit just powder it's going to moo-ve speed 40 feet is what the internet is telling me just let it happen just let it happen take 30 points of cow damage that just means you're going to bilbo baggins your way across this bridge motherfucker laura and don't kill my goblin matthew ja i'm going to lean out i'm going to extend my middle finger to the giant on the bridge mutter a few arcane words around my hand and cast banishment 16 charisma components are an item distasteful to the target so for my movement i am going to just take a step not back in but to the side actually and i will walk-- to the other side of the dog yeah right there yeah and i'm just looking for nott come on la come on fuck our culture oh man this is what happened the last time we went to the underdark taliesin and it's just where these people live man but they are really gorgeous to look at yeah hats off great books it took several days of pike giving me good mojo to heal holy shite don't you take my goblin mom away it's going to be around 45 what's your full hp oh shit it's got to be low then to survive that so what i did last time did not work so i am going to change tactics and i am going to cast instead polymorph on the same giant-- yeah a giant octopus 16 wisdom he has a movement of ten i'm going to move back into the-- nope i'm going to stay right there that was a lot caleb's standing like a doofus because he didn't want to leave nott so he's still out there just make him mad to keep it occupied the octopus is going nowhere ooh meniscus tear ten feet of movement what okay i don't think so it's just that unless it gets hit lasts for the duration or until the target drops to zero hit points-- for an action i will disengage and juke left-right and run into the hole chris join us at the table
