let's have a heart-to-heart i didn't answer any of them i just left it and took a walk what color will you be next week yeah i don't have an announcement but i have a bit of a surprise this is a little bit early because my sister and i share a birthday on the 28th however it's a big month for birthdays i'm a little worried about the next episode or two if we're going to survive or not so the gift that i have i want to make sure you have it now just in case it's very timely ryan if you please i don't know maybe have some padding or mattresses out the first time you use it i also thought it would look nice in the house i'm a big fan of all your decisions keep making them whatevs you're welcome and then grog was here reality is very malleable i have an odd question for you do you know of anyone still in the city who would know their way about the sewers it's fine so much better alive than dead hey a rare ray of sunshine from the dm today hey i remember this place wow i mean i can do it if you want to that key has seen a lot of miles and the hole in the roof could i get up it all right eh 14 hear anything see anything inside there's a window there's nothing in front of it you want to come in the window you just broke a chaise lounge but come in is there a basement here pike how much you got of that old man hey pike's at disadvantage for the rest of the day is there food yeah grog how long do you reckon we have before your cousin wants to either talk or get busy yeah seeing as we might be tangling with a black dragon tomorrow an old one i think maybe that stuff off you're talking about-- no i don't think it's a good idea but if it should happen-- if we get i wanted to say railroaded into it but i don't know what that is we'll probably need every bit of edge we can get so i actually agree with you for the moment percival we should stop by this house i mean it's a big conversation that we should have the where-when-how is pretty huge he's drunk grandfather let me carry that for you before you drop it i'll keep it safe i'll keep it safe for you you don't want the head to fall off it i subtly pick up the head from the ground roll for initiative sam (wilhand voice) wine cellar i think we need to maybe have a talk about what we're doing before finding your friend you're talking about mr d i know yeah right it's a good idea but i think we need to figure out what we're doing first i have no fucking clue he's dead he's not going to do it except for this one yeah there's a lot to think about there are a lot of people still here and i personally don't think attacking that dragon in the next few days is a wise decision but if we do leave what do we do with these people they're going to be run over by these people are we going to have this discussion right here in the street how are we going to deal with one of the largest dragons we've ever seen in the air what are 40 goliaths going to do with something 500 feet above us spitting bile from above you've got a day and a half maximum do you think your cousin would hold for a couple more days could he see the sense of planning that longer well that's what grog pitched to them anything we do here anything we do to that dragon anything we do in the city is likely to be known by the other wyrms so if we kill that dragon what do the other dragons do in that moment and are we ready to take on thordak right now absolutely but are we going to try to kill the black and then go on a hunt for all these-- we've run from them if we kill it now we're going to have to be-- if we kill it now all the others are going to punish the people they're sitting upon and we're not ready to go dragon to dragon to dragon like that they're going to know that something challenged his power and there are going to be consequences for it they'll make a display of their strength we will we will it's-- investigation or is it-- perception is normally what i've done for traps isn't it all right 27 oh he's dead (grog voice) it's a little brave running around i need a minute everybody everybody hang back just for a second yeah vex'ahlia could you come here yeah this is a death box this room is a death box and i have a keen eye but i wouldn't mind another set i'd like us both to look around no i said come inside yeah come in aww you're my bestie all right i'm going to start looking around for traps well you know your music does calm and soothe me-- 24 bullshit bullshit lotta bullshit all right guys i think it's safe to come into the first room so you said because i was being a jackass and saying bullshit what was the description you just gave let's not split up let's do this together like a nintendo cartridge i'm fine i got a 20 ooh that's not solid at all look put your foot through that i'm going to get down on my knees and stick my head through the stairs-- i know but can i see-- i pull my head up what can i see at the top of the stairs is there a landing okay is there any stray furniture around are there any shitty pillows or anything i totally ignore my sister which is what i've done half my entire life and i stick my head down and i let it go and watch it go down the slide hey y'know it wasn't fun but it was educational shithead and i walk over and stop at the edge of the stairs going down you said there were stairs going down same thing i want to see-- could you help me over here wise-arse you are very smart and wise you know we could be dead tomorrow do you want to keep arguing with me like this yeah i got higher than that 26 d'you know the last time i saw something like that the carpet was fucked do you think wilhand would have any idea-- yeah the-- no the other carpet what an interesting idea yeah you did it wrong see nothing happened (laughter) well so did we never talk about that yeah a bunch of us were riding it-- ah it was the dwarf i swear it was the dwarf we were on the carpet and there were runes on the walls and as soon as we got near the runes the carpet went (raspberry noise) and fell down well it could do that it could also-- i don't know anything about magic but i assume it could burn us well (sighs) i mean hey shorty you're our best bet here i don't know anything about this shit what's that one it's a 20 on the floor good because it's not that good good job pike you don't want to go up there's no up up is ouchie oh i thought you said it went to the ceiling you got the fancy broom exactly i've seen you take other people can i hang off the bottom of that thing can you carry me up i'm lighter than you look at my constitution it's very low this is stupid (grunts) i'm checking for traps this is a family thing please keep out (laughter) thank you under the bed in the bed around the bed 23 i take three steps back away from my sister you're so good at all my tricks are you sure you are extremely talented and you're going to get better and better every day all right i take five more steps backward (laughter) hey man i don't want to harsh your mellow good job that's a good job and aside from traps is there any like paintings with eyeholes cut in it for peeking or little holes in the wall what percy does it have a false bottom the chest c'mon don't leave me hanging what the hell you've always got to check it for a false bottom you didn't say shit hmmm i didn't hear the words 'false bottom' out loud that's right you're smart i think you're right you know what else we don't need to argue like this yeah why're you always busting my balls then i'm sure it is but y'know getting hit in the nuts hurts is it though is it really well investigation again 20 there was more than one room though right you said-- okay let's take that key downstairs as you said i don't want to sit behind you i'll hang from it again it's gross oh yeah i'll go a little ways ahead checking for traps past-- i'll go up to the sigil oh shite i don't know but i will have a high-- 23 i love you matt so much (laughter) now i know three-point landing okay we're fine you know what appreciate your rogues is all i'm saying am i right or am i right stakeout --a keyhole wait wait wait wait-- yes yes we will but hold on can i have a look at it can you have a look at it we'll just take a look and then you do it shut up back there it's easy to make mistakes 20 shit well sort of yeah yeah yeah not us not us i'm going to see if i can see any traps inside the room yeah doesn't matter 20 wait scanlan would you and your light-footed friend like to join me in here yeah i don't want to touch anything in here i don't see any traps-- have at it and i back up with grog's dead dad yeah don't we have that neverending rope let's do it like 200 times around i'll help her out and we'll go back and back and all around i grab-- in my bag i have the charcoal that i once painted half a beard on grog with and i use it to draw a little curly mustache on it yeah i'm more comfortable drawing mustaches on it than i am dickering with its power source i look at the crystal admire it go dink-dink with a knuckle can i inspect the chest of this creature like it's a trap 20 what's it made of is it metal or stone is there any way to open it from the front okay i add a little pointy beard on the bottom of his chin into the corner face the corner for a minute but you know let's go kill the dragon before we get the rest of these things because that's a good idea that's no fun i swivel out a dagger and cut right below the knot wait wait one second one second we tied it around a lot of times hold on look at that mustache can it do a double-bird a what keyleth is this something you're going to want to do in the long term so if we're going to go to the trouble of taking this thing out of here one of us has to use it what about your pom-pom or-- what did you call him i doubt it ooh i have an invention idea could you build a little gnome chair for either scanlan or pike or wilhand on the back of it i don't get that reference but i think you feel me i feel like quall didn't really think this through does it fly we're talking about your mansion door hey buddy whatcha doing over there also i lost a hitpoint when he flicked me in the nuts nothing nothing sure buddy sure sure yes yeah i'll see you guys later i'd like to throw in and say that i don't want to fight the dragon tomorrow all right let's go wait wait i run back to the door really quick kiki c'mere c'mere c'mere can you do that mend-y thing still this is her pom-pom pop-pop i dunno glue the head back on yeah glue the head back on and then i chase after scanlan i'm pretty good i've watched my sister do it you know that my name is vax right sort of i do have really good eyes do you want me to have a look let's have a look let's go could we do it together could i help him give him advantage your forearms are like popeye motherfucker i-- well let's see if she left any-- my sister looks for tracks you really should've brought my sister i'm going to check for tracks survival check okay well tracks footprints i said tracks i'm not looking for traps we're in the sewer tracks 17 i'm concentrating on the mud i hold my foot over one is it smaller than mine or is it about the same size yeah okay well i mean they would've washed away if they were old so probably pretty new let's follow them i clearly am (laughter) yeah i'll lead the way yeah okay 33 30 qu-iet quiet so we're in a larger chamber and it's in the middle and are there any of the footprints left anywhere i reach down and i scoop scanlan up in football pose again which way do you want to go i can't tell which way your daughter reach deep man shh don't move i'm going to set you down all right i think your daughter done killed a-- oogedyboogedy sit down it's dead 12 i already asked that is there any blood or ooze walking away i mean dripping away from there and where were they going where did you tell them to go do i know where that is which direction that is down here sort of like this or is it vertical and what do we see past the bars 12 i think she got outta here pal but she's not here she's better off no no don't worry about it you want to talk about it i believe that too i knew she would be taken care of and i wasn't sure about you you're very entertaining and i would be sad to see you go what do you mean well-- there's no right or wrong but next time i'll be all right you help people more in need than me and i'll be all right i don't know any of your fancy you know fluh-duh-duh but-- there is no ranger like me this is stupid we should go back yeah i mean we don't have big man with us and i don't want to run into any of his third cousins or whatever so yeah might as well p90x with fassbender (laughter) it's like an improv show salty mcfucknuts (laughter) y'know while he looks that up let me point out that when i punched percy in the face there were zero points of hitpoint damage (laughter) yes yes i did punch him yeah metal rods and nightcrawler going-- (robotic voice) whatever keyleth wants keyleth gets disintegrate beam straight on how will he do zingers now (slow-mo voice) we're slow bet he can't tell us all about the nature of politics tell it it's like our first game ever just a minor thing on the walk back in the sewer i would like to slowly just in case some of these assholes want to fight a dragon tomorrow i slowly start attuning to acidic damage instead of fire okay if we can ever find a store open in a city that's not destroyed we can sell this stuff back to the clasp big man what are we going to do in the morning when we get up if we can talk to them but we have to talk to them much to my own chagrin i'm in perfect agreement with frederick von whatsitface de rolo de whatsit by a bit can i roll stealth and hide right now (laughter) 28 i'm gone do we have any alore root (laughter) i'm going back to my room i'm not eating yeah (old-man voice) try the chicken sorbet i don't have a plan but while they're all dicking about after about an hour of staring at the wall i start talking to the air and say you know i've never put much stock in faith and for the life of me i question so much why my sister took that broom and i can't figure out another reason for her to have done it other than fate for i would not be standing here nor would anyone else in my family so you weren't my first choice but i'm over that and i'm ready i will come to you as soon as i am able i don't know how any of this works i'm coming whatever we need to do i don't know what i believe but i made a promise and i'm sticking to it and i'm coming to you so just hang on i go to bed i tuck it behind my ear that's some reincorporation right here wherever grog goes we go as well i'm a head taller talk to me make time blade out those dragons are going to find you and me and everyone in this room whether we fight them now or later the only stupid thing we can do is separate ourselves from each other-- yeah keep twitching twitchy i don't want to fight this dragon today either but stupider than that is splitting this group of powerful motherfuckers apart i'd rather walk away from here i'd rather take everyone out of this city and build our strength and come back and hobble this beast but the stupidest thing you could do right now is separate yourself from the herd you make yourself weaker you don't have them to protect you while you're in the fields alone while that dragon belches shit on you from above you're strong these fucking guys are strong we need to be smart your strength is shit compared to that dragon shit the only difference between you and us is that we want to actually kill this thing you want to be a prick have fun melting in (trails off) acid-- and they're gone would three days be better than one percival where're you going brainiac
