if we use that scroll to go to him now or kill him on his home turf and kill him for real can i make a religion check there also still acid and repeat history scanlan i have a notion but you are very close to him i kneel at his head and shoot out the wings and lend them to percival like the crow he is like a cloak oh well i cast lay on hands and take him out of that right away ten hit points no

sexy though and you are so invulnerable to everything what if-- no what give him this i'm considering giving you my cloak instead no my cloak displacer cloak he doesn't need anything he's got a thousand hit points yeah all of these what time is it shaun nine percival you should go to bed yeah pictures you like pictures scanlan oh it's a pop-up book (laughter) oh jarett this is kynan kynan has been telling me that he wanted to help protect whitestone he hasn't anywhere to live he needs something to do with his time and he has a fire in his belly and wants to serve are you all right those are called words grog it's true but percy needs to go the fuck to sleep seriously jack him up first you're outvoted percy go to bed nobody wants to talk to you right now we want you to go to sleep we're going to go have a drink and have a fabulous time we'll see you in the morning jarett shaun can you get away kynan come on well i'm not taking him with us to draconia or anywhere no i might like to have pike take a look at him in the morning but i think so and i clocked him it's so worth it i get three drinks at the bar and i walk past keyleth and leave one on the table by her and go and sit down by kynan i want to show you something i bought these months ago and i root around in my pack and i pull out the three finely made daggers that i bought she's right they were expensive i'm actually not going to give them to you tonight because you're worrying me a little bit but in a day or two these are yours i bought these for you months ago i looked for you i visited the butcher shop and i missed you i'm very sorry about that i wish that this had not i wish this had not played out the way it had you can atone it is not too late i see the look in your eye it is not too late you fucked up clearly big time and you can either curl in on yourself and rot in a ball or you can make up for it you know what's going on in tal'dorei you know what's going on i spent too much time looking inward it's pointless be of use i'm going to use luck that is a 17 i was kind of a dick that's all any of us can do you're battered you're not broken do better drink up (singing) turn down for pike (singing) wait for the brain vax paid attention to that entire conversation what is it taliesin would you like this to be in your voice my friends i have just taken an audience with the raven queen who has snuffed any hope of my redemption for which i am truly grateful with new clarity i can finally see my life as a series of compounding poor choices there was nothing i could have done to save my family yet i still sold my soul in search of vengeance later i allowed ripley to leave knowing full well she was a greater threat to the world than the briarwoods would ever be i traded the world's safety for the belief that i could murder my way to peace that if i could be a greater horror it would bring my family back once this lie was shattered i scrambled to find a solution to make a deal to undo my mistakes and balance the scales i now understand that there are no scales there is no redemption and no ledger that judges me good or evil i am free to simply be myself and live with the terrible mistakes i've made tomorrow i start upon a new path beyond the gods and demons who have tormented me and it's your friendship that makes this possible though a shadow lingers the need for vengeance is gone i will try and do my best for you all i will strive to buy the future more time free of my legacy i will stand against the children of my madness in hope rather than in anger and if you are reading this then my travels on this path have come to an end scanlan thank you for destroying my gun do not let the weight of life's consequences crush your bravado it is your greatest weapon grog remember that your compassion has brought you this far not just strength for the record i would have wiped the floor with you that time vax you often remind me of myself and yes i know that that is a bit of an insult stop indulging your desire to sacrifice and try being the man that these two women seem to think you are they may actually need you one day vex you often remind me of myself and that is the highest of compliments oh true to form percival true to form i hope you free yourself of whatever voices haunt you also since i'm gone you're the clever one now still the clever one keyleth don't let the world break you learn to forgive it for not living up to your standards we promise to try harder pike it is wonderful to have you home you bring everyone closer to their best selves and i can only imagine what a burden that must be oh she's out allow yourself some vice and failure done and done they'll still love you just the same all true as to what must be done i'd be content to be left in a ditch my weapons and notes burnt and broken fucker but i imagine that would upset cass if you can take me home if you can't i understand she knows where to find the rest of my instructions times being what they are burn my work or bring it home in the hopes of aiding in the defense of whitestone i leave this judgment in your capable hands please find ripley before she does too many terrible things and erase my legacy wherever you find it that silence would be the greatest eulogy i could ever hope for oh dear with eternal gratitude percival of vox machina yeah that's a very highbrow kind of humor it's hilarious i promise it's hilarious yeah it means stuffy boring boring humor that's a good point i balance a tray on top of pike's prone form and put some cups on top of it i put a tray on top of the cups on top of the first tray that's percival up and down there's nothing really that surprising in the letter really more cups on top of the second tray that's right third tray no problem 24 i stand and admire my own work hey did you know that i'm-- what you are drunk you are very drunk yeah grog you want to pick up pickle and let's go get some sleep turn down for what cucumber sandwiches let's throw it back and go out with it ooh you fucking machiavelli wow look at that little boy smile he's so pleased wow
