one-way ticket they're all from lillith for a little arcane booty call traveling back to the archmage the ritual is completed and the phylactery destroyed in time but not without some lingering necromancy branded within grog they are suddenly approached by the mysterious elf again saying his master is unhappy with the broken contract and he demands that either the debt be paid or the party complete a more difficult contract in its place the party accepts and heads into the shade barrow an ancient druid burial chamber that was purchased and renovated by an eccentric lord who made it his own tomb fighting the denizens of the barrow they locate the tomb and the iron golem guarding it successfully defeating the golem they tear the arcane cortex from its chest and return it to drez to square their debt after a bit of r and r a clean-shaven dwarf named grimthorne propositions the group to enter a nearby underground fighting ring even offering to represent them the party agrees and not surprisingly manages to pull off a victory with the holiday of winter's crest arriving the town bustles with preparation for a festival during which a strange blue crystal is delivered in the name of archmage eskil this crystal suddenly detonates freezing the entire populace of westruun in ice-- though the party is protected by a sudden ally in the streets in a last-ditch arcane effort a mystic merchant named noja manages to shield the group from harm and where the crystal previously rested now stood a pale nude woman of white hair and frail physique she opens a portal and leaps through the party giving chase into what seems like an icy frozen world chaotic and elemental in nature they catch up to the woman who then reveals her true self a great white dragon weakened by her premature rebirth the party manages to defeat her and upon returning to westruun discover its people released from their icy prison with the archmage eskil ryndarien now on trial for the attack on westruun the party intercedes and proves his innocence in thanks eskil uses his talents to investigate the source of the blue crystal revealing the powerful society of thieves known as the clasp responsible for its delivery vax having previously been a member of the clasp knows the main headquarters lies within the capital city of emon and vox machina sets out for the west we love you wendy right here can
