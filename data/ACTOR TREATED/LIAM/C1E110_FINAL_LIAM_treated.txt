bauza is funny as fuck with bauza at the table any celebrity could show up he can impersonate anybody anybody oh there's some stuff in the store okay go to geek and sundry's dot com whatever the store is we should probably re-announce the art book that we're making there's an art book that's happening it's going to hit in the fall at some point it's amazing we've seen it we've held an approximation of it it's beautiful and as long as we're vamping i've seen some of that comic book man it's looking good it's under the table in my bag it looks so good we're behind his meniscus right aren't we in his knee oh real close to the butt yeah we're doing something we're going to fuck around brian and i are chatting about it you'll be naked i'm going to be bringing in a bag of bazooka joe comics from the gum i'm sure there are critters in space-x boy let me tell you what i had for lunch today i will jaeger pike grog and vex it will be fine titties let's do it i did a very good job with merchandise if she weren't controlling it would there still be even though it's dangerous some air i'll be up front pike will walk right in front of grog because we don't know what part of this is the titan's butt and earth but some of it could have been made by cannibal dwarves at some point i'm going to assume i'm looking for traps and listening for undead cannibal dwarves that is a 27 speak rammstein and enter it's in the grab bag it's an option we're playing pike we are we're the pike jaegers you can do the impression and i will sort through the pages pike needs to do it too right 13 for the other gnome how far away is it i'm going to creep up 20 feet in front of everybody else divine sense which is specific to undead location not vague if there's any within 60 feet i'll use one so it's leading up to a plateau i'm going to scuttle up and look over 41 this is old news guys this is old news this is what i get to do yeah i turn around to group and do like a-- and then i go down over stealthing along the way i was as well the twins were scrabbling at the rock wait matt wait 19 pike rolled a one does pike's mace of disruption always shed bright light for 20 feet we've been in here under an hour probably not much time left but under an hour right since we arrived okay how high is the ceiling in this tunnel 12 feet i will float above everybody in the space above their heads we can fudge it probably between percy and pike if we can manage it and i'm going to dagger dagger dagger with sharpshooter on all three the one right below me next to keyleth okay the first one is a 20 okay second one is balls and the third one is 20 and because assassin and they haven't gone yet-- oh i have advantage because of assassin so sneak attack also next to keyleth multiple reasons for sneak attack so that is 11 plus psychic damage is 15 (counting) 36 for the first one and then the last one does a rinky-dink one because off-hand attack doesn't get any-- yeah just one and i'll stay floating no modifier that's the modifier that's calculated from dexterity oh so two and 20 more for the sharpshooter what you're sucked in the ground no yeah vax sees that and is not worried (laughter) dang perce he vanished should've seen the green so that's why vax's feathers were prickling the other time what about between grog and scanlan that way if one of them comes up by either of them she's there punch the mace and light that shit up blow hair out of her face (singing) fucking die about 20 feet can i move ten feet closer to scanlan and do the classic van damme movement and stand between stalactites in the ceiling and hide with my bonus action yeah and hide in the ceiling nah i'm just using my feet for that no my hands are occupied with my feet yeah stealth check yeah baby ten do i still have sneaky sneak from you that's fine pike get out of the way 27 and i'll hold my attack action oh yeah that's right right he's dead right before the end of the story sorry perce they come out where did they go that is my daughter's miniature oh shit light them up 50 feet we have a nice dm that's in range for me 24 am i effectively sneak attacking the fool no all right cool sharpshooter for both 28 and 26 for me 38 combined for my two my paladin attacks that's a pretty fucking killer twin moment right there you're at your most dashing when you use your sword okay you do it it is a big seven it means he gave it rum tongue is it like reaching into a sack for you even though it's the earth what's this thing on the ground can you throw her and it would be an action to chuck her though right i mean we could drop her where the thing disappeared it's still a crapshoot but it's better than nothing drop me on the ground keyleth okay she is going to still just hold her turn-- she could do it on herself just in case yeah cast resistance on herself in case-- instead she's going to look at the ground and go monstah and hold her mace there is weird energy at this table no no (laughs) didgeridoos travis and sam when everyone leaves all their stress will enter you and i i'm going to fly over and land on keyleth's shoulder and hold my attack for as soon as the fucknut appears perch dagon and she'll use divine whatsit divine strike once a round plus 2d8 do it again yeah and if it's still standing dagger dagger dagger she does an underswing right up between its legs and hits it in the goolies she gives it three or four more hits on the ground out of frustration yep i place my hand on scanlan's shoulder and say i'm sorry i know this is hard for you the bear lives i'm flying there's a lot of rules in this game staying on theme for the night sure sure and i pat your big stony face and give it a kiss and fly down the hall at the bottom in the middle i'm going to do divine sense again for undead specifically a location these are dead dwarves pike starts whispering i can technically destroy dead things so if we sneak me up to the outside of the wall-- how big is it too dm question because i can't remember for sure didn't in our story somewhere we come up with a solution for pike's noisiness something that quieted her down regular roll she casts guidance on herself to help with that roll i have another dm question for paladins until the end of your next turn you know the location of any undead within 60 feet so that implies number if i know the location of any so how many am i sensing one okay center also i mean if pike can get up and get a peek in she could take a first shot at turning it turnt stay turnt i wonder if getting pike on the broom or the rug could improve her chances of sneaking up to the door as well and get a peek in and try to turn whatever's inside okay unlimited no okay so she can do that she's got a couple of other things she can do with this ability she's 18th level it's worth a shot because we could one-shot a thing possibly possible one shot you guys go everybody hang back yeah do i spot anything here comes the roll checking for traps investigation right 20 however there's still an undead thing inside but i don't find any traps (sighs) can we see well can pike can i see into the hovel oh it's closed vax's wings go (poof) the last king when i'm turning undead if they're like little piddly guys they blow up but if he's a king he might not blow up so he might get scared of me or nothing i don't know well time is of the essence he could have something useful it seems like a coin flip that's tempting liam said yeah of course yeah all right so-- pickle are you ready to go yeah okay shhh i'm going to try and open it as silent as possible strength check good grief 16 yeah yeah sure enough to see in grog-- pike goes like this (yells) as soon as the door opens i mean as soon as pike sees him flex she's got her hands-- vax catches pike's shoulder hold on let me look i'm checking the boxes for traps and the door plus seven 19 for the investigation the door and boxes okay here we go thieves' tool yeah that's fine yeah 30 (shutting noise) just go down the line yeah (laughs) that's a 29 with luck okay here we go that's fine that's a 27 i did one two let's jump to five no are you here did you whisper it to me they don't relock when i go my sister's hounding me at the door so i'm going to go back and twiddle my finger inside the empty boxes yeah but i can reopen them they don't relock do they but retrap i mean so i'll go do this inside i go to box five oh that's great yeah that works that was investigation and it's 26 that is a 33 yeah two more 18 i'm leaning back good 20 let's do one more 19 yeah i'm going to hold my breath and-- wait wait wait okay here's what i'm going to do i take up whisper and i go (unlocking) (wind blowing) and throw it at the wall yep i walk over to it (finger swirling sound) oh i did that to the top i open it up (finger swirling sound) yes it does it again it didn't expend i would've thought there'd be a little container-- with what are there a bunch of gnomes down there i'm just going to take it a 14 that's not good enough i'm fine i'm fine i cough i feel alive-- of what of the room you never know they could've died trying and then walked away undead ask your rogue dude do you mind if i give a second opinion you know what could it hurt oh not that good though no lower than what you rolled it's okay you're good now natural 20 pick it pike is though she's been doing this for five minutes total of 37 i'm a level 18 rogue but you're inside 25 could you say that vax saw the look of panic in pike's eyes and blessed her in a split second too bad i didn't recognize the last one it's open pickle come on she grabs her holy symbol and flips it the bird and turns undead wisdom saving throw dc oh shit so many pieces of paper 18 one round i'm going to fill up with three daggers and dump divine smite into the first 32 19 32 okay first and third hit sneak attack on the first because assassin and i'm going to dump smite into it three plus eight let me get the dice first (counting) 41 and the smite is 3d8 because it's undead i said 41 right 41 45 46 52 doubled is 104 plus the psychic damage 109 for the first attack bad experience with coffins 22 for my investigation oh no you can fly over you might be feeling some issues right now if it were cursed i could detect good and evil fred freddie i wasn't going to say i could do anything i think that's a shitty idea right now natural 20 far-ish further than my visual range okay we've got company up ahead so yeah stealth 30 man i had to pee so bad i ran out of the room how close am i to that divine sense it's undead okay or a fiend or a celestial (daggers whooshing) one two three advantage on all three attacks first attack is 29 second attack second attack is 32 third attack is 27 ten 14 17 23 24 48 plus psychic damage 54 for the first attack we're not in emon in the market square we are in hell perception check 31 all right i'm going to sneak up to it flame tongue is out what am i looking at yeah liam knows what this thing is but vax does not fuck this thing i'm going to start looking-- what are the trinkets on it oh he could do anything was he did you say investigation or perception investigation all right thank you some weird energy tonight guys 19 i rip off the spyglass and go oh that looks nerdy percy will like that and then i yank off the dagger and go that looks all right and i stick it in the blinkback belt and then-- what was the last thing it was a key to the bronze door right yeah in the dark by myself oh that is fucking hilarious the tattered remains of the book eh eh i don't i let it sink back into the water a one eyed one horned swimming purple people-- come on up please we should keep moving oh freddie get excited i found a spyglass covered in diarrhea would you like it you know what 82 people tweeted me that pike speaks dwarvish so thanks guys thanks it's a match-three game right you might have seen a corpse in the water floating to perceive a dead body in the water let's have a look oh terrible 18 yes greg vax is backing the fuck up we're all going to die looking for traps dead guys from the door oh somebody rolled this place 18 investigation check for traps and dead guys so if dudes came in here and put stuff in sacks there wouldn't be scrapes mini jenga well there's something under that do you want to i don't think it's a small child down here what do you want to do sis i don't have much of that left yeah my last one i'll use it my last one detect undead divine sense how far away is it yay maps look at all the gold look at this great tile work i love dwarven forge we are taking that bird that's our percival 15 oh two (impact) kind of a gooch-smashing day so she's going to walk right up to him and slam it right into his junk yeah that is what she's going to do well if she wants to use one of three channel divinities for today she's hitting him in the gooch 23 to hit all right plus the what's it called divine strike so three plus four is seven plus the 2d8 that ain't a d8 that's 13 21 to the gooch yes that's right fiend or undead take extra 2d6 radiant damage whatever i just told you and now i'm going to roll for that extra-- that was the mace of disruption plus divine strike once on each turn add 2d8 of weapon damage to your damage total (gun cocking) gooch shot she needs to jump up to hit it what's at 18 we're not sure 17 or 18 real life is hazy double gooch shot keep looking at mine same thing 23 (counting) 12 and then the radiant damage 2d6 so we're at 12 plus five plus-- no once per turn 17 no she's going to face him down it's a half hour ago at this point you can say no you go blind (whispering) grog i'm so glad we're together at last finally an enemy that can kill grog no it wouldn't double the dice so next i'm up right i'm going to move past pike past the troll and hold my action should anything come from that room if i see a creature running at any of us i'm going to throw yeah (dagger noises) okay i'm going before them in the order does that mean i get advantage due to assassin cool 25 for the first okay second is a 25 third is a 15 oh okay cool right so what did i say for the first two okay cool but no sneak attack at all so here they come first one is 11 plus psychic damage is 17 for the first and the second one is 15 for the second 17 and 15 no that does hit i'll use uncanny dodge on it that hits balls okay (singing) don't fail me raven queen like you've done so many times before (speaking) that is a 17 what do you mean i'll roll it again if you want i don't care i'm rolling it again that's way worse nine you've just peaked sam let me take my antlers off yes okay that hits yeah that's fucked up matt yeah we're just going to slog slog it out man slog it out (laughter) yes please well it could be their version of death ward fire does work on trolls yes it's on foam but it's good love you oh jeez okay so i think-- she could turn undead but how far are they they're probably too far apart well no she could stand between them and do it 30 feet so she stands between she's going to climb up on-- no i'm not going to say that she's going to take a step diagonally down this way and then turnt undead wisdom saving throw spell save is 18 if they're challenge rating four or lower they're blowed up yeah wisdom save and that just means they're scared move as far away as you can from the person also cannot take reactions for its action it can use only the dash action all they can do is run so he didn't strike the troll at all what i'm going to do is turn to trinket really quick and say guard this dead thing and then i'm going to use my movement and dash action if necessary to sprint around and flank that troll between me and grog flanking with keyleth okay if keyleth is on the other side-- as long as i'm flanking either way no i'm fine i'm flanking with keyleth right now to the butt that's fine 28 on the first and ooh 30-something on the second okay so first one is (counting) 11 plus psychic is 12 plus those guys (counting) 28 for that one sorry that was the first one the second one i'm going to shove it down into its eye socket and just grind it around for the second attack even though it's down that's it done nope i did a constitution save 20 minutes ago was it dead or was it undead i'm just being stupid go for it i'll be fine yeah dude i already rolled terribly for pike pike got a five vax got a 20 lovely but it's not a one-shot it's got several charges right she's a fucking jedi i can imagine it in the abstract universe though i sure can laura bailey i sure can you could dash broom dash pike saw keyleth go running down that way so she is going to run after her (counting) she can't see the troll from there right she can see the troll oh my god i think it's time for a guiding bolt range 120 feet a flash of light streaks toward a creature of your choice within range make a ranged spell attack against the target on a hit the target takes 4d6 radiant damage and the next attack roll-- okay yeah make a spell ranged attack plus ten because it's pike yeah you've got to attack yo here's the white die you gave me 13 plus ten is 23 specifically toward the taint matt pike's on a tear today the guiding bolt streaks through the air loops down to the ground up through the butt up out the head and out the mouth everyone vaguely hears that's my pike and its head explodes that happened in six seconds it was like (explosions) okay realizing that the druid and the goliath are going to have to figure that out vax walks to the middle there and starts to take a wee in the corner it's been a long time yeah let her do her thing i think we can afford a few minutes then grog could finish attuning-- oh you did that stop hitting yourself hammer was attuned you are going to crit on vecna and ko yourself greater restoration i'm looking she'll grab him by the cheeks and squish the cheeks and say grog don't go touching things you don't know what they are cast greater restoration she gives you the mom look and says don't touch it okay guys have so much fucking fun on the playa recharge reset energize go nuts miss you no they need to recharge give them some space let them recharge i'll be topless on sam's one-shot you can look at me instead push-ups for seven days here we go
