testicle roach (dubious noises) humble dragon-brag which is a problem 'cause it blows the invisibility did you draw that one or is it your kid i'm pretty sure the only monster here is you (tearfully) i just thought of it five seconds ago and i'm so happy caleb starts silver threading the entrance that fjord swam through the moment that they exit the pool we'll know and it would wake me up or you up or anybody up frumpkin's hair gets poofed out and his tail floofs out and he starts growling at the sound is it my turn with the dodecahedron i do did you use it i more want to examine it no can i borrow the bag i'm going to spend maybe a half-hour before bed not trying to use it but just examine it 15 well this evening i'm going to use it for the grand purpose of being my pillow in the bag so i'm going to sleep it’s in the bag does my head do this i'm awake they're awake ah fish nott no down below in my-- yeah wake up i'm going to send frumpkin to crawl down and get a look it’s fine good four oh we left the corpses out i don't know no 100 feet i actually have no memory of anything on range for bamfing in and out but i will defer to you because you're my dm ja there is one down there right now and he tried to kill my cat am i able to prepare magic missile like a held spell for a fish head popping out of the hole but i’d lose the slot if i held the-- i won't do that then but i will watch the hole i have no lights up so i should be at disadvantage right i'm going to roll again what does that say no i had to fire bolt so it wouldn't matter how long i held it my lower is a 12 i just watched all that i'm going to pull out a rag and do my veiled lantern thing with dancing lights put one of what things up down there you want me to go down there i'm going to send frumpkin down again come on frumpy nine someone told me that cats have advantage on perception are they full of shit you’re my dm would it cancel out is why i'm asking i will so cancel that's pretty good perception 19 he could watch but the alarm is just as good it's automatic gets me up frumpkin can sleep after you ja 12 i have my hand on yasha's enormous rippling shoulder i need about ten minutes in the dark i pull out the thread and i start doing the thing i can't do that but i will do that we'll say that i said that out loud to her nott had a wonderful idea for you to pick up all of the dead things let's get the shit out of here i'm freaked out so i'm going to stay up with yasha perception 11 could i back up one hour and ask yasha a quick question this is a small group for you you traveled with the circus this is a big group for me do you have any advice you seem awkward like me but you made it work with a lot of people i've tried that too and it goes horribly i think it goes pretty bad i'm confused did you have advice i start writing these things down it just rained though this is the cleanest i've been in weeks most of the time i'm trying to people don't pay attention to beggars so much yeah in general you're as big as a giant barn you are hard to miss do you know what i miss shaving one thing that i have realized today is that i need to work on my interpersonal skills and friendship making so try not to cut up my face okay no leave my hair on my head but i have not had a clean-shaven face in a long time no you can take it all you can crush a person but i'm not quite sure how dexterous you are so i don't want any fancy tricks okay should i lie on the ground have you done this before with that i lie on the floor wait this means we are friends (inhales) that might be better four globules of light rise up around you as you begin to shave caleb's inner monologue is i want to shrivel up and die i take a brief moment with the dodecahedron before handing the bag back to jester i'll forget it's a bad idea for you to stay we would need you you're not very good at finding traps but everything else you're quite good at how long has he been gone for oh you're in here talking about what was there i was distracted i was thinking about my books i don't want them to get harmed your bag is probably water resistant yeah i do want to leave them with nott i'm going to unharness the-- yeah if you come after us would you please hide them under a stone or something two yeah girl yeah zweiundzwanzig 22 yeah that's good ashley listening to their footfalls so pretty here comes the smoke this is wrong this is right that's still wrong that's right don't fuck me colville you fucked me colville sechs krav maga quick question from the fish guy up at the top there if that was the corner of a cube would it reach the one down by the lollipop 40-foot cube excuse me sorry that's probably not big enough that's too big right it's too far if i were to hit the fish guy at the top and make that the corner of a cube and go this way it would probably only get two of them right forget it i'm going to cast haste on mollymauk i can't see it's dark i'm blind it's the safer bet to aid my friend on the next turn you have just been hasted and i am going to move along the wall this way away from the enemies that i think i can detect from the cavern behind us (muffled air horn noises) what's the lighting like in here i cannot see anything i'm going to move towards the sound of jester shouting in the dark and i'm going to raise up the glove of blasting and try to shoot the fish-man that i heard way up high ahead of me up the hill they'll all be at disadvantage the one with the staff at the top first one's 15 second one is 14 and then that is also 14 so just one of them hits that is six points of fire damage okay that's it double speed fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck ja how far can i get towards this one over there even if it means going in the water will i get within 30 feet of him well show me how far-- i'm going to try it i'm going to wade in i was considering it it's just not what i wanted to do i'm going to cast dispel magic on the storm above me everybody hears (nervous laughter) that did not sound good shield i will use the dodecahedron and roll a 20 on this side i got a natural two i get to choose it says it on this paper alternatively after an attack roll is made against me i can expend the fragment to roll an additional d20 and choose so two plus whatever caleb will remember this that's cocked you've got to take the good with the bad i'm going to save my higher stuff for the guy who's disappeared so i'm going to fire bolt it right at point-blank range at disadvantage ugh (laughter) i'm going to crouch down into the water and submerge up to my neck in the hopes that it does not know where i am and i'm too short to be hit flank that yasha enemy (pigeon coos) advantage to disadvantage straight roll i'll take it get out of here status thing what was the damage before dm thank you thank you my web browser's going insane i can't hold on i have no internet right now i rolled a six and i don't know what my con is because i have lost-- oh you're right i do after you asked me nine times (laughter) does the exhaustion happen when the spell's broken okay earlier i'm sorry because the internet shit the bed on me so it was 12 plus 14 i'm still up he's like this in the water am i able to wade onto the land just behind beau there yeah if i go in that direction can i get off on dry land okay i'm going to do that and as i'm doing that i'm pulling out my little clay cat's paw and i'm going to hold maximilian's earthen grasp as soon as i hear fish talking in the water i'm going to let it go cat's paw 16 strength yeah “on a failed save the target must make a strength saving throw” versus my 16 and it takes 2d6 damage bludgeoning damage five points of bludgeoning damage it's so big six total so a big muddy claw sinks into its tail and pulls it down in place the damage doesn't do anything to its spellcasting ability does it okay so what do i take i'm not going to make this eight yeah i'm out at least you got an apology when you rolled shit sure let's do this that's a six this is like those tatasciore spells like (mimics cutting out) front of molly that's what you do yasha come on buddy would caleb have flown backwards when he was struck before when caleb was knocked down by thunderwave the first time would he have been thrown backwards oh i thought-- should i make another death save that's an 11 thank you (groans) ow no you got to just do this check out her book motor crush a one a one and a two you look pretty bad i'm good what's that stuff up there i'm going to start hobbling towards the bottom of the stony steps i realize something in a panic and i trudge through the water back towards the entrance and i pull out the wire and i put it in my hands and i cast message and say to jester please please please get my books and put them in your bag please (bane voice) your punishment will be more severe are you being careful up there yeah you know nott could have a look around i could have a look around once jester returns with my books i start speed wading back (stuttering) are my books dry but can i see them are they dry they're dry okay i recommend that you allow me to check for magical problems then once we know what's what then you go in but that takes about ten minutes so i will pull out my spellbook and i will use ritual casting to cast detect magic there's a glow in the water as well well i'm not doing anything i'm just saying we know that there is something magical in the pool itself and then you said the long wooden box is glowing what kind of magic is coming off of the wooden box enchantment i don't believe that there is any kind of protection or magical lock on that so yeah try to pick the lock from a distance (sing-song) do-de-do-de-do she's doing it from 30 feet away hopefully that's enough that looks heavy so first you hold that have we found everything also while all that was going on i was looking for a jagged cross with two crescent moons in it of those 6 or 7 that i saw i will take the one that looks the most familiar to me from my memory i’m going to keep that clearly that's what's glowing at the bottom to my eyes what kind of magic school of magic is it i don't know i think you should put it-- yeah let's put it down with that sword that we found mollymauk do you want to see something come with me okay i'm going to lead jester up to the top where fish guy was at the beginning with his staff set it down and-- we’re already up there yeah i want to go up where all the little thingies are let's set it down just in case okay then i pull out my spell book again and-- will you hold this for me sit down with me i rifle through the pages to the right one for identify and the sword is down okay i'm going to use this one you can see-- and i start showing the different glyphs and i start the ritual so it takes ten minutes to make the spell i thought it was just the long box that we already opened if the box was solid enough that's true i would think there would be enough time overlap though for detect magic to still have one or two minutes left before we get to the end of identify so if that is brought over do i notice any sort of glow from-- okay so i mutter i pause my chanting and say i will take a look at that in a moment hold on and finish my 11 minutes of ritual casting wait is anyone going to interrupt me before i get to the end of identify yeah (laughter) just a bunch of sexual innuendo matt yes there's a complete blade that's magic caleb is furrowing his brow at everybody arguing about this as he's 30 seconds away from ending lost gone jester's holding my spell book on sword and cat's eye it's whatever's sitting in my little-- the complete sword all this shit doesn't exist so sometimes it's hard to tell what we're talking about this blade is called summer's dance mr mollymauk i feel like this might be good for you there is a kind of magic that i do not even possess that allows you to vanish from one point and reappear in another and this blade will allow you to do it it is a very fine blade it is more lethal than a regular blade and will allow you to poof poof poof you can all argue over it but i hand it to mollymauk as well as the cat's eye is it one spell one item okay next you're welcome internet could have waited 11 minutes but no you grabbed the stone before i had a chance to finish what i was doing why did you do that why no taliesin and i was him what does that mean no are you skipping any details are you skipping any details i feel like we're missing something i'm going to cast dancing lights and scour the room is there anything we're missing if you have 11 minutes to spare yes i can i begin ritual casting detect magic oh man ritual casting just one can i take 30 seconds to see if it jogs my memory since i'm such a history buff nope big 13 i do not have any i heard that but who’s got them i also have a propeller beanie and a bag of chips and-- i heard you say that who has them we're pretty sure we have them guys i hope we brought kiri with us nope i give beauregard a hug and say i don't know what i'm doing just go with it i look to yasha caleb doesn't laugh like that at all (awkward laughing) that's not necessary not necessary working on it ja okay of course i do you made babs tarr hide her head in her laptop man well my friends whatever we do we are really fucked up at least beauregard and i are really fucked up shit let's go find vecna reverse math we came from that direction precisely oh that's a final fantasy vii materia rogue bling it out man bling that shit out
