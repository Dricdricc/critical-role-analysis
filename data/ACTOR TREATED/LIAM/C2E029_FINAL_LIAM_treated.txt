(shouting) marion don't look marion (as caleb) well if you were wondering why taliesin was losing his-- (as liam) oh i'm doing caleb already taliesin was losing his mind the last several weeks while also dying i quietly lost my mind at nights out in the national parks it's because we've been working on this it's shaping up beautifully it's full of beautiful pieces from the community that you are probably familiar with there's some that are new to the book and we're very proud of-- oh it's gone-- the cover which is done by comic artist matteo scalera you might know him from the comic black science i've loved his art for a while the cover's gorgeous moreno dinisio who does his coloring on black science did it for the cover as well the book looks amazing and for the thousandth time thank you for every artist in this community who gives back to the show [cheering] i can't hear you but we don't have much time so let's move forward carefully please and it's just the two of us so you know help me out will you further up he's made it to the second floor i think i didn't pop out so i'm seeing what frumpkin sees at this point i can't hear a thing she's saying well they told us that they would wait for us before going down and i'm sure that they have done that [laughter] while i ask frumpkin to continue along the right path and this is where the plan falls apart i am processing right now i haven't made a decision in a split-second okay that could have gone better no no no let's wait here for a second frumpkin my boy will you please go ahead i will gently pull keg around the corner of the left path five feet so we are not in direct view well if frumpkin's going this way i will move keg and i a little bit that way so we are not in direct view i will let frumpkin continue and watch what are we doing let's have frumpkin look under that door that was just revealed they're preoccupied i come out of frumpkin's vision and i take caleb-- caleb is me i take keg by the hand and go close to her ear and whisper and say just follow me please and tell frumpkin to go up that side and we will go up the other side frumpkin can get there just ahead of me and peek around that corner before we turn it we scooch to the corner okay rinse repeat i send fumpkin under the first door pull keg a little bit further so we are by those doors i pull out the copper wire listening and i aim down looking for nott and say there are two coming from the upper floor i don't know if they're leaving or coming away but be alert no the stairs were down in the corner closest to us i will say in the meantime that i would of course have sent frumpkin into the final room to know if we have cleared this place up here quickly do i see anything of note in this room 17 17 okay well if we are still alive in an hour there will be time for this later i leave it listen you're not going to see me for a while but i will be with you no i am not-- yeah ditto kiddo it galls me to do this because i will only be able to do it the one time fuck it i pull out the scroll of invisibility that calianna gave me and recite a few words and i am gone then you feel a tap-tap-tap on your shoulder quietly please and i will not be walking right next to you but a little ways away you can trust me i will not leave your side carefully oh one other thing-- and there's a little flash on your shoulder and there is a large-ish spider a little quieter than that please that's the ticket let's go you're a beast a disembodied voice says oh this is going wonderful i am actually over here though okay i whisper into nott's ear and say (stuttering) just this once i think i should go first i'm not there anymore audience brave dead it's semantics really 17 for me i am going to move into the room and sit down on the floor between the cage and the door pressed against the wall ja and just wait 19 17 17 over here it'll be your spell plus-- oh it's none of these act natural [laughter] i'm going to slide out away from nott and go to the other side clear of the hallway to look into the cage that's there to the other side of the room is anyone alive or dead in that cage that is a 19 okay er hello i am invisible stay as low as possible and this will all blow over quickly i think that's the end of my turn what are you trying to roll i am very stealthy this seems to be going okay not so bad are those tables by the gate that keg and beauregard are trying to pull up not the room i'm in i am going to kick one over and roll it over because i can see keg jimmying on the gate i see where she is going with it and i am going to be ready to push it under once it's lifted up i will hold my turn but i am going to do that pushing my rear end out of the way of view of anyone even though i am invisible yeah okay what could go wrong big six i have average strength yeah okay (strained) yeah this table is pretty heavy too spiritual weapon it yeah okay since the gate is open i'm going to start slowly walking down the hallway after nott sticking close to the wall that's as far as i get i could but i don't want to do that i will put frumpkin on the wall opposite me ten feet ahead of me i would love to give frumpkin his turn to go as far along the ceiling after nott as he can oh you know 120 feet 20 feet okay and i will just stay pressed against the wall and that is the end of my turn in beauregard's ear she hears i am in the hallway ahead of you chill out for a moment i will continue to let frumpkin creep around if we are in that sort of a scenario bugs the show's all about bugs now bugs as you pass in the hallway you hear lightly entschuldigung if i am able to now i will send frumpkin over the ceiling and down the door and if there is a crack he will go through no ja if there's a gap ja frumpkin's not invisible is he good news i rolled a one they are going to die [cheering] i start moving up through the hallway nott-- ja it's still me i'm still invisible you need to check that door i don't know if it's trapped or-- you checked a trap in this room didn't you frumpkin went under a new door i point invisibly and say the door that i'm pointing at that one a gentle knock happens on the door in front of her the other side ja i would prefer it we are blown anyway so have at it we are just giving them time to be ready for us we need to proceed caleb is silently making the jerk-off motion in the room they are standing in [cheering] maybe nott will you have a look at it first caleb is already in the next room steering clear of the trap and trying to inspect if that brazier is arcane in nature or if there is anything dangerous other than the trap ja if only i had gotten to say natural 20 before that happened oh that's one of those-- and am i aware of that the trap what sets it off since i got the natural 20 proximity alone i am in the room there are a couple of options i could dispel it it would take me about ten minutes i would no longer be invisible we would lose time the second option is that we just run for it yes [cheering] there is a deep deep sigh in the room and then caleb descends into the hole ja oh good roll shak√§ste would you er-- friend would you do us the favor of stacy-- is it stacy or anastasia okay i used to have a cat i do not any longer-- would you do us the favor of having a peek around with your bird friend where are all you cosplayers at do me a favor i love you all but if you're not in costume sit down for a moment so i can see all the costumes [music fades] also question who has the adorably high-pitched laugh somewhere over here it's you keep laughing audience somebody get that woman a drink it's on me i love you too audience but that's what i mean too all right let's get this tpk moving [cheering] spoilers scanlan's gone man scanlan's gone are the stairs wide enough for two people to go down three people to go down individual that blows ja that's a pretty impressive illusion-- you are able to do something so substantial i'm right in front of you i'm right in front of you i'm talking about-- as big as keg what are we doing let's stop making so much noise and try it then come on burch oh winner (laughter) it's also-- it's not a trap is it because there's no weight to your illusion what would have been set off no it's a person firing it's a person firing caleb will come invisibly down but not leave the stairs he will stay on the stairs yeah halfway down but you can leave him up there for the moment what are you do you have a bonus 15 i don't like this music ah ja okay i think-- i'm already gone in my head i think this is still going very well i have not been hit here we go and i'm at the bottom of the stairs already not at the top so what i would like to do is move my full movement and then use my action to dash and just stroll to the right of nott and i will just touch her on the shoulder as i go and get as far as i can in that direction against the wall if that's as far as i can get so 60 feet ja that's exactly where i want to be and then i will scooch down not fully sitting but like bending my knees down and doing like a squat and thinking this is okay this is okay that's the end of the turn typically okay this is still going very good so i am going to slide along the wall that i'm on to try to get to the space where beau had been before she started now that the little weasel is dead ja i'll stay against the wall if i can ja and then i'm going to lose invisibility because i start to weave my hand around my arm and i am going to release scorching ray three globs of fire up his ass in the sky well the first one was a natural zwanzig so-- [cheering] so 8d6 total ja well the critical gets-- okay so this becomes an eight okay hold on ja okay so that's tenokay und that is eleven okay and then also this becomes 17 it's a total of 19 damage of scorching ray to his ass yeah eh wie gehts that's the end help [background music] hits dead the word is dead okay who hurt you audience 15 three plus-- egypt is just so far away so i am bleeding profusely everywhere and i am going to stumble in the direction-- i think that's keg she's short i will go that way as far as i can and as i go i say this is going very well if i go to the right will i clear out of that flying guy's line of sight yeah i'm going to cut directly right towards caduceus and just before i disappear out of view i'm going to say hey how's your day and i will send a fire bolt at lorenzo ja eh it's not that great it's a 16 okay that's good that's also good so 14 points of fire damage ja and then hopefully i'm disappearing around the corner and leaning my face against the wall like that i'm having raishan flashbacks ja seven plus (slurring) caleb's face is pressed into the wall and he says i am so glad that we have two clerics they will-- [cheering] so i'll shove that in my gullet that's totally the wrong die oh that's okay seven points back okay i'm cured i don't know where anything is or what's going on and i feel real bad so i'm going to try to crawl up the steps a bit through the blood in my face ja i'll crawl up the steps and then hey i will just throw a fire bolt where he was that probably won't work but let's do it ja natural 20 [groaning] we did it you guys confetti no yeah [cheering]liam  oh audience audience were you at 33 you're unconscious both okay ah-- i would like to push myself up the stairs as far as i can while still being able to have a bead on him okay then i will collapse onto my ass on the stairs and make that symbol shape thing that fjord used to make and go ey buddy i will send out another fire bolt ja that is a 16 16 no worries that's six points of fire damage and i will now push myself up out of sight up the stairs a little bit it's going very well shak√§ste will get to you any second this is going very well seven total now cough i mean of course they're going to come for you because you could have fucked off days ago but you're a big team player now oh i better try to hit that guy again i will scooch down again oh he's holding both of her blades okay well i probably won't hit but let's do it again pew pew that is a six-- 14 or is it hold on let me double check because my ipad died and i can't see my shit it's okay everybody it's 16 [cheering] it's 11 points of damage oh well fuck me running it worked i watch it leave my finger and take an impossible spiralling trajectory through the air and he's so preoccupied with that charming dwarf woman with the stubble it takes him in the back of the head and it starts to burn through the back of his skull and eat away through the back of his head and burn through his eyes [cheering] you shouldn't have killed my cat [laughter] also in the meantime dm i-- i have a question i don't know if the situation calls for it-- i rolled a voluntary wisdom save for-- ja but i rolled an 18 so it's a 21 it's better than it was you know we thought it would be a joke in the beginning it kind of stuck it doesn't make any sense i'm going to go sit on the table that got knocked all over the place during that fight and sit and just stare at the three unconscious and feel very tired do either of you want to come with
