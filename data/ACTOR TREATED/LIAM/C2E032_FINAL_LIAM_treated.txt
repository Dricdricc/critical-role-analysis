have la la sam and travis will be part of the game and we are bringing in friends tj storm-- laura and and erica luttrell both great actors fun to play with again i don't want to spoil anything but i will say that it will be focusing heavily on motherfucking werewolves late happy birthday present to travis willingham yes i met him years ago in japan doing mocap and on all our breaks he was just playing civ on his pc and telling me all about d&d this predates all our d&d so he is dpb dick in the peanut butter really gets into the game (laughter) i don't wanna speak for you tj better than chunky (baby talk voice) oh who's dpb who's dpb (caterwauling) [click tv static] [groovy critical role theme] too real caleb has to find new garage sales to dive through oh i'm thinking back on it now ask jester to show you the thingy in her bag okay ignore that it's something we picked up the first time we came through zadash hurry up and stuff that thing back in her bag you are not allowed to-- you know ja balls deep thank you for bringing it back to the material plane that is pretty good that's an 18 point of order there's also a hut now as part of the nightly routine is it looking as we near it-- is it looking a little more put back together there's the feed & mead tavern there's broad barn there's crate and barrel good times nabend any trouble here at home yeah maybe stay for the night before moving on no i am all set the trend is that it's pushing closer in coin wait hold on hold on just a point of clarification we're talking voyeuristically because of your household you mean i just want to understand what we are talking about you know up close is different than from behind a boudoir i'm curious about yourâ€“ you only because when i saw it last it was a bit of a mess it was a little bit egg mcmuffin if you know what i'm saying traditional zadash breakfast dpb ja but still here's a question once we get to the menagerie coast i feel like we'll have a good sense of how nott is at fitting in what is it like for-- it's also hot is it hot there you might not want mittens you know you're fine when you're next to me that old chestnut no a roof is good let's have a roof it's easy we stumble upstairs morgen ja morgen guten morgen liam does not know liefen laufen loafen loben also the nostalgia factor of seeing where we all you know got hitched have you ever been out of empire same i will pay for that it's done and done it's already happened i'm good i've stocked up i am plush i have more coin in my pocket than i ever could have imagined and i have already spent most of what we made no no i'm good ja oh you two take it then where are you going i poke my head between them what are you doing i send frumpkin to go look at the rocks ten can he climb to the tippy-top i'm looking down at us turn around having to do k turns as a person is rough does it look like there is anything buried any digging done here 20 sorry 25 that's a bingo hold on i send frumpkin to get down by my hand to look up so that i can look at what i'm grabbing to make sure that it is not one of those bags with teeth or something that i have read about in fairytale stories one moment some loot maybe no first frumpkin goes to look so i can see what i'm seeing i don't like all these euphemisms i pull the bag out caleb takes the bag and he puts it in jester's hand and starts to quietly dance around i take one gem and say this is a six-foot tall stack of paper we're taking them did you find it in your pants while everybody's arguing i'm going to sit down and detect magic as a ritual oh ritual casting detect magic but that's ten minutes of stoppage i am busy nothing stones the dirt okay we're good this place is clear let's get the hell out of here i lost all my dicks that's how it works right everyone in the bed is-- it was travis yeah if it's easy yeah you have a trost here that's what you do i wasn't paying attention could i get a bowl please oh i was going to borrow from a friend but yeah i will take a little bit of milk in it please i put it on the floor and i snap him into existence there you go buddy no yeah he really likes it no no no no no it is painfully true in my case and i tell frumpkin to start drinking milk just a little bit put some fat on those fey bones of yours please send me your emails for abusing my fey magical cat yeah it's like vax near the end yeah like vax near the end (as vax) oh this sandwich is so good mmm (laughter) i don't think we have that do we want to do a little-- i don't think that's true but we could do a token and if not i feel like we should keep a certain amount for ourselves for our travels but we could leave a token sum to help him on the way remember that norda and yorda in the morning if that is permissible ja roughly how long has it been since we were here well pleasure you know we meant to return sooner but we've been a bit held up about that we're not staying in town we are leaving in the morning actually but-- how much-- if it's not too presumptuous how much do you have left to work off what about remuneration an amount what is left for him to work off ja could you please could you go look up that number for us please he convinced the town that we all met-- werewolves next week travis willingham living his best life therewolves it's maybe a little bit for you but also for a friend for-- i'm not good at this does someone want to we were fond of him and he was fond of you so yeah so back to the situation at hand you are suggesting we continue doing what we're doing (whispers) this got weird so quickly i will put in 100 gold we are at 15 now jesus just keep 65 and spend 100 of molly's to keep it simple i'm keeping my money then solid what will you do now your guess is as good as ours boy not that any of us can complain but that guy likes to lay it on thick that's tea for life seems fake (laughter) i'm gonna go open and look at wikipedia i found it looks so good on the purpleheart intentionally late there it is i wish laura hadn't quit she was so good on the show we're over big dick energy bde is gone dpb is in it just means you're really invested schlurp how far to the gate it needs to be empty the way it looks we need to hop out now it needs to be empty the way it looks when they poke at it so i think we should all spill out now just on a whim do you want to try to dispel the enchantment the way you did-- what would i know about using that spell to make this go away temporarily or for good that's what i'm after that is 22 hey let's roll off of this thing and take a walk let them poke sticks in here and find nothing yeah but if they find the lot of us going (grunts) when they look in that's bad but if they poke at it and say what's with this cart we say it's a very good cart i'm getting out of the cart or maybe fjord would be good at that i will take the bag away and swivel it over to fjord he did it again it's an elven giant nice tal 23 oh he worked so hard on that and now the ettin just wants to crochet things with us that miniature is like the garbage pail kid card that you get 97 of it is the most frequent find in the box ettins got a lot of ettins in the meantime i pull out a white feather and i trace a triangle in the air and i cast fear on this one 16 13 is the dc i tap nott on the shoulder-- those two just saw their worst fears it's so beautiful wait now he can spin it around and it's a different part of the canyon entirely 100 feet later this is like old animation where it just repeats and repeats and repeats the ettins are throwing boulders at us go go go i assume it is yeah yeah where did it go where did it go this is my first time casting it if the creature ends its (mumbling)-- must take the dash action if a creature-- for the duration it just says it becomes frightened for the duration one minute i'm looking where is it do you see it oh if it doesn't have line of sight on me it makes a wisdom save noice noice noice 16 (jester voice) jester where did you land aww how far away-- oh boy caleb is going to jump out of the back of the cart i'm going to move to here and as i'm moving forward i'm pulling out a pinch of iron powder and i let go of it and pull my fingers apart and beau again becomes swoleregard and i will use the rest of my movement i think it's five or ten feet more then to back away towards the cart once i've done it don't let them down that's why i did this so i could see the big mini matt backing up towards the cart jogging backwards yep doing that backward jog for fuck's sake thanks gil fuck you gil what was it i don't know if this is going to hit me but i'm going to risk going this way away from it up onto the gray stone yeah i'll take it ten feet of reach probably but i'm not done so pushing myself up and trying to focus on the one on the ground and seeing double hand on the glove tighten it and i'm going to release three rays from it and-- hit the mic first-- and then hit the ettin on the ground is that at advantage because he's down i'm going to do it anyway first one is ten doesn't hit second one is a 20 yeah third one is 19 ugh i made six six one one so 14 points of damage it's a two (bane voice) oh sorry giantkin (singing) jester got run over by a reindeer that is amazing yeah he doesn't move (deep voice) that was real convenient guys ja i'm going to back up five feet away and as i do so i'm going to pull some bat shit out of one pocket and some sulfur in the other and slap them together and then stick my hands out and cast fireball at it it's a different kind it's a dex save but he's stunned so i imagine he's not going to do too well he's still prone but he's prone dex save so no that is a no it's a total of 16 fire damage did i go five feet back from where i was okay i feel very caffeinated right now if no one does anything else i will send another fireball 150 feet 25 points of fire damage because i have such an easy target at his back i give a little bit of a curveball to it and i make the fireball beam of red go (whirring) (explosion) and erupt about 15 feet back and just burn the backside oh yeah okay not great but at least we're not under attack a ten you're still huge oh nope yeah you're huge is enlarge still in place if i'm out of it i would think how long did it take for caleb to come out of that a minute i should probably stop doing that okay okay let's go catch the cart a thought i had earlier point of order-- the first time i did the hut it was bright orange but i've learned that i can control that so through experimentation i would say if we are ever in a field of grass the hut would be the color as close as caleb can get it to the grass it wouldn't be mottled or anything it would be still slightly abnormal because it would be one solid color if we are in a stony area i would try to match the gray just something i add to my routine did you say drudy by the way caleb has stayed behind he has no interest he is keeping the hut up and petting his own cat and watching twin cups (clinks) sam would you like an animal companion caleb is very judgmentally petting his cat's head beau's hard shell drops taliesin taliesin this one's for you (gasp) blink dog blink-- motherfucking blink dog i mean i'm not there (pigeon cooing) (laughter) why did you put this in front of us matt why no that blink dog is cool think how effective an animal companion was when you were a ranger and now you have none of those skills you could take it though this is revenge for all the times dagon bit us damn it and i take out a little metal wire and i add to this conversation and say you are responsible for this animal's stealth checks weasel yeah what about the owl and the weasel nothing is more important than this oh it's so cute if you guys are wandering back caleb is giving jester the vaguest stink eye as he scritches frumpkin's head that is super good for you why do you bring up the number of people in the party what do you mean yeah here have some tamagotchi you know caleb doesn't like the blink dog but keep the blink dog because liam loves it keep the blink dog alf please don't eat the blink dog (laughter) lot going on here work hard play hard well peanut butter and playa dust though nah no it's not
