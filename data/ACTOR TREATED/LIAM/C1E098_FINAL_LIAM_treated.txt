is like it's 120 miles away the mines of hear this we're running off on a lark but we've raked ourselves in the faces before if we're talking about what we were talking about before i don't think it's a good idea if you want to go and find him us and say hi that's a different story well a) he did that not us and b) we were all very much friends and happy with each other when he did that and he is not happy with us it's not exactly the same thing dear but if you want to go with me and find him and check in and say hello i'd be very happy to do that with you but to send the woman who threw our friend drugged over the back of a horse and took him off to his family i don't really want to send her after scanlan to look in on him or follow him or watch him or anything him it didn't sound like his father wanted him dragged back on the back of a horse and it happened anyway she doesn't seem very trustworthy to me yeah she's cool so what that was very smart grog oh anyway my point still stands once we wrap up here if you want to go find him i will go with you no yeah you done been woked so woked save that for a rainy day we don't need to punch that ticket now she has a mean streak i know one of them when she farts it sounds like a duck we go 30 feet (laughter) i'm looking for cooties around the outside cooties dang it 24 getting some baldur's gate vibes here man on the edges

actual eyeballs burn well he can give it to me i've got 50 things i can do a turn it was what kind of potion oh shit 8d8 i'm going to set the deathwalker's ward to necrotic well that is a very real possibility does gravity continue to carry it down dropping a great height did not go well for you we will not go bacon-less into the night good chance they can see in the dark it's a big one we are versatile as shit (guttural growly) i want a blondie so bad i rolled a two but it's a 37 built into the rules man i can get around very fast why don't i go look i have a flashlight is it a guard cherub i rolled a 20 on the wisdom save we didn't need to make and threw it away and thought well i wanted to keep it and then i rolled again and i got another natural 20 where's the baby when you say saved do you mean killed 25 so what did you roll wow the dumbest 25 okay boots on i'm going to arc over to ten feet away from the baby yeah where i am is it straight up or am i covered over here all right so action action bonus action i'm going to cast vow of enmity on it then i'm going to throw whisper at it that is a 33 to hit i'm going to cast divine smite on it there's a lot of dice here this is ten plus psychic damage is 11 that's not very good 11 plus divine smite is 12 19 plus sneak attack damage 19 21 26 28 29 34 36 38 and there's nothing extra because it's celestial not a fiend all right so that was bonus action action i'm going to use my action to then just fly away from the fucking thing a hundred feet away diagonally up into the tunnel where i can still see it hopefully i'm hasted movement was to get there bonus action for vow of enmity action to attack and then my hasted action i can use for dash hide disengage 60 normally 120 feet hasted i didn't make these rules or these items (whoosh) diagonally up i'll fly by my sister how's that natural 20 yeah nine instead of 18 is what you would've taken for it stupid baby keeps everyone from getting a good night's sleep it's been a thousand years got that slick stuff on you crisco oil is a peeper hanging out it's a boy got any luck left got to do something i wanted that baby to be punched so bad that little baby just zatoichi-ed out of the way i know what i want to do you tell me what i can do first thing i want to do is cast bless on-- i grab vex cast bless on us and pike i have a range of 30 feet on it is that bonus no i don't want to do that i don't want to do that i fly straight at pike and i'm going to lift her up sure and then is it an action to grab and an action to lift and carry over which is still a ton at this point and that's all i need is the action to grab her and movement to go over okay action and movement will all right then i will leave her on top of the wall and i will use my bonus action to fly within range of baby and i should have one action left yeah action action bonus action hasted great so the bonus action i will use to dash towards baby and my final hasted attack action i will stay 30 feet away from the baby though in the air and i will throw whisper with my last hasted action and that's a 25 which hits yeah one and can i dump smite into this i would like to there's nine plus psychic damage is 16 plus-- 20 26 and here comes the sneak attack damage 26 27 29 30 33 37 43 47 that's the end of my turn going to use another luck 25 she can see and cast spells it's like
