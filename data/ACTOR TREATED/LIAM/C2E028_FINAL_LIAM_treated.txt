i have a mounting sense of dread there's brand-new merch gencon oh so tense yeah and we don't have all the time in the world because we are trying to intervene before the worst happens do we get a sense of the taskers are they just a group like us like a small group or we don't know yet then we are not fulfilling our responsibilities we go at night and the first step is taking care of the two there could be more but two that we saw on the wall whoever is on the wall at night silently then from all you've told us we have-- this might be incomplete information-- but three there is the shithead himself and then two you saw so three total that we know about that is also correct when you were in this house as a mouse there was no way down there it was a solid trap door you don't know what was under it what did you hear specifically well we need to peel this like an onion we need to i believe get some help get some reassurance outer layer of the onion is making sure we take whoever is on the walls whoever is keeping watch out silently so that we can begin anew with the building itself i think that either you or my friend here should go in ahead of us so we have some idea of what is happening once in a while i turn this one into a spider it is slow but it is very undetectable do you feel differently truthfully there are ways that i can hurt people with a spider but i'm just talking about having a look around so that we are not walking into something different than what you saw last night well i disagree with you agree to disagree you are new this is very typical it's just part of the group dynamic we are all friends i am a master debater but we want to take numbers down so we peel the outer layer separately if all goes well then there is whoever is upstairs the big x factor is what is what is beneath we don't know how many people are underneath if i can find materials in shadycreek i need gold dust a lot of gold dust how likely is that here to first get gold dust i would need gold how much do we have i have next to nothing what about in the haversack does jester have any funds in there text thread explodes in five four three remember liam eats farts yeah it could be a group effort i feel very confident for many of our skills for the ones on the outside what i'm concerned about is entering the front door what is behind what i would like to do is go when they are sleeping and hopefully murder them in their sleep is the best case yeah the thing when someone is sleeping in a bed is they are like little-- (whispering) i was going to say babies i shouldn't say that there's a little bit that we have to play this by ear i think we should go at night to handle things when it is the least busy well maybe we can find some in shadycreek one that seems strangely specific than an onion well how about we're just going to kill the people on the wall how is that for a metaphor i like the idea of someone with a little bit of muscle and then another person who is adept at healing injuries in the woods did ophelia mention how far out into the woods that person was it is the same day ja that is a good point yeah friendsies well we're weighing two things against each other one is expediency because there are many people in shadycreek who could possibly lend a sword or ability but i think that you are correct that there is no telling their allegiance and i'm not ruling them out but this person out in the woods probably not in the pocket of our enemies we need to come to a decision promptly or wrapped them around her finger one way or the other no they are actually pretty-- they've got their shit together a child yes we have to make a decision (announcer voice) ophelia mardun (laughter) to the household ja if we find what we find in the woods is helpful enough and we feel good with what we got then in the middle of the night is a go we want to hit it at two or three in the morning whatever makes you feel comfortable you cannot argue with that yeah ashly and are we prancercising oh also are our horses dead but it wouldn't speed us up because it's the woods let's walk i will walk just behind nila she's just the biggest i'm going to stand next to the biggest person get it girl is there anything to add to-- ooh one moment i send frumpkin up to flit about 50 feet ahead to see if there is anything ahead or from a bird's eye view that we are unable to detect that is a 21 frumpkin is how far from me at this point so i can only watch i have muttered all this watching we are talking concentric rings ja i am beginning to think this a little more than we came looking for but we have traveled a ways we are going on a witch hunt we can't go over it we can't go under it caleb starts to climb over 16 nobody was aware i was panicked the whole time the thorns are almost like small razors careful how far away is the structure domo arigato hold on caleb tries to creep up to a gravestone and hide behind it to get within 30 feet of the door nine you're really just a random shopkeep in the woods you don't say does he seem like he's going to kill us thank you 19 nein-teen i come over and sit and take one of the teas oh well herr clay we come to you with a great tragedy do you want to or should i that's the first one (whispering) do we really have time for a comedy bit like this how long have you been alone out here how many seasons has it been since someone has knocked on your door like we have that is a very fair point we are very random visitors from out of the blue we do come to you with tragedy we do have a friend in the ground we do have friends who are in dire need of assistance you help people into the ground but offhand do you help them out of the ground we've all read stories of the extraordinary but you do not have this in your wheelhouse you are saying three in the cage is worth one in the dirt we are not bad guys if you are saying that you are able to help people back from the brink of extinction on occasion or under the right circumstances i am going to hazard a guess that you could heal a wound in a snap yeah now it's just you well you're double lucky herr clay we are dealing with a time-sensitive situation you are looking for a segue out of this predicament you're in herr clay we should be very honest with you we are intending to do good by people who deserve it a young one good people but we are going to do very difficult business tonight or tomorrow welcome to the mighty nein do you require anything you'll have it you'll have it motherfucking druid (whispering) we'll figure that out so let me tell you about the murderers we are dealing with first there was the dinosaurs (laughter) so only one hit point we didn't really discuss we got distracted we are going to find somebody spur of the moment tell them to come with us out to the woods to do a bit of dark business no i don't know if that's a good idea i don't like our options at the moment any of them really i feel like we don't have-- we are one more person than when we got our asses handed to us on the road and we thought we had the upper hand then now we have one more that is better but if we go to the town and we find a couple of ne'er-do-wells who'll work for coin we are convincing them to come with us right away into the woods into the woods what do you think if we do that the three of us would do the talking naturally well we could take them at night which we did not do before some of them would be awake probably not all of them we had the element of surprise before we hopefully have it now home turf is big you know nott i agree with you the most important thing is getting the people who are in that basement the most important thing you've always got to improvise the only thing that i believe is known is taking care of the people on that wall anyone outside i will send frumpkin around to see if there are more than just these two then we will have decisions to make we will need to send in frumpkin again or our new friend here one of us one of them and make a plan from there that is all we know now we need to do something and i feel a little on edge with our numbers but i am maybe more on edge by the ticking clock but what is it that lures the shepherds out of their hole that will put them in the courtyard it will not probably put them in the woods true ten i think we might be doing this now so be prepared for it frumpkin shoots up into the air and bounces off a tree i have an owl here it is-- that hits frumpkin is alive well it's 1d4 plus one and i rolled it last time and i rolled a four so it's 1d4 plus one i told him to go down low to the ground yeah ja i can but i poof into frumpkin's senses do i hear anything besides phil and mystery man ja because of the hearing oh that's good on the first roll the first roll is good so it is 18 who's in the building okay i snap my fingers and frumpkin vanishes leaving the bolt where he was and then i do it again he's here may i borrow one of your goodberries is this one okay i will take four one two three four you may keep that one thank you we could potentially keep moving now if we want to because-- yeah we know there's two on the wall maybe that's their mo every night there's two on the walls people are awake inside what is the hour right now 1033 yeah yeah it is oh i'm sorry 1034 now yeah approximately it's still 1034 i'm not going to do this right now we have a decision to make doesn't seem any better or worse from the outside but we are outside the onion are we going back to town to get a little more muscle or are we making a go of it here well how successfully could we silently kill these two on the wall you would be good at one but pitch it to me how you i know-- yeah but we have to finish the job instantly could also shoot him from the dark when he's not expecting it to happen no the people inside will hear it no we need silence no it's too early we need to wait it's 1035 at night we need to wait until they're asleep no how far is beauregard from me right now did you wander away from me (whispers) would you rather wait until they are sleeping in their beds before we did this i don't want this one moving along right now she makes a lot of noise if we are doing this i feel we should wait until it is late at night and wait until we see those guards changed and then wait a little bit further for the old guards to go to sleep yeah so there's a lot of sitting here and not moving i know we are all very anxious but we wait someone comes out relieves these two they go to bed and then we strike all at once then we do your plan it's just delayed that's all yeah but keg you stay here wait yeah you are just waiting until some of us are able to silently take out these people on the wall then we buy ourselves a little time while you can clink and clunk as we get closer it's good that you find levity in the situation then we go into the inside of this wall and take the next step well it's two groups and you move less right now thank goodness i have to pee so bad let's go back to town (elmo voice) elmosdaddy (elmo voice) (giggling) (elmo voice) everybody's going to die he's got a little board under there in the interim while we're waiting for that to happen i'm going to do two things one i'm going to cast mage armor on myself and i'm also going to pull a book out of one of the holsters and spend ten minutes changing frumpkin into a spider he has three hit points so i think he's actually a bigger spider than the one you're imagining see he's right there he's very big it's three hit points worth of spider somebody could step on it and he could still go get brian foster in here with his ping pong racket i put it on beau's shoulder i pull the haversack off and say i have a decent idea anyway i think that you should use this back to my idea okay nott on the other side can probably put a bolt in that guy's throat over there you can probably vault up the side of that wall if i'm not mistaken don't you think oh you told me about your ability to make things quiet around you when i hold him you yank him off of the wall and then humpty dumpty you know they can't put him back-- you know how it goes you are going to help beauregard here up onto the wall quietly after you use your-- whatever you call it then she gets up there and i am going to use my tricks to hold him and let her rip him off the wall and split his skull upon the stones beneath pretty complicated i pull out a little wire and whisper into it to nott and say i think we have an idea over here so we should probably get set well she's a party maker noise you know (clanking) matthew dm where would you say in relation to this map the two groups are so 150 feet apart probably like about that far ayy when you get on the wall off of nila's shoulders and you do the handhold thing you know what i'm talking about right underneath him that is an excellent idea yeah you and i we're good we have this little routine beauregard can do that on this side what about on your side you you're short what are you doing over there nott nott i have a question for you the plan is not foolproof but on our side over here beauregard's going to throw the asshole off the wall if you shoot your asshole and he does not die but starts screaming what do you do or you could attack at the same time said liam yeah the sequence of events is that you two need to get onto the wall successfully you've got your javelin tied up i say three two one no are they in place i'm going to hold hold person until these two are right under the guard use the dodeca if you need to luck you have luck still but you have a luck left you got one left no caleb seeing this would've went drei zwei eins hold person take a shot ten 16 oh held i send frumpkin up into the air to do a circle around the entire perimeter achtzehn 18 frumpkin saw all of this yeah saw the doors all of that i'm going to creep my way to the front door and as i go i'm going to cast detect magic yeah right to the outer wall yeah i will wait until i am within 30 feet of the wall and then i do so i will mutter a few words sexy i like this guy i take my wire and i say nott are you on the ground still can you meet me at the front gates quietly waiting very anxiously for my life partner oh son of a fuck come on ash sam and don't go lower than that that's got to be the worst seven plus-- we're at the front gate okay i can get this open but i would prefer to preserve my reserves so can you get this door open i miss being a rogue every day i pull out the wire and get it between my hands and whisper up to beauregard are we good is everything good up there from what you can see are we good there is another door over there let's get to that door we're at the front gate yeah so we have to get to that door there's no magic on the front door right it's like ten minutes so i've probably got four or five minutes left i think that we should cut around the side and go to the back they will probably be expecting that less yeah okay i think we should leave them for the moment to keep appearances up okay but are you able to-- i don't understand your people's ways but are you able to help her the way you helped beauregard earlier that ability you had to make beauregard-- so you could drop it and do it again who has it now let's tippy-toe around the back door i miss vax so much 14 plus ten whatever it is yeah no these two we asked them if they saw anything right before we went i'm going to guess that i have two or three minutes left on detect magic so does the door seem clear of that it was on my ipad luck luck luck is there any gap between the bottom of the door and the floor that frumpkin could fit through right now in you go buddy hold on to my hand please telepathically i tell frumpkin to crawl up the other side of the door and go onto the ceiling nila didn't tell us anything about a kitchen from her-- well that's where i will send frumpkin along the ceiling then when he gets to a door he can go down the door and under if there is a gap and then up the door are all these doors so far the same they are loose a half-inch for frumpkin i don't hear shit right now i will send frumpkin through the next gap no you can't tell me anything i will do this one here i will have frumpkin back away under the crack he is so little he is so small just one roll that's okay hold on everybody 14 wait everything's crazy i need a different browser window well i rolled a 14 but it's better than that it's 16 (singing) the itsy bitsy spider back under that door and he will peeky-poo under the door he has not checked yet yeah this door this one here to the bottom any cracks that are a half-inch wide big enough for a spider i remember this okay that's a wall covered by that paper there that you don't need to uncover right back out of this i know where i am i will go along the wall here frumpkin will crawl on the wall oh you can't see where i'm pointing yeah and crawl around the corner and peek around the corner into that colored spot this is too complicated for me to mutter so i'm not telling everybody this this is too complicated i don't hear anything and you're nowhere near me what i will do is send frumpkin down this hallway because i did not go this way yet i remember this from her stories so i will continue frumpkin up the stairs time is passing because he's not that quick we'll make for the wall at that point what does frumpkin need to do armor class right zwölf he scurries away-- no he scurries up onto the wall up onto the ceiling 20 feet there's a bug in this world and i won't rest until he's dead matt i don't know if this will happen in time but what i tell him to do telepathically because i should be close enough 100 feet is to go in here through this door that's open and over the door and down the back and once he's out of sight i will poof him out if that works they might hit him before it happens it's a spider but he disappears in the back of the door that was wild okay yes oh hi again there's two of them i pull a wire out and i aim towards my friends on the horses there's two of them six seconds go by there's two of them on the first floor what do we do i saw what the firbolg woman told us about there is a trapdoor not too far from us here (whispers) ja okay that's good we have to be very quiet here's what we do frumpkin i take frumpkin oh there's frumpkin i place frumpkin on your shoulder you have to go in this door and i'm going to talk into your ear i'm going to hold keg's shoulder and i am going to talk into your ear and tell you which way to go to get you to the trapdoor okay and you have to be very quiet yeah and see if that trapdoor is open if it is you will put my spider underneath and we will see what is going on if it's unlocked do not go in yourself right away send in frumpkin to look i will be watching the whole time it's fine halt i cast-- ja i cast knock on the door at every turn-- listen to me at every turn when you can go left or right if frumpkin who will be resting on your ear tickles the inside of the ear it means go right if nothing happens go left tickle means right you've got it my hand is on keg's shoulder in case things go to shit tickle means right left is nothing no tickle tickle i drop it we're in go i walk into the building that's not what i expected 21 did the sound of clattering pans clatter outside did the people outside hear it i slap my hand down on keg's shoulder and i with a free hand stick licorice root into my mouth and start chewing and squeeze her shoulder and you are hasted and i will-- a couple of things and i can't find my card right now but you have a plus two to your ac you have advantage on dexterity saving throws and an additional action on each of your turns you are very fast right now i start moving into the building as far as i can actually behind nott by the doorway yeah that's good pressing into the wall there so that people can get by me oh that's terrible that's up to you she's got another ten feet no tell her nothing blue fabric yeah i should be able to see just over or under nila's legs or something that one last asshole i'm going to do a fastball special a fire bolt at him i rolled a 15 to hit phil oh gut (gasps) i rolled a ten out of ten (whoosh) that's it it's just a cantrip does it okay 13 part of me really likes the way fire feels that's it ah no i'm going to back up ten feet what do you do mom fucking slavers redrum whatever you want sumalee i'm being a nerd have fun no stab and disengage keg is right there to the bad guy am i mistaken but i mean sneak attack damage-- i didn't even see the miniature beyond the door i didn't know she was there tight tight tight he's just that good it's jeff bridges in the big lebowski bing bang bong bing bong bing bong she's on the ground though and she is out of it so you could fucking goodfellas the shit out of that woman or whatever whatever you want it is advantage but it's not an auto crit get that motherfucker get it get it girl get it get it what is it normally zip there's nobody to attack cocaine oh my turn oh jeez louise okay i'm going to move forward back towards where i see nila in there that's as far as i can go i'm going to go towards keg yeah and i may do nothing but-- dm can i dance back and forth like this and see what i can see through that doorway can i see this one oh look there's somebody laughing and giggling on the floor fire bolt that is a 13 done and done wait why what (gasps) you motherfucker matthew mercer we will have words about the rules that exist wow it's dispelled but the stun still happens that's some bullshit matthew whatever you say but still that's some bullshit yeah it's wasted on all saving throws the hit points are phenomenal oh no come on maybe if we offer taliesin's new character in exchange for our lives we can get out of this you know you want to roll a halfling sorcerer come on we just destroyed the door (singing) welcome back wow i have a joke i'm going to keep it in my head this is all going much worse than i intended it to so i am going to tug on the glove and i'm going to slap it and send out three-- get him beauregard you're the monk scorching ray three times on the barbarian first one is shit second is a 15 first is total shit second is a 15 third is better than that that is eight for the first and eight for the second i have had very bad luck with people's skulls so i am going to send the fire into her thighs and legs and burn the bottom of her torso and even the center of her being her stomach and make it burn in upon itself and harden in blackened crust that's a 13 that's the first time i did that first time i did not go into a state (breathing heavily) stay alert we're not done here wait for me nott wait for me attune to the sword i will find nott have you done everything that you could here we all should've drunk more it is no shame on you i place my hand on the trapdoor-- the door is locked i place my hand on the door and i cast knock i'm going to walk through and find that trapdoor that i've already seen through frumpkin's eyes yes please i back up about 15 feet out of this little cubby a reach around your mother watches this show right is it open open it no i hold up frumpkin i place him on the edge of the trapdoor and send him scrambling under to look 15 we learned so much last week taliesin was hanging like tom cruise in a mission impossible movie just above the table waiting to drop in and we all thought it would happen near the end of the episode but it didn't it didn't how does it feel to finally let that little bit of rope cut and be in the game again i like this guy i like pink more than purple if i can say yes i like pink a little more than purple what i don't like about this is that the asshole was sleeping upstairs and we don't know about that at all but i send frumpkin along the ceiling and through-- that looks like a barred gate i will attempt to send frumpkin over his head along the ceiling stealthily humanoid that's it i'm going to keep going and you said roll-- very good that is a 19 yeah he pauses he's looking for green or blue or goth ja so would frumpkin be at the edge of that gate i rolled a 19 last we checked and that was 20 seconds ago do i see this (popping) there are more people down there this is the x-factor we spoke about i saw two down there correct right but i mean in that last room and i did not see lazlo so he could be upstairs no it's lazlo i'm pretty sure (laughter) we do not know that we know that there is one random shithead and two more beyond that and i did not see lorenzo or lazlo or larkin yeah he's either behind us or down below ja there were some people in cages but i did not get a good look at them through my spider's eyes here is what i think we have a bit of a bottleneck here at this trapdoor if they want to come up they have to deal with us ja so if the majority of us wait at this trap door and i send my spider upstairs to see what's going on to see if our friend is up there we can learn about upstairs and if anyone pokes their head out of that door they're going to lose it let's keep figuring things out yeah close it quietly and if anyone has a look around-- wait it's true you look like one of the guys upstairs you could go down and tell them but well you are putting a lot on the line for people you've just met tonight yeah simultaneously caleb will slap his hand down on keg's shoulder and send frumpkin on the ceiling or on the first floor towards the stairwell at the front of the building roll fucking high marisha oh my god (cheering) phil am i right caleb is not here he is in the spider spidering frumpkin is still climbing towards the stairwell up and i am computing everything that our druid friend told me about the stairs to see if big man is asleep in his room (singing) so many maps i tell you what i'm going to do i'm at the top of these stairs boy it's hard to say because the map is gone but i think what i will do is i'll drop out of frumpkin for a moment and i have 30 feet of movement so i will walk 25 feet towards those stairs yeah yeah towards the second floor oh wow if i'm able i will stand on my own and go back into frumpkin and wait because he is far ahead of me frumpkin and my friends are mostly behind me but i'm okay i can't hear anything oh that's great do i feel you next to me do i if i feel the dwarf next to me i would use a free hand to jam some licorice back into my mouth and start chewing furiously anxiously i'm so scared of everything and cast haste again into the dwarf one minute ja i know you are again on methamphetamines no your luck is dead oh you saved it (inhales) oh no it's a one that's right whatever one you want (quietly) i don't like it i have so much murder in my eye right now what do you mean things are really bad in the mighty nein when nott is the soft member of the group see player characters killed live in indianapolis sumalee sam and i were talking about bullshit before the beginning of the game and i forget the context but he was talking about you and i said no she's never played she played one practice game before this and sam's brain went (explosion) no no no we're not they cut the stream tell us about your politics
