we all had to fought to be heard that time i think matt went dead inside i guess somebody at this table used to go to furry conventions it does not go well with fur i have a bunch as well and there's copies for us in this building somewhere yeah that's it could be character development the baby is sitting playing dungeons & dragons with us liam and send those suggestions to @laurabaileyvo on twittercom well we played the game once in that back office so we could just move to you and then bring the stuff with us dwarven forge dwarven forge dwarven forge i liked that guy though he was good he was talented he was burned alive in front of me i am well aware that i killed a person i have nothing else to say why is everyone looking at me i'm okay it was terribly grisly his hair was on fire and he burned horribly maybe it went a little further than i anticipated-- i have killed people before in defense ja but not like that okay that sounds good would you like to know what they are before you put them on look over here you look like a nerd yeah i don't have ability i understand certain magics if you want me to explain what those things are before you try them willy-nilly yes i can tell you-- may i see it yeah you know i'm just going to check d&d beyond to see if i-- yeah i'm all tapped but-- i will tell you something i will tell you something i don't need to have this ring i can tell you what it is i do but i need a pearl i say to fjord i need a somewhat valuable pearl then i can do it all day long i can know what anything is even though i am tired is that worth about a hundred gold pieces oh yes let me-- can i borrow this this is not instantaneous since i am so tired it takes me a little bit longer i wedge out one of my books and i set it on the ground it's up to you i haven't done this in a while and i'm excited to do it but i could hold off a little okay i take the book and i close it and then i put it back no i have both the ring and the one that fjord gave me so if it's good for you you may have it i'm more interested in executing skill before we even go into the building i go over to nott and adjust the hood a little bit further forward the ears are in and make sure that the mask is secure have fun yeah i'm okay it was a rough night i did no i did not see a vision i saw a burning person let's go get a drink i'm going to find a corner table in the ruckus i will take the ring with the pearl and i hold it right here i pull out the other ring and i look at it and i begin to focus and study the different angles of it and hope that i have a pearl of enough value to make things happen it's already out you know when you play d&d you don't narrate taking a pooper but you can assume that the characters take a pooper every day some things just happen yes oh this is good you may have it i don't get into water too much as you could guess this is good for walking yourself upon water you take this as promised yeah but also why is there a dickbutt in my spellbook i don't know maybe it was nott pulling a prank on me no i don't need-- well i do want one drink but i don't need a ton of drinks this is my thing so what else did we get i will take the wand thank you i need another ten minutes fjord would you get me a second whiskey by the time you get back maybe i will understand what this is ten minutes later (sighs) it's fascinating (laughter) is she full of shit what do i roll yeah i got a 15 no it's for me i gave you the ring that's the deal i promised it to you and now you have it if i tell you you will try to steal it from me no it's too dangerous (laughter) fine do you want to know what it does i will show you what it does i point this stick at jester it is a charisma saving throw oh it's just a stick no told you a low what i promise you'll have these back because i cannot lift them would you put them on the table for me hold the ring and wait they are a very strange one if you are feeling gassy they take away the cramps you feel you have to wear them it's extraneous it's too much it's overkill these are shit i slide them off the table-- i want to do it again what do we have give me the thing okay yeah oh no this is great it's very powerful it is a fine weapon probably better than anything-- except maybe for your blade is anyone able to use a glaive i can't do anything with it do you know what this is it is a very good sale at a pawn shop well it's very painful if it hits you that's it most definitely it is magical yes stronger than your average glaive that's what i am saying yeah you know people in zadash who's got the monster calves to carry this there you go here oh my goodness yeah like 45 minutes have gone by looking at all these things he just puts it away he puts the wand down in front of jester it just hurts people do you know how to use arcane artifacts what he's not gone he's always with me and he will be back tomorrow yeah it burns people like i burned that man would you like to trade your goggles for them you have that very fancy sword you have does it mean that much to you would you like it okay here it is i don't know no he's good i don't move at the speed of your thought i'm sorry that i kept it for myself enjoy i will not take any of the spoils of anything we find anywhere enjoy it does hurt people you seem very angry at me right now i'm slowly ever so slowly beginning to like you so please don't fuck it up this is what people do is she still smiling it's constitution though isn't it i said constitution to you okay i'm sure i'll fail it 15 i will also pay for a room for nott and caleb wait did you just ja did you pay for everybody or for you danke i'm going to go get my cat i go up well i first take out the silver thread and i cross it across the door and if there's any windows there i do the same and allow for nott to enter and leave then i draw patterns along the floor that spread up onto the table as well and back down onto the floor i squat with my book since i am tapped and i begin to bring back my cat an hour and ten minutes later i don't know if they're asleep or not i have this cat named frumpkin and i wear him like a scarf come here i promise-- i promise not to do that too often i just scritch for a long time i'm sure that one's not important i know (singing) fuck balls did you give me a pouch when did you do that oh what is in it let's see one two and then ten minutes later-- did you say 113 okay so after counting it all i separate it and i put some jerky down-- go have it-- to frumpkin and i push 60 gold across the floor come here i have a question the metal on the ring with the pearl in it what is it made of can i tell i cannot remember but caleb can because of keen mind brass is that part of the alchemy that i can do yeah that is correct copper silver wood i just can't remember if it is do we have a player's handbook brass is not on it okay then i'm going to spend the last 30 minutes before bed trying to slowly wedge the pearl out of the ring i don't want the ring 15 brass i take what's left of the ring and i throw it across the room for frumpkin to go chasing it across go chase that (whispering) we are assholes i would remember exactly i don't but i do hold because if he knows he has to tell me because i picked the right feat for it a hundred a piece already we are so excited over chump change to vox machina
