straight on goes a little bit to the left a bit of-- i go sit down next to kash excuse me if i may all i want to say is that you are a very impressive man in many ways you are handsome and capable that's a little creepy but other than that you are very very capable-- percival i'm having trouble focusing so if you could sort of go behind kash no no no no no no there's only one man for me all i'm saying is-- (slurring) we could use your help all right i know you're a bit of a mercenary but you are a very capable man and there is a lot at stake there is a lot at stake there are dragons they killed-- i'm not going to get into it but i implore you to look past yourself and please try to think of the greater world (stuttering) i'm an admirer-- yes also one last thing you know what never mind i don't want to talk about that and i wander off into the other side of the room (muffled) it's dark in this closet how do you get this closet door open i can't get back out here what is high school vex i can't get out of this closet (mournfully) i rolled a one i can't get out of this closet as hard as i try we're identical i think we need to go to bed 17 hours later (laughter) that was great man [break] grog can you get this door open (laughter) is grog fighting yeah right now a lot of horses and chickens around here too everywhere will kima be there hey (whispers) yes 13 but let's talk about-- my bad i've got all my dragon lore over here just give me a second may i ask-- vestiges the word in these legends it seems vague does no one know anything about what they were is that a stand-in for things we don't understand or know about what are these vestiges we just parted ways with her-- (groans) i have such a headache and i very obviously chug the entire thing let's count out the things that we want to do not what we're going to choose just what we have to do and then we'll choose something we've got the cobalt reserve which may or may not be totally fucked right okay so there's osysa's mate down by westruun in the mountains yeah we've got your people three options are we forgetting anything let's just talk-- i mean if we're spiraling out right earthbreaker's here ashari are close by and then we're talking about in and around westruun level up lead the way shitkicker verily verily (whispers) what's he talking about grog 34 i would just like to point out that i am mostly sober natural 20 25 off a natural 20 i'm peeing just a little bit 25 off a natural 20 click my boots of haste (laughter) and use my bonus action to hide behind grog's thigh and hold my turn until grog moves towards the earthbreaker when he does it i'm gonna go with him and fight him if i can oh boy oh boy well let me just think for ten seconds only yeah okay so i use my bonus action to hide do i need to roll for that yeah that's a-- no that's fine because remember i'm me so that is that's a 25 i guess behind grog no i'm going to throw fucking daggers at this guy because i'm first oh my god i am first is 24 and then so i used my bonus action to hide which means i can do two right so the second is not that great using luck better second is a 30 okay now this is i'm the first to attack which means that it is-- ooh it's a 19 i'm sharpshooter man 60 okay so i'm hidden behind grog so it should be sneak attack and i'm the first to go so it's a crit it's not a sneak attack even though i used my bonus to hide behind grog's big fat leg he's huge all right okay i'm drunk and fighting in a pit all right all right so there is no sneak attack but it is crit right because i'm the first to attack he's not surprised oh god i'm drunk tell me what's going on one plus seven's eight and then eight eight and eight okay i'm gonna use uncanny dodge oh i'm sorry scanlan shorthalt that is amazing grog grog grog do we really want to do this he's down he's asleep are we doing this are we really doing this he's asleep we're not trying to kill him we want him to work with us excuse me all right so i use disen-- no i don't have to yeah okay so i got two daggers in my hands and they spin around in my hand and i just start beating him in the head yes it is because grog's right there 21 oh well then it is a 32 and then the second one is a 27 and the third one is a 17 first two hit and the first one is sneak attack with the blunt edge yeah it is oh i'm so sorry nine plus-- whoa that is ten 16 22 23 25 is 50 plus the-- 59 59 for the first ooh that's the wrong one and then the second dagger does ten and i'm gonna use my movement to run around and to roll around behind grog's buttocks acrobatics to hit oh that's an attack even though he was unconscious yeah i'm feeling that uncanny dodge ah fucking ankle come on yes i'm so acrobatic no that hits two of those hit like a tree cracking in the wind from this guy okay got it got it got it he's still pressed up against grog right all right i'm gonna use disengage and pivot around grog right run all around the circle and get behind scanlan yeah and i'm gonna throw two daggers at him yeah the first one's okay natural 20 wait it's natural 20 on top of a sneak attack what happens you double the sneak-attack let me take a moment (laughter) okay that's a nine okay think i want to savor this all right so oh my god (counting) 23 doubled quadrupled-- 23 28 not quadrupled oh so sneak attack is not doubled then on top-- all right so it doesn't stack yeah but he's he's up against grog so i get-- so i double sneak-attack damage 23 the sneak-attack damage is-- 56 all right yeah 68 critical hit on a sneak attack got it got it got it i'm gonna use my last bit of luck so that he has to roll again okay oh all right and i duck behind scanlan yeah sure it's that was a four ten no i rolled i rolled a bunch of times didn't i roll a bunch of times okay all right well she rolled a 20 i rolled a oh that did fine it's a 27 second one is ten nine i'm scared to death which is why the math is so bad don't want to be fighting you plus inspiration it's a 23 it's uma thurman it's fucking kill bill marisha and but he's a sponge on your same page your spell page come on scanbo i just drop to my knees so i can aim better and right over scanlan's shoulder dagger dagger dagger okay first one is a one so that misses second one is a 23 disadvantage for what oh shite well the first one was a one and a-- i don't remember what it was sorry all right so this is the second attack that is a 17 third attack is a 21 and just under my breath i say so fucking cool (laughter) you said the last one whoa buddy debatable oh thanks he van damme'd it you might already know this but i'm wearing my cloak of displacement so he should be at disadvantage to hit me yeah thanks i want to use one action to grab scanlan by his purple shirt and rip him and pull him away sure with boots of haste on that's fine that's fine i rip him i yank him away and throw the little bugger and then throw a dagger past grog at him for-- not that great 19 19 that's it okay so i threw him i threw a dagger and missed and i just juke to the right and get behind grog we got this guys me once grog once-- uncanny dodge that hits so first one uncanny dodge second one full brunt i'm vax every time seven yeah nine points okay okay it's gonna be great 14 yes yep (strained noise) (garbled yell) gently i'm okay no wait wait (vomiting noises) i'm ready come on it was their loincloths come on and as keyleth helps me away i say to kord it was an honor thank you whatever his name is (laughter) what a fun episode
