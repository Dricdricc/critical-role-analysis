that's confusing hey marvel animated has started to use me as doctor strange so (cheering) and also if you need to put your dice in something you should go to wyrmwoodgamingcom and use the code 'critrole' which will get you free shipping they're beautiful many of you have been purchasing them they're lovely to make nice presents for yourself or for another person let's hear it also for the app called waze which got me here at 720 instead of 745 yeah mm-hm yeah that dragon's days are numbered are we assuming it's going to be as easy as all that to have kima with us i think so yes how long do you need to get what you have done you need a day little rusty after three weeks folks we need to carve out a plan kash is right we should pick something short-term and do something because-- well we need allies and we need power because we're not in shape to take care of a coven of dragons at the moment seems like slightly lower-hanging fruit than the other option marisha and oh good grief yes yes get your perv on emphatically i'm already 20 paces away i go stealth 27 i literally just pivoted around my sister and pressed against her hey big guy no no i was able to dodge both ways apart and then came back together it's my cloak does that context is everything i say we let keyleth handle it we swish out and camp for the night so for the next eight hours with a little bit of concentration we can jump back and forth next four hours we can spend a minute to go (foomf) and (foomf) yes i remember it's ice and how thick is it based on what she just did oh just an inch ooh yeah no 71 i take her braid and i start wringing it out do you want to try to cloud-creep our way in there yeah we're going to camp for the night i don't think we should-- i'm going with her well let's just use the magic you already expended first twin farts can we breathe percy we did some science that didn't work yeah sit on the ground your hair's a mess i undo the braid and i just -- starting over hold still i go to the edge of the loch and watch i'm with kash man what fin fin it's going to be a big day tomorrow we should probably get some sleep (scottish accent) oh you're going to loch anus are you i'll take first watch (laughter) what are you doing man we take fucking turns all right i find the only empty spot of fur on trinket left and snuggle into it big angry bastards half the audience is going yeah and half the audience is going what the fuck are they talking about where did you get those thieves' tools where did you get them did you buy them stole them from where when i don't remember that did that happen in-game or did you make that up yeah where what the-- wait i wanted to talk to him you've got to wait (laughter) percival de rolo how are you doing a lot's going on a lot but it hasn't been that long has orthax fully left the building it is can i tell you i believe you are a good man if you listen to your better angels and they're within your friends listen to them i don't want to be pushy i'm sorry but you have a family if you want it i think we all are yeah i agree with that how do you mean i wish i felt that way well i started talking to you i just-- i'm sorry if i've done anything to offend you we're a bit of an awkward family but we are trying this is all a lot bigger than us individually now (laughs) there's comfort in that all right i've said my piece you are really fucking cool you know that don't you even if my sister's waking up i kick her hard in the ass 22 i am of course reminded of the giant roc is it the same shape after i've kicked her i grab keyleth by the shoulder and i start waking her up roc roc roc shut the fuck up hm my ears feel really hot this morning i don't know why that is what i'm going to take a walk around the whole thing and see if i can see anything on the edges did a 22 perception check around the edge of the loch find anything yeah it's good that you have it but just hold onto it for a rainy day ten minutes that's more than enough time grog are you ready to dig let's just get in there let's not destroy the loch i start pulling oh thank god i'm so strong that is-- i'm going to use luck and that's shit 11 11 remember how happy you were that i was alive that's not going to last much longer dying in slow motion over here we are sinking in the mud over here keyleth can you walk down this way while still doing that and scanlan can you use bigby's hand to block the hole once keyleth is past you yeah and then keyleth can you make a wall of stone once you've let down the water let's do it hold it scanlan hold it for a moment well we could risk it or-- keyleth are you able to put up a wall are you talking to her or me i let them argue and i skulk forward while they're fighting natural 20 get your purvan we got a very nice anniversary present from megzilla from meg she's a unifying entity yes yes i can draw all the penises i want on him they just cut the power on our show i'm 20 feet ahead and i-- sorry rolled a 30 for perception we've already got company i see two small little buggers ahead of me i don't know what they are i don't know yet just wait for a second i'm going to sit for a minute one minute and see what they do i am really well-hidden i am covered in mud the twins are dark right now is there any light here dim light they're walking in pitch black right are we all huddled together at this point they came up behind me right yeah so you're talking into your ear to me what what's going on it sounded like that but i can't see shit down here zahra you were able to see you can't see shit either i pull out my flametongue dagger and make dim light well we can follow the fish brothers or we could check out these two tunnels you got played what is it you think i should go-- you want me to scout ahead all right i walk past-- what the fuck is wrong with you (laughter) i really can't get a bead on you i grasp his giant fucking forearm and lean out with the dagger and how far can i see with this dim light so there's a big gap and then there's more path further you're not here you don't even know what we're doing i can but let's see what the others find on their end and then we'll figure out if we want to deal with this i heard it as well we don't want to split up wait there for a minute on our end there's a big chasm over here and there is a path on the other side of it but we'd have to get over the chasm but you've got a complete stairway over there with boogers on it traps i'm looking for traps yeah i'm using the light from her thumb or whatever i don't know why i rolled both at the same time 22 for me 22 i'm going to take a closer look at those things do i need to roll anything if i see them now because she's pointed them out i'm going to try to disarm them they look like things i've seen before they look like traps i'm going to try to disarm them what is disarm traps dexterity check an intellect check not the thieves' tools plus the intelligence modifier 23 then yeah instinctually i do evasion if it's dexterity i rolled a 12 plus-- 22 scythes in the wall my nose tickles right now i'm going to attempt to take these out and-- hold on thieves' tools to disarm right investigation all right 13 grog there's giant scythes in the wall or something and i can't figure out how to take it apart do you have a weapon that you could jam in this fucker like a throwaway weapon that you don't care about do you want to fucking fuck this knife hole with a sword are you saying it's not blocked it's just some rubble and you can step over it it's pooped into the passage thank you this is my profession (laughter) vex could you tell zahra to come up another 20 feet or so 22 so i had a fucked-up passage on the right behind me i've got a t ahead of me that goes in two directions but there's a hole in the middle of the t and there's nothing else i back up against zahra and i say to everyone else because she's right next to me we've got a t in the passage here but there's a big fucking hole in the way so we're going to need to use our neverending rope perhaps or some means of getting over this hole if we want to go forward how strong are you can't carry any one person over maybe a gnome oh hold on i've got this figured out hold on hold on shush eenie meany miney mo catch a tiger by the toe-- eenie meany miney mo we go rightwards that's a 30-something 30-- and there's nothing here 31 (groans) there's a bunch of bullshit on this wall and a raven's head and i don't know what any of it fucking means what do i hear if i knock on the wall that we're looking at doesn't feel hollow we should just leave (laughter) smart bear wait what are you doing over there wait up-- okay go for it do me proud well that was lucky i'm going to catch up with the ladies and acrobatics over to them 20-- 33 excuse me wait a second hold on a second this is the only thing we can do 25 30 35 (whispers) all right everybody get ready to play i reach down-- are there any rocks or pebbles or anything on the ground i take a pebble i throw it all the way towards the platform what's the matter (whispers) what's the matter stealthing to the side stealth stealth stealth stealth stealth is this new stealth who was this made by dwarven forge 29 for something 19 19 for vax okay she's very focused and studying our styles i dunno if this laser pointer's going to work since there's now a wall in the way i'm going to go up the side-- i'm going to hit my heel against the other heel-- yeah that's great (laughter) yeah and you tell me if it's surprise i don't know but i'm going before fish guy up on the dais i can't make it work over these walls i'm going to chuck three daggers at fish guy up here on the dais through the window but because i go first i get advantage on all attacks against guy on the dais yeah is 28 second one is 14 and the third one is 27 all three hit so the first one we'll do a sneak attack on and here we go oh sorry advantage thank you 11 for the first ten for the second and eight for the third right but because i have advantage i automatically-- so yes sneak attack on the first-- the first one was-- i rolled a full four so that's four plus eight plus-- that's 13 19 24 28 32 34-- that's the dice 34 so 68 plus seven is 75 you double the dice yeah sneak attack sorry i always get this fucking shit confused sorry so half of that is so 34 plus seven is 41 always get it confused every fucking time i'd like to use the rest of my movement just to sink down with my back against the wall out of the way of the window 50 from whoever's in the lead i'm under cover i'm pressed to a wall i saw a flash of something wake up everybody ah he's moving i always like the bail out at the end four more years (laughter) it's going to be 'uge look at this guy he's cold as the universe only she can get away with that none of the rest of us can i'm going to use cunning action to hide and then i'm going to run along the back wall to the pillar by-- across from vex at the back of the chamber and if counting is right i'm 60 feet away from the beholder just within right that's what i thought and i'm going to throw three daggers at his fuckin' eyeball two attacks but i got the hasted boots on i clicked the heels oh right thanks and do i have advantage-- no one's near him right all right use my last luck no that's okay because i'm me so that is 25 all right so the first attack was an eight-- 18 okay so the first attack was 18 plus-- sorry it was 30-- and the second attack was 28 one plus two five ten 11 15 16 17 20 for the first no 27 and then the second attack is-- ten i also make a little like raspberry noise at the end and go (pffbt) how high does he go come on use luck if it's sucky it's like a balloon in the macy's day parade so technically that's a gamble and if the thing you ask for never happens you forfeit your turn did you remember hunter's mark so you can just chime in and say 'fuck what i said i'm going now' think i'll take a walk over every part of the wall can you show me where his glance is again with that doohickus you have i'm going to use cunning action to hide yeah evasion yeah don't worry that's 30 hide that is a 25 i'm going to run past trinket along the back wall all around the edge over to where vex and kash are i'm going to keep pushing along-- i'm going to get between them and i know that slows the movement down but i want to be in there and i'm going to use my two actions left to throw daggers at the floating fucking bowling ball with eyes oh wow so the first one is a 21 yeah second one is a 17 so it's a measly little attack of nine no i use the last of my movement to lower down behind kash (laughter) slow motion he's fine come on scanlan is it on the ground or five feet above the ground and i start running to the edge kima are you all right i'm going down i'm rappelling rappelling rappelling hold on yeah yeah i'll give a-- piggy-back you up come on just wait a moment hold on let's tie you up grog i'm going to tie her up you're going to pull her up first and then throw it down and get me yeah-- no almost just pull kima up step two is coming and i'm going to use perception on this pile of bones down here as she gets yanked up that's some labyrinth of jareth shit right there 15 a very average 15 okay i'm looking through some bones oh wow are there any fish-guy bones i play a couple of them on the wall do a little song grog throw down the rope please pretty please thank you evil shit why are you rolling twice what's going on the fuck happened i run over i'm already running over i'm picking her up what happened i was only down there for 30 seconds i'm pouring a healing potion in her mouth i'm pouring a greater potion in her mouth the fuck is going on what are you hesitating for do it whatever the fuck you're going to do do it do it depending on what she does i'd like to do something next i do i pull my sister in close and i say take me instead you raven bitch 11 you were knocked out yeah i'm not crying stupid i walk out of the chamber would she or would i
