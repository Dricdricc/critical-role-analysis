the cold flower which one is the-- which one is run through those really fast oh god too fast corpse flower it's the only thing i can remember he said it too fast got almost all of it out yeah i will walk behind beauregard also question what is the temperature like here on this island are we tropical at this point caleb would then have taken his coat off and twisted it up and tied it to the back of his coat so he's just with the holstered books and his shirt sleeves rolled up at this point since it's so hot no i just tied it onto the back of my pack rolled it up like a carpet gesundheit 26 (whispering) they're not saying anything may i have a look at this one not the rubies are there any runes on this thing does it seem arcane in nature yeah how does everyone feel about a ten-minute breather here i sit down and unholster my book and begin to cast identify as a ritual no one at a time do you have a quicker way it's only ten minutes yeah this sucks nott here's your toy back was all of that for all to hear or are they off a bit yeah i'm good break time over 29 natural 20 i would also say as we're tromping through that i would push forward and try to catch up with jamedi momentarily oh jeez what is that excuse me two questions for you what's that how much further a day's travel or more than one day until we reach our destination and did you encounter any kind of threats anything specific that we should be on guard for or prepared for you mentioned that you avoided them you did not tangle with them yourself makes sense i cast mage armor right in front of him on myself thank you see you later i'm going back to my earlier position you said it's also darker now as i chew on some liquorice root while that is going on i walk over and stand next to caduceus and say hey hello would you hang out with me for a moment excellent let's stand right here i casually pull out the wire and i cast message to nott nott would you please go i need you to speak to avantika and jamedi together for a moment please ja just distract them please after a moment passes i stand behind caduceus' tall frame and quietly cast detect magic even for jamedi oh i need to walk up and learn more about this dance then oh ja verstehen okay i still want to see what he's carrying what are you two doing over here you're holding up we need to move i try to catch up to him i pass them by try to catch up i creep up to just about 30 feet away i quickly turn around and through the wire say (whispering) there's four lizard people over here looking in the distance at them and at jamedi before this spell fades 16 roughly how far away is that fray also do i see anything glowing on jamedi okay the path that they took away does it line up or deviate from the general direction that we have been heading in okay i have been spending this entire debate looking north and remembering everything that i saw on the way here from the boat and just calculating an exit strategy because i remember the things that i saw on the way here (shouting) or masturbate good riddance no i'm able to affect its color and have it match it still looks like a very smooth bubble that is 8-feet tall-- maybe not that big but it can match the general color yeah it does not glow i spend the next 11 minutes i pull out the book unholster it and start doing a ritual cast ja leomund's tiny hut is this where we want to do it jester okay just a little longer then do we want it just to be us and they have the tent at the surroundings here or what we're behind a little bit of stone ruins or-- then it's gray the same color as the stone i have control of the color also out of curiosity i am a transmutation wizard so do i have a sense of how old the stone surrounding us is ugh bad roll 12 the thing is if i exit this bubble now then it goes away i could do it again-- they went to do a perimeter sweep the good news is we're totally safe in this bubble and nothing can happen to us vier four six seconds done he doesn't know barbarians i drop the hut it's gone seeing what i see i've got the transmuter stone i can see in dim light so i'm feeling into my satchel and i take out some molasses and smear it on my hands and cast slow on-- i'll come as far as i can over here behind yasha to see what i can see i will come this way not getting closer to them yeah that's fine that's good and cast slow on the two creatures that i see dc 16 yeah no no apologies if i have any movement left i will back away from that shit palms are sweaty you just roll your eyes at us at this point that made me so happy 12 caleb is going to quick-walk over to avantika kneel down and say are you all right with his back to spaghetti and cast identify on one of the swords okay my back is to him it was almost a one but it wasn't that's pretty good it's 19 the rapier pat the cheeks we're good it's gone but it only takes me 11 minutes i don't know are we safe where we are did they seem like intelligent beasts that's better that's a 20 still animalistic knowing that i would recommend that if i make the bubble again even if some more of them come as long as we stay safe for the next ten minutes if they come we will be still and sleeping and all they would see is a round stone they're animals they will leave i will begin my ritual spell in the same spot mecca lecca hi mecca hiney ho ten-foot radius so 20 from one side to the other ja i'll take the first shift i'm good i'm very jittery tonight frumpkin by the way is flitting about a little bit from person to person while we talk even lands on avantika's shoulder a little bit and does a little-- entschuldigung i'm sorry now the owl is pitter-patting on avantika's hat not constantly but in a cute way are you putting the umlaut over the o's in the poop pyoop he flitters up to the finger he does whatever i say he bats his little one-ounce owl eyes at avantika frumpkin poops one also we're being very quiet because we don't want to be heard but while we're in here frumpkin over a period of ten or 15 minutes you see this goes (pitter-patting) along the ground and hops onto avantika's boot (pitter-pattering) eventually stands on top of her dagger and i cast identify through touch of my familiar and he weighs one ounce oh i'm sure it's terrible hold on a second i am it is 11 why did you do that you know why i did that ey okay don't mind me while i make another owl i begin casting find familiar to bring back frumpkin as a one-ounce owl (laughter) i promised beauregard an owl for a week so i can't have my cat back ten minutes later there's an owl watch is over (whispering) i like cats yeah ja you can go out and in and you can-- sorry you can put your weapons through it but no magic will go in or out but you can leave and come back anytime you want but please don't go on any walkabouts while we are sleeping but you already did do you promise that is good enough for me good night (snoring) to be fair we all had indian for dinner tonight so it could be any one of us it's a slow roll laughter it took a minute and then it caught like fire (laughter) hm yeah okay okay well say the word and i'll pull it down do the running man in the mud beau owl on your head you've got mono yeah natural 20 plus 10 the blessing woo 30 maxed out jeez 30 it's somewhere in the building we'll find it and we are hanging back at this point but not in the thick of it we're seeing this all from a distance i was thinking about spells yeah i'm ritual casting through this discussion comprehend languages it's just ed i did not prepare the spell to disguise myself i thought we would be fighting monster people so what are you marisha or-- comforting what do we think that these beings' reaction will be to not lizard-people being on this island all of a sudden you think it's an every day or every week or month occurrence i think we're probably pretty special here i think that if anyone that looks like me or you shows up on this island anyone who sees it is going to come asking questions immediately and the clothes we've seen on these people are like what they're purple robes you've mentioned (groaning) i begin to put-- ugh-- my spell books into fjord's bag yeah i can't have ornate book holsters and-- ugh trying to make myself look as simple as possible i had that spell once i'll look like a 1980s halloween costume come on make me look like spiderman you look pretty convincing how do i look what do you mean-- what did you say is that better i lean in way in to nott's ear and say (whispering) oh by the way caduceus says that jamedi is actually a dead thing (whispering) i was telling nott that jamedi is a dead thing caduceus says jamedi's dead (whispering) keep it on the dl (whispering) are you whispering too (whispering) we don't have a choice (whispering) what if we let the pirate queen tie rocks to our feet and we're dead we have to do this we can kill them later we've seen you flit about yeah 25 rogues man rogues so an intersection to go through to get to the right turn past it don't you listen to her i'm going to go listen to your tapes your level seven tapes it's just the bottom of the structure that curves around i cast comprehend languages abyssal you're going to take a dive distraction is them yeah actually we should chase them and kill them because they could actually snap out of it at any second kill them yeah that's right ja they would kill us we watched them skinning the inhabitants of this-- are we in a stone room is there wood fire bolt travis and bolt 17 it's 2d10 which is 19 it's all stone seven every week we're like this is the episode where we start thinking this is the one fire bolt yeah is he dead or is he unconscious oh yeah that's a 22 it's a 23 it's five that's the sound it makes phoomph how tall is this person who's just died yeah he's only four feet okay i take out some iron and i go (whooshing) and he shrinks to an eighth of that and i pick him up yeah i don't want to leave him here oh he went down there i thought he was at our feet i would only do it if he was right where we were 11 obviously for killing with all the reading i have done can i ascertain or have a good guess of what this is used for besides yeah i know it's for killing people but does it do something to do something summon things make a god happy i have read many books i got a one not my neighborhood yeah is it safe i'm casting mage armor how steep so how fast does the fall feel so it's not that far down i begin casting slow let's skip and go to the next episode
