oh hi the guy i thought seven ate nine i'm a dad also this one's in tales from the borderlands being awesome the future's so bright there's where that pony went found the troll dick how much time do you need everybody make a constitution saving throw female hers it terrible what's this thank you sir you knew i liked jalapenos not so fast not so fast is she unconscious i've got dagger to her throat and i'm hold-- she's bald all right so i've got an arm around the top of her forehead in-- she's not unconscious right all right i call my sister over i'll hold her you talk i press the blade a little tighter dig in maybe one hit point worth of-- she's only got one all right i drag her to her feet walk her over to the edge of the cliff where the water is and hold her knife still at her neck tell this one now's her last chance to give us anything useful to lead to her boss i guess i'm going to assist her by taking my other dagger and letting it drip poison down the blade advantage advantage assist me 19 drip drip drip drip drip i can't understand what the-- what the hell's she saying i did it i did it yeah it's a little sticky slimy i'm starved absolutely she had all the good things give it to tiberius he'll try anything this all seems very technical yes it's pretty standard pretty standard yes i think grog may have soiled himself a little we should probably get keyleth on the books keyleth you need to study so we'll take first watch you can't study and watch all right let's take a nap yes we wish pike was here come back little gnome yeah (sighs) well let me see well i seem to know fuck-all about it ten i really wish pike was here all about the bling stupid lizard well we all just slept so we're fine you got this keyleth you got this just upstairs save grog welcome back big guy brains apparently do you remember anything about a kiss in your dreams while you were asleep oh that was trinket trinket helped with the spell gave you a kiss and helped wake you up yes i have a feeling these tunnels are going to suck majorly but we have nowhere to go but down so-- i think that's in this book tiberius yeah i am stealthing i roll stealth natural 20 just roll on your phone a couple times and then off to the side and you said that the red crystals on the wall are glowing somewhat enough to give the half-elves vision in low light i am starting to creep along the ground towards the nearest building and press up against the wall and see if i can-- i'm just going to listen none of them alive that we can tell so we're in the dark no but we're in pitch black here and we can't really see what's going on i think we need-- and tiberius wait hold on tiberius will you bring the party up it was five total why don't we nail down who that is it's the twins you he's pretty sneaky all right 22 check that building anything useful in the pile my sister everybody my sister doesn't remember but one of our instructors in syngorn used to tell us of a creature i'm not sure what they're called but-- mm a creature that steals its victims' minds and digests them reaches right in and takes them out i think it's much worse much worse i think the brain was a scout or some sort of pet i just think we should proceed with caution our teachers spoke about this thing said that it was a being of the mind i think our trouble with grog could just be the beginning we need to proceed very carefully just don't go running off into the dark again not smart enough apparently he's smart what are these scores you keep talking about i don't know what anybody's talking about 16 yeah i have mirrors but that's more for-- i don't know if that's going to help yes i have them of course i always i always have them they were a gift but that's a gorgon that's talking about the gaze-- we're talking about the mind i think could you forge some professor hats for us all (all laugh) and if i may i suggest tiberius you work your light spell and vex'ahlia and i scout ahead about 60 or 70 feet so that we can see in the dim light catch anything coming using your magic and it was dwarf-sized isn't it dwarf-sized or is armor also shrink and expand magical it's like pulled pork if i try to pull on the sleeve does it come up to my elbow or does it stretch out and fit that's nice i'll take this hold on thank you i go into the smelly corpse hut and start to change my armor if you want a thousand years-- if you want a thousand years of d&d we've got to pay the overheads so please subscribe once you've got the dwarf gunk off it's rather nice yes it's supple nice (whispers) stay put you asshole yeah we're gonna start kinda quickly dash after them could mean anything how wide is the bridge ten feet that means two people wide but if we go out there it's going to be close combat you can't get to the ones at the back 12 12 i count we could fight now i grab my ear and keyleth i heard you through tiberius' earring why don't you just become a bat and follow along you've never seen a bat in the woods now we're a kite and scanlan side and up 'cause they can look sideways if you're on a bridge you're looking down at your feet 29 distance because they have a light source so we want to follow that this is a temporary war camp yes how many buildings how are we gonna get through this i think-- put down we're past the chasm at this point or still afloat the other side so bridge to land and then a tunnel so it's bridge town tunnel yes (whoosh) (makes farting noise) all right he's invisible though no last question where are the people the figures we were following did they finish the bridge at this point okay so then i'll stay by the edge of the bridge you go back scanlan go ahead i'll wait for you here if there's trouble yes shit go get the others careful bilbo we're going to risk it all [break] [no audio] you are a brave little fellow spread throughout the city throughout this little camp scanlan this seems to match up with the tales that my instructor master tharendril told me about back in syngorn i wonder if i remember something if only i had a small polyhedral to roll-- wow thanks thank you long list shit what if all but a couple of us snuck into one of these buildings and waited and a couple of us made a stink and got a significant number of them to chase across the bridge but then how could we cut the bridge behind we have a flying carpet so we can go back and forth but we could drop a significant number of them down into the lava it's also a huge and your stink-cloud is only you know 20 or 30 feet across it makes him lighter yeah well are we scaring them or are we luring them i'll go that's a great idea but let's-- -- let's stack the deck all right i'm still gonna be live bait because i have an inkling that that thing whatever it is with the tentacles on its face-- -- is going to see through it so if we've got one real half-elf in the mix he'll focus on me so i'll take the flying carpet and tie it around my back i have boots of haste mm so i take the rug from grog-- i'm gonna roll it up and i tie it i have a rope to tie it to my back is it it is-- 14 what's the bridge made of is it just rope and wood on both sides okay so what's the boost how high is it advantage on all dex rolls all right that's great because that's how i attack okay all right but we need to-- but tiberius walk on a bit behind me and i'm gonna walk up to the edge of town and i'm gonna chat yeah where are you guys-- right and i'm gonna run that but you guys are all going back to-- the safer side the further side just needs to-- -- work around the edge of the bridge keyleth what if you fudged it so the cliff-- -- looked like it went 30 feet further out close to what they're used to yeah so if it looks too different-- okay tiberius you wait here ready to run i take tiberius by the arm like this vox machina okay so i stealthily walk up to the closing distance to the edge of town and i stand there i click my boots of haste together okay i just clicked the boots and i cry out full voice listen up you walking prawn doom has come for you today step forth you slimy bastard your trolls can't save you no matter how far or how long oh jesus it's a great plan tiberius can we hit it and quit it i start flipping-- and i flip the double birds and start walking backwards a little bit yes straight back okay my ac is 19 i'm gonna use uncanny dodge for anything i can see i can dodge for half damage if i need to shit okay is that the halved or-- okay so it was 11 and eight okay six and eight okay 14 right i knew this was coming yes (high-pitched voice) where's the roll for initiative man yeah i'm backing it up i'm running man i'm laughing as i run i'm untying the carpet quickly (all laugh) i don't know i said i was yes okay acrobatics check okay good because the first roll was a one the second roll was a 19 plus plus plus plus nine is 28 mm-hm i drew him out i survive a free fall and you hit me with that right after yeah will save so that's-- what is it i've never done that that's-- wisdom okay ow not very good seven 29 dex save right down the toilet fly he can fly me sam  he is falling like superman i don't know what i am it has been nice knowing you ladies and gentlemen oh shit can i use-- mawp mawp yes i got to get the carpet (all laugh) what happened what happened noodle-face yeah shoot it in the eye man we're on the goblin side now who wants to have a picnic come on baby come on von rolo (ricochet noise) 20 yeah yes (high-pitched) natural 20 motherfucker (high-pitched) automatic win that's a big belly flop but we didn't know and if there's-- -- if there's more than one of them these though he's gone boodle-oodle-ooo to his friends right now i mean-- -- if we can it'd be good to put this guy in the ground on cthulhu's side you're talking about maybe well hold on all those assholes are still standing on the edge across there do we have-- we've flown out of a falling tower before we were all able to do it can we just fly up and over those shitheads and go towards the tunnel can't we go 150 feet in the air and-- i was on the bridge when that happened-- -- and fell down i wasn't way above when it got me and you said it's 150-ish feet in here though to the ceiling we can go-- in the direction of goblin town the cthulhu side yes but kima did not fall prey to random beasts she fell prey to these shits vote yes up and over up and over water holes or fire holes now tiberius can fly keyleth is an eagle who can carry a gnome and maybe my sister and that leaves percy and grog and i on the flying carpet can it hold our weight let's give it a little test you lost the vote keyleth you lost the vote feather fall-- the fellowship has broken the mind flayer isn't on pause meanwhile the mind flayer's saying (gravelly voice) 'i haven't got all day' (laughs) well wanna go down scanlan remember when we had women in this party vex'ahlia what is going on down there (gollum voice) nasty (whispers) revenge sounds spanish he is very thin four (jimmy stewart voice) clarence clarence come on burt reynolds thank you for rebelling and staking out on your own trolls
