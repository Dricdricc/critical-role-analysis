can we work in like a wolf blizter hologram like they have on cnn as well on the table next to all the guys well you know we have an ongoing relationship with wyrmwood gaming which you can find on the internet they make beautiful boxes for holding dice and stuff and if you use the code critrole critrole you will get free shipping they have all different kinds of woods they're lovely and then also hey this is an impromptu announcement but kurtis wiebe just announced on the twitters kurtis wiebe is the writer for the comic book rat queens we all are addicted to it he works with tess fowler who's the artist right now and basically their outfit and our outfit are in love and kurtis announced on twitter today that he is going to be shoving vox machina in there in some way somehow and we're very excited i chose the planetary society just in case the green world dies and it promotes exploration of space and the stuff like that what a variety of charities you're god yeah yeah definitely all useful and did pike's holy visitor fix the keep or is the keep still effed up it must look so strange next to the ruined city of emon use the skull to wish to know everyone's alignment problem solved this isn't the real game the game hasn't actually started yet insight and are they all strangers other than the people we brought back with us they are strangers yeah is anyone still badly hurt i'm going to spend the first bit of time at home helping pike doing whatever she tells me to do really to help the people here way to go dark way to go dark well he's gone up he's resting he's in percival's room i think you said you would sleep in your laboratory it's true they're a double-edged sword though i mean they should not be trusted we cannot trust them but they are an infrastructure under the city they may have more of an idea what's going on than we do i'm the best to speak to them but i'm not on good terms with them and i've never really talked to you about this but you were marked at one point a long time ago actually yes i'm sure i don't know the reason there is a brand on my back is because i interceded some other schmoe died instead of you you might be a bit of a sore point with them i don't know they might not remember but i don't think that's true i think they'll remember before we met when vex and i were on our own we're going down to talk right all right they're going to look out for themselves and you're probably-- i'm sure you're right they want these dragons out but they will do-- they will preserve their own existence and there's a possibility that bowing before these beasts will preserve their existence and yes we've been down there we've argued with them but we're talking about going down there and making an alliance an ongoing alliance and shit might come up that's all i'm saying this is one option are we sure we don't want to seek help-- so you're saying there's a chance yes if things went south-- don't get along with chromatic it's a horde of fucking ass-kickers is what it is allow me to play tiefling's advocate if we leave now and allow the clasp to take hold and form some sort of new shadow government without us having any part in it it's out of our control completely it won't be in our control at all but maybe if we speak to them now we'll have a better idea of what's going on i'm not sold on any idea yet but if we leave now and let things play out it's entirely out of our hands we're talking vasselheim yeah whitestone and you can do it another two-- do you think you could look in on syngorn history didn't help 15 all out of luck what points to what what are you talking about that's one more thing our father failed to impart to us you know just because you can doesn't mean you should that's true and there's 50 to 100 refugees you said something like that right 30s you mean like the one that crashed guys this is an rpg not a jrpg (laughter) here it comes everybody there is opportunity there's definitely no vampires there none they can't get-- no one can get cut in half can they well we were saying that the terribly injured the people with the worst injuries-- yeah those people first and then with kids-- but they need attention now they need-- no words no words you can stay with pike for now no severed limbs no whammies i regret nothing in the worst-case scenario they can go underground it is a fun idea-- one plus one plus two plus one she's not marked for death she was marked for death it's just awkward it's awkward i'm not a full-fledged member they don't like me i don't like them maybe you can well let's go then we're not going to walk in the open that's a good idea for now it's a good idea i won't hold onto it forever can we call this the jenga stone in moments of need do i need to spend a little time with this once a day all right good to know all right 38 laura 35 right here it's pronounced 'jif' and scanlan's the only one-- we all see it not too good uno oh six thanks for that that was so crushing to see the number on the die for clarification does this count as turns or are they since they're coming late to the party or this is just them in position are they into the initiative order just gameplay talk percy shot at them parkour yup d10 yes so i'm having trouble seeing the battle map grog is right against a wyvern right oh so not against a wyvern oh so percy is right there and scanlan's next to the magic user right scanlan's up against a dude right all right so what i want to do is slink up behind percy reach over-- oh no i want to click my boots of haste is what i want to do i don't think so no i didn't no i didn't i definitely didn't because i remember kicking myself for-- i definitely didn't okay so click everybody starts moving slower around me i want to-- so percy's against the wyvern i want to reach over percy's shoulder and stab the wyvern and then i want to throw another dagger at the dude standing next to scanlan yeah well i can't tell i can't see shit-- is that over percy's shoulder but i can go around it yes let's do that i'm going to stab the wyvern in the butt and then i'm going to throw a dagger from my other hand at the guy standing next to scanlan-- i've got a question for you because both of them have somebody who's running interference do i get sneak attack damage on both just per turn all right so i'm going to use sneak attack damage on the wyvern if i get it 25 and then for the dude by scanlan gets a-- word 19 i do oh-- yes so the third stab will go back at the wyvern yeah and the last one was a 24 total so that hits as well okay so that's two one yes that's 14 17 22 23 25 27 29 into the wyvern and then the jerk over by scanlan gets seven and then the wyvern takes another the keen dagger takes another nine did i use up all my movement knowing that it can swat at me i'm going to try to go right back around where i came from and i'm wearing the cloak of displacement yeah grog is full juicing does his strength go up to 100 eventually jeez you got like tetsuo arm it's like five times bigger than it should be grog is on god mode did you just call the dm a bitch dissention in the ranks i'm going to scramble up to the top of the building that i'm right next to sure no problem yeah way high 20-- 33 is that percy right there okay oh who's right directly in a row away from me yeah i can't tell it's a bad guy i want to run actually and i want to jump off and land next to percy yeah i want to run straight by and i want to stab the dude i'm going to run forward yeah stab that guy (laughter) nine yeah run towards scanlan and i want to grapple him hopefully he just takes it no not that far one square back right there grab him and i'm using my bonus action to dash and then drag him backward behind grog right two actions and a bonus action mix them around matt and then back-- yeah right behind grog and i drag him behind vex and grog back by keyleth (airplane noise) right dash-- hasted i can go very very far i spank him on the ass and say you're welcome shorty yes you may grog's going to bite his head off you've got to be careful with friendly fire and we're all out of the way phew gingers man gingers he's covered in ichor i'm going to start walking towards it and dagger and dagger and dagger first is 20 second is 23 third is a 23 so we get-- ten for the fir-- sneak attack is it near something okay so the first is ten plus-- wah ten plus 16 23 (growling) 29 36 39 41 for the first dagger i will aim for its open mouth as it's going huah and pin its tongue into the back of its skull can i assist with my keen dagger and help her under her instruction we're going to drag the wyverns indoors i'll get the door for you (door creaks) would it help if i gave her my keen dagger for the rest of it yeah so we've just got ladder down that's it well i'm fine so while everybody is-- just do some push-ups just do some push-ups while i check this ladder out so i'm going to check for any traps on this ladder or anything 23 i'm not going to go crazy i'm just going to go to the bottom of the ladder-- in i go 30 for stealth i have a flame tongue dagger 22 (quietly) vex'ahlia-- there is a long tunnel down here and there is a bit of faint light i have percy's fancy rock i am not planning on doing anything crazy but i think i should-- well technically i do still have it regardless i should go ahead and if there's anyone to talk to i should talk-- i'm not going to go yet i'm going to wait 'til you guys have rested and come down to-- it's pitch-black down here i'm not running ahead i'm better at this shit than you and the rest are so take a rest i'm going to sit here-- sometimes stubby yes stubby could you come down here for me yeah probably come here all right so before all these guys-- you were being stalked by someone i don't know for what reason i don't know who the person was i don't know what they wanted with you someone wanted you and i don't know who the clasp was going to get you for them and i stopped that from happening i followed you one night or rather followed this person following you and met the clasp and i made an exchange for your life i went and got someone else and-- not immediately you're almost on it they told me to get a body i got a body a living body a child rapist and brought him to the clasp and they brought out a stick-- really it was made of human tongues yes they touched it and he turned into you and they took that guy for whatever and in exchange for your life i have this and they are allowed to call on me when they want so i know that we've run in and out a couple of times but we're going in you can talk my fucking ear off in a moment all right just shut up for a second we are going to go in and try to form some sort of alliance or working partnership this is different than running in smashing some shit and running out all right so keep the cloak up hang back don't say a lot and you can talk my ear off later i don't know why you were wanted i don't know what it was about all i knew is that they were going to take you away and i wasn't going to let that happen and i took some fucking piece of shit and traded him in well if i had to wager on it i'd say that he's in a dungeon in a rubber suit but i don't know where no i never told you because it's creepy as fuck it was in westruun probably probably stay at the back yeah you do you vex'ahlia sounds like there's i don't know drainage or something coming from slightly up in that direction well that's not a bad idea but it means we've got to sit in this stank i don't know if the person who wanted you was part of the clasp i don't know who it was it's parading you around in front of the people who made an illicit deal with me it could be fine i don't know i don't think that's going to be enough it's not quite enough for our purposes she's multiclassing a third time second firestorm of the night how 'bout that smell everyone eh i never lived-- i'm like a distant cousin to all this (laughter) but did you say on the right is it going down or is it coming down follow the water down or follow the light this is like the underdark again is there any-- i'm sorry one last question is there any thieves' cant on the walls at all 31 all right confirmed yeah i'll lead the way yeah we sat here for 20 minutes in the stank we could have been but i use a bit of sign language from the cant and let them know that i'm part of the clasp you said human right i step forward well you know who we are yes and you know my spotty track record with the clasp but that's all past now the city's in ruins you're looking at the right hand of uriel of course we're looking for what to do next with this city i don't think any of us wish to be the pets of the beast that's now roosting in the heart of emon well i'll be honest our first thought was to flee this city but before we make that decision-- yes it is-- we know that you're the next best thing to a government in emon and we want to know what's left behind can i insight check not good no nine nine the plan now is to lay low and hide we can get to that we also have strong connections to whitestone we're proposing a short-term solution-- you want to get back to a position where you can grease the wheels and make money that's not going to happen anytime soon but you can't take care of these beasts on your own and neither can whitestone neither can we if the clasp were to vanish something else would take its place can i use perception to make sure that we're really private right now 22-- oh 22 plus can i use my inspiration on this i got it in the wyvern fight okay so 22 you're welcome you know what keep your deal i don't think you're going to let this city fall anyway if this city dies you've nothing if the parasite hasn't a host to feed on the parasite dies no thank you is this a whisper i'm going to roll out of his hands forward to my friends 28 save a thought for the people of emon if you've any room left in your narrow minds and i back out i don't answer i walk over to keyleth can you still do the thing with your hands i rip my shirt down i want you to burn it away now seven like you do it was you thank you grog no does that take the scar okay thank you there's hundreds of them grog yeah there were another 160 in the rafters they're going to go on doing the same thing they would have done with us or without us and i don't believe they are going to bend the knee to thordak i don't believe it and that was all i personally was worried about i think the only people on the inside right now have scales 27 we don't need an airship to do that is he unconscious still or just sleeping what what as the sun goes down it's been down and everyone's going to their rooms i go to keyleth's door and knock on it hi i don't want to be alone tonight do you one dragon crashed in the roof of the building what are the cook and the maid going to do jarett's pretty badass but i don't think he can handle that percival's the lord of whitestone he's got a castle you'll find another room bathed in self-loathing (laughter) that's ridiculous why don't you go ask the guards i'll go talk to the kitchen staff we've done it once before we can do it again fucking cold i imagine you'll fill your sister in do you think that with the time that's passed cassandra has found any of the belongings of the briarwoods they were pretty snazzy we need to kill some dragons and we are out of everything you've been here a while have you found anything of the briarwoods any store of treasure or potion or anything of use not so much interested in gold as in means of protection or healing let's have dinner whitestone and chill tinker tools this goes in here are you borrowing 300 of your gold from the money you loaned to vex we were just here where we fought the hydra maybe glad that manticore's not in your orchard that's all i can say remind me what was the duskmeadow again was that where we chased the rakshasa that ripped chiseled old man ta-da and we're probably going to need to speak to your lady lord well your wife but i'm talking about the boss here higher still the sphinx we've urgent business to discuss with her for now we need a place to stay the only reason i remember that is it sounds like merkin sorry we're tired we've been hopping all over sorry any room aldor aldor aldor she's still a member of the slayer's take of course though isn't she it feels like we were just running screaming from dragons in the sky we'll get up in the morning we'll take some of that gold we'll put it to good use we'll wait until nessa gets back and then we'll carve out a plan percival probably he works here he was she's led by her conscience oh shit can we buy potions in this city shit you can't can you nothing i'd probably tag along with percival you're right i do want to see old punchy man greyskull keep is going to be an ancient dragon's kitty litter box like our first hometown or our elven town
