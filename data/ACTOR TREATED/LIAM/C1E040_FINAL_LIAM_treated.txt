we told ourselves 40 and done that's as irish as it can gets oh i voice directed on two games they're the exact same game basically one is called 'the witness' mastermind jonathan blow has created a very very unique game there's no shooting people in the face or any of that but it looks to be one of the best gaming experiences of the year and then i also directed the voices for-- and ashley johnson is in the witness and i also got to direct most of the voiceover for what's it called lego marvel avengers which everybody-- you've heard of it show of hands who's doing a voice in the game aww well next one she was the first and last person i thought of also unique fun fact ashley is playing the character she played in the avengers movie so her lego figure looks like her that code is 'critrole' critrole you get free shipping if you type in 'critrole' but you got to do it on their website not other websites brooklyn what else can we talk about for the next four hours pike heal i'm all right i think in the short term we need to take care of two things one get a vantage point and see how the keep is and what we can see from above we also need to get the staff out of here we need to send them away immediately out of the city though into the wild i'm all right so i'm going to go find the staff and herd them down below and tell them what has happened this one's on everyone i'm going to start moving through the entire place i'm going to start at the front gate and see if anybody's outside it's actually not all right we need to gather everyone right now quickly i'll explain after we've gotten everyone in the keep we need to go to percival's workshop can you help me with that but i'm on my own right go to percival's workshop go i will handle it i'm going to go stealth toward the door to see what the hell is going on out there yeah it's a 29 i'm going to start running up towards them i'm going to join them on the wall how many people am i seeing down there if i look past do i see anyone else coming towards the keep is it just a cluster and that's it or-- all right slapping my hand on kendrick's shoulder we are going to let these people in the city has come under attack everything is fucked beyond belief there are at least four large old dragons attacking the city and these people need to come inside i don't know what we're going to do with them but we're going to bring them in now and you and i are going to wait by the gate for those stragglers to come in the rest of you take them inside join the others i scream out get the gates open now and i'm fireman's pole down the ladder down one side of the ladder to get to the gate i scream out if you rush you will die no i already said i went down 24 a little tiny ray of sunshine now it's angry i'm going to dive by that tree yeah i'm going to use my bonus action to hide and i'm going to hold my attack until it is on the ground or low to the ground can i attack right now i was holding my attack 60 because i'm sharpshooter so i'm going before him and it's a surprise attack because i'm hidden and i'm going first-- so it's an advantage and it is an automatic crit it's not surprised even hiding behind a tree all right 24 all right and then the second dagger i throw-- i can only throw a second one-- is also a 24 so the first one is double dice so eight plus-- 14 15 18 23 25 double dice is 50 plus seven is-- yeah 57 for the first and the second one goes bink that is a ten that's sneak attack i've gone up a level to 13-- 7d6-- oh wait sorry sorry sorry 25 plus seven is 32 sorry 32 the second one was ten 32 ten what was his name again grog's about to lose ten percent of his hit points 15 plus seven is 22 is that a medicine check at this point if trinket is frozen in ice you can't say-- thanks could i pee on him and thaw him out quickly he's trying to resist scanlan sent a fireball at it and it's fucking with it got to go revenant on that bear or behind the goliath behind the goliath hold that gun up from the ground left a taint upon you (laughter) 10d10 i want to double check the boots of speed that i wear it's ten rounds each day the haste effect's duration need not be consecutive rounds so it was one or two back in emon and i've had one round here so what is it ten minutes now i think it remember the ten-minute thing-- all right so i'm going to dash towards the tree in that corner and get away from this clump of my friends towards the wall yeah i should be able to get behind that tree i think if i dash so then i'm going to throw a dagger it's all i can do can i use an action to hide or it's a bonus action only whoa i'm asking if instead of throwing a dagger can i hide instead yeah i'm going to do that i'm going to do that so i'm running balls-out to that tree and i'm going to go right up against the tree and fucking wait and that's it oh sure i'm going to use luck i still have a little luck today good that's better 31 eagle to the fucking face oh that's inauspicious 18 too late for luck (laughs) i got one more charge nope nope so attack rolls and what was the other (singing) i like chicken i like liver meow mix meow mix please deliver what's pike's ac what's pike's ac ooh what's that face i think you just said 'two' you just said 'two' carry the one carry the three i wasn't paying attention but where do we go if we're outdoors we're dead and go where sure he can dig-- i don't know where to go we can't go above ground because we're dead shit everyone we need to go inside how many people are frozen can we all do medicine checks on them inside everyone inside now come along i'm helping and as we do so i say i don't know what's going to happen in the following hours do not go far from me if we are out of earshot you are too far from me do not go far from me do not go far from me he's just a sociopath that's all [no audio] that is a long talk what do you need i look at my sister what is it what does he need wait here just wait a second i walk over to my sister i'm going downstairs if i'm not back here in five minutes i want you to come down do you understand and i say that because i need you you are stronger than me and i will need you tend to the wounded five minutes i follow grog rogue proficiency bump yes because the cloak yes thank goodness five minutes pizza and five minutes i don't say anything what's going on percival good well freddie i imagine i'm wondering the same thing you are at least i hope and that's what's in it for the skull i'm looking at the floor i'm not looking at it hey quick question who are you who were you before you were in this prison ah well go fuck yourself and i put the blanket over it this seems like a very bad idea to me why are we doing this didn't we do this already once before if we wish to rid emon of these dragons then we've got nothing to deal with this fucking thing right here whatever it is he's speaking literally grog i had a thought-- i think-- i have a thought i haven't spoken out loud yet every divine being that exists is accessible through vasselheim we are not equipped to handle this problem maybe this skull will do something maybe that's a bit fucking maybe we're not equipped and we don't know what dealing with that thing will bring we will go to vasselheim tomorrow we bring all the people in this keep with us keyleth sends them through the tree they stay there we find help we cannot handle this on our own my first instinct was to go back in for uriel we don't know what's happened to uriel but we can't do it we are powerless against those things against one of them let alone four we need help did that blanket just blob down grog know your strengths it is your strength-- i look at percival we need to talk to the girls pike as well to catch things up i walk out the door and i'm going to get the other two all right i beeline right up to them and i drop down in front of pike pike keyleth we're working on a plan and we don't have one yet but pike-- and i'm down on my knee-- you need to guide grog he doesn't listen to anyone else he only listens to you yes and no it's better if you just come pike come ashley and and i take keyleth's hand and pull her after me naturally 15 plus eight is naturally 23 are we at the door yet hey big man trickfoot wants to talk to you okay i'm going to quick rapid-fire-- i was hoping to bring everybody in but say listen to me percy's got this fucking skull and we-- everything about it it's a skull it's talking about granting a wish it's fucking fucked up just like the fucking smoke demon that was in percival i don't understand what's going on yet but both grog and percival are a little fucked up but grog is more fucked up but i don't understand everything but things are not good we can get jarett scanlan scanlan join us please quickly please i do i do insist now shorthalt now just another minute mom scanlan here yet wait the door is open now ah good yeah bigby that shit this is all seconds this is happening in seconds d&d standoff damn it relay race okay then i take a step in front of her and pull out my daggers and stand in front of my sister i'm in this is so metal wait me too oh yes i'm barring the way vax this is a little like clue the movie keyleth let's just wait until allura gets here i feel like she might have a calming effect on this situation an outside eye i sheath my daggers things are a lot more complicated than you can even imagine please come in we need you could you do us a favor we had a small accident with percival no so emon is in ruins it's been destroyed by dragons and your tower is-- i'm sorry my lady did you know that uriel planned to step down he did it he did it and moments later four old dragons descended upon the city we are in a precarious position the city is in ruins already in a matter of hours yes most definitely that's not true if we are to solve this situation we cannot hide the truth i killed krieg we killed krieg i finished krieg we stumbled upon his lair reached through his home in emon through magical means we found his lair and we-- i-- when it happened he had four stones four orbs in his lair they saw us not all that long ago and on top of all that we have this fucking skull we don't know what happened to uriel we didn't see i go over to my sister in that time i want-- i want to kill that dragon or i want to die trying we are to stand now or we might as well be dead hey we're all cows (laughter) be sure to buy a t-shirt over on geekandsundrycom in sam's honor wow that game felt like 20 hours my plan was to take that skull and run like a fucking football player and fucking go for the goal yeah i would have been in the heart of emon shoving it up the red dragon's nose we would have been working in a lich's sugar mine if you'd done that that's a good point i was going to carve my name in your nuts tell me more sadist
