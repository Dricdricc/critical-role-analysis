those are and we noticed the i believed it was the naga we fought it seemed to have several extra heads stitched on have you no knowledge of these creatures it seems very odd is there any connection in dwarven history or past or this is totally out of the blue and what's security like on the mine is there any chance someone could've slipped in through kraghammer without you knowing or is that all locked up understood understood you say had literally or figuratively i think so all night do you get off in six more hours what's a mic tell you what when we drag our asses out of that mine we'll come straight to you and buy you a drink do the wink thing you do oh you did it already she's good at winking when you say too drunk do you mean we the adventurers or the humans back in los angeles have you had any luck finding an arcane-- no i know that did you send any fireballs at doors again like you've done in the past or-- got it i walk back to the door because we're all just standing outside the door i walk back to hieris's door and knock on it and poke my head in hieris i'm sorry just a quick question we have no fucking idea what time it is because we usually use the sun do you know what hour it is are businesses open at the moment are the stores open at the moment how much time do we have left oh thank you sir let's go shopping byeee you're a goliath you'll eat anything i think i will go with him just to keep him from setting fire to the entire city how does the grass grow down here we ain't found shit is there a front door i'm gonna use my rogue abilities to walk up to the front door and knock on it can i see if i detect a bell this is really not good for their business [liam and laura groan] (group laughs) which one of these do i roll for damage higigigigi all right don't tase me bro it's not gonna be ruined i have nine healing potions-- we agree wholeheartedly he's dragonborn he's weird he's a little weird we're sorry to interrupt i don't know it's dinnertime i think i don't know if you've heard yet it just happened we just fought some sort of many-headed beast down at the mines and lord greyspine is sending us in so before we go we were sent here we were told you were the dwarf to speak to if we needed-- i think it was just to get shit (travis and sam laugh) roll with it player roll with it let the dice act better than us tonight please (group laughs) vax steps forward steps in front of keyleth and says good sir dwarf clearly we are idiots we are-- stay with me on this we are strangers in a strange land however we are working with lord greyspine to empty your mines and end the evil that is spewing forth from them now i know that we are a bit stupid-- (group laughs) --in a number of ways but we fight well and we have the best of intentions and when it counts we're there we just need a little bit of help going into the mines and again lord greyspine himself sent us so please excuse my-- --challenged friends we're here to help i promise wink wink wink best roll of the night i rolled a 20 and a 17 so 19 how about a chocolate-covered mallomar this game has consequences so easy vex how much gold do we have at the moment more than double that means it could be one thousand 'cause anything is more than double tearing me apart lisa hello it's a beautiful shop you have it's so startling to find an elven establishment here in the middle of kraghammer how did this come about no we are not roll sister and a troll dick i detract my offer all right well friends we're about to descend into hell itself so i reckon we should probably pay the price no i'm good actually i'm so fast i don't really use them that much you'll get to that point as well have you any elven gear for a son of syngorn it's beautiful i am a bit of a light-footed one would it suit me all right i'll pass you're gigantic could fit on your left nut i've got it right here sorry i've got the map so i'm looking at the mine are we still in the dwarven carved out sort of structure portion of the mine guys i'm holding a map i see one room that they've scrawled supply on so it should be the next right up ahead i'd like to just take a peek in there and see what we can see before we head deeper in anyhow i've got a map so let's use this stay on point here i've seen enough we should keep going (group laughs) this map says that there's an elevator a short ways up that goes down but then there's a railway that goes further in into the caves so i'm not sure elevator straight down it's a safe assumption that lady kima did not just walk to the back of the upper floors she probably went down get shit done let's go we have a map to the elevator scanlan are you all right around these goblin corpses so we could either go to the rear of the mine on this level and see where they're coming from no not yet yes i see it word of warning tiberius is it black or is it dim duergar it's the duergar this is 2015 let's stop dicking around and go into that mine travis and two hours ago i started stealthing and taking the lead when we're in the dark uh 29 looks fine there a great little cave alcove here perfect for peeing in for everyone to pee do you catch my drift never entirely welcome in the company of elves or men vax'ildan learned at a young age to skip past formality preferring instead to invite himself in your door along with twin sister vex'ahlia vax was born by a chance encounter between elven royalty and human peasantry raised by their mother in their early years the twins were eventually sent off to their father in the elven capital of syngorn but their cool reception among the elves there never warmed and their time in the capital didn't last the siblings stole away one autumn night and set out on the open road after a few years of wandering they eventually decided to return to their mother and journeyed back to the lands of their youth but instead of finding their childhood home they returned to a pile of rubble their mother was gone their home burned to ash pressing the townspeople for answers they learned of the day the dragon came with their ties all severed vax'ildan and his sister set out to find their fortune together in tal'dorei an outsider since birth vax quickly learned to solve life's challenges in his own particular way often by sidestepping them entirely and when his knack for circumventing adversity isn't enough-- (sword slicing) --the way of blades the elves schooled him in more than makes up the difference enjoy your player's handbook 5e oh less than that oh no i didn't 18 that's true do we perceive anything in here with us before going that far in yes 18 yes i might hear spiders or something i think we're dealing with spiders the twins will creep forward no dim light only turn it back on clap on (claps) clap off (claps) i quickly whisper to my sister to the boundaries vex and vax dance backwards against the walls but i heard them that's beautiful look at that fun map thank you matt for doing all the work on these maps and shit limericks limericks they respond to limericks 15 15 15 it's go time go time (claps) go for the kill hit it in the face so i can see what's up i saw what it did to my sister so i'm gonna jump on its back i'm gonna swivel my daggers around and just stab it in the face yeah i'm seeing the back of his fucking spine or head i'm gonna stab him in the face twice okay okay so then i'll do damage the other one's an 18 i rolled in advance so 10 plus sneak attack damage right yeah okay okay one four eight nine 13 26 36 damage from the first dagger face in his face and the next was an 18 not in his face but i wanted i wanted to do this to his head okay whatever works the reach around the reach around that what i was going for and then where's my four 1d4 one's a three but no just three with my flametongue dagger which i don't know if he likes or dislikes but that's what i've done there once was a bard from nantucket (group laughs) --in a bucket better better better no we have a problem we have an angry grog it's more natural it's creature-based be a badass be a badass gnome coverage [marisha and taliesin] gnome coverage ride the bear scanlan don't touch the snail until the-- 'cause he'll poof out into the fucking big guy again leave it leave it leave it alone hit the other one good stunt work tiberius bear hug man bear hug she can only turn into things she's seen it's a waterfall oh yes the answer to that is yes definitely yes sam will write a ballad okay so first thing i do is lean down and pick up the snail off the ground and say hey um go fuck yourself and then i throw him into the waterfall yeah okay great great great dexterity you say 18 oh sorry yeah that's 21 22 22 toodle-oo shitface now that seems like a bonus action to me right (group laughs) so then that's an attack okay then i'm good well that's my action right and i only have one all right so then i'll hop through through percy and my sister and run up behind the shithead who's fucking with keyleth yeah that's easy 16 (mumbles) 29 right up behind shitface there and do i have anything left or do i just get there and stop second attack well let's stab him in the ass then right i still feel pretty good about that round i thought it would get washed all the way out down the toilet all the way out elegant just past it please kill it before it kills me okay don't let it eat my head please save the day scanny repeat just like last week yes shoot it in the mouth (clapping) yes percy critical on a disadvantage whatever your last name is again but you're so little okay so he's now got his back turned to me i'm just gonna stick both knives into his guts and say no one touches the gnome okay this is the flametongue four plus two is six (sam sings along with dramatic music) i stick it in the back of his his spider nads and rip it out his bum and out the back of him and just spill it all out the bottom (all talking at once) that's all right that's all right nobody touches my man-wife (group laughs) like the walking dead you're gonna sneak by the rest of 'em running (sam laughs) i'm unscathed so i run after grog just to give him backup if he needs i'm just watching and shrugging i try to keep like six or seven foot difference-- fuck you dick you dick (marisha laughs) i am now i rolled a 29 of stealth as soon as the first arrow flew duergar yeah
