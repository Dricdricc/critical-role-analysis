you are not allowed to go you'll eat your rice and play dungeons and dragons you know the meme when the dungeon master smiles it's too late by the time he's smiling you're already getting choked out it's the second highest rated comic book on comixology at the moment on comixology we saw it --me daddy what an accident that was oh no that was a thing does anyone have my clothing that's going to make tomorrow a little squirrely do you have all my shoes and glasses so i may have them okay could you lead me and my penis towards them now we're still standing here it's getting awkward acrobatic should we maybe talk out our plan for the moment no it doesn't but i do think we should probably have at it we've got the trammels grog's got them what are your three attuned right now yes it is we need to spread those out we need to decide who is doing what at least what we think is going to happen i think i should take one of the trammels one of these two i am what about you scanlan i was about 50 or 60 feet in the air and i was above him if you do and he slaughters everybody and subjugates the entire world-- as the crumbly the little guy to jabba the hutt for vecna i was above him though and i was 50 or 60 up he wasn't that high do you have anything gnarlier than-- i mean i'm a little invested too i've spent a lot of years with this bear-- like anything gnarlier than-- an eagle's cool but like anything with spikes or rhino armor or anything like that can you do a flying rhino does that mean you could permanently do it to him and then we cast dispel magic on him later to undo it tonight to lock him in but if it's permanent why not do it tonight could he be a baby like a young ancient dragon so did that live up to your expectations then new hobby or-- i mean that is flat-out amazing nah we need two hats or something can the meat man join us can vecna just dispel the second scanlan away you can never have enough scanlan there's always room for scanlan you know how vecna rolls sing off this is the last check off your list i think these last three or four years have been the best of my life we need his head in the game yeah percy get your rest because your last words to me tomorrow need to be indignant and irritated goodnight brother (singing) oh my darling i hunger for your touch-- natural 20 so take a conk on the head welcome to the table yeah he's attacking a gloomstalker i'll join in i'm going to help this guy out and throw all right plus one to-- i did and they both hit all right i will four-- it could be bad 12-- 34 35-- i can't it's too late it's triggered 46 for the first joe you're sitting on scanlan two eight you were jumping at him and punching him in the face i thought wrong i do that sometimes 20 21 and a miss is his proximity close enough that either of these guys are within five feet or anybody's within-- i mean i'm just going to do an insight check on principle yeah i rolled an eight he checks out that's a ten-minute one yeah two ones it was slim fast slim feast matt and do you mean actually have you died that's short term i rolled a four so it's 37 (deep voice) if i'm good at reproductions a fighting chance well we can try the door and then if that doesn't work grog can make a new one let me check out the door i'm going to check and see if the door is trapped 26 26 for investigation on the door all right let's open it up 28 i pick up a rock about that big walk ten feet back and throw it at the energy ooh that's not good 16 yeah i rolled a three i literally just got choked to death 18 hours ago so i'm not sweating it what're we going to do destroy i'm going to walk up behind him-- and plus two from me doesn't stack then i'm backing the fuck up feet skidding like a jackie chan film we can hide though we can't run ring 46 no it's his mount there's no windows on this side and then would you say we could use the attic windows it's up to you yes i am hateful eight i got an eight i'm way at the bottom could you ring up tiamat and have her help with this dragon thing 26 evasion means zero grog does not count in melee of the dracolich right it's just toys sorry audio team unload by delilah or here i really am oh my okay yeah okay so if i get to the very edge there am i in range of delilah on the ground with sharpshooter cover doesn't do much except full cover and am i within 60 feet over there about okay i'm going to throw whisper at her and she's down so i have advantage that is a 27 to hit and i'm going to bamf there what because she's prone her being prone doesn't give me advantage that's much worse 18 all right second attack is a natural 20 yeah with whisper she has to make a saving throw with a dc of 18 or become frightened of me for a minute on a crit 18 all right (counting) 72 yeah it's a crit double the dice oh sorry so 32 thank you and i'm going to bamf there on it don't worry and with my bonus action i'm going to throw my third dagger up at the wall can i throw whisper again is it like quick draw or does it have to change daggers all right then instead i'm going to disengage and i'm going to dart back between the scanlans wait she used a reaction to knock the dagger away she used shield which is a reaction so she can't hit me with an attack of opportunity never mind butcher that motherfucker modifier goes on at the end do you get them at reproductions too i don't know about that how are you doing there m our reactions come from melee range you said 120 feet away all right i'm going to use my movement and dash so five ten 15 50 55 60 and i'm going to paladin attack the gloomstalker up there first one is great that is a 33 and the second one is also pretty good 25 do those both hit okay shit should've called sharpshooter all right so the first one is one plus eight is nine-- seven so 11 and seven just 11 and seven on that gloomstalker yeah but we can't get out of range of the ring unless we want to-- he'd still be in range-- doesn't affect range it just affects your chances sharpshooter doesn't double the distance so it's at disadvantage normally i got 26 for vax he didn't get a chance to go but we're directly in front of the door a ways back how far back well our options are somehow flying up or going in the front door i used to do this with string and a gi joe for my cat when i was a kid she loved it i'm sure the rot behemoth will too wait one second do we want to lure it into a house and all of us be waiting to gank the shit out of it we just watched the wyverns get obliterated trying to fly into the swirl at the top i mean i love it but i hate it oh it was a one but it's a 37 now no matt told me that because of reliable talent one means shit 30 rolls this'll still work spread and let him run right into the range of it as soon as he enters he's in range isn't he no no pickle can you release a sarenrae bomb vecna's going to be too powerful for a destroy or turn undead it's for weak-ass shit like this wisdom for clerics eight plus five plus your proficiency bonus 14 20 challenge rating of four or lower don't worry matt your luck is coming upstairs you are now michonne from walking dead you got two zombies all right well up we go then yeah i'm going to look for traps as we go two miles away ish 18 one minute are we short resting or we doing little healies i'm telling you though it's this or nothing if we fall here if we fail then it's fucked so even if it destroys half the city it's better to have all of us at full fighting potential no but we have hit dice you don't need the spells i'm going to put up because i think that these two need it just roll a natural 20 joe roughly how much time has passed since we went from-- right right but probably his box of dirt is not-- i'm going to when we're right on the verge when we think we're right on the verge i'm blessing you and you is it one of these guys where we can see the height of the tower or-- there's a death knight oh excuse me where is vecna right now how high up right above us way up or a floor up way up okay if i have the death ward i will pop back up what about scanlan two can scanlan two do it i use divine sense and feel for undead 60 feet fan out 24 for me where's the exit to this room we can go around the edge what's making that so tight is there one trap that's making it so tight or all of them did they seem arcane in nature do i have a shot in hell of disarming them natural 20 okay okay (marlon brando voice) i could've been somebody arkhan instead of a zombie because i am oh who's near me could i retcon and say that i'm-- what did you get you got a natural one if i'm next to him because i give plus two to saves does that futz with it do we want to try to get everyone else across before you do that maybe it's a one-time-only oh okay well i meant the necklace but definitely take your armor off for this though definitely paint me like one of your chromatic girls is it hot in here point of order i know roughly how far vecna is right so i should be able to tell as we're getting closer roughly how much distance halfway up the tower three quarters et cetera oh that's dark how long did it take us to get to this point who knows what is above us it could be slower for the upper half i cast divine sense undead traps 18 how far above us is vecna i'm putting the wings out now also i'm going to say this now in advance it might not be possible but if we get to a door i'm thinking ahead of time if we think we're about to step out i want to cast bless on the three half-elves right before going out that might not be possible but it's in my head to do it you're blessed if it happens hashtag blessed a d4 rolled for every attack or saving throw up so that we're seeing the edge of steps at the top all right i'm stealthing are we pass without a trace right now 44 they don't look like the big kahuna they look like the underlings from my hidden position i want to see if i see any traps in the room i'm not entering i want to do it from my peeky spot yeah 23 for investigation so what i'm going to do is slowly back down to the party relate what i just saw three of them what do we do they're dudes in armor they're lackeys is it difficult to use that silenced weapon of yours it's a small room you and i can probably handle two but that leaves a third yeah could stubby and i each target one and you yank one into the ground simultaneously can you do that right now we don't want to create a stir we might so it's better that we do two quietly and leave one left can you throw your fucking manners ball at the third yeah so who's going in tell me again the three that are in this room arkhan we're going to handle the small right after you'll handle the tall i stealthed you have to stealth right i will go a split second before my sister throwing on the right throwing on the left they all hit that's good four i'm doing okay too 80 for the first 12 for my second no they all hit all my attacks hit 12 damage for the second do you remember anything shaun i'm taking him by the cheeks you're in a very bad place you're in a very bad place and time you need to get out of here you need to take these women and go downstairs and hide you are in no shape to do anything right now you need to take these two women and hide downstairs do you hear me there's no time to explain no his head is not where it needs to be in 30 minutes we could all be dead but if we have any chance-- you three need to not be here you need to go down now bless shaun it was an honor knowing you this is a great game joe manganiello (cheering) that was fucked up next campaign we don't attack anybody we talk to everybody every npc every hot dog vender every lich talk fucked up you managed in the space of a week to make the choke-out seem like child's play
