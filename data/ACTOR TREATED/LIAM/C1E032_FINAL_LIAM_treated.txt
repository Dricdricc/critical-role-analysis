give books to kids we enjoy doing this it's so good to have you here you got your gear johnson so we're 50 or 60 feet away from the skeletons and how far are we away from the villagers that are coming in the other direction no i was pulling her by the arm i immediately pivot around and follow he's just got to roll for a hundred skeletons climbing the wall i turn back towards the villagers who are probably running up at this point and yell fire bring fire i'm grabbing percy's arm and lowering him down lower because she's short she was light already how did you get here what are you doing here how did you get here can i pick her up by the armor and throw her it's going to be like a knife through butter yeah natural 20 for love there's no 1d6 for cube damage (laughter) i'm going to hold my turn are they closing in on pike oh then i'm going to leap off the wall and run towards pike how many skeletons are in range right now i'm going to take my blades and spin around pommel out and i'm going to start punching i have no idea if this will do anything there is a symbol of sarenrae sewn into this glove right here i'm just going to start-- i don't have the boots of haste on so i can just take two swings at-- yeah two skeletons one skeleton whatever skeleton is closest to pike yeah all right he's getting it in the dusty jaw all right i have no idea how to do this i've never done anything without a dagger that's not good i don't know what to add to this that's true but i have to hit (laughter) no that's fine so the first one misses entirely and the second one is-- oh this is probably fine for skeletons 12 13 14 11 okay that's the right hand with the symbol it's a one so it's a one two so it's a three this symbol does nothing for me i'm here to soak up damage for you pike let them hit me in the face that was a test it's better now than against sylas briarwood like you're attacking ribbon candy 20 we need to go kill those giants right now we have a holy gnome right now i don't know how you came to us pike we need to go to them and then we need to go to the briarwoods now now granted we're going to the giants now giants now giants now better than the briarwoods plus giants let's go get those giants right now no there's one over there and there's one off in that direction all right weight it more heavily to the group that does not have pike ah it's adorable are they to the south and west there's a person wounded pulling themselves through the mud saying help me keep telling the story back to the fight ooh he's got houses oh look at that blood of the giant you can do this friendly fire just turns grog on can these actors do addition you shoot it at an angle up at his head up into the sky roll two times take the higher of the two disruption i think so yeah 2d6 radiant damage dc 15 wisdom save it's now frightened of pike until the end of her next turn 2d6 radiant damage cleric vs undead we needed her from the get-go bring the holy retribution kill kill kill all right 44 i'm going stealth i'm gone man well i rolled a 23 am i stealthed yeah that sounds good and matt as we ran i wanted to split off from the group and go up along the side 19 that's what they call me i'm watching everything unfold i see my sister roll up i hold i remember that giant ooh identical 19 i start running am i within 30 feet it's hard to tell from here all right so i hit one ankle against the other on my boots and everything slows down around me a little bit and i double my speed and run towards it i don't know if there's doubt then i can't do it all right i still run at it that's what i do he's surrounded by people right so i'm going to run up to him and i'm going to start swinging up the arrows on his chest and get up to his head yeah never mind nine is a 20 that's a 26 yeah because he's surrounded all right so i'm up on his shoulders at this point one plus seven is eight plus ten 11 16 that's 21 23 yeah with flametongue right that's it i'm not i'm right below his undead dinger i say we move forward it's done she cast it let's go on yes sir (weak laughter) okay what am i doing fuck a duck that's hot what position is it in (pants) i reach down and i grab the scalding-hot daggers again and i lift them up and lunge and sink into its ribs oh you roll seven or eight yeah the first one hits that's a 30 and the second one is 17 and he's still surrounded so the first one is going to sneak attack his ass two plus three nine ten 11 12 15 16 17 17 on the second attack flametongue gets seven oh plus 2d8 for the fire damage that's a yeah if i get burned he gets burned right all right 14 i didn't move can i use a bonus action at this point second attack okay you've got a lot of papers in there get it you're wearing the shirt even i start sticking my hands in a puddle like my hands could you fix these yeah it worked it's good but they sting a little bit i heal i also hold her hands for a second are they unsullied i pull out my flametongue dagger and just look in two or three graves i don't know if there's anything in there they're empty man that is a 15 i'm just looking (laugh) are you giving me morality lessons i want to drop down i'm going to take a look at that yeah i'm going to look at it tell me more about that dagger i want to make an arcana check i just want to make an arcana check it's a 20 no 20 i put it down and i pat it and i-- tourist i'm a tourist their teeth are good for 1d8s though taking your pee break now 23 wow she rolled two threes in a row on that walk while they're leading the way i quietly walk alongside pike and fill her in on everything i have seen happen with percival the smoke coming out of him the darker turn in his personality the way that he branded that man everything that i am worried about the cough everything so that she's filled in on his darker turn all of us yeah 26 on perception big guy come here this is new these haven't been here long i'm not very strong do you want to start hucking rocks i am extremely fast and nimble and could totally fuck you up but i can't lift that much including door jambs could you help me move these rocks you look very handsome in that beard scanlan squish in there she'll light up the hole i lean down and say does it look like somewhere that we can rest for the night i flip my flametongue dagger over backwards and hand it to him through this little hole this was taken care of in their minds i say we squeeze grog and trinket in here yeah i'll go ahead a bit and take a quick peeky-poo no i use the other hand and i tweak his nose as hard as i can we came to a land of evil without-- or at least through next week i think to myself oh that is badass (laughter) you're getting the radiant digit i watched all of that and when i saw him lean back into the earthen wall i quietly back up and i'm going to go down the tunnel like 50 feet and see-- 23 from the glowing gnome 20 60 or 70 feet i'm going to go another 60 or 70 feet i would like to just sit down on the ground and close my eyes and listen for a full minute and see if i hear anything 21 pretty good i quietly walk all the way back and walk behind the group and i go goosh look at that i was like ten feet around the corner i've got this i pick up two small roundish oval-shaped stones from the ground and i slide them into grog's nostrils plugging them up 14 i'm removing one hit point from my-- no no i'm not no my rolls are too high you really don't notice (laughter) but i'm not going anywhere i'm going to go sit down by percy and what i'd like to do is watch everybody nod off and in 20 minutes nudge him awake hi i want you to get some sleep but i want to talk for a minute that's all right we can separate them this thing what do you really know about it how do we know that this thing isn't whispering in sylas's ear what do you really know about this thing i want to tell you something we're almost like family now and i've seen you do many great things and you have earned my trust but if you hurt my sister if you hurt anyone else in this group inadvertently-- all right then it's pretty cool isn't it well hold onto that can i borrow just a pinch of your black powder just a finger dab i lick my pinky and i put it in and i slowly draw a big ballsack on grog's forehead sure that's a 23 i did do little hairs on them as well well it grows here so it grows there i don't know or do i he goes to sleep i'm going to do my duty with keyleth for a watch i thought we were both staying up all right i'll watch everybody i'll stay up for two hours natural 20 20 while the fancy people are talking i walk over to grog and say big man you've got mud or something on your face come here and i take my hand and i wipe across his forehead and smear out what i did sorry (laughter) sorry we throw the signal to the sky and go up this tunnel scanlan we're going to make a leap of faith that pike can stay oh prepare to be gif'd mercer way to humble-brag pike only astrally best line of the night ice cream still not cracking a hundred immune to fear and what was it i'm taking point i want to check out that wall that i sat right in front of yep come on everyone i'm going to perception it 20 on perception i silently signal to everyone and i slowly stealth around the statue to check out the room i reach out past my sister and pat him on the shoulder peacock a little more for us please (whispering) can you please fix grog's back wait before we use-- listen this could potentially be humiliating for all of us before we expend any of our arcane abilities please let us all at least try and fail before you take out the hand let's do the one and a half elf push shall we you you and me all the average-shaped people one eight come on pike somebody draw it please draw it wait i fistbump pike pop my hood up and then quietly go into the room yeah i'm the best person to do this 29 for stealth disadvantage that's fine that balances out and my first roll was a 29 total can you help me understand the makeup of it again you said two passages-- one to the left one to the right-- and a chamber directly ahead between them i know we've got two paths but he said there's a room as well yeah so both paths and there's a room closer to me right all right into my little earring i say (whispers) i'm not doing anything fucking crazy i'm just going to go ahead this is the only thing i can do and i move quietly into the close chamber i stop moving entirely and i just wait and can i hear anything besides that there's nothing else i hear besides that in this room there's no dim light or anything okay i should be able to see then if there's dim light up to 60 feet okay i slowly back up away from that and creep up the hall and stop at the corner before it turns and i just lean my head out and i listen 27 got it so i tiptoe all the way back to everybody and say listen stop doing that stop there's two passageways up the way i think we're in some sort of dungeon-- i had surmised as much there's possibly an old person in one and then sounds of something so both of the chambers are occupied i came back to confer with you instead of going off on my own because that gets me in trouble one time only what do you want to do do you want to talk to the possibly old person with the crazy eyes thing percy you probably want to take out one of those contraptions of yours i'm rolling along with percival it's 30 this time oh 40 this time only with her can i give her seven of mine drawing a blade just in case looking away in the darkness i hand stupidly my flametongue dagger to scanlan again and push him forward with it just him mr high charisma wait if we destroy the briarwoods it will be no trouble to come down here and let anyone out who's down here if she's who she says she is we don't know they're not much but i have rations and a waterskin i toss them through the bars of her cell and there are creatures on the road and in the woods and quite frankly you're safer right now if we do what we have come here to do we will come back for you we can come back for her her fate is intertwined with our own if she leaves she has a very good chance of being killed if we go forward and succeed we come back and she lives if we go forward and she dies she's where she is this is the best place for her i've just given you food and water we'll be back within 24 hours come on we're going he was the first one out of the light roll intimidation eat that lembas bread no no no there's something i don't know what i couldn't make out what i was hearing it sounded like hay or grass moving so i don't want to mess with that no that was her passage there's another passage to presumably another set of cells so i will skip along quietly 20 feet ahead of you all try to see 21 this is the second room yeah this is where i heard something before and my perception vex come up here and look around i don't see anything but i feel like something's here pike do you is there anything here do you sense anything in this room all right so there was dungeon and dungeon set of cells and set of cells but you said-- i gave her food and water she scrabbled at it at this point i grab my sister and i say come on we're going to check the cells and we look at every single one of them in vasselheim there is grog do you get any ideas watching her do that we're making asses of ourselves yes the answer to that is no we'll be back i'm going to go creep up the stairs i'm moving towards those stairs shush you don't know anything shut up they mostly come out at night mostly can that astral connection hold
