very very very special that's some heavy she-ra juice no he promised to free-ball it garbage wine pirate on pirate violence is verboten that's true you are going to judge me for finger motions hold on everybody stop the game laura bailey just shamed me for a sexual finger motion at this table after three and a half motherfucking years i have seen everything resume the game how did you fall into it where do you hail from what do you snipe with you're an interesting fellow my name is phillip what is that i don't have my contacts in i can barely see it that's 11 right so that is 17 oh i am a navigator newer but eager and looking forward to plying my trade it's right that way it's still over toward the hallway over there you know this is our first time on these islands and i don't know much about it at all is there any legal system here do you know what i mean or is it just you know-- (gunshots) i am a big reader and there is a lot i don't know like my tall friend over here i mean there must be trouble that breaks out there must be bar fights well i can see the appeal but what happens if there's something risky or it causes theft of property for someone important so plank king is the law that's biblical we are trying to get the lay of the land here might have gotten to that perhaps you have mashed his hair spikes down caleb brings a big mug of ale and sits down close to avantika and says over this din this is a big longshot but you seem very well-traveled and well-researched this place is crazy but any place worth its salt has books why are you laughing at me why are you laughing at me such a straightforward question well i can tell from your reaction that there is probably no good place to acquire a book but you seem more educated than the normal sort-- or people around me-- so perhaps you have a suggestion for a scholar lost at sea sundry square during the day should i be checking the trash bins for these then or do you think someone might actually have them for sale i'm jonesing pretty badly for a good book like a person's worth oh jeez take my chair fine i'll go get another former business associate 13 yeah i'm more concerned about the waves you have experience with this diving yes or no question pretty sure it's anywhere ooh cold here comes the fanart i hope (as nott) all right i'm done hand me that dead cat you're not going to drink that are you yeah well it's a lumpy place you doing okay you seem a little off to me yeah you seem distracted around this woman oh is it because she's a murderer oh i don't like that part about her i don't think that all of us are murderers are you a murderer yeah but that's a very specific thing you know if your life is in danger that's one thing you know if something happens in the heat of the moment or there's danger in both directions murder is premeditated that's a very different thing i find it hard to believe that you have killed someone with premeditation i could be wrong but-- that i believe yes i have yeah sort of oh well nott and i have robbed people for sure people with not a lot of money so that we can eat that did that we did to you when we first met you you know we turn one thing into another and then we go stay at an inn and buy food and then it turns back into pennies and that's not so good but when you're starving they didn't know it though yeah no do you want any ale boy this is quite a predicament that we've gotten ourselves into how the hell-- we were visiting your mother your mother was so lovely-- that's not true we'll get you home we're here-- this is fjord's thing we're his support we're here to help him out beauregard and i don't want to be here forever either i don't think i know that i do not want to be in this place or on the sea forever it's interesting nott is like a cat clinging to the ceiling she's like a cat on a hot tin roof really none of us like it here but fjord kind of there's parts of it that he likes i don't know you're sweet on him yeah yeah how do you mean i think so that's a little out of my realm of experience i'm sorry i don't forget anything she was handsome no i said she she was handsome yeah the best for me that was a long time ago anyway let's just focus on getting out of this place away from that woman is there anyone paying attention to us or like just leaning in a table together very low elf 11 well i don't care i'm pulling out the wire and i'm putting it in my mouth we'll take care of her if we have to (coughing) yeah just a cough a cold i want to get the hell off this island eventually but we're here now tomorrow-- yes we'll find-- no probably not but we'll get sorted we'll make the best of this place we'll help fjord figure out his shit i suppose yeah then we'll get out of here and then you can reassess back on dry land thanks for not leaving me on the street like a drunk i think we'll probably going to get a room somewhere here is this place an inn or a tavern i did not even look coming in did avantika leave or did she go up probably to shit in an alleyway just drinking until-- if ever you're going to squat on that chair in a perch this is it (laughter) a few hundred years is there some sort of weather pattern or natural phenomenon that is responsible for this but there aren't creepy stories about every inch of it is there fair point what are we looking for are we just taking it in learn the city a wig ja and how well-lit is it out here maybe they thought they were tough and strong and they were not as tough and strong as they thought so now they sell rope 12 how far away can you do a pop-in we could also potentially send frumpkin with a note or letter leave it also this leads me to a question i have which is instead of discussing the short term which we want to do i want to ask you about the long term if we ditch tiffany and we find the apricot tree what happens then like what is your plan with this apricot i think we have ideas about what could come from it she's done what she did at the first tree and you got the next tree and maybe she races to the-- what happens next fjord like i know you are curious but what is the plan we'll call him honda do you know how at the first tree an apricot was picked and things shook something happened there this place was all about drei the number three so you want to go pluck another fruit and that's two out of three and what happens once the third-- i am not telling any of you especially you what to do here but an alternative plan is to get rid of anyone who knows about the location of the tree and bury the tree what if some of us kept avantika busy this is difficult what if fjord keeps tiff busy- man oh man-- what if the green guy and the gal are busy you follow let me finish the thought you do that thing you take your little doorway over you do what you want to do then poof you are tiffany you walk off the boat because tiffany is busy 100% busy not maybe busy maybe she's sleeping maybe she's out for a walk it's real quiet at this table (laughter) you're small that's also true he's right here well frumpkin has had a peek inside of her quarters after she has seen him she did not see him the first time although to be doubly sure i could change his shape again but you know if we're not comfortable i could change frumpkin to be say a raven or something that's where it's going to go down is in the bloated cup i thought maybe it would say like maybe you know romantic on the boat but great good so if that's the case then i'm not getting into that room i think that i should tail this team instead if you've got an eye on the exit to that building yeah yeah i think what beau's implying is perhaps it's better that we're never seen there at all here is how i would like to contribute first i'm going to disguise myself when it is time not yet but i will make myself look like voice actor charlie adler i will be salt-and-pepper-- i'll fit right in on the docks i won't be in a denim tuxedo but i will wear traditional pirate garb they are bullshit there will be no sleeves on this disguise i'm going to hang out between the bloated cup and the ship looking like charlie frumpkin i will just have circle a continuous circle above the whole area so i can see the guards on the boat and we can message each other ja i'll just be eyes in the sky charlie on the ground (singing) thunderstruck do me a favor i'm going to go outside now okay and keep watch let me know when you're on and give me updates good luck charlie adler charlie for every spell i'm out in the docks you said the boat-- oh okay also while they do that-- i'm sorry i was going to say once i'm out and about about once every 30 seconds i will lean on something pretending like i'm slightly drunk and i will go into frumpkin's vision from above just for five seconds to look at the activity on the boat and where those guards are and then go out of it okay ooh terrible so terrible that's six or seven it's all that fog just like macbeth caleb probably has wandered close enough to the boat now and hearing-- we've established the-- apologies to my german teacher from high school i start pissing on the docks and singing laurentia liebe laurentia mein (singing) am sonntag (speaking) urination (singing) ach wenn es doch endlich schon-- okay well i'm definitely pissing and singing yep i have rolled such shit tonight that's a five (singing) von dienstag oh okay well i'll do my best to knock things over as i go (shouting) hey macarena (singing) we will we will rock you rock you (singing) b-a-n-a-n-a-s (singing) hast du etwas zeit fur mich you're stealthing sam and none of us knew about the crow's nest person (drunken singing) it's pandemonium on the docks right at this point yeah i would have quieted down with the singing and just tried to go more lowkey i don't know what's going on so i'm still watching the boat and one eye on the loaded underwear-- what's it called the bloated-- bloated cup fjord's bloated cup what did you say perception still rolling shit tonight 12 boat bloated cup back and forth waiting quit while you're ahead motherfucker not a giant hole charlie adler busts into the inn and sees caduceus and just stops the door and pulls out a little wire and says i don't know where anybody is we have to go to the boat now come on caduceus no one told caleb shit no i saw people running to the boat in danger and you lead off pandemonium on the ship and fire on the ship they dropped their shit (protestant noise) it went very well i take it the slow creep on your face matt come on high charlie adler concurs (laughter) no it's caleb that what detects a problem wherever they are celestial common sylvan with my experience tinkering with comprehend languages would i believe this is something i could-- yeah all right i begin casting the ritual spell it'll take me 11 minutes to be able to read this if i can caleb is not listening to anyone he is sprinkling pinches of salt and soot in a circle around the book (mutters) well it's up to you (poof) all the soot and salt ignites and then suddenly whoa what's it say so caleb would seeing this play out as he reads would explain it all very carefully and delicately because he knows how conflicted a subject how charged a subject it would be for fjord but does tell everyone in the room everything she's cooked minor detail in caleb's deciphering of all the fragments was there any sense that there was any kind of romantic relationship between avantika and vandren or it's unclear okay yeah her own cipher that's not helpful at all which necklace would that be first time i'm seeing it not really but just give me ten minutes here's the question could brainiac caleb with this book which is her own coded cipher comprehend languages with enough time try to study the recurrence of vowel sounds consonance sounds and try to create a key to this book yeah but people break codes-- i've rolled shit all night every roll natural 20 (cheering) oh pretty good straight intelligence right 28 yeah it bumped up to 20 when i leveled up saving throw sorry i was looking at the wrong place that's correct 25 that's fine i would like to-- because i was asking you a question and then suddenly it was happening right let's say caduceus gives caleb the necklace he'll take ten minutes to figure out what this jade necklace is and spend the night decoding this book it's not a book it's a necklace just says found someone special this is like that around your neck except it's specific to warding off poison no poison it could help any one of us really would you like it nott i say we tie it to a rock and drop the rock off a specific dock and maybe we're lucky and it's still there later we have to be able to have someone point the finger at her though because what happens if she finds it herself later but if she finds it she could throw it out she could sell it she could say i found this in my room i mean that's unpredictable i mean we can't control that this is the key anything else is a distraction can only cause wrinkles so we ditch it maybe somewhere where it can be found again but it is not as important as this book is so we solve this and her goose is cooked we do though i have a question for the group because i don't remember did beauregard share with the group that she got tapped by the plank king maybe we send frumpkin with this stuff in tow to his little perch with a note an anonymous note i have a copy in my noodle ja i can write it down well it could be an anonymous note or we could send frumpkin once we leave here and you could sign it from beauregard spill it girl spill it to go with this once i have deciphered it for them avantika's coming for your throat this is the evidence do with it what you will we go to the pomegranate tree we could also add to this note that frumpkin delivers that avantika-- here is your proof that avantika wants your throat the whole crew is complicit no here's the thing if we just give them a page-- i am going to make a cipher that can be used to decode this book if we send a cipher and the book they can take time to read the entire thing hmm ja that's good but we'll leave immediately correct ja goodnight i take out the silver thread first i only used one sam and i wasn't working on the book and the cipher all at once all through the night that's what i'm saying yeah ja yeah yeah yeah sorry right this very minute he's a one-ounce owl ten minutes stall for me dumb as a brick it's in caleb's possession isn't it i take a bit of phosphorus and squelch it through my hand and cast wall of fire across the entire length of the boat between them and us i'm sweating like the salt on the rim of a margarita phosphorus through my hand we should have worked out frumpkin in advance marisha and i thought we'd have time in the morning the last ten minutes have been like don't cast it just wait just wait just wait okay yes
