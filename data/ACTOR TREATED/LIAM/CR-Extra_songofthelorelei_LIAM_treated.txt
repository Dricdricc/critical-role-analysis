then dive into critical role [click tv static] [groovy critical role theme] okay i don't want anyone to think that laura is a really bad d&d player even though she is so matt for some reason maybe an act of sabotage before he left for the desert signed into laura's ipad and now laura can't get into her ipad to get at her-- here's the good news you work on that because to begin this game it is storytime oh i get to use all of matt's toys where does he get these wonderful toys did it do it it did it on the edges of the cyrengreen forest not too terribly far from the city of deastok on the continent of wildemount stands lorelei castle home for many generations to the lorelei family the lorelei bloodline stretches back almost three centuries but only rose to prominence during the war between the dwendalian empire which we now reside within and the julous dominion which once ruled the southern half of the marrow valley in the preceding age the loreleis proved their worth in that conflict and were gifted for their service with a stretch of land that you five siblings were born and raised on it was also during the bloody struggles of that long past war that the bloodline would be changed forever during a near fatal encounter your ancestor alfarr lorelei was bitten near the end days of the war the curse of lycanthropy burned its way into the blood of alfarr in a relentless fever that nearly drove him mad but he did not bend to it he persisted as did his daughter and her sons and so on the family's secret has been closely guarded over the centuries and in its earliest days the curse was seen as just that a curse but with time came acceptance and the responsibility of power once of age lorelei youths eventually undergo the taming of their wilder nature and their animalistic blood and it has largely been responsible for the family's ascension over many a generation some have faltered there have certainly been dark periods in the lorelei history individuals who let their baser impulses rule them but the family always returned to the right and the good aurra lucius lu-see-us or lu-shus portia and the twins benicio and lawrence you know a little of this struggle yourselves at least you hear tell from your father-- i love this game at least you hear tell from your father and your great aunt katerine your father haldur lorelei never knew his own mother genevieve lorelei but by his aunt katerine's account she was unbridled and wild spurned the taming embraced the animal within more than the family would have liked it led to her doom they would say it was that very nature that drew her into a whirlwind romance with a man the family did not approve of haldur or hal was born out of wedlock and never knew his mother she was murdered not far from the castle grounds and found in a wolven heap her father was dead or fled or possibly killed genevieve the family theorized anyway the only mother hal knew was aunt katerine who loved her sister's son with all her heart raised him well led him through the taming made him the kind and just nobleman he is today sadly history repeats and repeats and katerine is mostly the only mother you five have known either when your mother rosalind died during the birth of the twins old though she was katerine dutifully continued her role as the family matriarch aurra you as the oldest and you lucius two years aurra's junior you both remember rosalind some but for all of you it has been old aunt kat who sat by your beds as children who taught you your letters and how haldur and katerine love you you've grown into your adulthood with grace and strength and absorb the lessons of your forebears to an extent aurra you were meant to rule this house after your father is someday gone but like your grandmother genevieve and others with that wilder streak in the family's history you have eschewed the taming in fact much to your father's heartache you have chosen instead to wander the wilds forsaking civilized nobility entirely he loves you and you love him but it's been complicated lucius in a similar vein you too have chosen a path outside of the lorelei's elder traditions you were but a child when you heard the voice of the moonweaver whispering to you by the light of the full moon you soon began praying to her nightly when you were old enough to make up your own mind you followed her voice to the temple and found your second family it was really portia accomplished and driven portia who first fit the mold of the lorelei noble you excelled at everything demanded to undergo the taming two years early and while you love your older siblings dearly you know if they have no desire to rule you will gladly assume that seat of power then there are the twins our two burly hulking twins studious and serious-minded larry lawrence really you underwent the taming as was expected and you're prepared to offer what the family requires but your true love is logic reason and the study of this curse that runs through your family's blood perhaps it can be better understood and better used for the good of house lorelei if anyone can do so it is you then there is you benicio slightly taller than your twin brother with none of the useless fixation on books you couldn't wait to undergo the taming you had an itch for danger from an early age and were impatient to enter your adult life and flex power it was this love of trouble actually that led you to burning your arms so badly all those years ago all in an attempt to prank your twin by sabotaging one of his explorations of alchemy lesson somewhat learned two weeks ago each of you received identical letters from your father haldur summoning you home to castle lorelei intimated in those letters is his wish to discuss the family's future and the handing down of power within the family you all have been spread to the winds the last six months to a year maybe following the individual threads that life has laid before you now hal is eager to see his children all around him again as yet another token of his love he has provided you all with three days and nights of rest recuperation and general pampering together at one of the finest inns in deastok the shaded bough it is here that we begin this current verse in the song of the lorelei you are gathered in the sumptuous dining room of the shaded bough your breakfast is finished your bags are packed b-o-u-g-h travis and your horses have been prepped for your departure and it is raining yeah so do i where is it where is it matthew drop a beat the morning is yours it is about a day's journey home to castle lorelei you have a way you go we have a shortcut that will get you there before sun is down but it does not look as much fun as you expected it to be with the heavy rain yeah you just finished your breakfast in a very fancy dining hall you spent the last three days getting facials steaming catching up i would like to thank whatever videogame company screamed you hoarse to make you sound so deep well if there's any business you want to see to you can certainly can but we could also hit the road if you'd like hoods up into the rain you leave the shaded bough mount up and ride out of the larger city of deastok it's slow going the visibility is low the rain is pouring in sheets but you are taking the same path you always have when traveling between deastok and your home the quickest route there is following the main road for three or four hours there's a particular field that you're all familiar with which if you cut across there is a stream there-- a small river wispern river-- which you cut over and you can get home by the end of day if that's the way you want to take or you can take the long way which i don't know why you would there is a great deal of trouble not in these parts we're more towards the east in wildemount but to the west there is mounting confrontation with the country of xhorhas all the military forces have been sent in that direction rumors-- hey man i don't know what matt's planning so let's keep it vague shall we but word has gotten back to you not generally known but to you lucius that it's not been going well on the front no there is definitely hiring of-- there is a criminal element in deastok and you do keep tabs on it but nothing-- no bump certainly that would alarm you okay so portia wisely avoids the wispern river anticipating possible flooding so it's going to be a long journey it will take the better part of the day you might not make it by sundown this time in fact in the interest of time we'll say that you ride all day in the wain-- liam and mawwaige (singing) werewolves in the wain (speaking) see we're very serious here you spend most of the day riding and getting sopping wet and miserable and you are looking forward very much to seeing all of the familiar faces who work in the castle the cooks the people in the stable all the familiar faces and catching up with your father you maybe are a little anxious about seeing him for the first time in a while but still the sun does eventually set and you ride for a bit in the dark you do have in your belongings some hooded lanterns which is lucky because that's the only thing that would stay lit in weather like this castle lorelei is built on a tall hill a ways from the road on the edge of the cyrengreen forest so you've spent a lot of your youth poking into those woods and getting into trouble you especially nostalgia always hits when you return but something is off this time returning home at night-- which you've done before this is not the first but coming around a bend about a mile away from lorelei castle you're used to seeing lights twinkling on the horizon few fires and torches in various places in the castle but you don't see any of that today it is pouring rain it is very dark out and you're a little bumped a mile out from home luci only you notice as you draw even a little bit nearer that the gates to the castle are open as well you're doing it you're doing it there are multiple entrances to the castle there's one at the back there's one on each side in fact on the back side of the castle facing towards the woods and the family cemetery grounds and the fields you played in you guys loop around in the dark okay you guys do in the dark make your way around do you want to leave the lanterns lit or are we going to go in total-- the woods are a half mile out from the back of the keep everybody make a stealth check great what'd everybody get did you oh six okay you guys are traveling along the outer wall and lucius is trailing behind and you do hear metal scraping against stone for a split second arguing you eventually make it around back and you do find the one single small door that is on the back side of the keep it also can be fired at from above but no one's doing that it is also barred from the inside you'd know because you live here obviously make an investigation check look at that it's that easy you just make it up no nothing seems amiss it is dark maybe you're missing something but it looks like the same old door in the same spot that you would run out in the middle of the night you'd opened it from the inside and leave it that's what you've always done is left a crack yeah it's not a (squeaking) it's a (thudding) you can certainly try you are pretty strong how are you doing this yes it is heavy wooden door one slat is a little mangier than the others you can have advantage because your brother and sister offered to kick that shit with you you do slam your foot as hard as you can into that door and it does break it pushes in about this far and it is dark in there but there is now about this wide a gap so if you can shrink a lot it actually smells terrible it smells nauseating yes you do smell the smell of a heavily ripe rotting body also lucius you know where you are this room-- which used to be a meeting hall-- when you were inducted into the temple of the moonweaver your father as a gift to you had it altered and turned into a chapel in honor of the moonweaver for whenever you visited you can see about six feet in from the angle that the wood is in it's still blocking your way and you can't get your noggin through that gap but you do see two legs and an arm and a stone with congealed blood on the ground no they look like three separate bodies you see up to a shoulder on one and the other one you just see the ends excellent okay make an attack roll on that door did you roll higher than a five you hit it roll for damage oh man the door breaks one hinge busts inward you now have a one foot view it's still connected at one hinge and didn't come off it would be hard to climb up and over into the gap but you're looking in it's a pile of bodies it's about 15 bodies piled in the middle of a chapel devoted to the moonweaver this is ground level there is an underground level and it is three stories yes you do you see one of the cooks a woman named estelle you see the stable master and his eight year old son you see two of the guards the others you don't recognize per se make an investigation check absolutely perception check the door has not been broken free so you can look in it's hanging on a diagonal angle it probably wouldn't take much more to take it away they are all slashed to shit 14 for finding dad you do not see your father no nothing is moving and the door on the far side of the chapel which leads into the courtyard inside the castle walls is closed you have very much illuminated the wretched pile of lost souls in the center pews have been pushed to the side and they're in a heap in a mound in the middle of the room i will say that door comes right off the hinges in that case the door comes right off the hinges clatters down onto the ground and you're now standing on top of it make an investigation check he's been playing for 30 years what did i just say perception they seem like they have been dead a while in fact follow that up with a medicine check you bend down by the body of the cook-- a woman who has cooked many meals for you-- and you check the body and study the blood on the ground and how hard it is and you can tell that it has been somewhere between-- i don't know two weeks a month maybe these bodies have been here a while no he's not you push over a few bodies you spend five minutes sorting through the dead and they're all-- there's no upstairs here within the wall are rooms on the ground level there is this chapel there's a great meeting hall where your father receives people there are the kitchens there are the stables the courtyard is huge and the entire thing is empty in the middle it's where you've trained and where you've played you would get there by exiting the door on the opposite side of the room i should add it's only the towers of the castle for the watch and the central keep that is three stories tall the rest of it is low buildings in here there is only a single shield okay it has the two arrows with the crescent moon in the middle that is symbol of the moonweaver upon it okay lucius pushes past you all opens the door lucius by the dim light of the rocks that you illuminated in the chapel you can see a little bit out here the first thing you see walking into the courtyard it is mostly empty what you can see is a pile of weapons in the center of the courtyard piled up there seems to be a cart on the far end but it's very dark so you can't make much of it okay it's still a ways off it's about 100 150 feet away but there is a cart full of vegetables half unloaded you can't tell quite what they are from here make an investigation check there is the residue and trails of blood leading from the courtyard you can't see it in the mud in the courtyard because it's raining so heavily i'll add that it's still raining is it still raining you do i can't tell from here on the threshold leading in you see trails of blood that are getting washed away by the torrential downpour excellent from your vantage point-- to help you see the thing you've known all your life-- you're standing with the chapel at your back and on your right is the keep your home your old bedrooms are in the keep your father's bedroom his study your aunt katerine's bedroom you also to your right have the great hall there are smaller one-story buildings that line the inside of the castlethere are the kitchens you can see the open gate now because you've lit the courtyard so well even though it's further off you can see the open gate where you were standing 30 minutes earlier and that cart you've been standing here taking it in long enough you notice there are also two people on that cart they're not moving well they're not moving there are many there's probably somewhere between 40 to 50 weapons here there are blades there are mauls there is a mace or two i will say also as you're running in you look at it this mace looks old as you run up to the cart you see instant recognition from your youth from your teen years one of the farmers that tills the land on castle lorelei's grounds is shot full of crossbow bolts as is his 15-year-old son they're leaning against each other it's a cart full of turnips apples some cabbage it looks like someone has started to unload it although it does not look like it pulled up it looks helter-skelter make a medicine check yeah maybe it's the rain that has been pouring on them all day long but there's not as much to go on as the bodies indoors they definitely weren't killed today the keep the largest structure in this castle there are stairs that lead up to a large ornate set of doors into your home the doors are shut good question you don't see anything like that and there's certainly no living animal or living being in here noted okay who's leading the way you ascend the stairs towards the doors to the keep do you mean to just push in sure fuck lucius presses his ear to the door and his free hand to his other ear to block out the sound of the rain shuts his eyes and listens for a full 30 seconds it takes you a moment to cancel out the sound of the rain drumming but you do it and you hear absolutely nothing it swings open it's big you hit it and it goes (creaking) in here in the great hall it's not much but there clearly has been a fire in the hearth here that is burning down to embers there is dim light in the grand entryway to your keep to your home the first thing that strikes you is a small wooden table and three chairs pulled into the center of the room there is a smattering of playing cards thrown out across the table make an investigation check at disadvantage nope you have got the reek of death in your nostrils right now and you can't smell anything else it's a wonder you can hold your breakfast in no grand entry hall your rooms the twins' joint room your room your room your room are all upstairs your aunt kat's room is upstairs your father's room your father's study is upstairs oh yeah okay make a perception check there is a very nice carpet under that table and in front of that fire you do see wet prints pressed lucius is ascending the stairs would you make a perception check at advantage is that a 20 erica sam and you honestly do smell your father it's not strange for any of you but especially you you spend so much time in the woods not in your human form and that smell is coming from upstairs sure make a new perception check does jester have guidance what was it you listen you close your eyes and listen you're a big listener silence i will tell you guys just to remind you of the things you've never heard of before this very second you know at the top of the stairs is your father's study where he welcomes guests then out from there in a ring on the second floor are all of your bedrooms and your aunt kat's bedrooms it is with your gigantic shoulder right with all the scar tissue on it you're pushing it open all right you do and nothing happens oh that's so satisfying but it's so familiar to you you look around scanning the room and his shelves of books and ledgers are all there a map of wildemount is on the wall by deven rue not by deven rue the great leather armchair his great desk the thing that is not always there is the severed hand sitting on it with a very familiar silver ring on the ring finger and a crumpled up piece of paper grasped in it it grabs you no yes okay and are you putting it on or are you-- with father's love yes also on the wall what you know is magical is your father's sword vargr which is a great black-and-gray steel blade and an iron hilt with the skull of a wolf carved into the hilt portia it is a longsword make an investigation check 11 yeah it's not too hard to find there is a spray of fairly dried blood along the edge of the chair and on the floor here no personal grudges no he was an only child raised by his aunt yeah okay you run down the halls the door on the end to the left coming up the stairs are you going in okay bust the door open she has one of those old four-poster beds it is clear that a scuffle has happened in here the bed is askew and there are shredded claw marks in the bedding make an investigation check yeah that roll was entirely extraneous you just walk around the room and once you clear the other side of the bed you find the lifeless body of your aunt katerine in her white gown for sleeping run through dried blood along the white of it you rolled a 21 you can tell by the lay of the sheets and the blankets trailing off the bed on the other side she made those claw marks you guys once saw your brother benicio in his werewolf form drunkenly riding on a horse and slam his head into a low-hanging tree branch and as soon as he passed out and hit the ground he reverted back to his regular form no twice yeah you've been there not in the last year because you guys have been off but at least once a year you would go with your father to pay your respects to your own mother who lays there now and his mother who lays there now at the very rear of the crypt so yeah you know it well yeah it is you were quite close to it when you were standing at the back of castle lorelei going through your old sneak-away door it's about a half-mile away from the back okay what i will say is that over the next 90 minutes and the use of a spade that you grab on the way out from the courtyard you two go out to the edge of the woods and take care of your aunt katerine she was very old the rest of you search all of your rooms you go to the twins' rooms first in that room your bed has been slept in and there are books thrown all over the floor and pages torn out of them you go to your brother lucius's room and it looks like his closet has been rifled through heavily there's clothes strewn about the room the bed has been slept in you visit portia's room you yourself portia and you see that someone has been sleeping in your bed too there is a bundle of crossbow bolts leaning against the wall in this room there is a somewhat ratty fur-lined vest draped across the writing desk and there is a dagger sticking out of the edge of the desk just right yours lawrence yours was just right your paintings of women from marquet are still intact yes the seven dancing veils scroll is still there you two are off right if you want i can jump back to you but let's finish searching the house one was your book on maths that you were very fond of some of your favorite works of fiction are torn up one piece of paper has a bit of poo on it in the absolute corner it is sitting next to a chamber pot yes and your-- make an insight check he's full of shit he killed them all in the interest of time you do search the other rooms as well you check your father's bedroom which seems to be the first room that is totally untouched and perfect not bothered at all as best you can tell you visit your eldest sister's room it almost looks untouched it looks fine the bed is made there is a strange satchel on it made of a very dark leather oiled yes it smells strange not like the bodies of the dead but it smells strange spiced almost and there is a dagger inside it with elven on the hilt does anyone speak elven both of you it very simply says silent message in elven on the hilt that's all you find here our guests are so disappointed this is what i was sweating let's jump outside is there anything that we're missing with the two of you you were very close to her she told you again and again how much you reminded her of her older sister all right you meet up in the courtyard and report to each other what you found you are not a very grand noble family but you do have emissaries come it was just the blade that they found make a history check well you are none of you have ever traveled abroad but you have been to different parts of wildemount this bag is not any kind of bag you have seen any kind of style of fashion in any of the places that you've traveled excellent you don't have to it is a badass longsword your father has let you wield it before in training it is a plus two longsword it does not require attunement it is very finely made and very sharp no actually in the last five to ten minutes it has slowed to a drizzle now it's misting at this point you just add it man you guys exit through the same chapel that you entered in both you exit out the back of the keep and it is dark out although you are starting to get occasional wisps of the moon almost full appearing as the clouds break and then cover again to get to the family crypts they were built into a cave system discovered hundreds of years ago and that you follow along the treeline about a quarter mile in that direction it wraps around and that leads you to a mausoleum what's the other word sepulcher it's a small building that serves as an entrance to the greater crypts below we set off in that direction i assume are we marching merrily along are we doing anything special this conversation happens as you trudge through the tall grass behind the keep okay you know intimately what it looks like it is a low wall surrounds the entire cemetery and it's broken it's old so the wall is fragmented and easy to enter from any side really there's a wrought-iron fence that is aging and decrepit but that also surrounds the mausoleum itself many generations are buried both in the grounds and below you watch as aurra pops her shoulders and twists her neck and you see her grow a full two or three inches and her shoulders widen and that very familiar prickle of fur which starts like needles but then pushes out and becomes thick do me a favor erica what is the pattern of fur she stands there her breath floating in the air it's cold now after the rain you're seeing her breath in great heaves in the air so through the woods to the back well you can approach it's open almost from all sides so there is definitely an entrance you know that in times of great traumatic pain benicio has always sought solace in slap dick humor into the woods you go i don't require any rolls for this to find the way because you've done it many times you lead your siblings through the woods in an arc and take about 20 minutes to reach a point where you know if you then veer back to your right and out of the woods you will be will be about a hundred yards away from the cemetery grounds so we're stealthing in are you hanging back lucius well how far back are we saying so i'll say everyone make a straight stealth check okay okay so you guys are stealthing through the tall wet grass after leaving the forest behind you what did you get lucius 17 everyone was worried about lucius aurra is so thirsty now that she starts in the still of the night you hear that deep roiling growl in her giant rib cage now but you stalk through the grass and you see that low wall ahead of you and the rear wall of the mausoleum where the ceremonial entrance to the crypts you don't see anything from back here and the main cemetery grounds are in front of the structure are we going to creep up to the wall the wall is only five feet and it's broken in places you can just walk through so you scrabble up claw your way up portia strides in regally alongside you you're now standing at the very rear side of this stone small building not much bigger than the space that we're all in right now in this studio you don't hear anything you don't see anything what do you want to do here make a perception check at advantage at advantage so roll again you smell blood you smell living breathing human blood right now you guys do not see much you're just standing at the back of the building not back here no you know it's on the other side the exact opposite side of where you are make a perception check no just the occasional drift of rain for a few seconds and then stopping it's on and off right now so it is lawrence benicio portia so three blood hunters and our lady of the wood and our man of the claw okay who's taking the left and who's taking the right okay still stealthing along creeping around the edges you start to see the wrought iron fence that surrounds this building you also see the cemetery has been from your vantage point-- and there is you can't see the source but there is actually light here there is flickering light being reflected from some source that you're not able to see on the cemetery which has been abused you see headstones pushed over you see piles of mud you see cloth or canvas tarps lying about in great puddles it's a mess they're further towards the entrance no if this were the building right here and i'm you guys initially coming around the side you would see the light reflecting off of things over there so it's here but out of view that you can't see the source right it looks like it the light is shifting yeah you hear just the gentle crackle of fire make a perception check at advantage no you're not a-- make a perception check yeah it's faint-- whoa it's faint but you feel that telling acrid smell of a torch mm-hmm stone building yeah you guys are exactly opposite each other right now they're doing a running gag that you guys are not in on have you turned the corner you move to turn the corner there's a giant wooden door that is closed here locked for all time unless father's bringing you here for visits but that door apparently is wide open and you still can't see the source but the flickering light's coming from inside so you're going to-- yeah i know exactly what you mean as you stand there and hold your father's blade out to try to catch the light you hear a sound from behind you from two places the sound of fabric and you hear-- and this is happening in a second-- metal banging off stone turning to look you see there are two men at opposite corners of the cemetery in the act of throwing canvas off of themselves each of them has a censer a small metal box or cylinder hanging from a chain and the metal is an oily black color or texture you see in that split second they're starting to spin them and a sickly green mist or smoke is coming out of them you start in your peripheral vision on all sides to see a little bit of movement everybody roll for initiative hold that number in your head we've got lucius and here's our low wall lucius who do we think is where lucius in the lead or is aurra okay we have portia and the twins right here at the door okay and our men here's one of them right here he has long dark brown hair and angular face we have a man who's got-- his head is mostly shaved but wet nappy blueish hair pasted to his skull and is wearing some of lucius' clothing that is seemingly a person that's a person everything else is dead oh sorry 25 to 20 okay 15 to 20 18 okay i'm going to use these things called stat trackers to help me remember what the heck is going on but they're really nifty where's the portia one it's got all your info on it so i can see we'll start here you're first up did anyone get ten to 15 hold on we'll get you all in order benicio you got ten you got 12 so lawrence aurra lucius what did you roll gotcha and oh man portia you are first help me spirit of matt where's your battle music is it happening can you hear it jiggle the cord you can per a long rest do a curse two times yes in werewolf form you can still do all your druidic spells no it's two times you can do one of those maledicts as i understand it no this gate is-- you know it's a model this gate is hanging open there's gaps there's this skeleton there there's a dead warrior here these are your ancestors by the way erica sam and this one here okay that hits okay so portia runs forward with her father's blade rams the sword through the ribs of this-- taking his legs off okay you cleave right through they are brittle and snap into pieces and the thing just falls to the ground and breaks into seven or eight different fragments of person they shake for a moment and lie still well he was already dead but he's gone go for it that does not hit you go to stab through and it actually goes through an empty space in the creature's body it pulls away it does go through its ribs but does nothing to it and it turns towards you now it is benicio's turn unless you wanted to do anything else okay and now we're onto benicio yeah you can get to there sure also as you're running up here you're noticing not a skeleton but what apparently is just a dog who came here to die is also climbing up over the stone wall but you're attacking this one go for it roll to attack that hits for sure okay you bring the glaive down straight on top of its head and it just collapses in like a skeletal accordion it smashes to the ground yeah three seconds later it is just a pile of bone and rags it is not moving sure if you take one more step it's dead half of its face is hanging off there's a lot of flesh on the bones too but not all the flesh 25 you take your glaive and you toss it up into the air and then swing it like a gigantic oversized golf club the glaive's blade catches into the dog's guts something bursts inside sprays your boot and the dog goes (dying snarl) and flies through the air and crashes and rolls down the hill that's it it's gone all right it lasts twice a day you can make either your claw or your blade have that extra arcane energy to it and then it lasts-- i forget how long okay great just don't do it if you're a lavender tiefling with three hit points that's the only rule don't do it then that's right okay now we're onto lawrence it's open (clanging) all right go for it that does in fact hit four points of damage shortsword right you take your sword and you jam it right through its hips trying to take it apart at the legs you've seen how easy it was for everybody to do what they did the hip breaks off and the leg shutters but it (growling) turns around towards you still moving you see it coming around and raising its own rusted old blade you take your other shortsword and swing it at the neck and the head goes pop flies in the air and bounces and rolls into a hole in the ground and scutters away into a grave that's correct but one at a time if it's quick yeah sure now we're on our strangers the one with the long brown hair-- handsome if he wasn't covered in filth-- backs up here and gets into this corner leering and smiling and holding that censer hanging from a chain and you hear him mutter go go this one does the same creeps around pushing backwards eyeing you guys as he goes he moves back into this corner holding the censer aloft and as he moves back he yells out ray ray portia what is your armor class okay you feel a crossbow bolt sink between your shoulder blades you take 13 points of piercing damage looking over your shoulder you see a woman a very ropey ragged red-haired woman standing at a perch on top hiding somewhat obscured behind this-- ah she's dead on this spire up top she is wearing a ragged vest and there's a hood a very wet cloak over her bare arms holding her crossbow and she's leering down at you now it is the skeletons' turns here's what happens this one-- (counting)-- i'm going to move things first so this happens this happens since there's so many-- this one is actually stuck in the ground and it's going like (rattling) reaching out towards you lawrence this one steps into portia this one also steps over to lawrence but this one closes in and starts moving dumbly towards this man in the corner so does this one so does this one they just start converging on this guy he's stuck same thing's happening over here this one moves in and as that's happening you see looks of confusion and pants-shitting fear on their faces as they're suddenly surrounded by the dead but we'll get to them over here we've got three skeletons converging on lawrence and lawrence your ac is 16 the first two swing dumbly at you and they're not that fast they're terrifying they're covered and streaked in mud and 50- to 200-year-old weapons in hand but they're slow and the first two swing at you and you very easily dodge out of the way the last one does while you're busy with those two manage to score a hit on you and you take four points of slashing damage as you feel an old rusted blade bite into your back over here with portia it's not bad it's just one that's an 18 also hits you take eight points of slashing damage cuts into your arm and you feel it gets through some of the scales where two pieces of scale armor meet here it gets right in that wedge then in the corner as they both start to go wha-- what one two three hits misses misses okay over on this side we see two skeletons converging and run this guy through with old blades he looks terrified and white as a ghost as two old blades go (slicing) (spluttering) he spits and a glob of blood flies out of his mouth he is still on his feet though over on this side we get-- same over here this guy is converged on as well and you hear him scream out in a high tenor and he takes a wedge out of the side of him with a sword he doesn't do as badly as his friend over there but he is damaged as well damage for the second is-- okay now we are on aurra wolven aurra what would you like to do you can see her yeah she made herself known she threw a tarp off of herself she was in a little perch up there so you want to use grasping vines what's your spell dc you want to remind me of that it's on your character page in the bottom-right hand corner where i wrote it for you there sam and 15 it's strength right numbers numbers numbers vines burst out of the stone out of the little cracks where barely any soil exists but it still manages to crawl and grow and expand and twist around her she sees it and manages to push and pull away and jump over to this side she is not restrained she managed to pull it off of her legs and get free of it there is a huge patch of vines-- well we didn't specify where it was so she is surrounded by them but she's still holding her own the vines are still there lucius it's your turn that is a spell slot yes you can move right now that was your action if you want to a different position-- you could get over the building i would say climbing up would be your action because that's a very involved thing-- you can use your movement to leap through this all right so your hulking now fur-lined body streaks through this gap in the fence and gets to the bottom and looking up at the edge which is 15 feet high not too terrible for you but it's up there you're waiting lucius okay she does not make that ooh what does that do remind me roll for radiant damage 1d8 on her three okay all right we are back up to portia where you at girl you take six hex-- hix points (southern accent) like them hix points okay so-- her ear is wreathed in flame now 18 hits yes it's a d6 you got your plus two from your longsword 16 points of damage the skeleton erupts in flame it does a small mini explosion in the night here sparks fall bone fragments fall to the ground it is gone you can still move this one here do you want to flank this one or-- where you want to go yeah flanking all right advantage on that then yes it does oh man you bring it right through the thing's spinal cord the ribs go (cracking) break again little fireworks flying it breaks in half and both the halves go flying off in this direction scuttle across the ground land on the puddle and steam (hissing) out after being-- now we are on to-- is that the end of your turn you get all your stuff in benicio you can go five more feet i'll give you oh nice yeah real nice which way are you going here it's (counting) 20 you can go two more you can go-- you don't know to where here i'll let you stand atop that fallen gravestone of your ancestors if you want okay all right so (counting) 25 you got two targets if you want go for it roll for attack this one with a spear that hits they do the halberd you smash into his giant spear knocks the spear out of its bony hand and then the halberd keeps going smashes down into his shoulder and ice fragments go (spurting) and fuse all the bones together hardens the thing's cape in ice and it teeters over falls to the ground and breaks into two pieces of frozen skeleton pop so that one is gone you could go five more feet if you wanted to this one yeah okay this one goes (guttural hissing) and sticks his blade out at your ankle he's stuck up to his bony navel so it does not hit you strikes nothing strikes the ground yes go for it that hits okay you take your halberd in your hand overhand like this you walk over to it and you go (impact) knock it right in the skull and the skull caves in and fills in like sno-cone ice fills the thing's skull the head gets heavy and drags the whole body down and falls into the mud i will allow it coming off of that embarrassing noogie what do you do lawrence i'm going to give you advantage on that 17 hits i'm going to say for flair-- just because it's fun i'm going to say you come at this thing with your shortswords and go eh flip it around to the pommels and go (impact) and nail its skull from both sides and it brittle-- breaks into fragments and the arm goes (faint gurgling) and falls still okay the stranger's turn oh yeah well you're twins what do i want to do the one that looks like a ragged hippie over here throws down the chain and starts to try to climb up on the wall and they all lay into him again (counting) they all stab him in the back very heavily he takes it into the small of his back in between his shoulder blades he screams out in pain he falls down on the ground gets back up and starts moving then over there this guy goes ray help me out here ray he's not going to go down-- oh yeah he is he rushes forward with the blade that he's holding and tries to shove it into the skeleton and actually runs into the adjacent skeleton's blade and gets stabbed in his own gut he's freaking out and panicking he starts to try to climb up rethinking his decision okay he screams out pitifully you've gone from hatred to a brief moment of pity because he sounds like a wounded animal stumbling over climbs up this one moves-- yeah she makes a-- half strength right so it's a disadvantage she is stuck but can still attack can't see the werewolf that she just saw running down the side but she does see the moonweaver's chosen so she fires at him your armor class is 16 she gets-- she misses the crossbow strikes the wrought-iron fence and clatters to the ground and she is stuck there sorry travis all right that guy is pushed down to the ground and run through by three of them standing around and stabbing away over on this side we've got-- yes no shit that guy missed no okay so that guy's dead too he is ripped apart and you see one of them turning its sword upside down and sawing into the back of his neck some have climbed over that little wall there that's right that's it for them now aurra is up okay make an athletics check i know you're already good she succeeds leaps claws grab the lip of the roof and you yank yourself up you actually fly a good three feet higher than you need to and then land your clawed feet clutch into the ground and you are now staring at your prey you used your action to get up there but you could still as a bonus action claw the action was to hoist yourself up to the top of the roof but you have a bonus action left which you could use to take a swipe if you want if it's a bonus action you can i would say that that's too much the best you could do is get right up on her business or slash her as a bonus action because these run in six second chunks and you've taken most of that time to go (exertion noises) not after hoisting herself up i'm going to say well she's held by vines at the moment you can at disadvantage you can use your attack so take the nine is it nine total well i want her to hit her armor class it's an attack it's the attack bonus next to her claw which is like a weapon on her page the center of the page you slash your fur-lined claw through the vines but it is thick and you can't even get through it she's so wrapped in you manage to get your claw onto her ankle she's too firmly held in place by your own druidical power now we're onto lucius now she looks like she knows she's about to done get fucked up (sarcastically) yeah it sucks don't it if i could have one wish this christmas season it would be that all the little boys and girls of the world healing word i think you just do it don't you i got it here it's 1d4 plus your spellcasting modifier so 1d4 plus five wait 1d4 plus -- the best you can do is nine i think it's 1d4 and your -- all righty we are back at the top there's mass healing word then there's healing word okay striding in you get up and you see a brazier propped up and sitting behind a giant round iron gate in the floor that is locked as well that is pried open and bent and there's a crowbar sitting in the corner in here marble stairs lead down and you see the edges of the passage disappear which you're very familiar with obviously over here you went (counting) 20 want to go this way there you're that far anything else okay good that's true okay is that where you want to be or did you not want me to put you right behind one of the skellies okay benicio you're up you can get to either side of her on her left or on her right okay going to hold your ground got to hold an action before you move right sure i don't care you can hold an action if they come at you and take a swing okay great it's whatever i say it is i'll let you stand at the ready don't @ me bro okay good now it is lawrence's turn right okay lawrence yeah just to remind you what you know this is your entire family line down here the torchlight only goes in another 30 or 40 feet before it disappears into darkness but you know that this passage goes a good 100 150 feet straight and then it takes a right it's basically a giant l down here and it goes another equal distance to the end and there are figures of your ancestors evenly spaced down the entire hallway at the very very end is the monument to alfarr and the monument to his daughter grenya as well as the small monument that katerine and your father built of their own choice for genevieve bottom of the stairs 150 feet right it's shrouded in darkness you can't even see the l-corner he's just crept in behind laura (cooing noise) what would you like to do down there sure make a perception check just a straight roll you stand-- you can hear the clatter of blades above and you hear (goofy voice) whoa what where are we going from up behind you there's a lull and you listen very carefully no nothing nothing that you can tell and-- no you finish okay she's in a fucked-up position she's going to attempt to break out of the grasping vine and she does she has half-strength so it's at disadvantage thank you no she does not she yanks against it (pants) and she's starting to hyperventilate looking at the big beast of a woman in front of her she's going to attempt to fire her cro-- no she's not she can't her action was trying to get out of the vines she is beginning to urinate and staring at a large-- that's her bonus action now 20 25 it's hard getting over that little wall for them but they can do it 25 30 and he can't get around over here we're going to 20 25 30 they start 28 days-ing it later like (zombie moans) yes you can strike so go for it does not do it exactly you're a little bit overwhelmed by the clattering of a small horde coming at you and it actually has a shield so it (scrape-clunk) to the side the one that you just hit swings back at you definitely hits yeah oh you chose to dodge so you can't attack well doesn't matter when it hits how do you-- but that's when something walks away from him no i've never heard of that i believe you because i've known you a long time and it does-- you took the dodge action so it misses that was a clatter of wills between shield skelly and you the one next to him got a natural 20 that is a ten points of slashing damage yep okay portia let's see three of these things are in range miss miss that hits the last one hits you take three points of slashing damage you feel your coat tear and just the tip of a blade poke through your scale armor you feel a little cut on the small of your back now we are on to aurra she's in the vines you want to hold her down okay yeah make a strength check at advantage at advantage so roll twice yeah that does it she is pressed down and your claw is holding her shoulder into the vines on top of here and she's (panting) unable to talk just frozen like a deer we'll get to that lucius yeah absolutely (counting) 30 i'm going to say that they're all in range we got (counting) nine what's the dc 15 ah fail fail fail fail fail fail success success these skeletons glow with a pale whitish light they raise their arms to the sky reaching towards the moon which is now clear and then fall into a clutter of death around you well played now we're on portia go for it yeah hits okay you are charging on adrenaline and you take that sword that belonged to your father and ram it straight though the skull it goes through the eye socket out the back and you have to shake it hard excellent with the skull still on the blade-- go for it hits okay the skull crashes down on the skull and it does not get obliterated by slashing damage it's bludgeoning damage as skull hits skull and it crunches it down into the top of the ribcage it becomes condensed so the head is down here now and the two-- the one falls to the ground and you tilt your blade and it goes (scratching) (thud) off the end (singing) benny benny hits just okay you send it right into the thing's-- because you're a cruel motherfucker-- right through the nonexistent groin of this thing and then give it a circle around and the centrifugal force shakes the poor bastard apart and the ribcage falls to one side and the legs clatter to the ground fall down into the hole that the thing climbed out of earlier-- love it you know we have a terrified redhead pinned under a werewolf on the roof of the mausoleum and larry is down in the dark i think this is a good time to take our

much to do it's gone i don't know lawrence-- she'll come out when she's ready lawrence is down below portia is counting her lucky stars i'll say aurra you currently are a big black-and-gray furred beast leaning down on top of this bedraggled ginger thug on top of the mausoleum she's petrified and there's just a moment of silence between the two of you as you huff in her face and you can hear the wind now moaning low against the walls of the castle in the distance and through the trees behind you which comes out in a deep bassy rumble make an intimidation roll (stammering) i'm from deastok we were hired-- we've been living here for weeks working for the elf listen we just do what he tells us he's waiting for you he told us to soften you up i don't know we don't know you feel a little bit of warm liquid run against your knee your furred knee in the vines on top of the building down down (crying) that's all i know i swear to all the gods i don't know anything yeah we watched as he hacked his arm off he's got him down below please i'll go right now i'll run into the woods she arcs over your head lucius and you watch her strike the wrought iron fence behind you she lands with a sickening splut as two of the metal poles go through her gut she is now hanging backwards on the fence but she's not dead she's now just gasping she's holding the iron coming out of her belly absolutely may you please do wisdom save or take damage your dc is 15 right she just makes it so it's 1d8 if it's missing any hit points the damage is 1d12 she wasn't otherwise it's 1d8 the damage increases by one die when you reach 5th so that is 2d8 oh of course she is you're right thank you it's 2d12 because of his level (laughs) she starts gibbering going (groaning) and you watch as blood starts pouring out of her nose and her ears and she's like a goldfish gasping for breath going (gasping) it's not passing yet though she is there going (gurgling and gasping) please (gurgling) she's still she is still now you all stand around the absolute wreck of this woman listening to the wind moan on the hill of castle lorelei flame flickering in the censer inside the mausoleum it doesn't work the same for all of you because aurra has spent so much time free of the shackles of polite society she has lived in her second skin for long periods of time you could do a short rest here if you want to or rush to your father's aid if you wanted to just as a reminder i think i said this when you were looking at things in the study-- or did you look who saw that blood on the floor you did it wasn't fresh yes lawrence i can see this conversation you guys are all sitting against the walls inside the mausoleum with the light of the single censer flickering in the dark the wind blowing and you guys gently bickering like old times sure you can easily grab one of your great-great-great-great-aunt's shield and scoop mud over them they're dark too they're done releasing whatever they were releasing yes that happened no take-backs tj aurra you weren't damaged you're fine are you back to full just checking the clouds have completely blown over and it is a clear night it is not a full moon but it is just shy of one and you feel it are we progressing okay who wants to lead the way that's right (professor frink voice) on my glaive lawrence was the only one who saw this before once you descend these marble stairs down to the crypt it's dark you're still getting the light of the fire above you but that trickles to nothing in about 30 or 40 feet it glows in the dark and the twins lead the way down this hall you've been here many times you've seen these likenesses of people long since past some in this century but the deeper you go the longer back it goes you reach that bend and turn to the right and as soon as you turn something is off because you have been here at night even sneaking out of the back entrance of the keep stealing your father's key on a lark it is always pitch black down here but right now at the far end where you know there is a dead end is light flickering in where the wall is it's hard to tell you're a good 150 feet away from it right now right here where you are into the dark you can absolutely with the intention to what light up the hall currently you can see from the light of his blades that the hall is clear and light gets dimmer and dimmer and dimmer but you see some flickering at the wall far in the distance nothing's blocking your way interesting okay you throw it about 40 feet and it strikes the stone and you hear it go (tinging) you watch as that little light slides down the hall it makes it about halfway there it's strange you know at the end of this hallway is where again alfarr the first of the wolves and his daughter grenya the first to be born a wolf that's where their bodies rest in shrines to each of them monuments i should say your father and aunt kat before your time created a small altar at the end of this hall for genevieve it's the family-- not secret but shame the family was ashamed of genevieve and her leanings and her choices in life and her ferocity they worried that she would let the secret out that generation above katerine they were very rigid and they sealed her away again these crypts were built within an already existing cave system that was utilized and built out your father told you a couple of times it pained both hal and kat but genevieve was laid to rest within a cave and sealed inside never to be seen or to be spoken of where that altar to your grandmother has always been there is clutter on the ground and there is a hole no she was killed outside of the castle grounds you've heard a couple of theories kat was always very reluctant to speak of it it made her very sad the subject it wasn't even a crypt it was just a small statue in her likeness and a small step that hal would leave flowers on there's rubble there right now travis enough of this i walk forward you stride down the hallway your siblings watching as you go it becomes easier to see the statue of genevieve is in three separate pieces on the ground and as you come up by the light of the coin behind you and your own sword overtaking it you see two large black iron hammers lying on the ground here you see what you remember as being a very smooth wall of stone ruptured with rubble lying around and it's not wide but a crack leading through this is something you have never seen before correct make an investigation check you take that blade and spend five minutes carefully checking that hole as you go but looking along the ground you don't see any blood you don't see signs of anything other than the destruction of the stone in front of you and the desecration of your family's most hallowed ground make a perception check with advantage you sniff through your canine snout you don't smell anything but your ear finely tuned listens and listens and you do hear (shallow breathing) deep ahead going in sneaking in or storming in okay i think we should decide an order so we have-- twinsies in front okay so the blood hunters leading the way who's taking the rear and are we one wolf and four humans for now good the way beyond-- you're going wolf okay so your arms your shoulders your biceps swell you start to reach the size of the twins and pass it just a little bit why don't you tell us how you look in your wolven form still holding that blade in your hands stalking forward got it got it okay so two wolves three men the dagger that was found inside silent message yeah it's got elven language carved on it-- well it has elven language carved on it make a history check 18 you've heard a fair amount not as much as your brother you've read about-- okay then roll again at advantage not as good you've read similar names in histories that touch on the nation of xhorhas that is correct the country to the east no so we're pausing at this crack in the wall i assume-- it's not that far what starts-- i lost my place here it starts out as structured excavation you can tell that this was dug out at some point what lays beyond this cask of amontillado-type wall but it quickly gives way to natural formations opening into a substantial chamber ahead it's a cave and there are two torches at the far end of it flickering the cave bisects though not that far in front of you and it seems to split as it opens up there is a passage on your right but your eyes are more drawn very obviously very clearly to the far end where those torches burn a tumble of stone leads up to a slightly higher ledge and you see a figure standing there staring at you all as you enter make an insight check you can you both can okay as you draw a little bit closer he is familiar he is familiar he's slender youthful-looking dark almost blue-hued skin of course sharp ears sharp expression the sides of his head are shorn and there is a shock of white hair tied back he is staring at you and you right now he's wearing dark oiled scale mail with a single chitinous pauldron on one shoulder in his hand there is a cruel-looking flail its jagged edges are currently trailing down and wrapping around the neck of your father who is lying at his feet breathing slowly sam and he is about 100 feet away from you-- he is just deadpan staring at you all okay yes but for the moment-- big man-- what's your name chet tell me-- what do you look like in werewolf form scar tissue they're bigger they definitely get stronger and ropier got it nice okay so that's benicio lawrence keg is aroused the twins go brotastic and you wanted to do-- one second lucius you wanted to say a prayer you said what's the range he's a little too far away where you guys are right now okay you want to charge fucking charge him then okay fuck roll for initiative everybody bring it on out max are you there holy cow yes you can okay this is heavy earthquake okay that goes there that goes there that goes there no okay here is-- where are we all i'd say then at this point then you're here oh the twins were in front so it's black and red you are still in your human form though yes okay am i missing a wolf oh here we are okay one second everybody i'm going to say at this moment in time in lead (counting by fives) i'll put him at 50 feet did you all roll for initiative let me roll for him he is at-- where's my stuff sorry i did not think we were going to launch into this quite this fast but that's fine that's great no not at all okay so who got 20 to 25 23 portia in the lead again 20 for you benicio second place again lawrence okay that's right after lawrence what are your two rolls yeah 13 luci so i'm going to leave a big gap right here and you threw a coin and it landed about here i'll say all right portia you are up just to remind you what you're looking at you're looking at a dark elf with a flail that is wrapped around your father's neck where'd the music go mercer you can only hold an action no you can't pass you would lose until the next time around i color-coded you guys okay so benicio is black lawrence is red portia is blue lucius is yellow and aurra is green about 50 feet okay ten 15 okay okay okay oh man this is why i said i didn't want this so five ten-- by the way i told you guys this before but i'll tell the audience i have no idea how to balance combat so i don't really know what's going to happen (counting by fives) i'm going to say yeah all right what are you going to do go for it go for it 15 plus nine you said definitely hits why does the music keep turning off mercer holy schnikes okay i'm going to say on that second-- hold on a second the two wolves just disappear while running and one of them just continues to naruto run up the hill comes forward with vargr and stabs straight into the drow he is bewildered that this happens that you are on him so quickly (choking gasp) you pull out to strike again but your foot slides on some of the stones it's just a pile of loose rubble up to this ledge and you go tumbling backwards and fall prone and take-- you take three points of bludgeoning damage as you strike your shoulder hard into the stony ground benicio it is your turn you're going to pull him okay make a strength check straight strength yeah as a werewolf that is correct i guess this is the one that doesn't-- just doesn't work out that's fine you yank your father away from the man and the barbed edges of the flail tear into his throat he ragdolls away and you hear a brief (choking) he collapses onto the stone in front of you and is bleeding onto your feet yeah it was laced-- you have him and the flail is free it wasn't tied in a knot it was methodically wrapped around and you have just unraveled it like a ripcord he is going to take a swipe at you with the flail as you back up what's your-- oh i know what it is it is 17 yeah you feel those same jagged edges on the flail rake across your own hairy chest you take five points of piercing damage and 15 points of poison damage from that we'll say two and you are poisoned well actually make a constitution save okay you feel burning inside the veins inside your body your chest starts to burn and you roar benicio roars in this cave and you withstand the poison by trololo-ing you wanted to back up a bit right i'd say you get back down to the bottom of the hill he looks flummoxed let's say the dark elf anything else you're out of juice right lawrence you're up okay (counting) this one right here awesome great so you take 1d6 damage outright or not 1d6 just six what are you imbuing them with lightning saucy okay next up is this stranger you've got dad down here and he shouts out kill them he backs up and crouches a bit behind this broken stone box he mutters something quietly behind and a dark glowing bluish-purple jagged spear appears above his head and starts to angle towards you all i got to look something up but next up is aurra aurra be thinking what you want to do really quick i'll be right with you i'm going to slightly adjust the description of that that jagged spear appears floating right in front of you benicio and on its own goes (whoosh) and shudders toward you you crouch down and cower-- not cower but protect your father's body and the spear strikes the stone behind you then retracts up into the air and quivers in the air above you now aurra you are up so you're going to cast haste on yourself okay all right you do that no you don't need to roll at all the hair all over your body starts to prickle and stand on end and you feel your tendons twist and tighten and you are now the fastest wolf on earth so where're we going 50 here or where because you got some more left you got maybe two more squares ten more feet he's on the other side of benicio i'm going to say no you can't i'm going to say that they're in a pile we've got brother sister father all in a little heap here because you're on your back dad's not good and you're standing but crouching over him don't forget your ac is now higher because of that so you're harder to hit and you have an extra action which you could use to move if you wanted to go further erica if you want to go further so maybe get in front of him so here definitely if you use your hasted action which you now have to stand in his way that's it she used her double movement to get where she was-- oh you've got so much to do you used your doubled movement to get that far you just used your action or your hasted action to get even further you have an action left you're right movement action double-movement-- hey vax you are done you are in fact done unless you had something else is that a bonus action yeah then you can do that yeah it was level one or below i'm going to use a rule called fuck it i'm going to use the fuck it rule healing word if ever there was a moment it is now the wording on the spell is it's 1d4 i think which is wisdom so roll the pyramid plus-- no not that one the pyramid one okay the holes that were raked across your father's neck close and the bleeding stops and he goes (gasping) stop that is the end of your turn oh nice okay so this whole back chamber done and done that's the end of your turn all of you from off on your right suddenly hear thick metal being dragged along stone didn't focus on it before but from out of a deep recess in the wall dark with shadow steps a ghastly maybe ten-foot-tall figure of darkened bone brown almost black tattered decaying robes in a faded ghost of the traditional lorelei green drapes around its scraping lumbering hips a massive canine skull stares at you its eye sockets seeping black inky horror a jawbone of ragged teeth widened beyond comprehension black mist or smoke spilling out in place of a tongue long since rotted away siblings meet your grandmother silence is here she is going to use her action to get closer her head stretches down at the two of you but for now it is your turn portia she slipped into jester your clawsies they're a weapon absolutely well i will say this technically in your werewolf form at your level you can as an action attack-attack with claws and with a bonus action attack so you got three claws whereas if you use your sword it's just sword swipe sword swipe done three chances to hit beefed up with crimson rite do what feels right get feral laura which is the bonus action so this time you get two claw swipes because you used the bonus action to do it so you take six points of damage what are you imbuing your claws with okay you use half your movement to stand roll slash her protect your father protect your family line hits 19 just hits my gosh i don't have it in front of me oh because you don't have your shit you don't have your character sheet in front of you right oh you got it it's an unarmed strike but it's 1d6 as a werewolf claw because of her strength modifier right 1d6 plus five plus your strength modifier plus your lightning damage okay we're on you benicio oh no i'm sorry she's going to use one of-- yeah and oh sure stand your mini up yes yes shoot okay she's going to use one of her legendary actions to slash the shit out of portia and does hit you take-- she got a 19 you take 13 points of slashing damage from genevieve lorelei i've added her to the playing field we're done there now we're onto benicio yeah go for it she strikes it out of the way there is a seeping bleeding black cloud pouring out of her eyes and mouth as she stares down at you so used to staring down at others and she is so much bigger than you hits got it it's a bonus fun fun fun yeah she claws it out of the air and goes to roar in your face and you hear (growling) not a full roar but unsettling nonetheless anything else movement lawrence (counting) you want to come up behind her all at advantage yeah hits oh my goodness no he's flanking ooh okay lawrence comes running up arms behind him and leaps on the back of his grandmother and tears the bone does not feel like bone it feels like petrified wood it feels like on the verge of stone but you drag your claws down and pull it's like sparks coming out from under your claws as you-- her bones are hardened and heavy and not what you expected whoa (laughter) yes i do i'm doing all the things no i can't make this one up can't do it the thin and ropey dark elf runs out of this upper chamber leaps down and drops down by aurra on the ground and he gets as low as he can in a squat you hear (chanting) you don't see him anymore yes okay the iron woe is going to whip around-- turning towards the grandchild that just hurt her so badly she's going to rake her claw against you lawrence for 22 you take 12 points of slashing damage and then she-- they're magical then she-- that giant gaping hanging walling mouth lunges down and-- your ac is what again snaps just shy of your face you yank back at the last second almost lose your footing almost do that whoa whoa whoa thing but stay up she snorts through her nose-- or the holes in the skull-- and a big poof of (smoke rushing) in your face it clings to you for a second and then dissipates now it is aurra's turn oh i'm going to retroactively do something too the spear is still floating in the air and it flies in an arc over and goes in a circle and strikes into portia that is a 22 okay and that is-- i really got to write this down-- that is six points of damage necrotic damage yeah yeah who all took damage you took damage yeah you three have to roll and see if you can keep control of yourselves we'll get to that aurra it is your turn at bat dc of ten or half the damage you took portia is here also aurra i should say this too the dark elf landed right next to you and then almost instantaneously went (fwoosh) and vanished next to you but you felt a bump or a brush against your shoulder-- you felt momentum running past you-- and you can tell that he's running past you right now you get what's called an attack of opportunity it's at disadvantage because he's fucking invisible but roll to see if you can swipe at him well you just felt (thumping) so if you are quick enough you roll twice-- --and take the lower you feel a hint of fabric on the edges of your claw and then nothing okay now it's your full-on turn so forget that aurra keels forward and lands on all fours and her hands plant and you watch as those hands expand and grow and her back lengthens and broadens and turns into this gigantic ridge a pony to horse sized wolf is standing there (growling) that was your bonus action you can still attack you have movement and an action you can totally get around-- sure yeah make a strength check at disadvantage as-- yeah no opposable thumbs sure ten you do run up and your claws drag down the bones of her back but she is able to pivot and take the momentum of you and shove you off of her you don't have a lot of flexibility and mobility-- you're not a ninja in this shape you are a powerhouse we'll say that's the end of your turn oh she's hasted it lasts for a minute so ten rounds you have another action so you can bite you can no longer cast spells though not in this shape okay go for it roll an attack that's plus five to whatever you roll because it's direwolf you leap and try to snap at her face and she is so tall she rears back a bit and you (biting noise) and fall down (growling) and hold your ground yes yes okay moonbeam is a tricky thing it's my son's favorite spell and there's a lot of debate on how-- but you have been doing this for 30 years when i first started navigating moonbeam i thought that when you cast it the damage happened immediately but i've seen a lot of debate about this and what generally people say is that it's when the moonbeam moves onto you or at the start of your turn but not when you throw it on somebody else meaning you would dump the moonbeam on grandma and then as soon as her turn started that's when the damage would take effect let's just do it now because her turn is so far away let's just nuke her she has to make a save it is-- constitution she makes it rolled a 19 she takes half the damage is okay i got papers everywhere okay cool i would say she's not anymore that's it yeah all right is that the end of your turn the iron woe is going to use a different legendary action she curls her shoulders forward and that black inky substance whatever it was starts to expand out from around her and envelop you all i need all of you to make a wisdom save so-- yeah all of you four natural 20 okay all right lawrence aurra you feel sick to your stomach you feel anger and pain and sorrow radiating off the expired body of your grandmother you feel loss you feel confusion you have to get out of here you have to get away from her now you two are frightened what's the reaction you can it's one creature it's in reaction-- you get one reaction a round and this is the reaction so you pick one person aurra and lawrence so roll again just roll that d20 all right that terror does overwhelm you and the second before you turn to scrabble away you hear a young feminine voice in your ear say stand the fear abates and you breathe a giant beast of a wolf and snarl at your grandmother not so for lawrence also-- never mind portia i need you to make a check to see if you control yourself right now you need to roll-- since we can't remember neither you nor i-- it's ten or half you're right so ten ten yeah hold on-- you have to hit ten it's a wisdom save so if you have any wisdom bonus that'll get you over the hump too so you're fine you're in control you feel from the pain you took your blood is boiling and you want to fuck something up but you realize what it is you have to fuck up what do you want to do oh the iron woe it's your turn go for it a 17 15-- yep is it 40 points total i lost track of that it was 17 15-- plus strength plus the rite yeah the plus five to your attack you're good okay do you want to move anywhere okay benicio you're up okay just the dice not the modifier yeah all the dice any die you roll you double does not hit only one person is flanking and that is benicio advantage on your hits but you hit already so anything you miss roll a second time that hits the beast is going feral all right lawrence it is on you right ten with whatever wisdom modifier you have you're good okay you can go no closer you can go no closer than you are a frightened creature has disadvantage on ability checks and attack rolls while the source of its fear is within line of sight the creature can't willingly move closer to the source of its fear you can technically-- yeah straight roll hits harrowed frenzied wolf desperate to live her chest crackles for a moment and then goes still okay yes if a target's saving throw-- the frightened target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns so make a roll it's wisdom do not make it yes it is yes you may as liam rubbed his eye her harrowing presence is simply too great it is the dark elf's turn your ac is what benicio okay you take five points of piercing damage as a spear floating in the air shoves into your back that is the end of your turn and now it is the iron woe's turn she turns this way is feeling very penned in and goes to town on portia no she just turned that's a 20 with her claw you take 14 points of slashing damage-- --from genevieve yes she is and then she goes to bite you she leans down the jaws open-- oh and you take a half step back and feel those jaws go (crunching sound) right there right in front of your nose she misses and rears back and her head tilts back and she goes (gurgling roar sound) and all of you feel a longing and a heartbreak that you can't really understand i have schmutz in my eyes and my eyes won't stop tearing aurra it is your turn she's surrounded no you're hasted and you have two dire wolf bites if you want you can't as a dire wolf you can bite her you've got a little extra padding of druid hit points because you're in this dire wolf shape that's the positive you could yeah you could go back to werewolf form you could go to your-- okay that's your bonus action so you have action and hasted action the dire wolf shrinks up into-- okay so you use guidance to cast on yourself sure what are you trying to perceive make a straight perception check with your guidance the pain that you feel echoing-- all of you feel echoing in your minds-- is wild not intelligent it's a wounded animal it's too hard to make out it's beyond your ken you still have a hasted action oh wait guidance was its own spell no but i'm going to give you one more action yeah you can bite as a werewolf no you're a werewolf now so you can claw yeah you've got one claw it's just claw so many wolf forms yes you just tried to learn the secret of her essence now you're going to take a swipe roll that d20 that loss has traveled over to you and every sibling in this room feels lost all of you know that something is very wrong here and just on the edge of your comprehension but you haven't grasped it yet now it is lucius' turn excellent yes you may it's against her it does not hit it just misses oh right yeah moonbeam is tricky she does not make the save okay and remind me okay got it top of the round she's going to use one of her legendary actions-- to move without provoking any opportunity a jet almost like a squid releasing ink-- you guys are enveloped in a cloud of sorrow you hear the bones scraping against each other she glides away faster than you would have imagined but doesn't go far and she comes right back to here no attack of opportunity on that legendary action it's portia's turn (sweetly) i'm going to strike with my claws now coming back at it claw claw claw got it (counting) yes you've got a stalactite up your butt yes absolutely what did you roll on the one you hit okay great this is the third i thought one missed why do you have advantage because you're flanking now thank you on the second so hit 20 hit and 14 does not hit but give me your natural 20 and your regular hit eight plus five 13 okay so you rush at her and you strike out and we'll say the first hit misses then you grab at her rib-- so you come swinging around almost like it's a pole and grab hold of her you miss on the first one but then right yourself and grab claw grab claw on a rib and you rip pry a gigantic rib away and throw it across the cavern she's going to use a legendary action to release that cloud of darkness again oh no it doesn't you're right it's half movement so-- good thank you tj she has three legendary-- she has points different things take more out of her i let you see behind the veil a bit now we are onto benicio (counting) she's just within range leave dad behind okay good flavor hits how much great go for it okay do it jock great just like when you practice nunchucks in front of your mirror she is in fact going to use a legendary action to swipe at your ass here it comes oh not that great actually nope your ac is 17 she lumbers around and swipes and you had just finished doing this little trick with the butt end of the weapon and held her back for a second as she went (woosh) you held her at bay and it's lawrence's turn you are still frightened it's at the end of your turn at the end of each of your turns nope can't go near her you can't go there yeah you could run this way but your brother's in the way i'll say you get right here aurra steps to the side slightly no no connection i know where he is thank you where is that that's a great idea terrified like-- no connection yes please do you get around the corner you get her out of your vision plant your hand your claw against the ground and breathe for a second i'm very tough i'm very big i'm very strong i've abandoned my son (counting) you don't have anything left she's within range of 60 feet but you've done all that stuff for claw does it say sight do you have to see her that's okay a lot of new rules here a lot of stuff happening you're about to find out lucius you feel a single hand spank down hard on your shaved head and you feel a creeping crawling-- --vomitous sensation radiate through your whole body as necrotic damage radiates in through the back of your head and you take 26 points of necrotic damage yes yes does it say anything about sight it says rend the spell from the air i'm going to nix that i'm going to say he's invisible there was no preconceived notion of it all you heard was (smack) ooh and it's done you feel just a bit of breeze behind you-- there's no save for that no-- a bit of breeze behind you and a step you hear it the moment's passed it is the iron woe's turn the iron woe she's just going to lay into what she's facing which is benicio yep hits 18 beats your armor class that is 12 points of slashing damage then she leans in to bite she hasn't bitten anybody and she still hasn't bitten anybody 'cause she rolled a three she's just snapping away can't get anyone she's pretty pissed that's it she's just going to stay there now it is aurra's turn sure you can you can say that if you want okay so you drag your hands in a giant circle in front of you and-- about as big as an exercise ball-- a giant bowling ball of flame springs to life right in front of you and you send it i assume towards her so careening through and you guys see it coming portia you see it coming benicio you do not it hits this and actually does a little skateboard trick kills laura bounces down and lands right next to the iron woe burning and the fire flashes out from it connecting with her she has to make a dex save what's your spell dc it's on your character page on the bottom right she doesn't make it so she takes full damage unless you want to cast it at a higher level but that ship has passed i guess seven points of damage and that flaming sphere is out here it stays not for this turn that's right lucius you are up unless you want to move somewhere oh you have a hasted action and movement you can move 60 feet because you're the flash right now and you could claw her if you got up on her okay so you just crouch low and run (counting) you don't get three claws you get one yeah no he can't you're right that's right we'll get to that in a moment okay the bonus action was the missed slash you just tried to slash right yeah so got a retcon when you cast while invisible it goes so what i want to do is let you know that in your peripheral vision after getting spanked in the back of the head-- the drow is behind you and bolts away in this direction so you get an attack of opportunity if you want go for it yeah that's why caleb wouldn't do anything in that dungeon forever he's visible now he is here he's about to run away from lucius this is a rewinding of time-- ah i keep hitting that-- that hits okay got it he cries out and keeps running and now we're on your actual turn i'm going to put him here (counting) 25 feet 30 feet great that almost waterfall of bright pale light gushing out of the hole in nothing just drags across the ground and centers on the iron woe and she has to make a con save does not make it i rolled a three bits of bone shard dark and solid as it is start to chip away and she is starting to fragment and it can only move 20 feet it was attacking her before you can yeah so i don't think it would make it to the drow but you can sure 17 on the iron woe does not hit (exhales) okay spiritual weapon is a bonus action wow that's badass woo moonbeam's concentration but spiritual is not wow make a history check no only what you hear about the dwendalian empire's efforts against them but not them okay got it and three beings of light appear around you translucent but formidable spiritual guardians 15 feet concentration so moonbeam is down concentration up to 10 minutes you can retcon it it's fine you would know your shit no i don't mean you i mean lucius would know that one would cancel out the other so if you want moonbeam up moonbeam's up moom moombeam tj travis and and guiding bolt is that's a spell attack right go for it that hits okay good no another rib splinters out and sticks sideways she's starting to lean to the side a bit it is portia's turn do it portia if you're flanking you mean first attack okay that's easy enough to do that's not you oh that's our druid sorry you're-- blue bottom okay so five ten 15 20 done so it was hit natural 20 nope 13 again okay you strike out and grab and rake at her hip and you tear an entire hip bone away and throw down to the ground she is staggering on her feet she is still up and she is angry at you and drags a claw across your face it's a claw attack for 16 points of slashing damage that was a legendary action are you unconscious no oh okay benicio you're up what are you using yeah you're at advantage 15 points of damage you smash the glaive across her face and her lower jaw flies and clatters into the stone and hits the ground she stands pathetic teetering in front of you is this the bonus action yeah you're flanking benicio how do you want to do this you drive the glaive right through her entire form and then you just drag and push and push and use that force that torque as you go to unwind her body and pull bone off and bone off and bone off she falls to her bony knee down to her chest claws at the ground and rests still and it's your turn okay you can make (mumbling) until the end of your turn are you amplifying or just doing the basic so take 1d6 damage 1d6 for amplify okay go for it wait you used your movement to get to him that's (counting) 30 you're not quite there i'll give you your action to get there and your bonus action for that natural 20 34 total nasty okay-- did i get it wrong yeah the iron woe shit travis and wasn't good the drow reaches out to grab you and you just bat the arm away and you see almost worms black disgusting energy dripping off you see a look of real fear and he starts to go yes you do hits 15 okay you rake a canal down this man's back and he is staggering away down this hall pathetically blood just pouring down his back he's on his feet and he looks like shit aurra it's your turn that's super cool let's see how we can make it work aurra wind wall what's the range on it though oh yeah that's great he is so low i will say that you just walk calmly throw up your hands and that energy flies out of your hands flies just over lawrence's head and a cyclone of frenetic angry energy spins this asshole like a dryer tumbler in that hallway because you have just shoved a wind wall in a very small space sending it starting here through there like a snake i could roll but he is beaten back and forth against the sides of that passage and his head softens into pulp and he is turned into a bloody mess and lies on the ground the room is still on the drow to do what you have to roll-- that's a straight roll i need you to roll something to see if this works no let's do this lawrence make a dex save i remember grog trying to pants vax yeah you got to roll this is outside the tenets of dungeons & dragons the mangled corpse does move but the bones are broken so it's just this shambling disgusting mess and it slops onto lawrence's front-- --and then slimes to the ground you know it's late here at the studio so i'm going to eulogize this game and tell you you've saved your father which i didn't anticipate it's the middle of the night you take hal back to your family home and he doesn't speak for the entire walk back he looks very shaken haunted you get him back to his room and the five of you standing around him as he would want comfort him and encourage him to talk and he spends the next hour telling you how this man attacked the keep with a small army of undead slaughtered everyone in the castle except for him he then asks you to sit down and explains to you that the man that you've just finished was your grandfather he did come from xhorhas and he did have a torrid romance with genevieve lorelei his people came for him to drag him back genevieve lorelei was killed the drow's twin brother was killed and he was taken back to xhorhas to be realigned he also asks that in the weeks that follow you help him to reseal the tomb below and to learn from this misstep in the family line and though there is darkness it doesn't mean that the light is gone and to hold onto that he reiterates that he loves you very much he shakes his head some days he drifts off to sleep and the five of you look across your father in bed asleep safe and rethink your future plans in relation to the house lorelei and that's where we'll end the story man every time i run these games i'm like i'm going to make it shorter this time i'm going to keep it-- it's impossible it's impossible yeah no you did great everyone should play d&d well guys burning man will soon be done we'll be back to our regular scheduled programming we look forward to having our three wandering travelers back but for now i don't know what is said be good to each other love one another try to be good and is it thursday yet
