excellent mime work no one die in the last one of 2018 don't die we're closing in on four years that is correct almost four years of d&d here hmm feels good tomorrow night it was a thing it was very special uk'otoa (parrot caw) a lot happened real fast now we're complete do you know anything about this island is it large mm-hmm i think that i will stay behind on the boat but i think you should go if you see any incense i would appreciate it if you picked some up yeah probably ja (clears throat) did we not open them i think i actually will be all right though thank you i don't get the sense that a lot of high-quality paper and ink makes it to this island but i have been wrong before so if you see any would you bring some back and i will reimburse you i'm just going to take it easy today yeah but you know i don't offer a lot of muscle to this group but i do have a little bit of knowledge so you know in situations like that just give me a moment to have a look around the room please fjord yes thank you beauregard lot of books yeah maybe you were locked behind something or there was some way to release it in the room also we're giving you a hard time but there was no reason why i needed to keep fiddling with this thing and i pat the satchel that i have the ball in could have left it well enough alone that's deep in (mickey mouse voice) hail seitan test drive a ford practical today all those teenagers in hoodies are going like-- where else are you going to go roll for nic cage i am a morning pooper so that happened at the very beginning once i watched yasha leave the boat i would have snapped frumpkin to and set him purring and worn him like a scarf go back to my chambers and slowly and methodically take out the silver wire and cast alarm outside of my doorway then take another ten minutes to cast leomund's tiny hut as a ritual in the room so that the bubble goes up to the door then i will take out the jar of beads and the thing of ink and the sphere from twiggy i would rest that on the table then as memory serves there was one book with arcane equations open on the table which i put away was there a second book on the table at that point as well there was two we got in our rush and caduceus just gave him one i would set all four books down in a row and the sphere is there and these two items stare at them after a minute of feeling frumpkin purr away and staring at them i say in my own language in zemnian i say well you piece of shit you should probably get to work i sit down and i will identify the two items i will check out the books and if any of them are locked i will cast knock on them to open them bees or bees or bees and bees and bees is the ink normal that is probably it i would-- oh right yes correct yes let's inspect the other three 21 that's two eiselcross not separated in any way just frozen over to the north or is it separate okay well there's nothing else that i would do i would say that all the time they were gone he sits rolling the ball on the table and speed reading these books that's it (whispering) even frozen-er depths she can rage she doesn't need a shield (singing to the tune of moon river) ball eater (laughing) very minty matthew mercer's ball campaign what is the plan captain exactly it would be very embarrassing for the people who designed that temple we visited we've come a long way what are you going to do with the cat there is no bird or octopus he is a cat i am out of supplies for-- he's a cat everything just changed how much did you get may i have it thank you where do we want to dump him in the ocean again for a look around i can do two things we can send frumpkin into the air and-- i'll sit down on the deck and start drawing in chalk on the wood and putting my cat in the middle of it even though he has only been a cat for a few days ten minutes later we have an octopus we'll try that sometime okay not good eight i see a whole lot of ocean 14 i'm going to send him in slowly larger circles over time now are we talking architecture or natural i relay this there's more dead things down below that tower's familiar to you huh so you misspoke okay one of them seemed to spasm most likely yeah will you stay close to me down there please your first statement was accurate yeah there was a jar full of-- they're like boba it's food it lasts a long time yeah the ink is good it will help me in my studies one of the books was about debate one was a spell book and there's useful things in it a little yeah i pull her even a little further away and turn our backs to the group and-- that's fine i've been getting a little wrapped up in this team we're working as a team and i've forgotten you and me i've forgotten yeah stay close caleb is standing behind beauregard and sliding his octopus onto his head always stealthily is anybody putting some juice on this no straight roll thanks that's plus ten advantage oh they're both good now even better 20 well i can hit for sure but-- no they're wrapped up in the seaweed are we sure we want to make a hit on these things that are tangled up as opposed to this one that is free floating not that close little over a hundred feet away well you tell me as far as i'm concerned you're calling the shots here i could either focus what i'm going to do on one of them or i could tickle all of them it would just get their attention it would not solve anything okay well i will aim for the one closest i begin to weave my hands underwater and cast magic missile i'm casting at 2nd-level four beads of energy nine-- nein points of damage oh 13 excuse me no i'm nibbling on some licorice root and casting haste on fjord and backing away i'm going to try to do a bit of a science experiment and cast fire bolt at the one next to beauregard and see if it even works down here okay ah no i rolled a two i move back (exaggerated southern accent) careful they spit what's left what's-- oh magic missile yeah hold on a minute go look around the tower yeah he'll spiral around look for any other entrances oh jeez it jumped on the box cocked natural one that's what i've been saying all this time i summon my octopus back to my head we did some talking you just went (gasping) and then it's gone travis how are you going to handle the shaft start at the base maybe we could send your friend in the door at the bottom while we go in the top what do you propose i poof a little globule of light in my hand and motion to beauregard from far away and go-- i make three more how tall is the tower roughly okay so i will stay 50 or 60 feet away from the tower and i will send one in the top one in the bottom and two through windows 30 feet from you or from the temple i might be you're always back yeah it's a front-bottom the madness oh my god that was my wife
