hello everyone and welcome to tonight's episode of critical role (cheering) he's gone for all the next seven days to australia with our badass druid marisha ray they're both down in haven expo in mackay australia anyway we don't have them they're not here so instead we're going to have a little shit storm of our own and we'll get back to the vox machina tale next week anyway i wasn't going to do anything this feels so weird the fact that i am not sitting next to laura who is like if i'm linus she's my blue blanket for this game has the camera panned over to her yet well anyway i wasn't going to do this at all because i didn't have any time but then a directing job of two days went poof which happens once in a while i had two days to cobble together some stupid bullshit to do with my friends and we're going to do it we're going to see how it goes i'm really looking forward to it but before we get to all that we got a ton of announcements so why don't we jump into that the first one that i see here is that the joe mad poster on the geek and sundry store online we only have one day left on the signed posters until tomorrow at 100 it is really hard to concentrate with that nope i want to get used to it until 100 tomorrow you can still get the signed posters but if you can't do that we also have one more week to get the unsigned so it'll be there for a full week and then they're gone i don't know when forever just to stress though in person they are gorgeous they are gorgeous to look at sammy there's still that t-shirt too the blue critical role t-shirt that all the proceeds go to the charity they're still for sale i was told they are you can go take a peeky-poo and find out she's still going quick little announcement we can tell you now that we are definitely going to be with geek and sundry at san diego comic con there'll be more details coming out next week but we're going to be doing a ton of stuff there we're looking forward to it we're going to be at petco park again which means if you can't get tickets to comic con you can come see us over at the stadium now some really big news we'll cut to travis breaking news that's complicated now i've got two more quick announcements one just to help marisha out there's a new signal boost out with america young doing her first boost america young is totally badass good person funny as hell on the show i've seen a little bit took a look and then t one of our ts taliesin you have a little-- not unless you've got something so we'll take a quick little mini break and when we come back we'll let the bullshit sale begin [dramatic music] kill the music i'm drunk with power kill it it worked there we go power with a three-second delay well look it is another hot-ass day in los angeles guys three days into the latest heat wave with temperatures in the valley hitting 116 117 luckily-- whoa wow a zephyr a wind just blew by luckily for the four of you travis laura taliesin and sam you guys live the life of voice actors in los angeles so you get to beat the heat you spend most of your days in supremely air conditioned recording studios you hide away in your dark little hidey holes and today you're double lucky because not only do you get to hide from the heat you get to work with three of your bestest friends in the whole wide world that's right the four of you guys have been working for the last six to nine months really on the latest game by phalanx studios you're working on the third in the felguard series you've been doing performance capture for months but you know most of the performance capture is behind you you've done all the principal stuff you probably returned for pickups but now we're moving into the voice over leg of the journey and today you're kicking off your first day of serious vo on the job you're going to have several days this week and you are headed to good old warner brothers studios no no no it's traversal it's the connective tissue between cut scenes how can you not see the water tower when you arrive at the wb it's on the lot have you guys have seen animaniacs you know all you need to know you've all had busy mornings travis you had a home workout you worked out and did whatever strong people do i've read about it i don't know myself but i know you do something to look like that you did a bunch of that you jumped in the pool cooled off listened to showtunes all the way there laura unfortunately you've been working all day you had a 900 to 100 you've got to rush over for a 200 to 600 you work two sessions a day seriously is this game over yet taliesin you've been at home writing all day on a totally unrelated project well because it's anime and that goes deep with you somebody's got to adapt that shit but you get to work on this fucking aaa game felguard iii you're going to go do some vo you're heading over now sam is rushing over obviously from one of the like 37 animated series i've lost track by now you're barely going to make it on time got a little wrinkle though well it's a heat wave right and your air conditioning broke and your neighbors had just gone on vacation and given you their dog bixby he's a pug he's staying at your house but you can't leave bixby in the house when it's that hot you took him to work which is fine when you're directing i don't know how it would go in the booth he's generally pretty quiet he's fucking adorable anyway you all roll up you come through the gate you park under that iconic water tower sam ten minutes after everybody else (laughter) liam o'brien your old friend liam o'brien that lovable idiot here he is he's going to direct you he's taken over for the voice over leg of felguard iii yes it is you're seeing some people for the first time in a while other than liam who you see pretty regularly you go downstairs obviously pierce o'toole is there iconic red woolen zissou cap on big beard and his tie love him emma stops in for a minute but briefly i think i'm going to steer away from that (laughter) and the director garrett who was on set as the director comes over to you and is like dude you're not going to believe the scenes are coming back i mean it's at 80% it's not fully rendered and everything the sword work you did looks fucking-- you're a monster how's that bruise so just so you know when we get in there today i know that liam's taken over but we talked about that edge you have hold onto that edge all right also the audio lead is there and he's eyeing the dog his name is gus and i just want to make-- i mean is it normal to bring dogs to recording sessions liam chimes and says well is he quiet or is he going to-- is he more likely to bark if he's apart from you because we also don't want him barking in here if he's away from you-- well liam turns to the rest of the guys and says well we'll just give it a minute and if it's a problem we'll figure it out but if you say that's he's good-- what's his name hey bixby (cooing noises) okay (laughter) okay so he walks person to person and adjusts all your microphones pierce pops in and goes guys can i get you any coffee or tea we can do that let me get it down let me take up this game of critical role with taking down a starbucks run we're getting picky no it's all right it's fine you guys all get set up and after a while liam pops in on his own and he's smiling but he looks a little tense he goes okay so we have a ton of shit to get through we have enough time but-- we're good we just can't screw around too much not too much so it's going to be great should be great okay all right i'll be with you guys in one minute and he heads back out he goes in you guys are now vacuum-sealed in and they're talking-- they can hear you at the moment but you can't hear anything coming out of there okay guys i guess we'll just dive into it so the first page of the script is right there on the top yeah yeah just the one so this is the first we've got like 50 of these to get through this is us leaving oathbreaker keep right after that huge fight laura between your character right and the quartermaster you and the quartermaster fought and now you're leaving in a huff okay so the last thing that happens in that scene i just want to remind you is sam tantalus gets cheeky with her and sends her off so laura remember that you're coming off of that line from the very end when you shove him out of the way and walk toward the gate okay so is everybody ready to get started (vocal warm-up sounds) that was my first point it's scourge you said scorge well we'll do one more do me a favor this is like a walk-and-talk so flatten it out yeah taliesin flatten it all i think flatten it all out a bit keep it on the move and sam i think your guy is a little miffed from getting shoved right before in the cutscene that leads into this so i want to carry some of that you know-- are we cool okay all right we'll just go right back into one more no just more of the same-- just overall everybody can flatten it out a little bit yes travis was the best here we go again i'm sorry i spaced out this is take two liam cuts in on the mic and says it's really good guys the whole room-- the devs pierce everybody is busting up laughing behind the glass window behind him you know let's just get a fresh one sam we're off to a great start guys great start all right here we go this'll be take three that was perfect that was-- and then just as liam says that he turns to the guys behind him and they go back and forth he takes his finger off you're in silence for a second okay it was totally awesome let's just try one more thing where i would say that i do want it all flattened out but just the very first line really explode at sam through 'chance' i would say just round on him and then you know furrowed brow heading in everybody's great let's just do one more and we'll have this (rumbling) what was that cue pierce what was that fuck it all right last take and this is take four-- okay i-- that was a good option i think probably-- hold on guys just give me a second while you guys are all yammering you notice that liam is gesticulating a little bit more it's lasting a while i mean you've all worked with liam you know how when he turns to the people behind him and he talks and then he comes back and gives you a little like-- just for you you know how he does that this is the other half of that where he's trying to get some point across anyway time is passing and he turns around just give me one minute we're just trying to figure out shit on our end okay we'll be right with you so laura while everybody's talking you just space out like you're looking at your iphone for a little bit but after 30 seconds of that and they have been talking for a long time you're just spacing out and you stare over at your water bottle next of you there on the little standy thing and you see strangely a little ripple in the water and before you can even decide what that means everyone feels a little (vibration) under the ground-- and then the entire room rocks to the side-- you guys all sway to one side you see everybody react behind the glass and out of nowhere what can only be described as a pulse or force-- almost like electromagnetic pulse through your actual brain you wonder is this what radiation feels like (electric humming) the sensation is like your thoughts turning 360 around in your head and you're caught in it and then you're out you guys look at each other and the floor has buckled up and the ceiling has buckled down and worse than that you look to the glass and there is pandemonium on the other side of it liam is floating two feet in the air alien abduction style floating in space you can't hear a thing you can't hear shit you see everyone around him freaking out and then suddenly his body rips in half-- (shouting over each other) not blood and guts but globules of matter almost like beads of mercury floating in the air between and the two halves hover and both halves of liam's face look horrified and frozen in space and then the next thing that happens is each of those halves you see from that gooey miasma coming out of their body a shriveled arm and leg go (poof) and they drop and then the back wall behind everyone that you guys have looked at so many times has darkened and starts to look wet and purple and expands and bulges almost like the taut flesh of a caterpillar and suddenly the wall sucks inward (sucking noise) and you're looking past-- through really-- liam's two halves at a dark winding-- i would almost call it a tunnel except it looks more like intestines curving in and away and the devs are looking around in horror-- by the way liam was wearing that yellow shirt of his with the lion with the glasses-- this is adr5 and that's when you see four more liams in yellow shirts with the lion with the glasses crawling up the sides of that purple tunnel not like a human but like a little-- they're crawling all over the devs they're yanking them into that tunnel the two liam halves that were floating there have dropped to the ground and both of them-- you're an actor well the good news is that the floor buckled up and the ceiling buckled down so the door is jammed in place there's also a splinter up through the glass window-- everyone's really busy right now and the two that dropped to the ground turn towards pierce and pierce backs up no he'd just walked in 30 seconds ago with a full tray of coffee he can't hear you he drops it he runs back out the door the two that had been floating there drop to the ground and scuttle out the door up the stairs out the door after him they're gone and the devs are gone and allen is being dragged bloody and beaten back into that passage they were the lights in the room you're in flicker (electric flickering) the lights go out you have no signal (groaning) no wi-fi there is light coming out of them and there's light coming out of what you think was liam's mac in the room no and in fact that intestinal tunnel going back has swelled shut and sealed-- it's still dripping the what system no it's still all intact you can certainly have at it at this point you all can take out the last sheets laura and what are the character names yeah trais strength is really good hey i rolled them well i assigned them where i thought would be helpful for what you're playing and who you are i couldn't give you 18s in everything guys so what did you want to do all right well you make a strength check with advantage it's not budging well you guys are together right all right you make a strength check glass shatters all over liam's computer all on the floor it's gone that wall that moving wall gives a little (sucking sound) yeah it's cracked open you know what to do make a stealth check motherfucker yes that's accurate all right so you guys creep up that little set of stairs out of adr5 okay so here's adr5 you just smashed the glass right here and you've come up the stairs and as you creep up quiet as you can bixby farts you wait you pause for a second-- nothing happens you look it's dark out here there is a flicker of light coming from down in this direction everyone's got cellphone flashlights on okay you swivel over here to the left and this hallway like tin foil is crumpled in okay well sorry so there's a door here you're passing it-- there is as you come out the door you all hear a metallic sound (ringing) it's hard to tell what it is but something is spilling out of the kitchen like six feet high spilling out of the kitchen sure it's beautiful it's gold-looking it's coins and other stuff spilling on a diagonal slant down out of the kitchen into the hallway right in front of that frigging little sitting area it's a pile of stuff while you guys are arguing a gigantic red-- like a gigantic alligator's claw i guess comes down along that slant and rakes in as much of it as it can and pulls gold and as it does so a little goblet spills out you see a sword spill out on the ground there's a mess of stuff in there and maybe a third less gold there now (barks) okay as you do so you see a sword you also see a dagger you also see the edge of a bow poking out of it you also see a silverish-colored looking stick or rod you grab a bunch of stuff make a dexterity check eight you do manage to slice into your hand on something you're holding an armful of sharp stuff but you come and you dump it out a sword a maniac sword it's gigantic a couple daggers fall to the ground as well you had a bow hanging over your neck and there's a weird silver-colored rod there that has tentacles etched into it in a spiral down around it a giant red hand comes down and goes claws in now there's half of that left give or take not here in this pile but you do see a quiver like something out of the goddamned lion the witch and the wardrobe poking out of that pile of gold okay can i ask you a question though did you pick up that rod the moment you do you feel a headache spring out the side of your head it's migraine-esque in level and you feel like you had a quick acid trip you storm in there's no lights in here other than the phone you're holding right okay you start searching around make an investigation check there is one of those giant bulk costco-sized jars of advil (laughter) okay still have a headache at the moment but you're not splitting in half (growling) you see the snout of something shove into the hallway just barely giant nostrils (snorts) it's gone make a dex-- coins and are you guys-- both of you make a dexterity check you're both good that's all you needed it's sitting out on the floor you're running like fuck all right so you sprint past here you see this door is open what's that music man it's just darkened room you do see some brownies on the table as you run by you come around the corner and-- you know how i told you there was some light before this door is slightly ajar and there is a pale goldish-colored light coming out of it this door is open as well you want to peek in okay you creep up i think it's the server room there with all those machines in it you see a pale glow basking over all of these terminals in this room and you hear a voice faint you know it it's ashley's voice you hear find-- me-- waiting-- cafeteria the room goes dark you heard find waiting you hear a loud crunching sound not a growl as you guys are at the corner you guys are here and you look over your shoulder and you see this end of the tunnel go (crunch)-- you run towards the light well this was the light it's gone now you're just iphones as you run past this open door nonsensically you look and you hear a (creaking) and there is a porthole of a boat scraping by the door and water sloshing in the door you see an 'i-c' pass by cold water spills around your feet icy cold water against the door you're seeing this go by the door on the inside the hall behind you (crunching) okay you guys bolt up the lobby it's not dark in the lobby there's sunlight you run up to that you go up and around and you turn left and you see that glass door that we've gone through 1000 times you want to go out there you're going out there taliesin grabs the door (deep humming) you feel your thoughts twisting around in your head again you feel that feeling of you can only imagine high-powered radiation something-- you can't move nobody can move you're held in place the moment his hand touched the door (deep humming) you're standing on the steps and you're looking at the parking lot sort of the door in your hand is rusted and old and you're looking at the five-story-tall form of a gray green legged squid-like monstrosity everyone roll a d20 all of you except for taliesin is frozen in terror at the mind-numbing presence of what can only be a harbinger of the end of the world you think it is massive it could crush you if it sneezed on you yes it has its head brays at the sky and a groan comes out of it like the sound of a whale magnified for 10000 miles if anyone is still alive in calabasas they are hearing an all-terrifying groan as it looks down at you the pulse in your head goes (throbs) the advil is not working and you see it flex five stories this thing is coming out of what used to be olive avenue there is a massive chasm outside of the warner brothers lot and this thing looks as if it were a chinese dragon it looks like it is continuing down to that crevice and coming up to here and it is looking at you and flexing and you see all over its body little ridges little nubs start to bulge and protrude almost like little blackheads pushing out and then (deep humming) you all feel that same pulse moving through your head as you're frozen in place and taliesin just agog one of them goes (explosion) fires out like a little missile and starts to fall and the beast is gone and you're looking at a different sight the building that it had crushed is there again but covered in vegetation everything is covered in centuries of vegetation there is a massive pond here in the parking lot and you watch dumbstruck the fear releasing as a thing (splashing) splashes into the pond you look out to the left at the gate and there is still a giant chasm where olive used to be the nearest land you can see is by the gas station or what was the gas station three blocks away the tower you can see one leg sticking up out of the foliage you are in dense-- it's just released and there's a thing in water going (slithering) there's no ceiling over you any more there's no second floor on the building all that's left is one of the doors part of a wall you're basically outdoors where you're standing you have no idea all you see is green the only thing you see that isn't green right now is part of the door next to you and part of the water tower one of its legs is sticking up like a bony finger do you want to count them there are exactly 25 arrows you know where you are right you're outside the building of adr5 the leg is 50 yards you can stealth over there y'all can or just one person you're in a new time or dimension you're making a new stealth check oh you are holding bixby all right so you roll-- i was going to say roll with disadvantage so we'll call that the roll for you both what'd everybody else get 20 okay all right well you start slorping through the mud and water bixby is just as scared as the rest of you and doesn't have the senses you all do so of course he lets out a little (barks) and you hear a (slurping noises) roll for initiative hold onto that thought for a minute okay here's the tower leg you sure do no one makes travis and laura and taliesin and sam miniatures so this is travis he's a half-orc this is sam as a ranger here is a nice goth warlock for taliesin but the best one really is-- and i thought this when i got it oh where the hell is it is a miniature that looks like fucking laura bailey and it's missing oh shit where is she there she is it's just laura so here she is yep okay here we go so 20 to 25 20 okay i just get to write down travis and write 20 next to it 15 to 20 17 okay ten to 15 travis there is a spawn of fucking hell slithering through the pond towards you right now and you're up with a sword in your hand what do you want to do less crosstalk you do have a full gym bag that's right i don't know did you grab it on the way out you can say yes over your shoulder there's probably something useful in there okay it's really difficult terrain so you're going at half speed here so you can go one two three here here you want to be here and do you want to hold hold your action okay make a roll to attack 21 it lands right in front of it and hits it on the lower-- i mean it's a big tentacled face and there's a second mouth on the inside all the little beaky claws on the inside it poofs in its face and it does the equivalent of a (sneezing) (laughing) sam you're up this is like a two-foot-deep pond a fetid pond in a swamp i've got it written on your sheet plus four to hit that's your total the arrow whiffs past and sinks (splash) into the water behind it okay laura you're up laura bailey sure you do i'm new at this sam okay cool you're not slowed down because you're on land so okay got it laura you're up sure what is that you might be able to fish it out of there it's about a foot and a half maybe do something or i'm going to pass you by i'll say that there were three in that pile okay great that's all you can do i will say that you are i'll say that it is momentarily blinded by protein powder 20 hits it's written on your sheet and you get sneak attack damage 1d4 plus any damage bonus you have i have it written here in case you guys-- so plus three on the damage did you roll sneak attack too one plus three plus one is that what you got all right well the knife sinks into-- it has eight eyes all in a circle around its mouth it slices right into one of its eyes which sort of just (bloop) and a little bit of mucus or pus flies out okay taliesin your headache seeing this thing throbs harder than ever it did before and you start to see through a haze of black almost like a veil has been held over your eyes and you look down and you see almost like the outlines of black tentacles on your own hands okay you want to give it your all all right roll to attack it's on your spell sheet what's the there's a plus so you take that plus no you take whatever the number is there plus the plus one this black tentacle lashes out you guys all see that you guys all see it come out of his hand it splashes in the water right next to it right next to it and it goes (gurgling growl) and it cowers (monster noises) it cowered it's looking past travis to see you it then in anger goes (monster gargles) and flies through the water right at you what's your ac travis 12 yeah that hits the thing's tentacles (hissing) and it latches onto your torso travis and you take one point of damage and then as this thing's facial tentacles wrap around your chest it then pulls itself in and you see the round mouth of teeth come in for a second strike clamp onto your nipple and sink in super sharp for two more hit points (laughing) travis you're up i'll call that an attack sure roll to hit do it this game never gets old maniac sword is 2d6 times two correct 30 what did you roll initially what did you roll on the dice alone just tell me what you rolled on the dice that's seven so 14 plus the modifier the sword cuts down through its face down through its body you peel off a piece of bacon from this thing and it shrivels up it shrieks right in your face (shriek) it falls onto the ground right at your feet it's still juking around a little bit sam you're up bixby disappears under the surface of the water well you don't have a good line of sight no not unless you roll a one okay you've only fired bows at ren faire but fuck it (arrow noise) the arrow (impact) strikes it into another eye it goes (gargle) it's not moving out of it yeah it is in its eye that's right bixby's splashing in the water (gurgling noises) i don't know (laughing) okay all right you splash into the water you wade in he was drowning you pull him up and he splutters you hold him upside-down and shake him a little bit you notice taliesin that rod you were holding with the etched tentacles in it when you hold it this arm that black aura grows larger than in the other hand yeah black tentacles they're not solid you can see through it but it swirls in a spiral and then lashes into it and picks it up and squeezes and it (spurting) and a couple more eyes go (spurting) and it lands on the ground your headache is a little better it's not gone but it's better make an investigation check 20 you guys look through the vegetation you take 15 minutes to dig through here and there's other sections where there's more fetid water and there's bugs that are biting and it smells like ass in a lot of places you do find a car the wheels are pudding the windows are gone it is smashed all to hell and there's vines and leaves and ivy growing in it and around it everything is brown underneath plant life you got up to the point where everybody parks when you are visiting for vo and you're at the base and you can see sticking out the contours of the water tower are there but it's totally covered over you can see the street that goes past that that leads into the pretend town and the only reason you know it is because you've been here so many times you recognize the contours of this canyon swooping around but you do see one piece of what looks like a stoop in a brooklyn building nonsensically out of this tropical setting what do you want to climb i don't know what's sturdy you can certainly have at it fake town is like a canyon covered in green the tower is a hump there are plenty of vines on it you could give it a try try and climb up a vine it's less scary than the absolute straight up all right make an athletics check okay it's really tough part of the problem is that the vines are breaking away in your hand so you can't get a firm grip on it on the side of fake town you mean is everybody going to follow make a survival check there's a fucking door under there it's coming away (panting) oh yeah it pushes in in fact it disintegrates as you push through you're in it's really mushy there's much less vegetation in here although it has crept its way in here and you do see wooden stairs obviously not a brooklyn building because it was all fake when they made this whenever they made it but there is wooden stairs going up want to go up okay make a stealth check okay now make an acrobatics check you make your way in you guys can't hear her after she rounds a corner and you see as you gently put your toes down in different places-- by the way your phone is dead you gingerly place your feet down and you're seeing parts where the wood gives way but you're finding a few places that are firm it's a little jittery but you get up to the second floor of this fake building there is a window you can see it is entirely dusted over on the other side and you can see all this leaves and stuff on the other side you've got to open the window okay make a strength check yeah slides right up part of it comes off in your hands as mush and pudding you throw it down there is a veil of plants you spend a minute pulling it aside you're looking down around you went up to the bend and on the corner you're now looking down to where you once knew outdoor tables and the bathrooms and the commissary the cafeteria you can kind of make out just because of your memory you know the distance no you see trees you see a seam in the sky go (ripping) like a wound above yellow viscous fluid comes and pours and pours and keeps pouring out of the sky and splashes down into this canyon and starts spreading in both directions towards where the commissary used to be and towards where the tower was it doesn't look like water it doesn't look like snot it's somewhere in-between like vegemite the rift goes (tearing) and it's gone it's just blue sky are you looking out the door now there is a frigging foot deep of yellow pus just everywhere he does come and he is coated he's losing his hair he's balding a bit you wipe it away hair comes away as you wipe you may indubitably give it your best effort okay yeah you're able to do that everyone is able to follow you show them where not to step travis roll a d20 you're okay not a high bar to cross just wanted you to sweat because it's fun you make it up you find all of these buildings are connected on the inside because it was all bullshit it was all magic it'll take some doing but probably you look out you don't see buildings as far as you can see you see green as far as you can see where's bixby by the way as best you can tell he's half-bald he's got patches of hair patches of not to quote matthew mercer in the interest of time you make your way through the upper floors of fake town you do get close i think there's a building that's not one of these things before there's a full-on restaurant not in the building you're in but you do hear leaves rustling around you hear something it sounds like one source of movement in vegetation you heard it through the windows you're inside one of these buildings none of your phones work they're all black there's another little canyon of plant life and you do actually see somehow one corner of a metal table is managing to poke through all this shit but you see a bird (fluttering sound) land and sway on a vine (fluttering sound) fly off again yeah it was totally normal looking it was a dove i think super close you're just in the building one or two doors down i don't know got to get out there you could make an investigation check i suppose 20 you look all around there doesn't seem to be any trap doors or stairs it seems like this is as high as you go in this fake building everybody make an athletics check on the way down you guys all make your way down taliesin you step somewhere squishy and you fall straight down through the step from six feet up you hit your tailbone super hard fall on your ass on a knob of a tree stump or something you take one point of bludgeoning damage you're all right you're embarrassed and your butt bone hurts a ton you're looking out now you don't see a lot of goop you see a lot of tall grass and ferns growing out of it you don't see any goop tons of foliage you're going to be up to your nipples out there in plant not that you can see laura could explain to you where she saw it so now you have a rough idea of where it was it wasn't exactly dead center it was past center from where you guys are from where he's standing all he sees is green if you look to the right you do see there's schmear on the sides of the canyon walls yeah no snot from the sky make a survival check five you find a good grip on a piece of wood you rip it and it's exactly that big and everything stays behind are we running or we're sneaking everybody roll for stealth yes nine and eight okay so who's on whose back you guys creep out you place your feet down in it does feel a little juicy but you can't tell if it's yellow goo or just another puddle in the swamp i don't know but you start to make your way through weaving you bang your shin not too painfully-- that's a metal table in there you start weaving your way through metal tables and you can again only from memory and the dimensions of these canyon walls you're like i think that the commissary is over this way you start to make your way through there and as sam is stepping a snap you step on something that snaps like a twig and you hear all around you rustling and you're seeing almost when you see a squirrel in the ivy or something the plants on the wall start shaking and you see a flash of yellow fabric up on the side (rustling sounds) towards what okay make a perception check looking for the door plus anything you are wandering with a dog in your hand and you're like it's here all right run and make a perception check you've got a brain like a steel trap you run past laura you hook her arm and drag her and like a linebacker-- is that the right term in football right towards the door you know where that door is you reach out and push through and you feel glass man-made glass through all this leaves and shit okay you're going back in to be a hero all right everybody runs towards it travis is motioning going i've found it it's not everywhere but up high near the tops of the building still (skittering sounds) there's a little bit of a moment as vines rip away but you push in and you guys are all inside a very very dark room you don't feel plant or anything you feel tile under your feet it's pitch dark you light the comic book page and there's a weak little sputter of light and you look around and there's no plants in here there is dust all over everything it is the commissary that you guys have had lunch in a million times and the fire burns down the page and burns down and goes down and down and just as it's about to go out another light source swells up from the center of the cafeteria bright light-- you guys shield your eyes you can't see anything it's so bright in here you open your eyes and between where the tables are and the check-out counter is is a blue-gold glowing vision of a desk and a flat-screen computer on it and facing you the way we are in this room ashley johnson sits in a flannel and jeans she sees you and says oh hi guys (laughter) oh you know i'm almost done season five of blindspot's almost done and once it's done i'm coming home and then i'm going to stay okay well you know the show is what it is she goes still for a second and then (electric sounds) lifts into the air her arms out to the sides she's transparent and beautiful white feathered wings translucent shoot out from her side she is an angel her hair is floating backward her eyes are solid white she is staring past you she doesn't see you almost you can see through her she's illuminated the entire cafeteria and a voice of power says there's no time the tower awaits if you don't make haste the clock can never be turned back only you yeah (laughter) you feel brave you feel strong you gain 25 hit points she looks to each of you in turn i love you guys go and that's where we'll take our break (shouting) welcome back to mr toad's wild ride we'll jump back in the game in a second but we just wanted to remind you that tickets for the critrole live show are up for sale you can get them now the link is in the chat also just less than 24 hours to get the signed joe mad poster much less 12ish something like that 100 tomorrow pacific time but i'm ready to go want to see where this is heading the light fades you're standing in the dark and you feel-- (deep humming) your brain hurts it's numb you can't think you're not inside anymore you look around you wasteland total wasteland the remains of a few buildings but not much scorched earth everything is ash and desolation san fernando stretches for miles to the hills to the north a vast valley of scorched earth and the odd fragment of fallen civilization jutting up a few stories at best and behind you the hills bordering what probably once was hollywood stand barren grim the only thing that dominates the landscape is the tower gleaming almost like new like it were built in 1927 the warner brothers water tower standing above the waste rifts in the sky above it tear open for a moment (ripping) vanish as quickly as they come every six or seven seconds lightning storm around it and that's when you realize it you've been here before or maybe not here somewhere like here together you four have adventured together before and you'll do it again you've lived a thousand lives before this together you'll live a thousand more after this you're living a thousand lives right now in other worlds [dramatic music] you know that you are linked and have been throughout eternity the tower stands in the distance what would you like to do there's no buildings between you and it now it is just a field-- no just brown scorched dead earth as you get closer to it you do see something you see patches of yellow all along the legs of the tower you see liams glued geiger-like all over the legs of the tower some sort of mucus-like membrane over them holding them in place they're also not-- liam's about 5'11 that you remember these are about four feet electricity courses through the metal of the tower into them (electricity sounds) back out again all through the legs the whole thing is charged and above now that you're closer you couldn't see it before in the sky circling the peak of the tower you see a gaunt corpse-like steed a horse of the apocalypse leaving a trail of fire behind it as it circles the tower on it rides a shriveled corpse with red hair straggling behind it and as you draw even closer it hits you there is no mistaking that thin towering frame that is fucking conan o'brien (laughter) he is moving all that's left on the bottom is a skeletal jaw the flesh stops here but that signature pompadour is a little ragged but it's still there the horse lands with a (clang) on the top of the water tower the horse shrieks it's terrifying fills your ears and the o'brien lich-- and the tower pulses the entire thing with a greenish-yellow light like radiation and you see the liams the small liams on the legs start to jitter and jive on there and (squelching) and in four or five places another liam fires out of a liam and another liam fires out of a liam-- hard to tell here is your water tower husks of cars husks of buildings oh dear they do not make a conan mini he's sitting up here and there are also not maniac liam figures he's standing on top he's on the horse on the tower roll for initiative please it's staring at you as you walk up 25 to 20 15 to 20 what ten to 15 okay under 13 what did bixby roll oh your initiative thank you i knew that obviously who got the nine travis okay the lich kicks the sides of this nightmare steed's broken ribs and goes ooh and the horse takes off to the sky and flies a little closer and now it is taliesin's turn given by angelic ashley and the dm roll to attack 20 that hits laura it is your turn no you're over here by this husked-out car he's there taliesin is taking up your hiding spot their eyes are on you they're coming i'll allow it at disadvantage because they're dumb as sticks but they're looking this way roll for stealth at disadvantage yeah that didn't work you duck behind a car that has no walls or anything they're looking right through understood okay travis you're up i would say it's this crouching liam right here (heavy footstep sounds) oh full movement for you is six right i'll reverse time you can either go as far as you can go or you can use all your movement to go up just one dagger okay roll to attack oh got to flip the page sorry (whoosh) flies past his head sam you're up (barks) i'm going to play fast and loose with the pug and i'll let you take a couple steps to the side to get a clear shot hits roll for damage seven the arrow shoots and goes straight into liam's eye (death rattle) and it looks up at you travis and goes buddy yes they do actually sorry all right one liam attacks ranger sam what's your armor class you just go oh jesus and he misses entirely what's your armor class yeah these things are not that strong so you just go hey buddy and he smashes into the ground now it is this fellow's turn he gets closer shazbot you fall to the ground stunned nope you can't move you can't think you can't do shit taliesin you're up okay roll to attack hits the tentacle goes (whoosh) slides around liam's neck like a necktie and his whole head freezes breaks and he's gone travis make a constitution save right now your turn is gone but you came out if it you look up in the sky and you see that red haired motherfucker go meh sam you're up that's where he is that's where you see him yeah he's in your face and if you try to fire at him with your bow-- where are you on that list oh it's because my writing sucks so why don't you go now you can get close enough to throw not sneak attack obviously but go for it is it a surprise or is it a crit i get quadruple damage i just want you to fail laura that's all it sinks (knife sound effect) right into his sternum (death rattle) twinnie yeah i just took the player off it's sticking straight out okay now it's sam's turn make a dexterity check yeah i'm sorry you take eight points of-- you're good all right i'll call that a freebie and now what go for it hits all right definitely hits he (hisses) breaks it off and lets it fall to the ground lich's turn oh man he points at you hold on this is where the cracks show i don't remember the spell shit hold on i'm pulling up the app oh man he points at you and a swirl of white icy cloud forms around his hand and shoots right at you (spell firing) right past your shoulder strikes the ground behind you did i get that right yep missed you i rolled okay now it is taliesin's turn here you think i'll say you can make it do things okay the dagger floats up in the air bixby chasing after it (barks) and goes right to your hand and you see just traces of octopus tentacles in your vision for a second but it's gone maybe you imagined it travis you're up yep (bloop) you got three more squares left (laughing) about 50 55 feet away roll and pray for not one the sword flies up (spinning sounds) 15 feet too low and comes back down-- no it doesn't it's five feet away from you sam what would you like to do now wait did i skip you again i did because i wrote your name-- liam liam two liams on the ground oh you're right thank you awesome what's your ac sam oh it doesn't matter taliesin and travis what are your acs okay you both get hit liam slashes at your chest travis for two points of damage he leaves a raking claw down that nipple that healed is cut again misses you though taliesin he saw the black energy swirling around your arms and (gibbers) i've lost my track laura okay all right you're there okay roll to attack this hurts me laura 15 hits you sink it into his back and drag it down his shoulder (death rattle) he dies sam you're up think i got a little bollixed in my lineup but i think you're up now yeah right here by taliesin conan (counting) yeah you're good go for it 17 does hit (impressed noises) all right it sinks between two ribs and hangs there he doesn't pay much attention to it this one sees laura distracted with her kill and lashes out and tries to bite into your ribs and it does bite into your ribs you feel liam o'brien's teeth sink in and take a bite out of your side one hit point of damage the lich flies closer to you still sam points at you again no love spells love them he points at you again and that ice flies out of his hand again this time hits you full-force you feel sleet and ice covering your entire body the whole front of your body starts to freeze and burn you take 25 hit points of damage no ranged just like an arrow so where're you at you are slow-moving too you are reduced in speed 40 is that silly putty doesn't make it laura eat that taffy and attack that motherfucker anyone you want there's a liam next to you pick your o'brien okay go for it roll to attack taliesin's there you're good that hits okay you sink the dagger into liam's stomach right through the bellybutton blood goes (spurting) he clings at that arm and pulls you down and says i loved you like a sister it's totally messed up now travis what would you like to do sure you can (counting) he calls down and says i'm listening roll to attack you turn to riegel to do what nobody else is willing to do you bring that sword down and you look into sam's big giant eyes and big smile and you can't do it and you swing wide sam's turn what's your ac travis you feel small teeth sink into your ankle and tear at a tendon a little bit you take one hit point of damage from bixby the pug you hear (ripping) (laughs) the lich flies his horse-- ah he's dead he wants to finish what he started he points at sam again let's see where did it go you are frozen over for 14 hit points of damage covered like an icicle taliesin what would you like to do you want to swing wide of that guy conan or a liam that hits wait you're hitting conan right that hits sure i counted laura you're up you're right on top of him now you don't have any but you can maybe rip off of some of his t-shirt and try to-- man your hands are so cold now travis you're up where are we he takes two death-- well you have to roll to hit right help me out taliesin do you have to roll to hit you just automatically hit that's familiar okay that arm you wanted to chop off before breaks free three liams converge on taliesin what's your ac that hit okay one of them just faceplants right under your legs and eats shit but two of them latch onto your arms and bite into each separate arm you take a total of four points of damage as they rend away part of the flesh of your biceps suddenly you hear a deafening (ripping) and the sound of a motorcycle (engine sounds) you all turn and look except for sam over in this direction i don't have a motorcycle mini but you see two figures plowing through the dirt on a motorcycle with a sidecar you see they're familiar but they don't look the same you see a badass cut fucking woman with red hair streaming behind her tats all up her arms and a bandanna tied around her head and in the sidecar is this fucking dude with long hair and an eyepatch and a shotgun hanging off his side with a guitar and the motorcycle pulls up right here here is the sidecar here is the driver of the motorcycle and they look over you and mercer shouts we don't have much time we have to act now marisha cut like linda hamilton leaps off the motorcycle does a flip here (whoosh) you see her go (impact fire) no she is not her muscles flex and a dragon swirls around her hand and fire shoots out (flame impact) hits the warner brothers tower it explodes in flame you hear metal creak and groan (creaking) (crash) grizzled matt mercer jumps down out of the sidecar and says hold on i know it's rough you're the only thing that can fix this he whips the guitar off and goes (guitar chord) you feel vibrations rush out over all of you your wounds close up sam starts to thaw the arm goes (shoonk) all the ice melts away any wounds you have heal whatever your hit point total was after ashley you have just received 30 hit points so if you're at zero you're up as high as you can go these liams-- they're still there you don't go higher if you were at full you're at full these three liams explode like sausages (squelching) marisha yells it's already over there's no-- (ripping) the horse goes (horse scream) crumbles to dust and conan goes fuck crawls to his feet conan is still here one two three four he reaches out with skeletal hands at your face laura what's your ac 13 you say okay you take 11 points of damage and please make a constitution save you feel the veins throb in your neck a seven the muscles lock up you can't move taliesin you are up yes it does now okay so what was the total damage okay laura's frozen travis you're up 15 hits of damage okay you hack his arm off falls to the ground 15 total you said right 14 okay we are now on to sam what would you like to do frosty yeah level 20 yo no you're not too close but you probably want to get clear of laura all right make a medicine check you run over you start to kiss her you cut your lip on her teeth the lich turns towards big man here what's your armor class make a constitution save please you take 12 points of damage and you feel your muscles start to lock up and you go pull it together travis (breathes heavily) you're still moving no it was 12 that's right taliesin you are up double the dice in what manner would you like to kill this and the tentacle slaps and slaps and slaps and knocks bone after bone away he backs up and goes (whines) does that little thing conan does snips and all the bones go (collapsing noises) to the ground you feel flexibility come back to your arms okay the gym bag of holding all right you have a lich's skull no the tower is slowing melting into the ground bixby comes waddling up to you with a bone in his mouth and he drops it and looks up at you all you feel (wind noises)-- you get pushed forward through time who knows where that's the end of the session really i was waiting for different music to kick in about a minute ago it didn't come and the (thump thump) was making you guys go what's next you guys are together somewhere with a dog oh man i'm sure i fudged so many rules that was so meta travis and yeah we totally could do we want to take a fiver and fly out the couch all right guys totally winging this tonight we're going to fly out all this shit and bring in a couch we'll do 30 or 40 minutes of questions all right start tweeting criticalrolebixley well something different than just criticalrole criticalobrien with an e anyway that was a ton of fun i was totally freaking out in the first five minutes and then it didn't matter anymore we're doing it live there are so many questions on this hashtag we threw out i'm a little overwhelmed holy shit let's go through the hashtag and find some questions thanks that was a lot of fun for me to do someone's asking i mean we get it all the time i guess we can put it to rest how old our characters are that makes sense 27 i think is what we said at one point it could be 28 at this point someone asked how much-- not the cthulhu portion of the game but how much the early part of the game was true to life we were talking about a real place that we work at a lot and people we see and some of that was realistic that would be the hard one i keep thinking it would be fun for a one-off magically have-- no to be vax but with one of your personalities in me so i would have to be you in me and start talking like this the whole time you know but if i were vax's body with percy inside i'd have to start talking the way you do i know the one i would not want to do is scanlan because i don't think i could pull it off people are curious what class marisha was for her brief cameo she was a monk i asked everyone what they thought they would be that's not true i didn't ask ashley but i knew what i wanted to do for the story marisha texted me somewhere in the middle of the game because i told matt and marisha about all of this i was too flummoxed to answer but she said if you don't have me say 'dope' somewhere in there sorry marisha it all went by so quick i don't know i will say that vax is head-over-heels completely in love with keyleth so if you guys want him to go get it on with gilmore when he is seriously in love with another person okay i do too well listen i said literally the day before i announced that i was going to do this that i didn't want to do this and the next day i totally flip-flopped because i was too busy with work i knew that i wanted to do something eventually i just figured it would be six or seven months from now but then i had all this time open up to work on something and the idea popped into my head i always knew i would want to do something totally different from what matt does because he does it better than anybody i don't want go anywhere near high fantasy because he does it so perfectly so i thought i would go in the opposite direction and try to make my friends-- eventually as i thought it all out i just started thinking what would the artists like to draw that's what it was like in the back end of designing i don't know probably still a rogue i think that's what i would lean towards hide and fucking stab when no one's looking and then just hide and hide and hide yeah i like wizards too well i was in that conversation too somebody asked if vax knew that gilmore wasn't gilmore when he stabbed him and i did think that it was somebody else before because his voice dropped and he became very ungilmore-like i didn't immediately think rakshasa i just didn't think it was gilmore someone asked if what they saw-- this is related to the earlier question-- if what they saw was the average day in a voice actor i mean we hammed it up but sure sessions a free morning working out and then going to a session or two sessions sam directing and rushing over somewhere you could be a serial killer i don't know oh i know that i know it was yeah if you wind up in front of me and audition the truth is when i direct i don't do much casting i do a little bit i do some suggesting but most of the casting comes from elsewhere and i direct who shows up in front of me travis laura and i've heard that not 90 times in a row but i've heard someone say pick up plus we're coming at this as actors doing an improv show almost anything is game yeah i would do it again i don't want to do it all the time because it's a lot of work and with two kids and my work schedule i'm pretty crazed i will say i was very anxious about it in the leadup but five minutes into it i was having a blast i didn't care wasn't worried about what i was going to say beforehand i was like i'm going to fuck it up am i going to say that at the right time totally didn't matter didn't care it was just fun thanks man my hipster rakshasa shirt comes from threadlesscom a bunch of people asked is it a complicated system i saw a college production of jesus christ superstar when i was 13 and it got me very interested in acting spring awakening and fun home are in heavy rotation what well if you're a human being in a t-shirt with nothing on you it's kind of rough i'd like to ask this question from @katykreation for travis what the hell dude the t-shirt contest did get moved to next week someone has asked was the liam in the recording studio the real liam or was there a liam mastermind somewhere i would say in my imagination it was the real liam and i got pulled apart and set off a chain of liam duplication that i can't answer a fragment yeah i think the most recent was the worst for me being up there with the rakshasa it felt like getting hit by a bus it felt like i was out of my control shit just creamed me i felt like matt totally fucking hoodwinked me and it emotionally fucked me up for a few days setting you up for that amazing moment and jumping out i was super curious to see what you guys would do once you realized you were playing as yourselves at the same fucking places you go everyday he's cold like the universe it's fine somebody asked if we die what are we going to reroll as that also reminds me of when are these two characters going to get together or when are you doing to this and at least my answer is never going to tell you because i feel like that's going up to jk rowling when you haven't read anything and saying what happens at the end of the final book we're not going to tell you anything that hasn't happened in the future because we want it to unfold in front of you you can keep sending those tweets but it's ultimately going to go down the toilet hey how to get into voice acting take some acting classes go to where the work is boom done next sam's commercial pizza hut question i've seen that a thousand times on the internet i'm not sure if that's a regret but that moment a lot of shit and talk from the fans and a lot of what i thought about swirling around that moment with the raven queen that was a huge deal for me in the game because what i thought was doing in that split second was bowing out as vax so that vex could continue that's what i was doing i wasn't angling for the armor i wasn't trying to get a cool story i was like what i've always said is that vax dies for vex and i'm going to die now and laura will get to keep playing this character and i'll come back as a fill-in-the-blank and fucking mercer spins everything all over the place and it wasn't what i wanted and vax did want to follow sarenrae and he was in love and becoming the right hand man of the fucking cryptkeeper made it problematic for all of that so the first week or two after that i was like (sad sigh) why maybe you should have just killed me (frustrated sigh) it took like ten episodes to go through empire strikes back to maybe poke my head up slightly at the very end of that but it was a huge fucking downturn ninjas is it the day before friday yet
