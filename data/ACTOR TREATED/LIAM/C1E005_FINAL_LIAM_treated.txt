there's not any kind of dark magic about the armor is there yes that's fine sh so he spoke of some sort of trap door that's easy to open from within but not from outside correct the smaller of the two yeah we-- well he was about to walk out the door and cause mayhem we should just get out of here keyleth can you fucking eagle up and let's go we need to get out now tiberius cast fly on this fucker right here we need to get out of here we just need to get out the way we came in like a thousand yards the carpet's away but this guy is flying flying grog no you can't go on the carpet you're too heavy we're going up straight up he's in goblin town 29 just keep going up up up that's good that's good double crits oh good thing you got a thousand hit points that's the point of a meat tank if scanlan were here he'd moon and blind all he's here he's watching yeah home slice i think we should friggin' dive bomb towards the far tunnel past this war camp is fine he's hiding out they don't know he's here we're going to dive yes dive bomb dive bomb i take hold of the front of the carpet and steer it up and over along the roof and then down towards the tunnel i'm steering the carpet we don't have to that seems complicated she's not an eagle and she's falling with the gnomes i don't know are we parallel dive dive dive dive party trick even wizards make mistakes okay 25 i let go of the front of the carpet i stick a-- i have a rope i let go of the front of the carpet i put one end of the rope in my sister's hand and i jump off towards pike holding it around in one hand as i go-- savecriticalrole but wait dungeon master re-explain what's happening so the carpet is falling not as fast as it would but-- how high are we at this second and the closest building the highest building under us is how tall ohh unpause how far are we from the tunnel that we were talking about i'm grabbing for pike and going like this grog's gone grog's down do what you fall a lot this is tense we're gonna hit we're gonna hit i'm shielding the healer intelligence good good good good 24 yeah so i'm pretty smart still holding a gnome i guess that's what we'll find out afterwards do the halflings-- shit do the gnomes get an advantage since the half-elves are protecting them oh okay oh no yeah i got pike 18 doesn't matter it's all right i got the healer i got the healer (pff) everybody everybody 18 it was halved so eight no sorry no vax is pulling up pike onto her feet and dragging her towards scanlan 'cause i know how fucked up he was from the last battle but so is scanlan scanlan's out too right you take scanlan i'll take percy healing potions out sorry here's three-- sorry i'm late percy he's all right he's all right he's all right i've got a healing potion and i'm pouring it-- i'm pinching percy's nose and pouring it in his mouth i think so (whispers) 2d4 + 2 eight eight for percy yes let's get the fuck out of here and they can-- we gotta keep moving i pull out another corked potion and slap it into percy's hand and then grab him by the wrist and just start walking oh i feel good clarota clarota yeah clarota he's gotta have more than ten hit points completely seals it they could have magic in their possession they could use magic as well so let's move felicia day that's not nice let's keep moving yes yes no that's-- hold on a second i take out the flying carpet-- sure we do here sit on this clarota that'd be easier yes that guy was lying 21 for me i'm keeping my eyes peeled for useful shit clarota do you know anything about these passages this is a coin flip running running really running it's like having goofy as a party member (all laugh) any useful shit no if you seal off the passage right we keep going down and if that's a dead end-- it's probably not-- if it is can't we rest and use the same spell to open it up that sucks yes we know that about you what about in the game though i think we should rest i'm totally fine at the moment so i'll stay awake too yes i don't think it's a good idea we're fine it's warm down here yes we've got tiberius if he's awake can cast light let's just go into one of these tents i pull out some dice so that grog and i can gamble while everyone are sleeping (cary elwes voice) gently gently off to the side many footsteps how many does it sound like from right from up or down from above wait grog and i are the only ones awake right grog and i are the only ones awake do we lay low and hold quiet in these tents or do we get everyone up yeah i think so no no no i rouse my sister quietly she's in this tent (whispers) quiet yeah 23 you know when you can't fall asleep-- -- and you're like am i dreaming or is this the dream or is it real and you wake up and you have to pee it's hard to tell shake it off sh sh daggers out daggers out not dark vision there's no fire-- on purpose no fire sh sh they're going last time i did that i got kicked in the nuts very hard sure so what does that do to us yes skill skill okay just for emergencies in combat i have a question outside of existence tiberius put up a stone right but i didn't hear any (impact sounds) right oh so we sealed ourselves into this little pocket oh we didn't even friggin' need to hide in the tent we were in a little bubble of air okay spaces okay all right thank you right we're all healed maybe-- does anyone have to pee or perhaps-- start smacking the wall might need to take your armor off (singing) that's fuckin' teamwork there are also some i believe some duergar we didn't tell you-- yes while you were sleeping in the middle of the night duergar walked-- i assume-- duraga but we thought it best to lay low and they went on so steady as she goes going the homeopathic route i like it smells like grog that was quick (all laugh) i insult you and you trip me in a half a second would you like to take a shot at my nads as well what goes around comes around baby 22 i'm going to voluntarily erase one hit point it's all right when the illithid general is bearing down on your walnut-sized brain-- i may be there i may not right everyone we're getting slap-happy that was a high acrobatics roll i think the dm wanted me to eat shit oh really it was a direct contest you still wanted me to eat shit sounds dirty did you see any whales no whales oh that sounds creepy that sounds really shitty it feels a bit-- broken glass in which of those places in the-- fungal he sounds like a real fun-guy i'm a dad (all laugh) what is that wisdom 12 noted noted percy's losing his shit everyone there's footsteps coming from ahead let vex'ahlia and i scout ahead wait for a moment 22 for me well it's definitely not duergar how far ahead of us do they sound i'm listening trying to make out how many sets of footsteps i can hear but there's lava spilling and we can see in dim light cart could be some sort of device-- can we tell what they are yes separate sides i also yank my serpentine belt off-- and throw it out right under the rope snake yes it is and i leap out daggers at the fallen one hashtag bitches in lava i got 99 problems and a troll ain't one 15 15 yeah liam and yes i'm already jumping in the air so i'm gonna go okay and this since it's a surprise it's automatic crit okay okay all right so that's 28 yeah 1d4 for-- this is my poison dagger two eight okay i'm doing my sneak attack damage here we go four nine 12 18 yeah 23 total for that 62 points of damage and i use my bonus action to hide natural 20 see you later motherfuckers that's a ten ah yes bellybutton still pretty cool still pretty cool they're dumber than grog is it's part of his charm (whispers) you can't see me oh dear something's coming out of the jar no no it's dangerous it's dangerous it's fucking dangerous it's black ooze it's dangerous it's fucking dangerous stay away from it stay away from it stay away from it french kiss that shit ranged attacks fire and ranged attacks think sing sam sing (sings) we're up all night in the dark we're up all night in the dark taliesin and oh shit the music the music ranged attack ranged attack sounds good hit it hit it hit it yes it is it's a crit isn't 19-20 crit that's just for me yeah it splits into smaller ones smaller sizes all right i'm gonna run up to the back of tall and ugly and try to stab him i'm gonna do the reach-around again and try to stab him in the eyes orion and and i'm hidden-- i'm stealth already i think right so the first attack is an 18 okay sneak attack here we go for the eyeballs two plus seven is-- 40 52 as it does i want to use my bonus action to spring off his shoulders towards my friends sure that's a 15 (sneezes dramatically) (cosby voice) you see the black goo thing-- -- is not so easy to kill (all laugh) what was that sound it made again yes aw yes burn it hey that was pretty good so long very old testament get closer gotta run up i'd just like to point out this is like the avengers trailer where all the heroes run out and jump at the same time (all laugh) do it do it try it do it come on you're a warrior ten 25 that's better oh man you the real mvp wow work those rules how is he keeping all of this in his mind it's like a computer in his brain grog math hard that's nothing for grog that's nothing no we stayed up and kept watch tank double that double that or that he has to look he was hanging back nah he was hanging back he's weak he's got this but he doesn't have this he's weak he's hanging back what is the deal with the mind flayer shit shit oh man oh tiberius our soft vulnerable spot yes yes half-elves see in dim light up to 60 feet does that pool of lava give anything oh okay i'm gonna run over the dude in the lava i'm gonna jump on him probably make an acrobatics check and land right around here between the two little slimes yeah it's acrobatics 22 now because they are because grog is-- fine okay it's fine yeah okay okay and since i land since grog is right up against those two-- i can sneak attack one or both of them so i'm gonna hit the one closest to the party first this is sneak attack this is this is-- it's an 18 three plus seven is-- this is my flametongue dagger so that's-- oh hold on no i don't know what it is yet where's my pencil i'm sending my dice everywhere nine plus six ten 15 18 40 58 on one slime the piercing damage so i don't know what is that is that what's besides the sneak attack damage that's 18 if it's doubled for the sneak attack i don't know it's nine without a sneak attack 18 if it's sneak attack so 18 for sneak attack that's first dagger second dagger attacks the other one i just turn around and sink down into the other one for 16 with the keen yeah 16 with the keen dagger okay and this is probably not sneak attack at this point or is it i don't know okay eight 20 you said okay all right it's all right pow pow pow pow wow not sure how i feel about that i'm all on my own hey man if i can't be a hero here where am i gonna do it i'm surrounded by shit i am surrounded by shit i'm going unconscious here kids (tommy wiseau voice) oh hi pike (all laugh) hit it yeah do i have to roll to do that right 26 11 yeah that's the damage 11 oh yeah yeah yeah son of a gun masochists sure they are yeah that hits 'cause i'm at 19 right so that hits if i'm at 19 okay so i use uncanny dodge on the one that hit whoa half-damage that's right oh i am rough kids i am rough

dagger that is nine second dagger definitely hits that's a 26 that's fine this is flametongue i don't know if fire helps but that is an eight so nine and an eight except that they teleport back to my blink belt shite finish that shit pike hit it he'll be fine in ten minutes pike he's out of the fight but he'll be fine (sings) thorn whip (sings) thorn whip the bitch is dead you tried to kill us but

magical armor which was dwarven in shape before-- -- but i take it off it shrinks down to like a little toddler-- i'm wearing like a scientology unibody underwear underneath-- (all laugh) the armor shrinks down to like toddler-size-- -- and i hand it to grog and i go to my pack and i take out my old armor which is acid resistant not quite as cool as what i was wearing but i don't want him-- i can't-- huh i can't stare at his pecs for the next three days so i'll give him my armor ooh and put on what i had on before studded leather armor plus two okay i've got my old armor i found that armor
