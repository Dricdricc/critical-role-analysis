aw me so sorry (laughing) sure (laughing) do we still is the pass without trace still active from before i think it is i think you cast it before you arrived or in the approach so yeah 35 yes yes yes uh don't keep your distance yeah keep your distance all right good to know what's our plan b in case zanror never comes out that's me now you hear a horrible scream and a crunch sound as they all those that fell are unconscious or currently completely unable-- 25 hey where'd the grizzly guy go the grizzly guy's just stepping back a little bit or like he's like taking one step onto his back foot not even approaching grog where's the eagles the eagles aren't too far from your side right now and where's the chasm all right where are the twins right now twins would be back here and i would like to hold my action and if the goliath's buddy does anything if he tries to help or if he tries to run i'm still hidden right yeah yeah so i'm gonna fucking throw a knife at him if he does anything this is westruun i call it i go for it and i'm hidden i have advantage and all that shit oh (laughing) 25 25 doubled is 50 okay in theory whatever you want whatever you want love it finish him off efficient he died as he lived deeply unimpressed (laughing) the other guy gets up though and he's going to use action trying to break the grapple that is going to be a-- and scene you've made it-- i'm looking for scanlan too by the way kind of keeping an eye out for scanlan perception check uh 23 23 okay the second time as you're glancing through you see no sign of scanlan you do see now that there are small groups of these clan individuals are now pulling out of homes various denizens of westruun and pulling them towards the center of town they're screaming and kicking you know or some of them just aren't putting up a fight because they have no way to and they're just pulling them almost like shields to the center of town it seems like they gotta get there before they run out of cucumber sandwiches get it get it get it scanlan get it natural 20 on his saving throw oh no as he turns around and he stops for a second looks over his shoulder oh you gotta be kidding me we got-- at which point kaylee reaches out with her hand and let's see if this works or not 5 8 and it's been how long since we've seen him since he went in we should probably move then every time that's the thing okay gate stones i promise when this is over i will surgically implant it in him scanlan can you-- scanlan can you hear us at all way up high in the sky on this one you gonna start harvesting i'll let it go (laughing) there's a mechanical engineer on the roof (laughing) 23 we're going seven different directions you look up as you see suddenly glance overhead a shadow from one rooftop to another make a perception check uh 18 if there was only six it worked stay put and let us come to you what do you see around you i'll get it open quietly i'm not gonna break anything is it locked the window is locked very minor lock well i just rolled a natural 20 so i hit it like fonzie yeah (laughing) we pop in the window great you guys all crawl inside of the room and looking inside you do notice that the some of the furniture is kind of tipped over the front door actually that leads out to the main road the south-facing road the knob is broken off like someone just kicked the door in and it looks like there were signs of a minor struggle but there's no bloodshed from what you can see most of if any belongings that had any value have been taken the place looks stripped of anything metallic it looks like it's been pretty heavily ransacked inside here so is maybe the one-on-one combat our only option at the moment do we have any other option how many were there total we don't know how many probably 30 to 40 now that may be something useful it's a red brick building it stands out against a lot of it because it was built specifically to kind of be the small gnomish hovel that was built buy his own hands so when attacking right once you've given up your position it loses its worth so my suggestion would be that we move to approach from another vantage point or we can just kick this thing off and i walk in i'm fine either way grog ix-nay on the elp-hay just hug him just hug him 39 that guy tortures small animals by the way yeah i'm gonna go for the elf and cast hold person okay uh we'll say for the sake of you two you both roll initiative 14 14 do i still have the bonus action left oh it just burned you 29 21 11 because the extra 10's gone it's buried in rubble now no maybe he open the door do the top one do the bottom lock i don't want to know the answer i can't believe i ate the whole thing fuck that house look at that house oh it's so tight liam and i guess i'm maybe off by that fountain in the corner of your map over there this is an open area over here then i would be at the bottom of the building that vex is in okay so you're kind of close down like kind of looking through the window out into the main thoroughfare okay good to know so grog with this i want you to roll initiative his version of fear was not digging in he's probably looking up the price of a mace that's in the open i asked about that first that's so unsatisfying (groaning) if i steal your kevdak mini he can't be killed
