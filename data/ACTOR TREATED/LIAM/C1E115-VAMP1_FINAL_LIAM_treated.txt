charisma and persuasion yes yas key where the frig is persuasion where is it there it is four failures the red is a nine and a non-red success two successes one of which is on a red i only have one red die though and i smell my finger you've known me for so long what is it are you aware this is not a normal situation right now smell the siggle wait eric did you get your suit for the wedding why are you always the one who picks up the ashes i'm with marisha in the office meanwhile back in the office this is why i never get in the middle of g&s conversations because you guys have your own language i never know what you're talking about and it's best that i just stay out of your way no i'm going to start scraping them off if i can okay just straight right that's a failure on the red no it's not it's a five and ones are the only failure so one success (shouting) no she's a mushroom she's a mushroom look and i push into her shoulder where's matt don't drink the tea she drank the tea i literally just bought a new suit it's a good suit hey just a side note for their wedding i bought them a big block of tickets to hamilton and they can't use them now i get that would you like to see hamilton again i mean if anyone wants to buy them off me i'll cut you a real good deal wait what's going on i mean not on me but i could never tell you where they are if i'm eaten wherever sam is i am

arcade are you good you all right la why are you-- you need chapstick i'm pulling sam away for a minute whispering listen to me those guys i love them but they're married and-- i'm saying that you and me you are my best friend they are my best friends but they're married they have to help each other i'm just saying if things go pear-shaped i got you the wedding is probably not happening what's up yes and it wards off christians i am having a great time let's put that over our head do you need this back here's a heart sun bottom left is face bottom right is a cross in a circle a little wooden stake and so much good role-playing (snagglepuss voice) oh exit stage right even (snagglepuss voice) heavens to murgatroyd it's probably rachel romero up from the second floor you're getting pink eye from that poop in the eye yeah what's travis doing right now i catch up put my hand on your shoulder that is sick and i'm sorry and i use presence awe to say you really need to keep me safe so i can get us out of here yes okay just one so it's not charisma plus persuasion charisma and persuasion that's what it says hunger or charisma plus persuasion this is the scariest thing yet i rolled a four on the d10 a single d10 or-- so i roll too charisma plus persuasion two successes yes five successes everyone here i don't know why likes me i'm an idiot but they do so you keep me alive obviously so you keep me alivethat's an auto-fail well matt ended and marisha ended what all right there's no people out here right the drink me and eat me people were all back in the nerdist offices outside the bullpen can i go back i forgot something that i wanted to do back at the office inside the bullpen i'm back at the office outside the bullpen where the door was shut who all's wearing these signs it was arcade-- taliesin and and the sign says what again don't judge i bite arcade's neck travis and i am i use dread gaze and inspire unbearable immobility charisma plus intimidation versus charisma and willpower and failure is a one so one success no failures okay i grab a couple of t-shirts and i push-- the stayturnt t-shirt and the dungeon master t-shirt and i cover his hands up and i say can you just give into it you know this is terrible for both of us i know but it will all be over soon i mean we're through the looking glass here arcade i'm really sorry but i'm going to try to bite him again yes please strength brawl brawl's nothing so strength brawl plus two okay it's not good i got a fail two fails one on the red fuck it i whip around and turn on chris that's better that's two successes yeah you can't get rid of the other one so you always keep one if i'm okay-ish i'll hold off i'll see you later though but everybody likes me here travis is there any other weapon-y stuff in the room is there anything ridiculous like-- yeah all right i swing past the office supplies and grab a fistful of pencils you also have no idea that i just drained chris' neck that's a bad idea well we wanted to find more weapons i got a bunch of pencils maybe other people are vampires like us my internal monologue right now is really pissed off that i did not get to taste arcade yeah you just come from your car right to this table so there's a whole bunch of areas you don't know about i'll go with sam because we got to stick together you can deadlift a house you can't bust that shit open let the right one in we might have faintly heard (muffled noises) daddy chops is that true of his sideburns as well let's go vampire oh shit two failures travis and you're rules-lawyering a game you barely understand time for a taco hell run he's real big that's five you get four right three plus get that big gulp why did you hit the mouse again can we lower the gain on the mic though or a horse we're in the bathroom right no we left off of us ages-- a while back there's nothing going on in the bathrooms we could keep going back around there's conference rooms back there now where they keep all the games where you shot the slayer's cake those dragon torches are there too did she believe you are you sure i know i will lead sam-- unless we see something of note sure do i see anything-- there is a little bit more there's a couple of conference rooms glass doors windows yeah we're walking past these shelves of tabletop games yeah sure i also failed on a red two successes one fail on a red if we get through this we have to record another episode of the podcast and not one that we do at the convention sam-- you never edited it dumbass yeah we got to release that one there's another one just you and me she's nowhere near us oh the voided room is back here oh i didn't realize where it was i know what's in the actual building i didn't know the void was back here and do what what to fill the chairs what kind of game is it straight up do you think this is safe for me what do you feel for me i mean okay dani is he a speedster now you're certainly the most clever person at the table it can only go right uh-oh spaghetti-oh you're not hungry any more at all but we could have used him and gotten an answer (singing) shot to the heart and you're too late is he bleeding at all i'm going to come up behind laura and press into her elbow and i'll press the blade in and use awe again and say ivan i mean it's really all about leverage right we need some information and i feel like we've earned it charisma plus persuasion no charisma plus persuasion and one hunger die all right what do we got here nice i've got two successes oh that didn't work yeah all right you think we're at burning man right now don't you you didn't hail satan i didn't see you we are in a looney tunes a cross in there i thought he was scared of scary stuff it's a death note step one eat bloods she rolled a cocked dice and got another failure two failures one success both red two failures nothing three successes here with the tabletop games on the wall of board games i'm hungry too i'm going to help you look i'm hungry too but could you wait for just a minute travis and just a minute man i'm hungry yeah that's a good idea i feel like it would be good to have a snack guys snack up i'm all right with that everybody knows travis loves you it's obvious that's real good stuff that's all success every single one i bet that smarts (groaning) wow you love me dex two shit shit two fails one success two fails one's a red i feel so crazed it's romero two successes i grab laura and say listen he might die he might die and if he's gone you and i are going to need each other so you need to keep me alive so i can protect you and i use presence awe on her four successes one of which is a red die there is no versus on the sheet four one of them was red it was a crit well i need two crits i mean if travis doesn't come back or if he does come back it's wise to keep me alive so i can protect you and you love laura so to keep her alive-- reverse math three i need to live so i can protect her uh-huh well you're stronger than me how am i going to protect you that's silly tal i never got a penalty for what i did laura where'd you go no i think i would be a good ways behind big man watching him work his magic gary gygax is no longer living still not in and i'm unscrewing two pipes for a microphone setup so i can have a bar in my hand i'm not here i'm quietly looking for laura outside of the critical role table (whispering) twinnie twinnie laura and i dive over to where she is what do we do blam blam blam yeah everything else on pause
