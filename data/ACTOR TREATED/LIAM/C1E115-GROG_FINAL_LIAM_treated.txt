how did you do that without moving your mouth it is soft it's not one of those scritchy-scratchy scarves it's soft m & m and you and i tal not marshall mathers we meant matt and marisha couple things next week marisha will be in your chair running a game of honey heist we're all bears they're not bears but the three of us and everyone else who's going to be here are going to be bears it's the worst episode for you not to be here look at these guns feel-good game of the year did you even know she was in the game no duh also tomorrow will be the first character playlist it will be mine so you can find it sometime tomorrow you've got time it'll drop sometime tomorrow madness yeah episode two dropped on project alpha today it's pretty great it's pretty spooky like tiny vax but tiny everybody this time that's drawn to scale that one is there a ball involved in this game a ball games are typically-- ball a ball not that my father ever played catch with me but you know the type of ball that one would play catch with with one's father if they gave a shit what kind of game is it then vegan wine yeah this is the game that's an odd story choice to make the last of us the dimensional distortion there for a second i was just standing here yes but wait one second grog you're very good at this have you been spending time at the theater and not telling us let's fight this fucking guy what do i do do i actually use this or what do i do are we fighting i would like to poke him in the eyes these all right i'm going to use this weird-- i'm going to use this weird purple one where you can't read the numbers on it i think it says 13 and what i think i'm improvising this weapon is that accurate all right so i would add i have no fucking idea you know what i'm going to do i'm going to add my wisdom modifier why would i add anything how strong are my fingers is that the point sure i'll add my strength to my fingers so 15 that's fucking hilarious i have four of these you threaten me all the time neither do i this game thinks of everything you're intelligent do you understand what is happening i'm sorry i know i keep slowing things down here but in this imagination game can we do anything that we do in life can we do things that we can't do in life that sent a shiver down my spine i would like to cast faerie fire yes i do i had the craziest dream last night scanlan yeah and then i died and then i wasn't here and then i was and then there was like three weeks where i was a father in this other city washing dishes and i had this car there were no horses but it was just wind i had these kids i don't know who these kids were i'm going to save that for later i'm going to put these away everybody seems to know what's going on grog-- not grog but grog-- did we get any points did we win i love the theater but we're playing a game i thought we were near the end of the game but we're just getting started it's a game it's make-believe we want to get fucked up bobaline are you going to go down and get it and bring it up or are you-- he's sending us to his basement that's creepy we will go with you grog to the pig sty i'm not going to the basement because once in syngorn a comic book shop owner tried to get me to go to the basement to look at comic books and i'm not doing that yeah so good luck in the cellar let's go see the pigs i don't know whether to shit or go blind in this game intelligence i'd think yeah you have to know how locks work what are those words you're using i didn't pay attention through any of school i copied everything that she wrote down what kind of role playing are we doing here we're getting ale for our buddy grog got to keep the big man hydrated do you know how to sneak with dice how do you do it okay night at the improv here we go neither one of us are very strong can you do your handy thing yeah i don't want to get all muddy and shit could you just grab it from here it seems to plebeian don't you want to skip the hard work sure i can make a purple hand can i make a purple hand why not i thought it was imagination is my fun wrong i guess it is all right well show me how to handle a pig i'm so confused but we're right at the table no i got confused for a second because this is confusing yeah i'm roleplaying a little bit today you're going to grab the booze and carry it back with us what did he get i was daydreaming but i guess but you said there were no points and you got points that's a fancy word it's no mystery that grog likes you better than he likes me so-- what did he play do we feel hungover do we have all our shit what are all these papers can i hide i can i'm going to hide do your thingy though you don't have to clap or-- what are these things you've seen that before oh i'm right at the crack of course that guy looks just like you grog he looks like me that looks like scanlan that doesn't look like you at all what you got a fucking bear where did you get these toys also i rolled a 39 for stealth is that good is 39 better or worse than 45 jeez grog you're inspired today well hold on we know that i like to stick my dick into things so why don't i creep ahead and see what is happening i'll roll this one with the book on it because i feel goodness from it i got a 19 on that plus perception oh my gosh that's really good 33 for perception i didn't understand the rules it's not as high as mine i would like to point out but i was facing the wall may i turn around from the wall first can i use some sort of perception or insight or one of these numbers to figure out if we are in a room shaped like a cock and balls okay i've got a total of 23 grog i'm a big fan of the show stillben vandal it's quite good i did burp i love you too stubby but slowly move up the shaft i will follow behind scan-man yeah you know palm the sides as you go i pull him back what if i suck the poison out well just on principle just on principle is that a lot is that all you have i definitely should or i could use my paladin ability-- okay i'm feeling lucky though but it knocked the first die into a higher number can i go with that we've never played this game before not for the first time so go again look at what i got that's a good ass suck right there 19 how did i do i wave it away and then i take the opportunity to do one of these (blows raspberry) you just made that up where did you learn this game every map has a dick in it from here to eternity i will start looking for traps up this shaft jump over that spot ooh yes 36 i like to evade stuff like this can i use some sort of evasion i knew this was what this game would be i knew it grog i didn't see anything hit you but i might better just suck poison out of your ass just to be sure i would like to see if there are any more traps before we get to the tip perception which one is this there's a picture of a monk on this one what what's initiative that's a die you're rolling a die i had so many ghosts in that box over there travis i brought six tubs of miniatures so many miniatures 16 what what look at grog on that board looks like he's staring and judging the toys a what bonus action this is what all those ballet classes for trinket were for right now i will run at the ghost right because i have to get up to it i could throw but where's the fun in that so i run at the ghost and i'm going to use whisper and i'm going to dagger dagger dagger and i'm going to use the power of my deity and do something called divine smiting i've never told you guys what it's called but it's called divine smite yeah so that's 33 yeah i rolled lower than the last time great i jump across run how do i hit it with my knife okay okay so i roll once i'm going to use my-- i have endless luck it's endless that's a one so instead i get a 19 it does oh my gosh god there's all these numbers on this piece of paper i've used 17 lucks it was a six i'm not very good at math i copied all of her answers i think that's around 13 plus eight 21 and then the divine smite which i'm going to peg somewhere around 3d8 so a 31 that'll do 38 that was a 42 44 grog 44 points of damage feathers everywhere david bowie-style does it hurt the ghost but i can attack so many times grog can i do another quickie is that how it works what the fuck is that a wisdom saving throw okay so i don't have any of that oh that's good i rolled an 18 let's refocus on the shaft just the tip though percy we should backtrack the way we came push it real good that's the lowest number you can get on that thing just like life i'm going to hang back at the tip of the wang there yeah i don't want to leave i don't want to go i feel safe in the shaft eight tubs of minis eight tubs of minis there's a die on the map you're at disadvantage if you're right up against i mean i just feel like that's a rule must be like a rottweiler or something then because they're so mean not really that's just a myth isn't it maybe a chihuahua it's probably a chihuahua have you played this with him before you played with us why didn't you let me sleep in with keyleth then why am i here jeez i want to fucking sleep in for once is it like the ghost piano at the magic castle how far does this go oh look isn't that clever it's tits caverns okay we're doing it again let's roll one of these little balls 21 okay i click my boots do i have my boots always fuck yeah i click the boots and i bolt through out the end of the penis and to the boobs or the egg or whatever it is i go from the tunnel-- yeah the hallway into the cavern the first round cavern that is identical to the next one painful stuff yeah i'd like to run around between my sister and trinket and get up into the grill of that first spiky dog because i should have a better chance of hitting it because it's so preoccupied with my sister jeez so i jump over here so i bang like that i can jump over grog and i go (whoop) right up in the middle like that and then i stab i'm going to roll twice because i'm feeling good ooh that's good 30 oh it does okay so i roll this pointy one that's like a caltrop and that's a two and then i add eight to that that's a ten and then i roll again for psychic damage that's 12 look at all these in a box oh my god look at that 14 eight no 25 29 32 32 grog and then we all only get one attack per turn is that right i do but before-- yes i have four more five more seven more attacks one more attack is good it might be more but we'll just do one more that's a 31 yeah on that one i'm throwing it so that's not as crazy because i kind of blew my wad on the first one that's a nine a nine how much did he do total were you here when i did like 30-something on the attack just before it focuses on me but it was talking to you you must face bavmorda vex vax and trinket oh oh my boots are on so i do better at that now 21 for me so what does he look like set the scene for us but what am i subtracting that from what health i feel fine percival what do i subtract it from what are hit points is that over here somewhere i mean i can doesn't mean i do that says my name vax'ildan-- where oh i got a lot that's so many hit points i bet i have the most in the group so i take away i think you said 14 why do you decide for trinket what trinket does but only since you met vex just make it up this is imagination did i get any points did i get any xp so how it works is you have to get all the xp at the very beginning the xb what does the b stand for gently first though maybe you should taste it sorbet may i search the bottom of each nipple that's what i said yeah like feel around see if there's any loot well there's one right behind me i should do the one closest to me i'm going to see if there's any traps in there if i'm going to stick my hand deep into that thing of course oh that's really good i'm getting the hang of this that is a 26 i love how automatic that was he's got breath worse than a decrepit old dachshund too this is game of fantasy and imagination so it's just going to open and not hurt us at all this is a utopia my own bathroom door in whitestone hits me for one point of bludgeoning damage every time i use it this door is faulty even if we didn't say we were going towards the door i knew it was too good to be true vax'ildan rolled a 30 freddie up top fucking dummies right yeah i'd like to wait and also to mull over who is this more painful for you vex'ahlia's husband and lover or me her oldest friend and twin brother it's hard to tell grog can you enlighten us that's fine while he studies the door i'm studying percival does he look more rugged and good-looking as his hair is blown towards the door or less okay i do a five-count one two three four five and then i just go motherfucker and i grip my own shoulders and dive the pentagon is this heaven can you be pwned i also cannot be knocked prone i can see them though right there and is this also permanent marker all right grog may i use an action to stand up yes that'll be my next action to turn around seems wise oh no i think you're supposed to keep what you know and what you don't know separate that's called what was it-- mata-gaming mota-gaming meka-gaming you can't mega man-game-- it's been about three minutes i'd like to use another action to face the same direction as everyone else okay the boots have worn off so i can only roll this ball once it's not very good 14 circle door i know what that is but that's liam not vax yeah they're very fisty ooh trinket is killing it irony na-na-na-na-na-na you don't know we don't know yeah i'm right around the corner we didn't hear oof aaf or the bear going (growling) i feel like my twin sense would have kicked in i'm running towards the sound of the sister (growling) it's not coming from me at all you're just imagining it in your brain okay so i'm going to throw whisper and bamf to this motherfucker at advantage i'm getting the hang of this that's a 28 to hit okay where the fuck is the four-- there it is (counting) 44 for the first and a paladin attack we'll go attack attack and i'll use my bonus action to attack-- one attack well that's how flungeons and kragens work so one more attack that is a 25 to hit which is a little bit less that's a seven yeah yes this is the most fun game regerts can you spell regerts scanlan no not scanlan scanlan i'm out of vegan wine could you get some more vegan wine in please thank you you were dealing with a melted humanoid i'll go to my circle circle door you are a world-class performer on free three or free that makes sense that makes sense dagger dagger dagger maybe three daggers three sides let's try it well it matches the symbol for your home a little bit de roll-o that's what it was all along you are the richest most powerful people in town who is looking down on you it's a tree creature it's like a medium pain reaction ooh yeah i'll do all the same shit i want to before i check for traps at the door perception check for anything-- why'd i roll two i don't know why i rolled two i'll take the lower of them 23 i do not understand this game grog jeepers creepers do i know what direction i sense the movement from in front of me is it the rug or the chest hmm what is this thing moving sam wiggle your hand where's the movement it's there so i go over to this desk and open it what does it have to do i believe so sweet (muffled) can i say jenga jenga we have to do this i will use a game to experience death it will be enlightening mega man is for cowards grog you're breaking the verisimilitude this is not my first time having my breathing snuffed out a strength check all right i roll the round die i'll roll the grog one that's a one i'm going to use another luck it's not it's my third one a-hole i have four the most important thing to me right now is to point out that my strength is 14 which is slightly above average which is very different than your shit-ass seven with a modifier of negative two does it roll to hit or do i make a dex save what did i just roll to do though grog i don't understand that's very important is it important for me though i haven't breathed very much at all-- i would have been fine in there okay so i take a bunch of damage right 21 points of damage okay hey i have 69 hit points nice are the hatches bars there's a witch behind it i thought you said you played gurps in grade school sounds like a lot of something of something these scarves were a wonderful purchase for the group they are so cozy we need them in vasselheim fuck the lot of you my hands are free i throw whisper 15 feet out the door and bamf to where it strikes on the ground yeah and then i will turn now-- it's up to you grog-- i'm going to use two daggers if i can wait i'm going to use my vow of enmity on the rug and then i'm going to attack i have zero points (giggles) 31 and because my vow of enmity on this rug is in fucking effect i get sneak attack damage so that is two plus eight is ten and then we add some of that 12 and these guys go as well (counting) 39 points of damage on the fucking persian carpet hardwood floors are much fucking better fuck you and i'm going to walk in and check out that chest i'll grab the potion i will use them to easily hop the 12 feet up and then i will pull the wings in press the wings into the back of me and slide and crawl my way up this tunnel my wings are silky smooth guys from my point of view i can see fletcher's mill emblazoned at the base of the tower i just imagined it i wanted to pickpocket scanlan so i could start robbing gibbons over a gibbon a big 12 it is yeah that'll hit okay i'm going to pretend like the deathwalker's ward is set to fire so halve that does not hit sidestep evasion for a dex save uncanny dodge can halve one melee attack per round evasion only triggers if you have to make a dex save is it a jrpg you're throwing mana what are you checking grog do you have a book or something for this oh you killed him celestial for unicorn and your six seconds are up you know that was like 87 seconds all right i regain one hit point as a revenant so that's going to make all the difference i use my action to cast a level one druid spell faerie fire on this flying fucker it has to make a dex save versus my dc of 16 i did poof lit up like a disco ball and i now have advantage on the attack against it so i can fucking sneak attack which is going to be clutch right in front of me and i will use my bonus action to throw a fucking dagger oh dear that is a 23 to hit yes it does and it gets (counting) plus these guys jeez that was a shitty roll 33 and i'm going to dump my other level two spell slot for divine smite 48 total from whisper it will but i'm going to use my last luck roll again does not hit does hit what's it hit me with all right fire so that'll be halved to eight and then it might be four i'm going to look something up really fucking quick uncanny dodge i'm going to halve that down to four have you ever seen this unicorn before the triceratops diddles his iphone in the corner there you go i'm going to use a level one spell slot and cast faerie fire again on the illithid by freddie so it has to save versus a 16 i thought that would affect physical not magical all right well then i will fuck this guy up in front of me then that's a 23 19 that's good 36 total and i'll just stick it out right in front of him that was sam as scanlan as scanlan as t-rex as bear what to fly into the wall over and over again okay colville it's up to you not good eight-- 15 i don't understand this game the rules don't make sense can i have some xbs please can i have some xbs sure sure what a good idea to grovel but which part of it just give me a number grog you're the mathematician okay i would've got back a hit point because i'm a revenant so that's 41 so i'm sitting pretty within five feet of where he was (as clarota) go fuck yourself i will use half my movement to stand and then i will use the other half of my movement which winged is 30 feet and fly up to this asshole and i will use a bonus action to down that potion that i grabbed which is 4d4 plus four so that's (counting) 14 and then i will stab this asshole in the asshole that is a 33 to hit all right here we go (counting) and then here come all the d6s (counting) 44 and i will dump-- i'm good at math i'm not good at whatever the fuck this game is this is the best game though so it's in the high 40s you made me lose track i'm going to say 49 yeah not much that is 26 to hit seven and i will dump my last spell slot in 17 slow dance down to the ground very quickly covered in gore freddie and vax nod (sings jurassic park theme) well earned my wounds are starting to heal up somewhat i would like not in the game but out of the game to hide i'm hiding because you're going to murder our friend you know i have never seen you feed a single thing to that bear in all the time we've known you what was your reasoning for feeding trinket right now he's always hungry scanman if it's a doppelganger we have to murder him together insight check for sure oh that's terrible four come on girl terrible stinkaroo seven rolled a two on the matt die this is grog porn if ever there was any hit die too late it's going to be the best the best i strike for four hit points of damage come on one one magic sneak attack damage did you already use it we've got to kill him to be sure shank him percy and to get while the getting is good and i would like to shave the other side of grog's face that i didn't shave that one time shave shave shave it keeps growing back did you happen to catch this man's name cathew verser what a shitty combination can we do a sci-fi bent next time rifts or shadowrun or cyberpunk a do-ron-ron yeah it was very entertaining who won the game though grog ten titties not titties i don't know you anymore that's the thumbnail image right there we will say lovely things the scarves are the fucking bomb they're so soft and cozy hey good job with those three of my 400 miniatures travis how lucky are my eight- and 11-year-old yeah
