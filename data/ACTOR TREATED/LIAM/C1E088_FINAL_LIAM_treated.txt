that's for building a thing isn't it oh that's cute yeah they're all different what do you got what lego did you get you specifically send all your complaints care of sam riegel we are so proud that's you twins and in all your experience with these beasts are their attacks mainly physical long ones manatees the unicorns of the sea this all she talked about from ages six to 13 only thing look at our dm even that's a pretty big number for you oh great (garbled) three hours of this you put 'em away didn't you aren't they for close up you don't want to lose them in the ocean maybe put them away just just don't open it yeah so for example daggers'-- -- short distance is 20 feet i could throw it 20 feet at disadvantage gameplay wise game mechanics this is awesome so you think if your bullets were to pierce out through this bubble they could still go a ways yeah i mean fairy tales tell about them pulling ships under the water breaking them in half does that negate all my class boosting and all that what about these merpeople i mean don't knock it also i know it's always been a waste of time our planning but we're not even talking about what we're going to try to do are we going to try to distract this fucker and take his lodes or-- oh shit question i'm obviously a fan of stealth right but when we go in there and it all fucks up like it does nine times out of ten and the thing sees us anyway what are we doing without the lodes with the lodes but we don't wanna hurt this thing so what are we doing interference and distract and a couple of us try to smash and grab yeah we do that and then we kind of take it like jazz on the day you know if it makes you feel any better this feels less asinine than many things that we've done before i once teleported into the belly of a dragon with another jackass and that went tits up fast i'm still breathing you know just between you and me this does sound really fucking stupid yeah who hasn't seen a drawing of a squid or a kraken in a fairy tale book they're disgusting as soon as those two start talking about that i get out of the water and start attuning the deathwalker's ward to lightning right in the blubber change his alignment (laughs) frog sacs not a bad thought rider this is the meal i was waiting on that's extra hit points yeah how many roll for all of us no fear no poison advantage on saves isn't it wisdom saves welcome to the cool kids' table tary get the fuck out (makes ding noises to mimic hitting glass dome) (gong noise) i do (all laugh) i mean that's funny but it doesn't sound safe that's not a bad idea at all it's not just as flashy as the armor though is it good idea grog scary fun well i'm gonna follow keyleth back to our room you all right no i was waiting outside the door i've seen the trouble behind your eyes all day not surprisingly yeah yeah okay long time coming you know you are already a river to your people i know that your life has built up to this moment in many respects but your father is very proud of you you've already done a lot you silenced that dragon you've done a lot you know i know that you struggle with doubt and i don't think it's ever gonna go away for any of us especially for you i think that's part of the job you're getting ready for but i don't see it as a weakness you know all this time i've remembered uriel i'm not big on monarchies and the like but i liked him yeah may his soul rest and he had doubts and he let them inform his decisions and tried to do what was right and the questions you have i think they speak to your character well all the matters is what we leave behind us when we go you've already done a lot of good and you've taught me to be happy again i'm very grateful to you so thank you you make that easy yeah you know i noticed about a week ago you were curious about my wings i shoot them out we have one hour fade to feathers i don't think they went anywhere derp i want to go to there that's nice cool that one looks like keanu reeves and that one looks like patrick swayze (all laugh) oh jesus hopefully the whole time and gameplay mechanics can trinket get walloped so hard that it passes all of his new form plus trinket form and take him out so riders show of hands rider rider what do you want me to do with these just keep them safe okay all right freddie he does speak fucking-with-you very well hi my name is vax that's short for vax'ildan from you yes i have it's a good tale that is my sister her name is vex'ahlia you can call her vex some people call her vax i walk away (all laugh) just finished going up the ropes and down nice to the rift wait by the gate like a butler love you matt the magic of improv that is a lot of steps eh how many grogs like ten grogs long hundred grogs long and you've seen it leave these stones these lodes i have never felt more prepared than i do right now let's do this shit it smells like poop (shouting away from mic) what we're on now holy cow you just opened your eyes i'm using divine sense right now to see if anything is not completely-- undead in the bones dm snark and krakens it says right there-- aberrations if it's not an aberration-- it'd be a beast which you don't have-- the only thing on there-- the only thing on there-- that it is maybe is an aberration i mean elementals-- there's nothing on this list they're all around us man tary's armor a killer

going to start swimming there over the shells and i'll blow-- and i'll use my bonus action for more movement yeah okay and i'd like to use whisper to tear into the tentacle holding him to try to get him free of it to un-grapple him yeah athletics check goddammit matt plus-- that's shit shit luck 11 okay i'm out i've been in a dragon wise as fuck (zapping noise) six deathwalker's ward good gravy

bless roll make that big roll but it's like-- yeah okay oh the twins like hey just keep yanking that out lot of rules okay i'm gonna use disengage to kick away from this big fucking thing and start-- i'm hasted so i should be able to get to keyleth and she's grappled correct i'm just gonna start cutting so try to do what i did with grog before so athletics you said attack roll i'm gonna use my last luck of the day because that was a one i ignore and i keep cutting 16 29 that's very high 31 right because even though she's grappled it's still way far away all right so where the hell-- two

look to where keyleth pointed and try to see a lump or something in the sand okay i made a-- hold on 18 is that one action because i have an action and a bonus action so i'll just do as much as i
