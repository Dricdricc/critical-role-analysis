sharpshooter trick where i take a negative five to attack but add ten to damage no from this far away okay so constitution 16 yes oh yeah gamble worked out man yeah i know first one and advantage because i'm going before it so the first one is 18 second is 14 and the third is 27 last hits okay first one gets sneak attack damage and plus ten to both hits because of the sharpshooter right so here we go i can't think 33 43 for the first one no-no-no 43 plus 49 for the first one and the last one that hits is 19 sharpshooter i will take another ten feet back away from it all bye guys
