that was like standing at the dock going three two one jump and travis was the only one who jumped in sphincter sphincter sphincter aw i don't want to have sphincter next to caleb now yes that's the name i gave them that's as far as i got delete oh there goes caleb kids a little thing that is totally improvised a couple of weeks ago a critter named courtney-- forgive me if i'm getting that wrong-- she tweeted a picture of her with this scarf that she was making for caleb and she made the hashtag scarvesforcaleb and then people started talking about it i retweeted because i thought it was awesome and they came up with the idea to make scarves for caleb-- but not for me-- to give to shelters homeless shelters to veterans to anyone who needs scarves or hats or mittens i think it's a great idea and you would make me happy this is beautiful i love it thank you but don't pile me up in scarves send them to people who need them i just think it would be a nice thing to do i wrote rod barn what is a bloodline you got to the circus from that how that's funny you gave me an answer but you didn't really give me an answer do we think there's anything left of this town i would like to take a walk and see what it is we're out to save maybe we do that second and first we take a walk we did but molly was drinking so maybe he does not remember i counted 60 gold i don't remember that either well my social anxiety is getting the best of me i'm taking a walk goodbye it's a zork game we go down the stairs excuse me i saw in the middle of the fray-- sir excuse me i'm sorry i was part of the fray as well i was right in the thick of it i saw a cart piled high with bodies are there people missing from town how has the rest of the village fared is everything as poorly off as you are is yours the only business that was hit i'm sorry mollymauk another question for you is there maybe-- i hope it is still standing-- but a supply store i'm sorry i'm in the need of some incense also i'm sorry just between you and me i know the look on your face a little bit you seem a little manic if you have friends you can stay with right now you know you don't have to rebuild it today i recommend you take it slow to the broad barn so you wish to hire us how much we are very experienced but we'd like to know what we're talking about in advance what kind of money are we talking about is there some lesser number for those it is permissible is what they're saying here could you tell us at least what the landscape is like in that direction what is over there this comes from research you have done that you have read up on would you be able to share this reading with me so that we are fully prepared just a small book with a y yeenogru sorry another question may i call you bryce bryce we were just about to go inside the barn here and get outfitted for this-- for many things but especially now that we are going to go take care of this problem do you have any sort of pull with these people might we get any friendly-- no well sure but i'm talking about some sort of discount for getting ready for the road we're not that flush it's asking a bit much i was too forward yes sorry my curiosity gets the best of me always you are talking about buff-- buffaro creatures or something we saw these beasts on the outskirts of town they look brown-furred beast of burden-type creature do you know what those animals are valley aurochs got it thank you all right we should get ready for the road walking into the store yeah yeah oh yeah well that would be worth about-- how much dm a pack or something that is really very-- yes this has helped me immeasurably well it depends on how much i want to do with it i want my cat back but i was in the realm of 15 or 20 gold i'm going to spend here today if they have that much did anyone say that out loud it's not quantity it is the quality of the incense and this was top-shelf but i still need more so in we go and then i say thank you big guy and i punch him and i walk in keep up a good face for two seconds excuse me i just inhaled my own spit (speak n spell voice) i am okay (as caleb) i am needing a very fine kind of incense and i don't know if that is the type of thing this establishment would carry but it's very important do you have that sort of thing i'm sorry it's very noisy in the shop what did you say well look at me can you not tell how fancy i am well you know i've been on the road a long time and i'm carrying a smell with me if you cannot tell to the point i like it i would like to spend about 20 gold worth of incense do you have that much i don't mean cheap shit well it's a barn ja i would like to make an insight check to make sure it's not oregano come on where's the druid that's what would be for oregano that's vex this one perception insight oh that's much better that is an elf travis and elf 11 you just learned something everybody it's 11 in german good this is really good i will give you 17 gold for all this one two (continues counting) 16 16 and i push the 16 gold forward these are heavy is it flammable do i know if it's flammable marisha and nott you're selling yourself short no i have things to do well i would really like to get my cat back so i would need about an hour to go do a little stuff do you have anything else to do what are we doing are we taking our cart well okay maybe i can put it on hold although i really hate to but let's come up with what are we doing what is the plan oh so were you thinking of having a barbecue here or setting up a barbecue on the road just a random field either way we will probably need the cart to carry one of those beasts if we kill one well is the point to try to-- i'm sorry no you finish your thought i'm not a tactician but i have a question are we trying to go back to these things where they live their lair their home their camp or are we hoping to luck into them on the road or-- i like that idea as well well that's the thing we can do both but there is a timestamp on the people we should take care of the people first because then we're increasing how much gold we will bring in because if they die then we will not get as much money for them if they are alive we should get them alive get them out kill the baddies if we can at the same time and if not go back a second time no social graces let's do this wait so now we need time oh god i really want my cat but maybe-- we'll get the tarts maybe it would be handier as a bird reggie this town has been hit hard you look very weary and maybe a little down on your luck yourself maybe i'm just reading into things but i would gladly pay you a silver for this horse here's that copper thank you silver's way too little for a horse they don't care they're swinging low and leaving it behind as we go and also we didn't have time so here off you go i will sit in the cart and go blind the last one frumpkin would be in the air 300-400 feet in front of the cart and i wouldn't do 100% of the time but i would talk for three minutes and then maybe go hold on one sec (magic sound effect) and then come back so intermittent seven also in this time i would have told the rest of the group before nott and i arrived in trostenwald just outside the city limits we were waylaid by gnolls previously and they were hiding in grass just like this it was very much like this so we should be-- i'm getting very nervous right now looking at it all you know i know it's actually about 1137 so we're not quite there yet by the position of the sun beholder walking on the ground as a human is it up to here or-- you've seen teen wolf ja here goes all jester's teeth come on roll a 20 make it happen i would like to use frumpkin to do a once-around from above to see if any of those beasts are on the horizon anywhere for us to kill and also if there are any survivors or anything here that is a 13 from 100 feet up i can see through frumpkin's eyes all of us being a bunch of dumb fucks in the back of the cart the crew the crew groaned disgust i was waiting for the punchline i'd like to point out that we came up with a loose plan but we're not doing that plan also in a pinch we could kill the horses (spitting noise) i can't do that (various whistling noises) i will also help with that okay lift with the legs do we have the time for that right now right now it will take me 11 minutes to do that we're coming in as a line together i don't want to be on an end i don't want you to be on the end i would grab nott by the shoulder and pull us into the middle somehow yes 12 those monster calves i think they're going to make a big fucking stink if we-- that is correct i will send frumpkin down to the one that jester's attacking right up against it to distract and chirp in its face caleb sends frumpkin right down to the one that jester was attacking and i will send out a fire bolt at the same time that's at advantage if my birdie is bothering him up close yeah the one that jester is attacking that is-- oh that's good that is 21 these spells are all still new to me oh that's a big one big one point of damage yep 17 to a three she's like miss trunchbull from matilda there's just the carts there's the one mine entrance i'll take a look around to see if there's anything where they started or anything like that 20 but we'll remember it for the future how about what's behind the grass let's discuss this instead sorry i was thinking about a thing you were saying there is a way through for us i mean that is a fair assumption yeah well we're talking-- jesus that was good do not be sorry frumpkin has been a sparrow before sparrows don't have darkvision do they no it is a regular sparrow well i mean i can send him in there he'll probably hit the wall a few times but if there's any fire or anything-- no you know i can always bring him back but be careful all right but there he goes 21 yeah i am is that from a light source inside or from sunlight coming in please no okay well i think i have seen all i am going to see for the moment but i didn't see anything in there nothing living in there that i saw okay nott my friend i think maybe this is a time where you could-- please don't go crazy but maybe go in 30 or 40 feet there's a room in there and i don't think there's anything in there but you would see i can hear through my sparrow that's correct richtig go wait i don't want to get punched in the face while i'm blind somebody please put a hand on my shoulder-- if something bad is going to happen just shake me no don't do that just shake me don't do that just-- you are a wee baby rogue oh shit i've heard a confusing thing something fell down but okay we're good help me help me now save my life we have to go in here we go wait so the whole party ran in as that was happening the two humans in tandem said wait let them draw out their-- fuck are we doing initiative or are we just going dancing lights four globules of light dancing lights the room is lit up as you're looking i'm going to pull all the dancing lights down to one and put the rag over it and walk beside beau so that she can see come on you people we need a corner and a camera for the corner and a long paper hat for you to put you in the corner okay that's okay that's scheiße where did it go over here d&d beyond it is ten yeah i rolled very low does the rod look like crudely made or prettily designed okay no carving no glyphs no nothing like that just caked in shit okay have a peeky-poo around as you go you know she does this from time to time she becomes a little unpredictable but you can't argue with the results you really cannot because you're drunk you can't tell me what i can do matthew for keeping things-- alerting us of things coming here or-- yeah that's a good suggestion first what are we doing what did you find out down that way i think we should also send you down that one as well to have a look around how far down did you go each way well my instinct tells me that if there's something there that they would trap it so probably more valuable if we're going on nothing take the path that is trapped these are dog people let's take the path with the trap down the wooden shaft you can see in the dark ten (vomiting) did you describe any light source in here that they're working by got it the one that got thrown into the wall it got stunned or hurt it didn't get any-- (whispering) here we go the hyenas are just doggos what about the boom stick that you have we can chuck it into the-- yes it would but-- where would you want this distraction to be because i can make a little-- i can make a little dancing golden person of light appear down at the bottom of the passage if there's more in there they're just going to come in here anyway here's the question do you think these things are going to come out of here right away or is it worth a shot maybe there is a way around to a way they're not expecting you know there's nothing saying we have to run in here if we're not feeling this we can backtrack and look in the other direction in fact i'm leaning that way plus we do have a map here use d&d i can make a little golden person dance behind that guy there aoe surprise round what are you talking about what is your thing not right now no but it's like that (snaps) it's easy this one do that i'm going to start throwing up again soon so let's either do this or backtrack please are we going right now are you about to go i'm going to really quickly mutter a few arcane words then there is another caleb blinking in front of me a little bit and behind me a little bit it is hard to see me at the moment i don't care (whoomp) a little halfling-sized person of light appears behind the gnoll at the far end there i'm using dancing lights you can use the four lights to make a little person a little humanoid shape of light it is doing a little macarena behind the gnoll all the way i have 120 feet of range yes it is but i would know that i'm not going to do that because of my keen memory that caleb has but not liam i send frumpkin through the chamber and down and starts battering into the walls here oh i'm sure that hits yeah the effect of that hasn't taken place yet correct did fjord hit one successfully that same one i am just going to fire bolt it from yeah yeah fire bolt that is an attack range guy plus six that is a 15 to hit the damage is seven i'll use my movement to back up about 15 feet just outside of the chamber rogue best class 17 i hope we at least heard the looney tunes bongos (bongo noises) yeah i can see from where i am i can see fjord and beau with one of these things i'm going to fire bolt right from where i am that's it aw no sorry yeah i will walk just inside the-- jester is the lollipop the flat kind or the round kind that's the best i saw nott dart in front of me and chuckle to myself see nott walk past i'm going to walk forward and say you are enjoying this too much but okay can i see these two you said they were backing away correct all right then the diamond comes up i spin it and little charges of electricity crackle around it and i kick it out from my hand and it spirals through the room to that one come on grog no two plus six is eight did that do it nein but i was so eager that i actually came down the steps my full movement i don't want to go there i want to go to the bottom of the steps behind mollymauk and fjord i'm going to go along the edge of the steps this way and come down toward it and i'm going to now spin and flames lick around it and i'll go (flick) and i flick that off my hand this time is also not good it is a 13 oh for my attack same thing rolled the same thing no it's okay no i don't believe in any of that bullshit you all are crazy no don't worry about me keep going everybody attack two and a three never recover from that injury you are going to be rubbing tiger balm into that shit for years as the room falls still i say well he had a good run a toast to that guy right there on the ground i'm going to call nott over to the chest over on that side there do you see anything wrong with this is there anything hinky about that chest it's investigation i think does it look good take a step back you've earned this i will open it just in case oh well that's probably true thank you you take the two medicine packs and then-- she can heal without the potion of course she can there was a lot of gnoll chatter in here and a lot of exploding orbs and stuff so i'm going to guess that we have alerted whatever is beyond that we are here how do we wish to proceed they don't send orbs of fire through the air though are you clear now how many fingers am i holding up and thumbs or-- (laughter) i don't think i mean yeah we could but-- no we're still trying to get to people here our options are we press forward to something worse or we backtrack and try the other direction or we get out of here did we no we opted not to do that for time's sake yeah we could do that now yeah i could do that quickly i could put an alarm here quickly i could do it the fast way and know if anything is coming behind us is that what we want to do do we want to go around i don't know i'm a little terrified of what is down there that's a half hour is a short rest or an hour is a short rest there's two ways that i can do this i can do it lickety-split or i can take my book out and do it the harder way but that's ten minutes about we just have to march into it okay how are you with that sledgehammer on your back you're carrying a sledgehammer on your back how are you with it no we don't have time for that here we have to get going when we're victorious we can do disgusting things as we leave nott i think you should take point again that i thought that was for going back the other way we want to know if something comes behind us the reasons for doing that are slighter and i don't want to blow my wad magically if we were going the other way i might we talked for seven minutes yeah why are you curious about that that is the crux of the matter it's like a tip jar teen titan's go plays grimlock on transformers all over the place
