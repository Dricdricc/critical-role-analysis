it was sweet and offensive by the way sam that's a very handsome hoodie you're wearing i can't wait to open you up like an advent calendar later those characters are going to be awesome i was not prepared oh i'm fired aren't i am i able to make a jello shot of invulnerability and haste at the same time i guess i'll go back to sleep now i can't we're into initiative right it's too late for potions i'll do it i got 11 plus what 12 and pike got 11 while we're cowering here pike says guys i think i could really help you out if you wait a second okay no it's not she did this once and wrecked our enemies it's worse than that are there any fires left burning in the vicinity our pores are cleared-- the steam-- so is he i do i don't understand all this arcane terminology i like to think of all of vox machina nervously laughing 24 so i take zero because i'm using evasion as she rushes past she hears (slowly) those are just a loaner i am going to down the potion of healing with a bonus action and then now i have two actions because of the potion-- no no haste so that's bonus action now i have two actions because of the potion second action's used to pump out the wings then i am going to fly directly towards thordak's face to-- you don't need that-- to ten feet away from him to his face you can just hold it for a second and cast vow of enmity at him and then i am going to barrel roll back fly and land hard right down next to my sister where she's hiding 120 hasted he could have taken a swipe at me i'm just glad he didn't can i uncanny dodge this yeah i have to i knew it was going to happen no 17 plus 16 total okay so eight and 17 25 gives me advantage on every attack i will get sneak attack on every attack whether there's someone next to him or not inside squished into the corner okay i'll mark that off so anyone within 30 feet of her is getting some nice things and the best part-- when someone heals you you don't roll you calculate the maximum amount you could possibly roll so dm who all gets that looks like grog is just out of reach of it percy needs it grog needs it check out the big hand on scan pull out your dragon gun nice actually not bad pretty good this makes me happy this is going to be funny is thordy la forge poisoned there no disadvantage i really just wanted to say thordy la forge clarota is that you on a flying steed keyleth is on the price is right double all the dice they should really just do it already evasion on this round it's once a round this is a whole new round okay at advantage because of those boots man 23 did we fail the save so i take zero happens to everybody thanks pike we're so glad you're here come on shaun his ac is high so ditch the handicap hey thordy eat a dick how about acknowledge it ancient dragon wasn't enough huh matt 25 should i go or should kima go bonus action i'm taking the potion of invulnerability next action i cast hunter's mark on thordak then i fly at thordak's face and strike at him with the dragon-slayer sword (cheering) at advantage good 26 hits so this is dragon-slayer sword plus sneak attack i'm going to smite and hunter's mark yes all the attacks okay nine plus six is 17

i'm all out of moves and i'm open to getting bitten again but i want to fly away from his face as far as i can and land opposite everybody maybe near the lip no behind the building behind him 120 feet of movement curve over his oh no-- sword's in his head my friends are going to fucking kill you today you fuck arc over his head no i'll slam down if i can behind the building behind his big fat ass i didn't disengage working on it working on it that doesn't look normal just dish out damage so legendaries can fall whenever they want oh grog and it'll keep going i say wait because she's doing her job she's keeping grog alive at max it would have hit the fucking dragon it's there for 50 years spider-climb is cool this is a busy battlefield don't worry sir we didn't see you playing with your

sunshine man do it it's really on matt for there being no pee break vax's turn i'm going to fly straight at thordak's flank you can put me well don't actually put me there because he'll topple but i'm going to attack twice once with the dragonslayer sword once with whisper so here's the dragonslayer sword natural 20 (cheering) yeah but this is the sword he can't against damage can he yeah so seven i'll save the bonus for later seven plus the three seven eight 14 18 18 plus all of this and i'm smiting by the way 18 21 24 26 30 32 35 39 plus hunter's mark is 42 plus divine smite-- 46 48 times two is 96 without the bonus so a hundred and two for the second attack-- good this is yeah it hits 16 plus 20 20 25 this is whisper so that is one plus-- is nine plus psychic damage no hand hand 16 for whisper and i will use my last action so that was action bonus action-- last action to disengage and fly down and land by kima and gilmore this side of the building closest to me on the ground even if i can yeah behind the column in the corner by gilmore's head i think pretty sure i just had an orgasm (laughter) take it take it pike cheat sheet here we are she was low somebody gets an inspiration die (laughter) i really like this spider-climb guy yeah evasion for me with advantage 18 for me i'm sitting pretty i mean i'm really rough i am borishnakoffing all over this battlefield the last thing we'll do in this fight is all turn on you go girl legitimately though matt why would you why would you he's hesitating oh no it's this die big eight big eight you shut your pie hole hear me half-elf other side of that building i can't see where vex is at all ditch the broom pop his head off in one shot go 6d10 i'm up i'm going to arc up and land on his head i'm just going to unload all three action action bonus action into his head first attack probably misses that's 17 second attack hits that's 24 third attack with the dragon sword is a 22 so with whisper (counting) that's 45 with whisper and then with the dragonslayer sword eight plus six plus 3d6 so 21 what did i say before that laura and so 21 plus 45 is-- so 66 and i will stay there sorry also four for hunter's mark on the second attack as well girl so many levels all the levels pike cheat sheet five plus 1d6 every level above second level so 3d6 you can do it pike all the way from new york city he is groot the whole face comes off that's love what are you saving it for give the people what they want here comes the gnome am i electrified sitting on his head do it again percy (laughter) no nope nope hasted 23 fuck you not you not like this i'm going to use luck yeah good time to use luck 26 would this be a new round for me to use evasion i've lost track it's fucking end of the world that'll do it won't it i'm riding him yeah shit yeah i'm riding him i'll use my last luck so it's a 15 so i'm in there with him that is a 25 do i still see him with darkvision at this point are we still in the same chain of initiative how far away from me is he 60 feet then i am going to use my movement and go 120 feet or until i see him this is just my movement 120 feet or until i'm on him yes i'm flying still away from me then i'm going to use a bonus action to dash and hit his back and land on his back attack attack first attack is a-- scheisse 24 i don't remember-- oh i don't get the automatic sneak attack but i got advantage all right so 24 for the first 24 second one is a natural 20 so the first one's the dragon-slaying three eight 14 19 plus hunter's mark so there's no sneak attack on this right you said 21 with the dragon-slayer and then whisper which is a natural 20 is one plus that is nine plus the-- six is 15 plus hunter's mark 17 oh 15 times two is 30 30 plus eight 38 with whisper i'm going to shove it in so that my hand disappears from view so i'm up to my forearm and stab as far in as i can reach i hear the voice of my mother in the morning fuck you 25 which is also halved by the potion is that the quarter she's doing great she's in manhattan 17 sounds like 18 crazy eddie prices yeah man thanks for that yeah what now keyleth this is the jarett we know he caught my sister's attention anyone that does that has got to have a lot of spunk keyleth you tell me you tell me hit or wait what i'm going to hold my turn until keyleth acts attack i'm attacking her she acted she said don't touch i said i'll base it off of keyleth so i'm attacking i'm going to interrupt that no if i've heard don't let her touch him and she's doing that those two things mean the same thing to me she's doing something yes dexterity check all right and i'll use my last luck of the day i had two so that's a 28 this is everything how far away is she from me all three attacks okay move i don't need to move how far away is she you said-- 20 feet so i can throw daggers at her right no but i have lots of daggers i still have the flametongue dagger which is not attuned it's just a lame old dagger first one is a 23 second one is a 19 third one is a 29 god i don't remember 23 sounds familiar so two of the three hit so it was hit-miss-hit right i think so all right so the first one is whisper four plus eight is 12 plus psychic damage is 15 but there's no sneak attack because there's nobody near her and the hunter's mark-- oh can i move hunter's mark to her at this point i have no idea it's a bonus okay got it okay so 15 for the first and the second one oh i don't need that is nine 15 plus nine and i'll use my movement to move between my sister and raishan okay we've seen pike do it you're not here you're not walking away from this field you're going to die maybe i will too but you are going to die out of sight i'm sure she was just going to ask about cooking recipes it's fine go for it five four three two forward yes 31 31 31 25 what did we have to beat zero i got you i got you doesn't matter i can fly 500 feet i got you lay on hands dude no shut up i will kill you in the parking
