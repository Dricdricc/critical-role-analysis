on a side note matt you look so quietly pained to hear mordenkainen bathed in whatever that was so shiny and beautiful oh my gosh laura wants to hold it because it is a new comic critrole where did it go oh man that ashley she's so boxy can you get it empty or close to empty if you try i am not suggesting you try i grab and shake it with my thumb over the spigot probably not how is your esophagus after that how many fingers am i holding up how many members of the mighty nein are there she's okay it's true jester help her out there she's in need looking at our map how much longer do i think we have to go to get to our destination we want to rush you want to rush let's take it slow and we're going to get to the swamp just as the sun is going down if we rush and that is full of nasty things i'm sure if we go slower-- yeah you all are an enjoyable lot it will be fun maybe a little carefully not willy-nilly not galloping pace i want to watch twice yes we saw that i've spent a long time on the road too there are a lot of soldiers ahead and i don't think we should have anything to do with them that's a very good point your background would tell you if you chose a background what bag of shit you have i have for two minutes been thinking if only i had the mending spell (pigeon coo) how tall is the grass around here where's he from again sam and druvenlode where are you all headed just carve it on the back of your dm's screen like a prisoner captain where are you headed en masse like this today do any of us see this would you rather be headed there or where you're heading stay safe as well thank you good trick i think we should camp because then we will hit this swamp at a more advantageous moment how frequent is it a couple of times you have spit out seawater saline solution hey you're not supposed to drink that stuff it's for rinsing this week's episode brought to you by bausch & lomb silver thread around the fire how many of us can fit under that cart i wonder disgusting we're going here silberquel ridge perhaps hupperdook is beyond that mountain range he was from druvenlode it is a big group of us yeah is there enough people left over to do the last watch oh your eyesight is better than mine the storm (singing) never say goodbye oh man jester and i talked about everything like everything about childhood favorite kind of ice cream we know everything about each other now i'm going to mull it over in my sleep good night what's the temperature like right now we have to be miserable right now because we are soaking wet and it is cold i am working on a thing i have not got it figured out yet but i think that i could make some sort of shelter for us so that this doesn't have to happen again i haven't worked out all the-- what no magic of course but i don't have the-- i've been working on it but i haven't struck to the-- well i always need those things but i need more time and more research thank you mollymauk this sucks travis and i have higher hopes of-- i mean this is a long ways off but i would love a large home or a mansion of some kind that you can (snaps) on a whim doesn't that sound amazing we have all of us seen magic in our lives nothing is impossible that is correct you have faith so you should have faith also caleb has watched beauregard go to town on 100 pushups or something and i go maybe 40 feet away and i try as well i do one pushup and then i go study siff duthar's spell tome some more instead of going to two roll a 20 how far up is it about okay cart in addition to the insects do we start to become aware of wildlife around birds and beasts i'm good at nature i've lived in the woods for a long time on the plus side i think sitting in the cart that caleb is probably the cleanest he has been in two years because it's been raining non stop i cast mage armor on myself that's not a good idea i would say that caleb has spent a lot of time over the last several years in woods can i check to see if i have ever heard that cry before that is an 18 fjord regurgitates saline solution we're just getting into this swamp right now right it's your proficiency plus your wisdom plus eight do we even see her anymore yeah luck is for suckers man also it's important that it is kept hidden 12 as well i'm on a log oh i am okay i am going to stick a root of licorice in my mouth like a hayseed like i'm fjord and cast haste on nott read this because your armor class is up you have an extra action per round you have advantage on dexterity saves i will do my full movement forward 30 feet you have an extra action yeah you can use the extra action to go closer as well or extra attack i love this cleric that's fucking dumb screw you snitch get them ninja stars out they're darts i think they're homebrewed darts i think that's the first time any of us have ever done that (as grog) he did it (sings) light the corner of my mind what's that spell do i think that i see one of the giant gators is getting close to nott and also yasha so i'm going to tug really hard on the glove of blasting and revolve around my wrist three times and use scorching ray edubation say again three attacks advantage against the target correct first one is a 17 okay second one is a natural 20 third one is a 17 so they all hit ja here we go dang it total of 21 fire damage ja then i will keep wading through the shit try to get a little bit closer and say hey fjord isn't this fun and that's it but what if you get a natural 20 roll again in case you get 20's we got a natural 20 +2 on your ac ja it seems like i'm-- can i get within 30 feet of it no correct i would think probably not just out of 30 feet i am going to cast magic missile at level three because he's got my little friend that is five missiles total here we go total of 18 so (firing noises) (yelling) disappointed is he flanked with yasha advantage roll again it's like the simpsons frogurt scene oh just when i think i'm out they pull me back in sure this one not this one yes but does an unmoving body move (regis philbin imitation) would you like to phone a wotc friend matthew mercer how do you want to do this maybe she's vibrating on the ground like when a pager goes off good narration dm good narration ja hallo it's worth 100 which is what i need for my spell ja ain't you got no long range out of context quotes a purple worm erupts from the middle of the floor-- caleb is watching all this i could it would take an hour but i could understand this one if i set my mind to it oh no no please no please no i'm going to pull my coat shut or does he want to draw empire kids wouldn't know kenku like ravens they are able to mimic many sounds i mutter that to the group are you able to handle yourself in a scrap are you good with a weapon or-- to my question though are you able to handle yourself in a dangerous moment in any way a monk many seconds what do you need since he brought me over what do i make of the same yeah that is a 25 just looks like a bunch of old crap to be honest did jester spend hours doing that if she did then caleb would have spent one hour to cast comprehend languages as a ritual spell to talk to her full on i'm going to walk kiri away from this for the moment and say after an hour has passed of me doing this ritual spell for the moment i can understand you as clearly as you can understand me do you want to tell me anything about your time in this swamp or what you want to do with yourself now that you are alone or how we can best help you or anything you want to tell me okay well in the meantime while we are looking for them is there anything that we can do for you or is there anything that you can tell me about your last days here i mean their are hoots and whistles are some form of language aren't they will she be welcomed in a town dm you said three or four five hours for jester to do all of that gator carving before and that's what you did than i use arcane recovery that's all i wanted to ask if i had time well i think we should do what we have done well so far which is to improvise it is better to bring her with her and then leave her and then if we find an advantageous place to leave her then we will but for the time being she is a sidekick do you know cats do you like cats do you know cats do you like cats into her hands frumpkin starts to purr and nuzzle yeah i ask frumpkin to do a blep and to lick her face he's friendly that is my cat if you want to spend some time with him you can he is very soothing for me anyway give it a shot i just want to point out that if we pick up one more stray there will actually be nine of us that's true it can be both caleb takes off his cloak and puts it on jester i never wear a cloak when we're not in the city look you guys we are trying to make it work jester took most of the day to harvest a gator febron keyes in the keystone pub in the puddles puddin' just pull that cloak way down that's a percy mask also very important question how is kiri doing with frumpkin the only way to get in is an eight-foot climb on a rope oh dear i start to pull the silver thread around the edges of the cart all of us can get in but anybody else will set that off man what a great scene between husband and wife no she's coming with us do you know what booze is we'll get her a tirley shemple it's fine all over the place really bon or barn or-- let your eyes adjust to the room i have it that's easy for me to do okay how old is berleben in general wow there's a fancier part of this town are they below the water level here from the bottom that would be a 9th-level spell that's beyond-- we could also drag you back to the gentleman if you'd prefer that instead or you could point us in the right direction and let us take care of it that is a 15 well you know keep it simple stupid we are very aware that he has sent us into something more troublesome than he has described and we are willing to do that we're told you are the one who can get us in the right direction we'll be very disappointed otherwise that's a persuasive jessie-- damn it jessie because matt doesn't want to sing i'm going to give you all my gold that is one no i have two silver and five copper how broke am i (whispers) power ballad well he is staying with us this evening i highly doubt it i mean it's possible insurance no we are in a podunk town there is no insurance here well we've been here an hour there are seven hours-ish left on the spell that'll get us through most of the night what all's in there you have the-- sure i thread the cart but you have the thingy that's the most important thing i'm fine to send it also nott i would not worry the spookiest thing in this place is us (squeaking) quick conversation just quick as the hooligans are getting ready for bed i wanted to say to nott you know i think for obvious reasons now i have kept a lot of things close to the vest and those things are out if you ever want to talk about anything-- now or later after you think about it-- you are my friend and you can talk to me-- if you want i can't see you through your booze i'm clean right now i mean an hour in yeah but we were in the rain for like 48 hours yeah did laura bailey put you up to this you're getting ahead of yourself okay i am a garbage person let's put that on the table but while i am a piece of shit we can help each other in the short term this is going further than i anticipated i just meant that if-- these people we are with are all interesting and great-- and untrustworthy but great-- but i trust you which wasn't really true three weeks ago i just mean i wasn't-- i don't know words don't do it talk to me if you want gute nacht hanging brain febron is totally telling his friends that he nailed a barbarian (as febron) so i had her alone right (as febron) it's me pheromones each page is a centimeter thick though on this book but there's illustrations maps curse words colors-- punisher skulls mountain range i remembered matthew no englishmen she was the last one
