beat poetry-ed us to our death you've got to get that unicorn though just go (inarticulate noise)-- it's hilarious that's me that's me tell you what if i have a super-funny year i'll make a super-funny playlist thanksgiving we can be thanksful we can be thanksful for the campaign we hads the characters we hads it'll be greats altar boys props to that set though ghurrix would you like to phone a friend and what's behind the pit fiend where the map disappears is there building there or what how many stories is the building behind them 19 we're tied let the big man go first dnd bob ross reference is like playstation trophies get it girl get it okay i'm standing right in front of scanlan right right next to him all right i'm going to take my hand and palm him by the face and cast heroism on him that's the first action first i'm going click my boots of haste which they've seen me for the last 30 minutes we slept i put my boots on i've not been invisible all day i slap my hand on his face cast heroism then i cast it on myself then i'm going to take to the air and fly up and over them and behind them and hover over the building behind them maybe we should just imagine it because i want to go off the table and throw whisper at the back of his fucking head from about 40 feet in the air directly behind him all right i'm going to do 50 feet above his head back a little bit and right into his head that diagonal line is probably just the edge of 60 and since grog is hugging him it's sneak attack and he's grappled which means i have advantage so it is 25 which should hit if i was paying attention to the acs two we'll say is ten plus the sneak attack damage is 15 18 22 25 28 31 35 plus the psychic damage 35 plus-- i need an eight somebody give me an eight where's an eight 38 no then i'm going to fly an additional-- because i'm hasted i can go 120 feet i'm going to go up another 40 feet no i'm going to stay where i am stay where i am every round because my charisma bonus is not that high you get two hit points every round you get them back yeah do they go up temporary hit points yeah they go up does he get them now or does it start next round the wording is unclear on my card two just two magic guns are dangerous let's see here how can i kill them kill them all at once kill them one at a time kill them in an embarrassing way cut the feed cut the feed that's fucked up you get two hit points temporary hit points oh my gosh i get to hit a hundred hit points because of that spell that's amazing at the start of my next turn i do though don't i both of us action action and the bonus action was an attack hasted oh it's a concentration spell i'll leave it on scanlan can i take a secondary hit on him after the fact since i was unaware of the rules right which is what he's saying right and we had a text conversation earlier today where i said that if i don't hold an action i can do this this and this and we just misunderstood each other so keep the one on scanlan and i'm going to roll i would have rolled a secondary shitty attack on him for 22 okay that is a massive nine hit points of damage it's very in character this is why we play the game man your jail is full tonight she's got professional makeup for our game underneath not within five feet in the immortal words of laura bailey mother bitch still even though we established grog first i'll go first is grog within five feet now is he right up against her okay so what i want to do hasted i can go 120 feet so what i want to do is a tight arc around so that i can go this way and down into that little corner so i can land behind keyleth but on the way i want to throw a dagger yeah i want to land right next to keyleth down in that little nook but on the way i want to throw whisper at her okay advantage so that is very good 28 so that is one plus eight is nine plus the sneak attack is (counting) 32 plus the psychic damage is 33 so that hits her as i go by i want to land right behind keyleth there's no room can i land right in front of her okay i land right in front of her grab her by the face kiss her full on the mouth and cast heroism through the kiss then i'll use my bonus action for movement and fly up to that roof straight out across the street from him from the pit fiend you're now immune to fear and you get two hit points per round still doing it to the tallest building across from the-- no i don't have the thingie sorry this building right here but in the little gap right here this little diagonal spot so that i'm like this so just my little head is peeking out three-quarters cover matt bought a platinum snitch dustin fell off the roof slightly nervous i'll use uncanny dodge on the first one i guess uncanny dodge that's what's halved 26 hits good you just need it to go down four points love that little man i'd like to use my first luck on him so he has to roll again go fuck yourself it's fine i'll die and roll another character it's fine yeah wow two 20s avenge me fall down on the mocap mattress 4d6 or 46 46 great well that's much different doesn't hit doesn't hit because i just got knocked down so it went over my fucking prone body everyone hears (groaning) does he leave a cleveland steamer on me as well oh sneak attack no sneak attack okay fine (wheezing) ouch ah no probably not no 16 oh hi pike you don't even know how fucked up i am probably why not do your full movement it doesn't take away from your actions oh for another full movement that's just a wee jump to that tower now all right i'm going to use a bonus action-- yes but i'm a half-elf so i get advantage let's see how i do pretty good 18 okay so i can't go toward him right on him or everything that's fine i won't do fuck-all with him so for my bonus action i'm plugging my single potion of greater healing into my mouth to start so that's 4d4 plus four right (adding) 16 okay i'll figure that out in a second then i want to use my first action to-- he's right up on me i'll use my first action to disengage and then i'm going to arc almost go in a straight line but arc slightly around the tower since grog is right on the erinyes i want to throw whisper again at her as i zing by 20 feet away from her yeah throw whisper at her as i go by and land as far away from the pit demon because i'm so scared as i can as far away as i can get and i can go 120 feet with movement hasted against her but that cancels out because i have advantage because grog's right on her you're right yes thank you disadvantage on the attack oh balls one as far as i can get 120 feet if there's a nook to scoot behind in the corner i will all right stay true to percy that was a dickens novel did i roll for that ha i'm sure i lost it how do i do this first one's a natural 20 oh the zero cool 19 15 16 (singing) if at first you don't succeed-- think of the burn scars you'll look so cool all right i figure i can see keyleth and the winged lady so i'm going to beeline right to the other side of the enemy and flank her second attack is a 19 how does that work she automatically does it plus four i'm going to use nah okay then the third attack is a 32 okay so first and third the first one gets the sneak attack so that is (adding) 29 plus the psychic damage gets 32 that's the one that sneak attacks then the other one the regular one where'd my pyramid go gets a ten so a total of 42 between the two attacks shoot to kill baby do it golden snitch does that hit ashley matthew mercer keeping us humble since 2013 it's pronounced jift that was strong yes uncanny dodge does not hit i will use a second luck to make her roll again all right uncanny dodge so the poison's full but the swipe is halved so it was nine plus what 20 ten or higher you can keep the jewels though stanky jewels i got pike okay i'm going to rocket toward the hm just give me ten seconds to think okay i'm going to rocket into the door so i've got haste i've got 120 feet so i'm going to arc into the door if i pass the pit demon i'm going to use disengage as a bonus action so he does not and i'll swivel underneath he has oh and vex is right next to him five feet i'm going to stab him in the fucking face as i fly in the door 24 hits okay so that is (adding) 41 as i fly past into the door use lay on hands twice there's nothing in the book that says i can only use it once a turn so i'm going to use the first time i use it to cast neutralize poison on her and the second time i'm going to use it to give her one hit point it doesn't say anything in the book about amount per turn but i have two more actions can i use the bonus action to attack all right question for matt and i'm liam right now if i bring her up ten hit points right poison doesn't bring her down anymore in 5e it just puts her to disadvantage correct i'm going to use five points of lay on hands to cure the poison well if i can only use lay on hands once i'm going to throw another dagger out the door into the pit fiend-- look at his eyes she's unconscious already you're about to be i'm holding my dying friend next to my dying sister what about your sword roll a d20 to start whatever it is matt's been sitting on it for months months you're unconscious oh percy helped her that's right are we out of combat if we're out of combat i'll do lay on hands safe bet i scuttle over to my sister then and scoop her head up i'm looking out the door watching what's happening with grog give her a gentle noogie and cast lay on hands last five hit points to bring her health to awake i'll also say that i'll hold an attack if an efreet pokes its face in the door she's awake but very low five actually let's say it's one not five i'm just an emt she's the doctor can i use my luck on him i have one left watching this i don't think so i'm wrong about a lot of things matt in-game and out of game just attack rolls all right let's am-scray so 1d12 and then we do whatever after that i'm up to full 99 wait a second though grog that magic bucket you have does it make champagne does it make ale pour it out i walk over to scanlan i grab him by the face and cheeks look at this guy i scoop him up and i put him on my shoulders i walk over to keyleth and i say look at these fucking two to scanlan and keyleth the two biggest fucking heroes i know yeah and can i just say thank you scanlan thanks keyleth is there anything left for everybody or for one for one half cup is that all it does you there blue fellow i'm going to walk up to the corner i've still got scanlan on my shoulders i'm going to invert my hands and grab him and turn him upside down hey you know i'm teasing but you're an amazing man you are a hero i shut him up and i kiss him just take it take the compliment you fucker i go to scanlan's cheek (patting slap) that's okay do one for me i'm going to go find my sister i'll talk to you later back out the door absolutely yeah hey guys that's your hangup not mine (laughter) my name is pronounced liam (laughter) after my bit with scanlan i put the ring back on and spend the next 20 minutes attuning to it and she hears behind her (mocking) oh thank you i love you so much no she's got to roll for it with disadvantage because i'm invisible (mocking) your hair is so white and beautiful i'm so in love (mocking) you're a shithead a disembodied voice says totally we came all this way well completionists we fucking did it she bounces back from death one time a day yeah if we survive we'll send him a jelly of the month club membership look we didn't have the time to come here period so let's go talk to him and ask him if we can have a few days to get back to him if we die problem solved also we're mostly nice people but i'm pretty sure grog could crush him like an accordion we're not going to do that but we can set the terms of the favor a little bit all right family and history are important wait percy do you need a commission time it was just yesterday or two days ago at the most that you said you needed it not what i was expecting but i like it well this is a good place to start this is above average here it's a whole other dimension as one last thank you to him since i'm still invisible i make moose antlers behind my sister's head and go-- and cows sam and two weeks from now let's all be thankful for vestiges and thankful for being alive you're going to do great i think we should go ahead and do it give them something to tide them over travis and
