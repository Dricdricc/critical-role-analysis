it's been a while so long since matthew mercer ran dungeons & dragons three just came out i just read five and it is so baller oh my god also to rewind that beautiful art on that book is by @natroze roze with a z made that ages ago and laura's been in love with it for ages that is one shiny bear ass we tried to get you to talk about killing your friends and you would not do it why won't you kill your friends what's the matter with you new episode of madness came out we have this guy to show oh this is the shirt for sagas of sundry madness i am a jenga pro if you want to learn how to play jenga you must watch sagas of sundry madness this eye glows in the fucking dark i surprise myself let me tell you i think this is ivan van norman's eye i hope it's his eye this is a little weak do you have anything stronger than this all right log then grog yes yes my name is quazirat toluus quazirat toluus all ten yes i am draenei wear all white at all times top and bottom underneath and front whole nine yards i am simple man i like to test myself in battle for the glory of argus every day of my life for the glory of argus i also like to sample the fine spirits of the realm and i am a big player of mmorpgs i like to unwind at night when i am done killing the burning legion it is lrjenkins1234 as long as it's white and i was going to ask for a couple bottles of your best vintage to be added to the agreed upon price travis and will it mess me up that's a deal are there any markings footprints different toe patterns any kind of clues yeah i was actually asking the dm do i see with my draenei eyes as i stroke my chin tentacles-- on my chin i don't like to draw attention to them that's right yes i'm making an investigation check i'm rolling a d20 that's not very good that is hold on i've just solved the entire game that's a two there were candles here that's a good idea okay that's better than us so you go from there to there and add that you can also tell there were candles here yes intelligence modifier is up here yeah five plus-- oh so intelligence check you say intelligence check well then it's just that plus-- where the hell is it there it is what about paht-pourri you're dropping off the t you're fucking with me probably unrelated you first little one there's also rocks on the ground yes is there room for our world of warcraft pauldrons to go into this space either the small magic one or the sneaky one should be going first i think yes all right little stinker let's see what you can do all right dramamine lead the way it would be better because here's the thing even if you are supremely sneaky which you are i'm fucking bullshit with sneaking so we all have to you know pull our weight we'll see how i do three and i lied five yeah they'll never see us coming (shushing) what happens is he will create the environment and the things around you and you interact with them and you roll dice occasionally you're in control of your personality and the actions you do in this world he's the world there it is oh that's shnazzy yeah what is that and we've been trailing the elf so-- i think it was more than nine so like ten candles eleven probably we'll find out if we kill them you just said candles a lot of times where are you this is the time all right and it's at advantage because she's hiding yeah yeah so roll it twice and take the higher one so it's a 17 plus your attack from the crossbow is a 25 plus eight so the damage is a 1d6 so you roll one of those cubes okay three plus your sneak attack damage which is at your level-- plus the five so we're seeing what the order is so roll 20 again and add this and then keep that number in your head for a moment you changed it roll it again well if you know what it was then keep it i can't read your die jen yes that's good that's 23 okay just remember that why can't i roll well okay 11 j-e-l-l-o 11 11 quazirat q-u-a-z-i to hit you roll d20 so roll the roundy and add your attack bonus for crossbow yeah so now you're just rolling d6 a cube and add a five so yeah roll d20 dexterity save so what you get on that ten plus that is here nine and this is a save not ability skill correct oh that's big 11 no i don't think so seems fake on other side what's the length of those bridge guesstimation-wise five total two on each bridge big guy other side big is relative term is there a clear path between where i'm standing and either bridge yeah that sounds fun i'm going to run for edge of bridge on this side how far is that for me where i'm starting that's good i like it 15 feet is good i run towards edge yes sure that hits no eat shit no i used 15 feet to get here i'm going to do my running long jump for 25 feet over 20 foot bridge you describe to me and land on other side and move up to this asshole on other side oh you think i would understand this mechanic before this moment in my life at level seven what kind of check okay oh not great at all but i get to add two because of remarkable athlete so hopefully that's enough 14 i'm how far from him oh well i'm going to take his head off i had a pet rat but i don't care here we go oh that's a one but i have an extra attack so i will go again oh that's so bad that's a 12 i'm using greatsword i'm going to attempt to embarrass myself further and use action surge colville don't fuck me colville 15 for the one but this last one is okay 17 yes finally oh fievel your troubles are just beginning that is ten slashing damage kiss my sword the hilt says leeron jenkins let's get this shit started so you attack this guy you get sneak attack damage because i am right up against him acceptable risk what'd you get plus your crossbow-- so 1d6 to start then you add the other cubes okay that's good plus nope you cannot do that with bonus but is she up against any kobolds at the moment well the best you could do with a bonus is maybe to disengage which means get away from them so they cannot hurt you but you cannot hit again with-- that's good advice just dance back a little bit oh good yes he's got lots of candles yeah that's good that's 24 i'm trying it's a ten okay so you did quite good with 22 yeah does she have evasion zero because rogue is best class 14 you want to take like five or maybe even 20 minutes here before we go forward i don't know you know conserving energy that kind of thing let's go you want to kick ass i can tell little one let's go he tossed it at the dm how are those tunnels coming you've made them or making them safe passage convince him oh yes bring closer your hands what i like about them is they're so little (bones snapping) that's a 17 okay i can do this to you five more times i can play this game all night long little man so we need to get inside we need to be you know alive and not getting killed so we would like to keep you she has lots of beef jerky we could feed you but we can't have any what did you call these well let him earn it first you know maybe 20 minutes we're still alive you have healed hand and more meat i'm not holding you you gave him to me i like this guy pat pat pat well i went like this i thought you were holding him you know dungeons & dragons is funny thing your mind's different from my mind who knows what we're seeing i drop his ass on ground and i kick him really hard in the ass lead the way lead the way that's you you take look make sure it does not explode on you this plus this so plus eight to what you roll i don't like mushrooms and the rope is still trailing from him depends on what we think biggest threat is touching mushroom breathing mushroom how far away can you cast that shit from what if we all back up to our different sides yeah get back as far as you can and we'll get way the fuck back see what happens i mean to begin with you're not alarmed by us being here in the first place i grab rope that is holding reekcheeks and bring him over you know this one is he problem i punch him in the eye you've got to keep them in line with tough love give it to mikey he'll try anything everything is crystal clear in another life i would have hit that guy before he said a single word i would have dropped his ass good news my brothers we come from both the future and the past let me tell you your fathers are proud of you i've been this fucked up before your mothers love you and are proud of you persuasion you said that's 18 and the deep secret is you know that i am you doing inches this way like an arc and papa and mama don't want you to hurt you you have to love you give into it oh that's a 20 show the feywild we are such fake nerds travis and what are you doing did you eat mushrooms you were talking out loud to no one i think it's your own positive nature speaking to you from yourself i mean that's up to you and them i don't know shit about that mind over matter aerwin do you see anything hinky in this room anything off bad what's that okay that's 16 plus perception and we're standing here talking in this chamber that's good you're going to be good acrobatics you say well that's iffy you know but also tempting because what did they have when they died i can chuck you over well yeah first one thing then the other i'm not going to fall you were staring straight at me oh yes now you seem sarcastic because you're rolling your eyes there are these big bruisers floating there staring at us you can fly i have seen you do it so many times can't you skirt the edge of this room and go over there you don't need to go through this guy sure see if there is anything worth you know this is what we live for i am not going too much hassle look laura you're finally doing it i also talk to you what kind of blade how big is this thing i would also but i would do roshambo with you okay best out of three or just one time on four i have intelligence of eight throw on three why are you changing it on me let's do it on two we go one two shoot okay all right one two shoot oh shit two papers we go again one two shoot give me that shit you seem very crazy right now hell yeah i am attuned to nothing so i will attune to this yes this was made for me should i be describing this to the table yes this is called adventurefury blessed blade of the thrillseeker this weirdly pristine longsword is encased in meticulous almost gaudy gold scrolling and rune-like carvings that spell out phrases like carpe diem like your shirt with donut and you only live once you gain plus two to all attacks and damage rolls made with this weapon you are immune to fear and if you ever attempt to flee from danger you must make a wisdom saving throw dc 12 on a failure you instead rush toward the challenge in hopes of glory yolo for argus and for lrjenkins1234 hey shakira do you fear me good that's all that matters let's go 20 natural 20 is it the warcraft dancing animation we are problem solvers aw i don't feel bad why is that not toddlewaddle something else what did you say yeah but i have to share speaking in accent but out of game as a former rogue boo-hoo this one is asking me if assassinate is good in this moment to get a special surprise attack on gargantuan-sized dragon yes you would almost definitely hit dragon but it would be like taking donut and hitting side of empire state building absolutely you will hit absolutely you will take off half of one scale of dragon i mean you can do it this is dungeons & dragons do whatever you like but i'm just saying the game will end in two minutes i am curious to see tempting tempting yes if anyone's going to fuck with that shit it's going to be you but it's still a big if i also have a question about this item that i'm attuned to let's say that this one's not crazy enough to grab dagger and we just want to go by this says that if you ever attempt to flee from danger you make wisdom save does sneaking by-- i just wanted to triple check part of me thinks it would be hilarious to see me rush in but-- i elbow the gnome and lip sync and i say chain i know you all need to go through because you know i'm so big and heavy okay so you want to try to tangle with the devil and try to take this blade hm and what is the landscape like from where they are to where we are here here's what i think if i fucking move big noise jig is blown you need me to stay still so you do your thing and if it goes well you go and then i go if things go bad we all die together you know no promises we'll see what happens good luck stealth oh it's a one does she have-- she does not does she have what i had oh too bad so sad lrjenkins1234 running forward so you're there but this is where you're at isn't it or is that where you're at you shouldn't be there because you can't go higher than that so now you add 16 to that and that's where you are so 45 add 16 yeah 24 oh shit that was vax's voice five plus whatever you roll party i'm running at dragon yes i'm not running from dragon couldn't if i tried now well maybe i could nah i'm going to dragon yeah first one is 17 of course not second one is 25 yes it does okay so that is big damage 16 oh buddy let's go what did you get what is that that's seven plus your dex but it's still not great not me that's not bad 22 total ain't no thing but the chicken wing so these two are down get the hell out of dodge okay this is bad i'm stupid but not that stupid so i'm going to run towards these two to dwarf yes and use action to cram potion healing into his mouth wake him up okay this is a potion of healing greater 4d4 plus four that's the end of turn yes that was action wait hold on i will use bonus action to do second wind on myself no that's fine that's three yes only hits a little bit though everything's going to be fi-- yes okay yeah you know always living i'm going to flee from the dragon we'll see how we do it's a big 13 12 let's get the hell out of here you guys blessed blade of the thrill seeker eh too much hassle go 24 see what you got ooh she needs 20 minutes with that so we should probably you know where are you at i don't like that music i don't like it i've seen you two in action what if she fires and you follow with fire no it's not it's much higher 30 that's cocked so what's the higher one you're doing crossbow 1d6 roll a cube three plus your sneak attack damage and we're going to double this when you're done because you're an assassin hitting in the dark (counting) 37 because you're an assassin every kobold is the best in this game big ten my man let's go wee one it'll form back together though everybody say crack as much as you can okay and your buddy is there so-- not hidden can't do that but you're still going to get sneak attack yeah you're going for an attack is she at advantage because he's stunned and weird so roll twice oh auto-crit so you don't even have to roll well yeah you hit 16 plus eight so 24 so you roll-- 1d4 which is the triangle the pyramid roll that okay now you roll your-- four good roll these guys okay roll those holy shit that's a good sneak attack 22 wait you double it because it's an auto-crit so 22 44 plus the three is 47 oh you have smoked this guy ten 57 yes you can disengage as bonus action and get away from him so he can't hurt you dance back how far away are other little guys from this one ten feet behind him then i will use my whirlwind warrior class ability and i will start with the big man and move to his little buddies okay so here we go so i'll start with him yeah so i get two attacks because of who i am that is 16 not great okay so am i at advantage because he's fucked up okay good that's better that's 24 to hit that hits okay here we go again okay great 14 on this guy keep going ever hear of baryshnikov amateur do i roll for attack on each one okay here we go first one we get 18 second one we get natural 20 third one we get one fourth one we get 28 okay so first one we get 18 yeah okay so second one critical so eight 16 18 24 oh buddy and the last one 14 life comes at you fast sure does stop drop and roll you've got six seconds that's what your turn is right i see the little one go down so i start hoofing it in that direction and i plant my hand right down on her little forehead and i use gift of the naaru and you get seven hit points of life but then i keep running past her as far as i can go that's fine sure that hits towards the latrine which is technically fleeing so do i need to make saving throw with sword okay good no that's not good that's a four yolo bozhe moi but am i out of movement and i'm stuck where i am yes i am i take the sword (guitar solo) is that a dex save is lohkor adjacent no you're doing the crossbow you said you can do the dagger you cannot fire it you can throw the dagger or you can fire the crossbow so 1d4 roll the pyramid then roll your four cubes add that all up no you can't do another attack you can use a bonus action-- okay so i'm on fire fuck it i run and i attack i shout for argus and i run forward to him and i would like to attack-attack for my attack but then also use my recovered action surge so i'll hit this fucker three times first one is good don't distract me is 29 fine is 17 for the next okay and last one-- oh balls-- is 20 that's good shit so here we go first attack-- oh that's terrible-- for ten second attack that hits is 18 so a total of 28 all told it's all right i hold my ground and block my friends don't act surprised travis we know

find out what that does i'm not down but-- okay cool i'm up 15 oh you're picking it up instead of attacking that's your call plus what is it seven no she's up i think of my father leeron jenkins and i
