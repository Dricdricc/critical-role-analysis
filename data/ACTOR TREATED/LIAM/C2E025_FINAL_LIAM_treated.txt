it is the best day so much is going on my nephew is here so many things are happening behind the scenes it is the best day so on this show where ashley is about to leave baby baileyham has just been born i'm in the woods and we're about to move you decided to wear that for the entire episode as long as that is on your face you will get no sugar from me sam riegel do we want to leave it up to chance that we'll run into those two kids that they will not succeed or we'll find them jester could we perhaps hold on to your backpack before you go so that we have that in case we need it well i feel it is fairly obvious but okay as you were ja okay so what are we doing now it is animated by magical means i am sorry i don't understand you say they're too busy to deal with it have they got it locked away in a vault while it just stomps around yeah they certainly have nothing to lose we are a group of people claiming we're here to deal with their issue we either die doing it or solve the problem (chuckles) being as the man's daughter is standing here with us perhaps we will pass on that idea yes i have questions about it as well oh natural one it's a good half-life yeah so herr tinkertop once we are to get past these defenses would dispelling its arcane nature shut the machine down the nutshell protecting that core needs to be defeated first and does it have any capabilities of attacking at range would it be foolish to have you speak on our behalf to usher us in yes you're finally ready to make amends et cetera i have honey yeah i have that as well i have molasses i will tell you that in a few minutes actually if that's all right it's industrial grade it is not for baking i am quite sure did i stutter that is a good question yasha i don't cook with it i use it for arcane things i have about the amount of a plum wrapped in-- that would be even better if we could get our hands on-- that is a good idea fjord also fjord congratulations on this your most auspicious day yeah get your sleep while you can and don't use the exercise ball to rock him to sleep because then they get addicted to it and that's the end of your sleep life yourself oh no yeah this is silly i take off the cloak that i've been wearing for a week or so now and i just put it over the man's head no oh sorry sam and to disguise his appearance i have an idea i could summon schmidt and it would be a slow process but he could carry it a couple of inches low to the ground and wait and then go a couple of feet oh let's see oh it is about that distance so it might be just shy or-- let's give it a whirl just give me ten-ish minutes that's not bad i pull a book out of my holster and flip to the right page and start muttering does anyone want to do anything in those nine minutes left ja schmidt one second you two circus people mollymauk could-- ah that's cute could the two of you do something fabulous over there ja i preemptively send schmidt over to the closest bucket ja that is correct here's a question i'm sorry how wide apart-- is it bars the fence what kind of fence do we have so that bucket is not going between any of that nott would you be able to use your invisible hand to lift that up and over okay so when he crashes right at that moment i ask schmidt to move the bucket three feet closer to us low to the ground oh boy another ten feet towards me yeah we don't want it off the ground i'll try to edge it a little closer still i'd like to get it near the fence if i can okay then i'm just going to wait for the right moment then i'll have schmidt lift it over his head but not yet oh jeez i go-- that's how you do it you set them up and knock them down not life just this campaign taliesin let's heat that tar up before entering of course you have tasked experts with this job spiritual weapon is a good idea that is incorrect (clears throat) i can speak when i have to no i can just talk and what will happen when we go inside here are you locking us in until which okay nott can you lift that thing up for me well it's going to scald the bejeezus out of your hands if i-- well i could semi-burn your hands or not burn nott's make-believe one everybody back away from this bucket and i crackle my hands and send a fire bolt at the bottom of it that is the most relaxed that spell has ever gone yasha could i borrow a torch from you so your hands are free to work danke let's try diplomacy wow indeed i sneak up behind nott (whispering) i can open this if you need me to i just like to save my shit also if i were to unlock it it would be loud so that's not good oh that's good 19 okay we can check this off our list probably there are some dead inmates in here while people are moving around the room i whisper just for our options here if we want to kick this off and don't mind getting its attention i can magically unlock this door here which will make a sound and then instantly lock it if we wanted to we could all hustle inside here and maybe attack at range just as an option well i could be wrong but with what i know how to do i don't think it can do that to this door for a short amount of time well i'm talking about magic i can magically seal this door unless it has a way to deal with that it will not be able to get through that is 15 impassable until it is broken or the spell is dispelled or suppressed okay yeah instantly so you bruisers you're staying out here wait i do not have the components i need for arcane lock damn it a lot of gold dust into the last unexplored room yeah okay i'm going to back as far away from that door as i can and i will send frumpkin in ladies yep oh i don't have the cat paper with me in this state that i'm in because i didn't know i'd be playing so i rolled a 15 i snap frumpkin out of there sam can you take a new picture and send it to me six [no audio] sam and can you hear me right now yeah okay i'll go but i can't see the map is a pixelated mess of shit from my point of view after mollymauk cleared the way is the thing on its own is it in a 40-foot cube of empty space or are any of my allies in it slow is out the window i pull out my clay cat's paw and mutter a few words and i will cast maximilian's earthen grasp a soil cat's paw comes up out of the ground and swipes it needs to make a strength save 16 16 it's held in place and it takes 2d6 damage hold on it takes five points of bludgeoning damage it has to use an action to break out if i can squish even one square further away from it i would just a reminder that everyone is rolling at advantage while the cat's paw holds it meanwhile travis is somewhere singing dear theodosia shield so it misses oh that will hit those will hit that's not going to be good good good good i also have to make a concentration check hold on i rolled a three well it's still there it's just not holding it wait no it's gone matt was that 17 points of damage yeah (coughing) that's rough buddy what comes after jester and i in the initiative order yasha does and then the thing yeah i know i'm having trouble thinking straight because there is a blade through my gut and my rib cage so i grasp the cat's paw again i don't try to pull myself loose and i cast maximilian's earthen paw again strength save bad 20 i spun myself like a pinwheel low on what nothing's up that failed last time didn't it it can use a strength save to break out of it and it exists but if i fail my concentration check it goes right the second time it succeeded immediately it stays there great then that means it's staying there yes sir 12 don't throw away your shot that was a chow yun-fat moment yasha could you please come cast pull this lamppost out of my stomach who gets what now from jester i'm coming caleb stops mid-somatic gesture and says ah fuck this and goes back to the first door and has a short rest eins zwei drei vier back at the front gate leaning against beauregard eh what is that is that your blood-- or is that mine (snoring) yeah i have a little bit left in me mollymauk will you help me up please (grunting) okay point me at the thing i turn to mollymauk and say yeah the only thing magical here is you friend pat pat on the cheek i wander back over to beauregard and i go to sleep again make a fu-manchu check you picked us specifically look at it this way one path we could take is that you are the mastermind who hired the right people for the job and everything is perfect the other path we talk about how we came in and fixed things you could not ja i think that’s a fair deal jester would you mind settling this debt for us your gold laura or your maternal bond you choose man don't i know it thank heavens for little blessings this could be our chance to find a good home for her you like these kids kiri ja you know you spend enough time with us-- beauregard and i here almost died tonight you're just a little girl you should be playing with these kids not playing with us what about you mom and dad in exchange--

give this girl some parents a what i tag along with beauregard hey beauregard that felt pretty good last night helping somebody do something good i get the sense that you have bigger plans than that even cobalt monk i get a sense well that's just semantics i have a feel about you you and change i don't think that you and i have the same plans but i think they might overlap i would be willing to help you how do you mean evil surely neither of us are evil beauregard yeah i like that i think i can help you i think you can help me i think we can do some good here marisha and i will do my best
