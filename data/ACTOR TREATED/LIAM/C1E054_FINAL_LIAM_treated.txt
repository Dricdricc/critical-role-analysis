it was already periscoped what's in the box ah you can sleep on the plane it's a good one though yeah i went to that one yeah sam riegel and i are both in fallout far harbor which is the first big dlc story dump fah hahbah fallout is my favorite way to escape reality second to this so i hope you come join me i play a human guy but there's also a synth look for the synth there you go that's it shoot from your screen then you got hit by a wang oh laura bailey standing in for an orc (stabbing sound) ugh gah now be yourself oh and i'll go oh why the dramatic pauses how much time do you need perce three hours ago back when we were still together i pulled scanlan aside listen i want to talk to you i have an idea you're right i should have never dragged you down into the sewers and i apologize it won't happen again but listen to me i have an idea it's a dangerous idea and i don't want to lead with it i don't want to fight this dragon to be honest but i think the group is going that direction if we do-- percival's run off to try something maybe we're just going to run out i have an idea that only you can do we have a rod not the cube a rod that cannot be moved you can teleport and i'm almost too afraid to even suggest it but if shit goes south how would you feel about teleporting inside of umbrasyl's stomach with that rod i assume it will i don't know anatomy i haven't talked to my sister about this she might be able to give us input and i don't want to lead with this i don't want you to do it because i feel like you could melt in there i know i'm looking for a way through this fucking clusterfuck and if there's nothing else to do you could go in there and click that rod and give him the worst suppository ever invented as a plan b and i take him by the shoulders you remember that little talk we had about a week ago when you told-- no we can talk about kaylie in a couple of days all right when you told me how things were better now okay you remember that that was fucking insane they are not better everything is terrible our lives are terrible they are way worse than they were six months ago way worse i was with all of you assholes a year ago and two years ago they're way worse i slap him on the cheek a little bit and say you are a fucking madman but i am glad you're here and i love you and i give him a playful slap across the face don't roll a one but you know you wouldn't suffer yes my armor she has it no i'm about five feet behind you rolling my eyes and doing this the whole time you're talking about dragons yeah it's better overall during which i pick up scanlan's shawm and start playing it terribly no idea what i'm doing do you blow into this are there strings i don't know yeah i leave the room you told me to leave you took off your clothes i'm liam i'm not vax what're you talking about oh shit i go running after percival i'm going to go find percival yeah well does that take an hour or do i catch up with him pretty quick oh there's that white hair percival yeah i'm sorry i don't want to take up a lot of your time i reckon you're going to be busy with this all day yeah ah and also tomorrow you're probably going to be taking potshots at that thing yeah that's probably not my plan can i have use of your blade it's just in case good luck today good luck tomorrow billy mays here for the ashari tribe there it is there it is it's in all our heads that was all knowledge in your head i was frozen in ice that guy the daughter six six six go tarv go tarv oh get him get him stupid tinkerer percival and his technology you found dabney coleman keyleth where are you right now my goodness gracious a what like claymation i'm going to track down the women after talking to them over the earring straight from percival once i catch sight of them can i talk to you for a minute just a minute i know you're busy um yeah two minutes two minutes um thanks stubbs you're way more powerful than i am and i don't know what i'm going to-- (skype noise) what's that sound you're going to be doing a lot more damage than i am tomorrow it's not like i'm going to run up and stab the thing in the back i feel like you're probably going to be too busy to be using fassbender-- i think i want to be of use so yeah so it just goes on the head then how does it work what do you what do i talk to it or do i think it or what do i do all right okay do i say like slow maybe i'll prac-- where did you park him oh great well i'll take that kiki what is that percy tinker quietly please (taliesin makes louder noises on skype) (laughter) okay really quickly hello yeah percival i'll talk to you in a minute all right ah i've been confused i am confused but and i take her by the hand in your room in your room me leaving wasn't-- --wasn't fair that's it i'm sorry this is awful all of it is awful really similar what yeah we gotta kill a dragon tomorrow we gotta kill a dragon what do you need i mean i'm really weak but i think i can use a shovel i walk fassbender out and i lay him down on his back face-up yeah i'm walking fassbender out to where keyleth is pulls the glyph up no it's hitting and slicing i'll check he's expendable hopefully he survives if not good cause okay yeah one to the ground put the other one in a goliath's hands with a harpoon or a hook on the other end snag our prey and then we have a fassbender hanging from the bottom of a dragon i think we should do ten or 15 feet to the ground of chain and ten or 15 feet to the dragon so that it's thunk and he's caught on the ground yeah yeah we'll sever the chains with grog's muscles we need to get 'em the right distance ten feet into the ground which we can-- but he's going to go up like a kite now because it's going 60 feet all the way over there where stone is with dirt fassbender lie down lie down give keyleth a very soft high-five please i quickly take that same charcoal out and i write in common on his chest conclave or bust (laughter) as soon as he finishes it i have a couple of questions one so i asked this outside but i just want to make sure it says in the rogue section that longsword is something that i'm proficient in but there's a rule somewhere that i can't find that says i can't use that for sneak attack on page 95 it says i'm proficient in longswords but somewhere else that i'm unaware of-- no surprise motherfucker so it's not a finesse weapon in hawaii the longsword is a finesse weapon just want to know in advance lovely i'm going to take off my boots of haste and my cloak see if anyone else wants it and i'm going to start attuning-- can you use this circlet would you be able to control fassbender no keyleth said you just say zap and he just does it until you tell him to stop i want to see how much i'm giving up here haste will let you double your speed you'll be able to do one more thing when you're doing things scanlan showed me some sort of potion it's funny because part of my idea was to go in with you but i know that you have to do it to folk of your own size but if i were little vax i could go with you that's true but i'm wondering if anyone wants fassbender if i'm going in i'm not going to be able to concentrate on that i know i just don't want to miss a shot to go into the belly of the beast with my little buddy here all right i'll wear it i'm going to take this sword and i'm going to leave the deathwalker's ward on that can't come off anymore and the circlet so the boots are up for borrowing and the displacer cloak is up for borrowing displacer cloak makes you very hard to hit and the haste will haste you you're wearing a cloak so if you wear the boots you can click them and you've got more movement and his wife just before i wait until everyone falls still and then i scrabble over to you are you awake yeah you're awake i don't know if it's the food you made or the fact that we're going to die tomorrow but i want to kiss you and i kiss her for a while good night she's a witch she's a witch did you see the broom scanlan where do you want to go are we going in a tree vax is with scanlan stuck like glue can bards inspire themselves disadvantage on attacking you until you get hit and then it's gone for the round but resets for the next round that's right she doesn't clank if she doesn't move come on meteorite die don't dick me matt colville this is on you hey can i use luck for initiative it's up to you you're the boss i love you you're the all-seeing eye (laughs) it was the exact same number big ten which if you think about it rounded is like 100 gosh plan b indeed you do you seven plus five is 12 we're not making out there's a slow trickle of wizz going down my leg right now man enjoy those boots don't piss him off question did we give the chain attached to fassbender to one of the goliaths to the stone but one has to go on the dragon i don't know oh no okay cool he's got it he's got a whole strategy he's street-smart this guy it's more of a surprising round if an ancient black dragon takes one hit point of damage it cowers and dies is this an attack range thing or does it automatically-- i'm going to hold my turn until scanlan no yeah i'm going to-- fassbender slow the fucking dragon down now oh dear god that's a good question i've got it slow-- 17 it is wisdom and fassbender just slow until the end of tomorrow just keep going question he'll just keep doing that until i tell him to stop right okay with my bonus action i drink that potion and i'm a tiny vax (high-pitched) do it scanlan do it (high-pitched) hey buddy i love ya let's go in that dragon's gut (high-pitched) do you think keyleth will think less of me yeah action bonus action done i'm like eight inches tall if that's true he's so small (high-pitched) these are still sharp (high-pitched) heeheehee just do what you're going to do ignore the gnome go we wanted to keep you off-balance matt here we go (high-pitched) come on big guy and i say this is so fuuuu-- can i give him my luck who's got the other gatestone i have one 60 seconds suck it bitch i'm a two-foot-tall rogue you motherfucker i'll say with no facetiousness this is all i ever wanted in my life that bullet came from the center of the pacific ocean here we go scanlan pull it off look at all those people well what did you do you did death ward and is that it you'll feel better once scanlan and i have dissolved i'm just going to take the dragon blade and i'm going to as best as i can drag it in front of me i'm going to cut the insides of this-- yes probably its sphincter now what at disadvantage well i'm using the dragon longsword which i've never used before it's a plus one sword so i get what with strength i just can't sneak attack all right so whatever you want to do you are the deity here so this is a 17 to hit use luck nothing we discussed it so much yeah it does plus 3d6 if i remember 15 from the inside hopefully that cuts me a little breathing room and a question that only you know matthew-- am i within five feet of scanlan i got 15 damage am i within i'd like to use my bonus action to sneak attack if i can if i'm within five feet if scanlan is within five feet of the creature that's up to you i don't know it's crazy circumstance the heartburn is not distracting it not enough okay yes i know i did it i did darling i only got 15 i would like to use the dagger to cut into him as well disadvantage oh that's no good that's nah it's 12 i'm okay okay all right i understand matthew i'm fucked it's fine also i have no idea what the initiative order is but fassbender keeps doing slow until i tell him to do something else right a d6 two click motherfucker click i don't know what the fuck's going on matt it's fine that's redundant taliesin yeah try it buddy internal damage that thing's fixed in space but you're resistant you don't know she might've rolled a 78 okay i'm going to use my bonus action to-- can i sneak attack this thing from inside i'm inside him that's very surprising probably not all right well i'm going to use my bonus action first to hit it it's at disadvantage okay so that is 19 which fucks up and now i'm going to use the dragon sword okay that's a 21 well i will for my turn suffocate and also fassbender should still be trying to recharge d6 four i would like to say that liam o'brien who's a total wuss-puss can hold his breath for like 50 seconds so vax and scanlan should be-- i'm still in its anus all part of the plan the hastily smushed-together plan eat some shit umbrasyl natural 20 (cheering) (laughs) okay i'll take it i just want to remind everyone i am really small i fit between muscles bones ligaments anything scanlan we're safe from all this shit i'm behind his left nipple it's pretty good already it's pretty good man remember when we used to do hopscotch that was the best and then also we used to take baths together when we were really little but that was when we were really little-- vex'ahlia-- i wrap my fingers around it shut the fuck up gnome you're 15 feet tall now grog you're like two feet tall now and it's really impressive that one hits damage that's a fuckin' missile you're attached to him by a chain he's scared work that broom girl yes i want to go keep going no it's on us because we have jobs and getting up in the morning you're leaving me in this thing's anus for two weeks yeah but i'm holding an arrow that's half in and out of the dragon so i've got a little tunnel out is it two thursdays from now yet son of a b matt if you were wondering what to get me for my birthday it's to kill my character in two weeks kill me the dragon's name is hope
