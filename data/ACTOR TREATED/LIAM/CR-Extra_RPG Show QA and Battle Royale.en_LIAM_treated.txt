got to kill a dragon we should all like bees really right next door to the chickens you bring it on yourself just saying that catchphrase that's where the questions are it's like an edward gorey poem my tabletop is high school which i don't remember too well and then our home game the show was far crazier than our home game was as fun as the home game was nothing as lunatic as the cow episode-- it's called outreach (laughter) um i think it would take a lot and i got a lot of static after vax punched percy a week later everyone's like like vax has any horse to stand on with what happened with his sister first of all that was what was running through my head as i punched percy none of you had to tell me about that that's what i was thinking about and if that hadn't happened i probably would have done more than punch him one time i probably would have went a little bit further but i would say on one hand vax thinks it's a little different because vax rushed in to try to save his sister not exactly the same situation but on the other hand you're kind of right he doesn't have any moral high ground and i'm not trying to play anyone on moral high ground and i thought do i have the right to do this probably not who cares we're all playing imperfect people you're going to get dicaprio'd (laughter bear grunting) you should stay in that mindset after the break i think the twins would have been doing mercenary work somewhere i want to do a one-off sometime that goes further than the goblin game i know what that character is for that game well you got the bird's-eye view matt i got one people all week-- all year really-- but a lot this week have been asking me-- and telling me-- asking me does vax have a death wish or saying that vax has a death wish you are free to think i have a death wish i don't have a death wish i don't want to roll a new character i love my character but i'm not going to play him like an accountant i'm going to rush in and try to save people and kill the motherfuckers who killed my parents my mother i don't have a father we'll get to that i don't have a death wish i do not want to stop playing my character he could die next week and i'll be bummed for a while but this is how i'm going to play him if i survive next week's game i will do something just as dumbfuck two to five episodes later so strap in that's what i'm doing the game can be different things for different people and if people want to treat it like a wow raid go for it have fun with that but if i had to be like okay how i can max out my opportunities here and my chance to get my devout-- that's not why i play i play to stick myself in epic books that i loved reading as a kid and sometimes characters die yeah someone else asked how long did it take to create your characters and i feel like it's still happening the first game was like yeah i'm a rogue we're twins cool okay what do i do i sneak around grog doesn't even know that he can do whatever the hell he wants great it's so loosey-goosey it's still ripening and sometimes we have one-on-one conversations with each other or in a group we feel like we're learning new things about the character-- every game-- or each other or ourselves even playing this game that was how you hooked her in vax has a-- wishing he could follow a bit in her footsteps or did and i don't want to get too much into that and obviously all this i didn't have any beef with you at any time in the past but now i don't trust you as far as i can throw you grog and vax never had any real digging at each other but it's a little dicier now they're okay but a little bit of-- i'm a cutter i've been cutting i'm vex matt marisha how long have we been playing this game for still a fun game sure you did there's a rule in the rulebook that says bend the rules whenever you want to bend the rules that's a rule so matt followed the rules personally one of my most insane moments because i've always told myself all right the twins vax is going to give himself up for his sister whenever he does it and in that split-second i was like here it is here we go i'm going to end my game i'm ending it laura's going to go on i'm out just like i planned and you went-- flipped it on me all my ideas for the future went (pfft) had to change everything i was thinking it was such a back-and-forth too because we were like okay here's what we're going to try to do shit it's working it's working we got this we got this and then it went (explosion) and flipped into 180 and we're like we're dead we're dead and then a hail mary pass at the last second ripping expectations back and forth i'm a ground fighter if i'd been on the ground i'd probably be goo in shoes i get asked frequently if i'm ever going to dm a one-shot for our show like when you're out of town theoretically like a year from now or more if you wanted to go to aruba or burning man or whatever maybe in a year or so but i'm playing with kids the kids have low expectations or no expectations i don't remember any of the rules seeing all of the quivering palm business and dragon fight business i'm not ready for that talk to me in a year but i do it at home it's great my kids love it so far well i think that vax has a little bit of self-loathing too i don't know people think that vax thinks he's a boy scout i don't and i don't think he does either for the backstory i was a thief for years i did shitty things and stole from people so he could get by i think he at this point in life feels like he's been a fuck-up and a waste of time most of his life and the only good thing he's had in his whole life is his relationship with his sister which is like one good true thing but everything else they're dead-enders well maybe maybe things are changing but that's what he was and then also he follows his heart now to a fault and that's what we love about them none of us are trying to be white as snow even those of us who think they mean the most good for the world we're all fuck-ups we're going to continue to fuck up you clever bastard laura says by text is the chat not working chat's working la hi are you guys on the other side of the planet now shifty eyes we're not deciding laws in the supreme court we're being doofuses 16 years old jaded (laughter) close calls are getting closer and closer together matt could you give us a list of the easiest encounters to the hardest or could you put a skull next to the super-hard ones like in fallout where you're not supposed to go near the bad guy because the skull is floating there i didn't want to fight it we need to go get some of these things and come back yeah i said it like 20 times also the whole cast is this-- we're all very ripened mature characters with lots of nuance and the first one will be like hey i'm a new bard where are my spells although when you play every week we used to play every six weeks so things were a little shallower at home and now there is a lot of lore matt somebody asked how you and i avoid awkwardness in real life after vax and keyleth moments we're pretty cool with it it's like an acting gig really not at all everyone crawled inside their own assholes when we had our-- that's right we were pioneers it was like that moment when you first get to prison and they put you on the wall and take the hose and bring it hey do you maybe want to go out sometime i kind of like you ow laura and/or travis i'll answer for travis (grog voice) what what that's pike or that's ashley you're saying you make sarenrae look really good on the outside oh man can we do a photoshoot with ashley with the sign for sarenrae (laughter) knew she'd be good at it though back in seven seconds actually hold that thought because i have a question that's not the same question it's not for me but it's related to that and that is who is pike in love with and i don't want an answer instead i'd ask the audience people who are asking questions like that or what's in the letter don't you think that's like asking while you're reading the first harry potter book why harry wasn't killed by his nemesis it's a book do you really want to know the last chapter when you're in the first chapter wouldn't you rather the story unfold in front of your eyes taliesin or percy what's in that letter i would much rather as an audience member who gets to sit on the set while we play the game see that come out in the story and have my mind blown rather than on twitter be like oh well it's this and this and this and this just enjoy the roller coaster i want to know at the right time it's 30 shit jokes isn't it i took a photo of it but i deleted it i could have read it but i didn't you just got cubed work on your sleight-of-hand technique i'll answer another quick vaxleth question which is what inspired it i think that all during the home game and even at the beginning of the game on the show vax had the same opinion of keyleth as his sister which was come on are you serious most of the time goody two-shoes really i don't remember what it was i promise i don't remember what it was but something happened in one game i remember thinking about it after the show and then talking to matt in the next day or two going like can you do this in dungeons & dragons like would this be okay would you be okay with it i'm not going to go anywhere with it but would that be okay that's where it came from and the reason i thought it would be fun for the game is the same reason i think why taliesin had percy give grog an evil sentient sword because it would make the game interesting it would totally shift the game pieces on the board and add new dynamics in unpredictable ways i'm not treating it like a dating sim where the end result for me playing d&d was winning the princess it's just to see how things could change in the next year of gameplay it's been done this way for a year let's see what happens if we move this over here and that over there ah whatever i'm having fun i would say part of the reason that i didn't want to fight umbrasyl most of it was because i didn't think we were ready but part of it is because i'm looking at this game like a game of fallout i want to go to the corners of the map i want to go to marquet i want to go to the bottom of the ocean i want to go to all of these places where the vestiges are are we really mainlining the quest really that's what we're doing what about all these side things that matt's got i want to be a completionist one of the other characters i would go keyleth because i want access to the broad range of magic and i've been so non-magic the entire time i don't know shit about magic i barely know anything yeah vax-- and side note before we go into this game vax is totally impressed with keyleth and thinks that she's the most powerful one in the group and is in awe of it and feels like a weak dingus basically in comparison to everybody to everybody that's fine not liam vax looks at everybody and is like oh my god look at you shining beacon of hope look at this crazy fucking motherfucker who can build stuff out of a tin can look at scanlan staring into the maw of horror and stupidly thinking everything's okay look at my sister who's not scared of anything i've seen the first three seasons of korra but not the early one okay i'll get there first appearance we were rolling laughing we didn't know what was coming there was so much panache he's also been one of the greatest pleasures for me for this game because it wasn't anything that i saw coming it was really funny and surprising the first time at home and then he came back several times and right from the first time that gilmore appeared he zeroed in on vax and was sweet on vax it was nervous laughter the first time and then slowly over time it got more charming and more charming up to the point where you guys have seen that probably vax is legitimately taken with him definitely intrigued by him charmed my-- almost charmed my pants off just before and then some people are like it should be vax and gilmore like i get it gilmore's a great character and vax was definitely taken with him we probably saw gilmore two to three weeks of the last three years maybe more i've traveled-- vax and keyleth though have been traveling together for years so i mean-- hey guys we're in hollywood we're all leftie communists we're good my primary character trait is heterosexuality and i mean as liam four oh this is a loot crate shirt it's from one of the last couple of boxes you can still get it it's alien-involved i'm going to answer a super quick one and then pass one on to matt that i want to hear the answer to why did the twins know abyssal we learned it in elf school like latin and then tukroll asks the vegetables of the virgins is such a cool story arc will you release the quest line after this yes (laughter) vestiges of divergence tuk means the vestiges of divergence are you going to drop that on the earth you know really i just wanted to read that tweet out send you that pocket universe to get inside of trinket totally trinket it's trinket that's the forbidden love good luck maybe your dm could create an all-powerful hobo lich who could murder them i feel like she doesn't know that but-- we're not going to clean this up afterwards we're going to cut it off right now colin dorrey @e_jeansegast asks speaking of gilmore is vax bisexual duh good question the raistlin level there's a fun one for me someone said what characters do your kids play would you ever introduce vax or vox machina into their quests i hadn't thought of that i'm going to do it thank you for the suggestion i started with my son who's nine he's with three boys and my son is a half-elf druid with a dragonborn fighter and a dragonborn rogue then my daughter got interested so i started doing a separate game with my daughter and my son where my son plays a dwarven wizard and my daughter plays an elven druid and then my daughter got into it so now i'm doing one with four girls where my daughter is a gnome rogue and there's a gnome cleric and there is a gnome druid and a human monk and i am up to my neck in dungeons and dragons lately thank you matthew mercer you're all learning a lot about ashley right now yeah i think you have to you know it's not real you know it's paper and dice a musical card on the flip side one of our home moments was amazing-- it's actually on my vine account-- which was keyleth walking up to a shambling mound was it a shambling mound a corrupt treant we were going to have to fight that thing and you went (blugh) and it went (groaning) and wandered off and we were all like (yelling) what you got under that blanket unless that is a hedge maze i am a dead man if that's a big room i'm gone can't read that stuff somebody asked-- here's a big question i didn't see it on there but somebody asked which character dying would have the biggest overall effect on the group never mind bad idea forget it what are the dimensions of the cube that's one by one i got mine ready to go using my cape of the mountebank for the first time to teleport to the other side of the glass and save everybody (clunk) oh fuck it was like my stomach just went-- thought it was the door opener nope that's all right it was a great moment whoops still alive for one more week death by a thousand cuts it's a lot of theater etiquette and improv it's like you're like i'm going to oh no they're having a moment and then you kind of forget it or the moment passes and you got to let it go right and what i was thinking was gilmore's over there and he's looking at this he's looking at this and i can't explain this vax and keyleth really like each other but this is them we entertain ourselves it's not appellate law the answer is not me [break] i'm using a luck right now (singing) i got you babe (laughter) 20 again four (laughter) holy crap okay with the assassin feature i have advantage now because i'm going first i'm going to throw a dagger right at percy's head am i within 60 feet this is our basic stuff even if i had it i'm not using that oh good that's a 29 (counting) 39 and this is the dagger of venom and i want him to roll versus poison how does that work automatically or does he have to succeed to do it yes 15 is the dc okay now quick question matt if i were to attack him three times in a row right the next two get no sneak attack i know that if i move to another target do they get sneak attack or no in this instance one time per round i click them now thanks buddy boots of haste laura has that piece of paper what's the lighting like in here there's the light from-- okay i'm going to use my action to go stealth that's action action bonus action you're saying the boots-- i don't think i have ever used a bonus action before when clicking the boots so we need to change things from here on out you've never called me on it in 50 games okay then with your permission i am going to use my-- i am going to throw another dagger i totally miss and i am going to let it go it was a one i am going to step past that wall there i can do it myself okay i'm hasted so i get double speed as soon as i'm there-- (whispering) is it going to fit any more holy cow how high is the ceiling so watch your head it's amazing how careful pvp is making us all be okay i'm from a hidden position right advantage obviously right and as soon as i go i'm giving away my position to everybody or to the person that i'm attacking or-- yeah should i just place him as soon as i attack okay i throw a dagger at keyleth doesn't matter i'm a sharpshooter so that's a 19 okay so here we go that's two plus (counting) 24 plus six is 30 then i will use my bonus action to hide can i okay so instead i'm going to go-- i don't know if this is slowing me but (counting) six can i attempt to now can i attempt to stealth from both of them i thought it was low light everywhere got it never mind hold on instead oh i have a backup idea can he see in dim light what's her line of sight she can see here obviously i'm going to use an action to hide where i am gosh how would this work i want to hide and then run past here if i'm stealthed successfully i'm invisible to percy by the time i get here and if i'm past the wall she's lost sight of me that's what i think that's what i'm going to try to do i'm going stealth that's great that is a 32 i'm using my bonus action to dash i'm going to real quiet tippy-toe in dim light i'm a 32 still stealthing tippy-toe i've just passed the wall i'm known as a scavenger (laughing) it's all i got i ain't got any hexes or bullets or bits of spells or help from the gods you'll never have sights on me could still easily die as soon as i go for it pops his head up he's getting shot oh my gosh okay great yeah no well it's fine it's where i was but i was going to just use-- and i'm here and then i throw a dagger that's the flame-tongue-- that hits that's a 25 and here we go again mm-hmm okay (counting) it's not that good another 30 total then i take one step this way which i think takes me out of her line of sight or do i need to go one more how about here all right i'm here and i'm going to use a bonus action and an action and use another action to go stealth good real good 29 isn't he covered by this what'd you get oh did he take that feat let's get dicey here okay can i have the miniature oh i have him right here sorry so i want to step right out here throw a sneak attack dagger right at percy here we go that is a 21 does that hit then i'm going to use my last luck oh okay all right that's fine i didn't know that i had to-- okay i'm going to use my bonus action to dash everyone sees me go (footsteps) and i'm going to go stealth there i like better telling you well ugh yes okay but i'm not done yet because i've still got quite a bit of movement left easy pickings on de rolo get him someone knows where i am come on drama now the whole group knows well once she starts smashing the ground there you'll have a good idea all of her attacks are at disadvantage because of my cloak well that was the first attack the two rolls with disadvantage what i'd like to do is take two steps back from the earth elemental you shut up let her do it for my first action i would like to open up a pouch in my belt and dump a bunch of metal marbles out towards the elemental underneath keep moving so they're all around her feet is the intention i'm going to use dash on my bonus action i'm going to move to here and this'll be up to the whim of the gods between this wall and all of this stuff i want to try to stealth right there not great i have one last luck yes same exact roll it's not my day all right it's okay i am at 25 stealth i'm not done with my movement not acrobatics can i parkour 19 it's okay it's all a dream fall still a square of marbles in front of you oh jeez okay i have advantage because of the boots dexterity 17 well i use evasion pass what what do i pass i didn't even move yet yes and vax reappears right here on the move and i am throwing a dagger right at percy's forehead 36 so what i'd like to do because i didn't even stop moving is use my bonus action to kinda dive this way and hide here right on top of percival's body so i'm going to roll for stealth okay and i'm going to run to-- hold on i'll tell you where i'm going to run to not moving remember all that time out on the ocean worrying about percy was he okay how is his soul sorry where'd you go buddy i'm around oh there he is i was sitting on percy evasion i get advantage because of the boots that is a 26 thanks for dropping earth elemental (high-pitched) what about the marbles (hissing) (gollum voice) nasty cleric advantage not good really bad 13 did i say what the armor was what did i set my armor to yes aw balls that could've been so accidentally good is the halved version of that she lost line of sight of me am i in this little nook still on percy's ashes looks like it now it gets interesting i'm going to take one step this way is this still burning i'm going to throw a regular non-sneak-attack dagger at pike terrible this is broken right this is gone is this wall here okay so what i want to do is use my movement to tuck in here press into the wall go stealth that's good that is 28 i'll tell you where i'm going i'm going to run to here can i ask a quick question when i put those marbles down it went (marbles rolling) right a non-rogue leaping over this we'd all hear that right unless they tried to make a stealth move understood tremor sense was good though percy was the fan favorite all day mine too (laughter) i would like to pop back into existence right here and throw a dagger-- i wouldn't have revealed myself if i had known that i thought she was five feet that way which would have changed everything that's everything that i've been working on for the last few minutes instead of that because this is gone right can i see her from here all right i'm going to materialize-- sure i have advantage 11 or 11 what is with me 21 through the ice through the snow i have sharpshooter so does-- 21 (counting) 33 i'm going to dance back use bonus action to hide it's a 27 and then my last action it's a 21 for why so many things not my strong suit 13 it's a wisdom-based thing is it a blade so no uncanny dodge for that and it's not a dexterity save so full hit you nudged her towards that corner mercer you nudged her towards that corner and there's no uncanny dodge because it's an area four tens will you allow me to go to here and then jason bourne behind these like a boss and go stealth right there oh i thought there was a gap i'm right here i'm gonna go stealth this is the sleet storm that i'm dexing 20 stealth is 27 is that where she was standing at the beginning of my turn then i want to do it here instead didn't she dispel it for the bugs 24 stealth and i will-- i haven't taken an action yet because that was a bonus disappeared into the bugs man in another life somewhere i'm very much in love with you but not this day what spells are going on right now ice storm's still happening has it already been ten rounds already why'd you give her that ring was this some sort of hunger games deal hi right at pike oh that's a natural one okay so-- i know i know is this out of sight here is this a solid wall okay i'm going to roll stealth there that's a 25 so i want to go-- dex save 24 is that an action like an effort for pike would waste an action yeah you're in a pickle (laughter) yeah is a 23 okay perception i rolled-- well here's the thing let me tell you this is in-tents what's the spell okay i'm telling you what i'm doing right now it's interesting okay forget that just this you know what i'm talking about right oh wow ah it's 1100 it's amazing this game is so depressing (whispering) aw dang it where i last was okay i know that is a 30 i think hold on you mean closing in okay so pike is in the little tunnel well i'm looking from my spot oh okay right i don't see her and i don't see keyleth okay so what i want to do-- --is use my action to do that and use my bonus to-- just a little so here oh gosh yeah aw that's a five she didn't lose any hit points oh it's an attack roll got it even though i stepped one in okay ohh one okay i'm going to materialize i'll have gone one two three four five to here i'm going to throw a dagger-- i haven't walked up to you but if it's ranged-- constitution i am doomed doomed doomed so it's on me right now to roll here we go ugh it's a big six big six oh i'm gone i'm out yeah still still going to get knocked out i'm down so what do i do and the death ward does nothing against that death save advantage all of that nothing so stupid rose so stupid rose that's totally on me i wasn't paying attention i heard you say blight and i should have stayed put that was my mistake guys it's a game amazing so much fun while matt flips what i was going to do before i forgot that was stab you in the back and then just wrench you down into the lava three take my sneak attack dice i want a fistfight at the end of this ow you hit me in the ear that necrotic stuff hurts huh brutal oh look this one's gloating already you've still got high ac got anything that can put her in the pool your biggest damage right there swim what does that penguin say slide hold on let me take my earrings off we're really more of a co-mingled milkshake we'll be together forever the monstah also when you cast that blight on me i had 14 hit points whatever number of hit points i had is what you hit me for by the way she texted me today going but i won't use that on you i promise (laughter) yeah no i knew that you were a liar liar but you also accidentally benefited from something we weren't supposed to at some point that was exhilarating i'm surprised no one went into the lava until the very very end too i feel like i would have lost momentum right away if i hadn't gone into stealth it got so dirty at the end so dirty and nasty my time was up even if the blight hadn't gotten me without haste i was going to start getting seen more often and i was low and you guys had plenty of frigging spells left at that point i would've been toast one day you guys will get the whole group thank you
