how is pike is your stomach closed do you need a moment do you need to speak to sarenrae typically scanlan is the oldest but i've been aged the most maybe i knew that this was coming i just thought i had more years until it happened yeah so-- it's probably a good idea you could do it tomorrow could you take care of my sister first pike give her the works eat it sword you're a good hunter though it's not really-- that sword is an asshole (high-pitched) what are the odds everybody roll for initiative roll him over roll him over grog yeah punch him across the face grog pike use those gauntlets break it where can we take him where can we take him can we take him to gilmore can we take him to-- who could we take him to could we tree to gilmore while that's going on i walk off 30 feet away and i fall to my knees on the ground facing away i know you are not what i want but you are what we need and i will put aside my reservations and serve you it is too soon for him we need him he is needed i will set aside my reservations and serve you please 15 i don't six i'm pulling out daggers and standing behind my sister grog grog let it go this has been something on the tip of our tongue for weeks let it go whatever that thing is it's fucked let it go what did you say scanlan what put it in the bag of holding and give the bag of holding to pike de rolo knew about this that's perfectly clear you knew about this too scanlan that's a great time for a joke that's a great time for a joke who owned the sword before you had it who find it on the ground it's very familiar that's right it belonged to the arch-vampire who we fucked up show of hands who here is uncomfortable with that piece of shit you have to choose between this group and that sword so what are we arguing about the sword just fucking killed you you dummy newark it was an island with child labor it's full-circle for keyleth i don't want to send it to the hells yes percival percy you are clever it doesn't mean you're always right we can camp here for the night we don't have to go anywhere all sad and tragic and with gravitas yeah keyleth (tiny voice) help meeee what do you say we camp here for the night everybody right in the cave you got a hard-on for adventure little man levitate would make her quiet yeah it was good times though pike in those gauntlets that was pretty cool sorry you know it's so new it's hard to remember-- here i come ol' wrinkly-nuts i am still older than you which means i get to tell you what to do and don't you forget it have fun doofus i know about gilmore yeah are you in a hurry to talk to dad maybe later no we do not need to talk to dad sore spot 30 why did it get so scary [break] oh dear fuck drez if we could figure out where kevdak is and drop in on that point yeah and handle kevdak before the rest of the city can descend upon us it's a gamble but so is everything we do well how honorable are your people if you fell kevdak or whatever the fuck his name is will the rest stand down i agree with that weirdest production of grease ever anyway kevdak's using a gift of the gods we have a gift of the gods and soon we will have many more well we probably want to set up shop for a while and wait for the dragons to come and leave and then strike so that we've got some time we use fake shithead grog sorry fake shitheadier grog to create a scene and run off and draw away some of the goliaths probably not kevdak and then you go in for the main event with a thinned-out herd that's very intelligent of you grog 30 22 yeah i can get that i don't know why but i can get that 39 27 fuck survival roll well i'm going to use luck because i slept yeah 18 do i sense anything around i'm going to stealth up to the body cut him down i shoulder him back to the group 20 25 35 let's all talk about repercussions and i lay him out they did not think the farmer killed horace these people were in a shit situation while i don't blame us entirely for this because of where they live now we must not do anything we're doing lightly there are many lives at stake not just reginald's let's just not flit about here let's take this seriously please scanlan can you make a fake stupid body can you make a scarecrow can any of us me reginald how much do your murderers know about us go ahead scanlan he broke it grog broke it yes yes i'll take him yes disadvantage oh it's all right though 35 just straight dexterity 17 better than what it was we're going to be fighting soon enough i think everyone should hide inside your love shack and my sister and i should wait here in the grass and watch and wait and when the dragon comes we alert you all i fart a lot kevdak you are wanted at the front gates can i read it do you want to go steady if yes check this box (whispers) secrets dick pics hand-drawn by quill it seems like a slim thread of hope but perhaps the underlings are not entirely satisfied with this arrangement just scooped one up yeah it's a long shot but you told me about those giants when you were with zahra and they turned we shouldn't rely on it no yep chicken please your buddy horace made it sound like it was easy street but i don't know if that's entirely accurate same same laura doesn't shit maybe you don't say anything (laughter) like dig dug i have a question for grog (crash in the background) we fought your father and he was dead what's the last thing the herd has heard of your father well i don't know how he got there but we saved you from your father and the dead guy deep underground so they lost him at some point what if instead of grog you appeared as grog's dad yes you do you fought him he was a rotting corpse in front of you trying to kill you make yourself look like that i'm not exactly sure what that would do taliesin and and kevdak would think that grog's father was serving him and he wouldn't feel pissy if he saw one grog do a magic trick and then the other grog sprang up and said fight me instead it would seem more real larry wow that's like george foreman iv this is george foreman liam and you know what would make you move pretty fast is a lady rogue with a flying broom maybe they'd think it was perspective fuckery like in the lord of the rings movies his dad is much better grog so grog's father's too big for you what about the undead severed head of grog's father floating about in the air with pike's boots saying nasty nasty nasty things at the herd could you pull him like a balloon you can't i thought you could do anything can it follow you about you could be a whole wyvern but you can't be a goliath do it scanlan do it no but my sister or i could go with you one of us ragdoll physics smart bell is bad he's in trouble we need to go in now by the way this one under her breath goes oh i don't like him he stole from me well maybe he needed it to save the world scanlan is drunken master
