words shave words in-- three-armed shirts are coming in 2016 can i just interject for a second only because i'm hot as hell i just want to thank @pupgames on twitter for making me this fabulous stealthy cloak i'm going to take it off in about two minutes because it's more t-shirt weather here in the studio so i'll just let everybody bask in the glow of my absence of light for two minutes and then i'm going to switch to t-shirt mode oh mazel tov well-earned you nerd i'm good well couple of things grog and i were keeping watch i forget one of us was on the first floor and one's on the second i'm just going to say that i was on the second for now because i can't remember it's probably wrong i'm going to take all daggers out of my blinkback belt except for the keen dagger and replace them with wooden stakes that i purchased and i'm going to spend an hour or so whatever it takes to-- i've got partial gloves on i'm going to take that symbol of sarenrae and i'm going to take as much time as it needs to sew it so that it is fixed firmly to the back of my right hand i tell grog that i'm going to go down below and check and i follow the path all the way down to find-- i think everyone else is down there i step over scanlan's head and i kneel down by keyleth and gently place a hand on her shoulder and say what do you need what can i get i got holy oil not water i got two i remember it it was two vials of holy oil i gave one to my sister and i have the other if you think it will help you take it do you need me to get water i'm going to go out into the street i'm going to find water yeah we all are percival do you want to come upstairs to the window and-- oh you're coming too all right you're my son let's go (laughter) i feel like we should probably bring a little more water than one bucket so we should spend a little bit of time doing that but maybe my sister and i can have a look around see if there's anything that we've missed outside do we trust anyone here percival we're on your turf so i'll follow your lead can i choose to hide instead of deceive yeah i'll hang a little bit back from them 26 wait a minute nope let me look i'm just going to move in ten feet ahead and see what i see that is a 23 for perception i hiss back at percy is this the way to your temple through here do we knock well all right and i look-- it is what i do this is an old old type of lock hold on there's no lock oh but i rolled a natural 20 does that help let me get through the door oh where's grog when you need him okay who's got a-- mine are all very small do you have a shortsword oh right i always forget don't fuse with a church pew more of a sneeze (muffled) scanlan open the door all right scanlan step back from the door a couple of paces i'm going to stick a blade through the door i'm going to hold on one side you're going to hold on the other and we'll do it together percy can i borrow your blade it's all we need scanlan grab some rags or something wrap it around the blade you're going to lift on your side we're going to lift on this side i can't get the handle through the crack in the door got that bigby's hand is that what you're saying all right can we lift it together bigby's hand bigby's hand whip out the purple hand man wait scanlan are there any windows in there hold on this is stupid which way to the window i can walk to the window i can probably lift that door bar from inside with your help son let's save that for important stuff all right where is the window which way do i go yeah i'll attempt to leap all right 25 builds character i'm going to stay away from the altar and skirt the wall all the way around it mat okay you get to the door whip out the hand come on what's the matter they're trying to copy your work for war yes going with are there any untouched i'll snag those 20 stepping back into the darkest shadows i can see 32 stealth i'm throwing a dagger right now it's a banshee man there's siouxsie and the banshees they're all right he means well okay okay natural 20 for initiative as well 17 no doesn't stack so do i get to attack and then move into the combat round where i got a natural 20 plus five for initiative so there's no sneak attack damage on this thing is there all right 15 so this is a 26 to hit okay and this gets the sneak attack damage all right here we go but it's not a critical hit from assassinate because-- it's not surprised all right so that's a four plus seven is 11 plus 15 19 20 24 26 28 i'm just going to keen dagger it three times in a row oh i've got to roll to attack so that is a twelve plus-- 22 okay two and that is six of damage and then natural 20 on that one that is three four three plus seven is ten so 20 for that if it's doubled for a critical hit oh all right so six plus-- 13 you know what just to be fair i changed out all my daggers except for one so i probably couldn't throw the same dagger three times in a row so i think should pull back some of the modifiers so i would pull out four because my dagger is plus two so the plus two for two of those hits gets taken out right so four minus four i threw one dagger and two wooden stakes first was the dagger yeah even though they came out of the belt all right it's okay it's just wood what 16 in a little bit without percy all right so where is it i'm just going to back away from it about three steps while i pull flametongue dagger out of my cloak yeah oh that oh okay no so i'm going to walk thanks i'm going to slide up the wall along where scanlan is towards scanlan and another thing i realized i haven't clicked my boots of haste so i wouldn't have been able to do whoosh whoosh whoosh anyway and i'm still not going to but i'm pulling out my flametongue dagger and now i'm throwing keen dagger flametongue first one is 26 and the second one is 23 okay first attack gets 11 and the second attack gets eight i'm going to without doing any dash or anything because i can't i'm going to move as far as i can just going kitty-corner behind scanlan walking along the wall absolutely yeah that's as far as i can get that's good it starts over no we should kill this thing we're not going to be able to run this thing flew in here on the breeze fingers going out the windows of the church like alice in wonderland they look like diamonds you crushed it lift yourself up for a victory lap no i've got four healing potions i pour it's not the best it's a greater healing we don't know but i poured the potion into percy's mouth i slap him twice anyway what do we do the priest's dead is there anyone else or should we head back no while they check the room i'm going to go all over the altar and see if there's anything any hidden door any trapdoor anything like that eh that's a-- oh no wait i keep forgetting that's a rogue skill that's a 20 i take my dagger and i go to the altar-- i didn't say i'm leaving it yeah you want that i start-- would you hand me that scrap of paper yeah so i start carving this-- is this pelor okay so i just start scraping it into the stone with the keen dagger and then before we go i'm going to the wooden door and i carve into the door pelor lives in whitestone it's wood it took me five minutes i also grab those wooden stakes off the ground i grab a couple extra as well 23 my name's reggie bucket of water i'll take first watch 20 see you in 17 [break] damn damn (singing) look at the sun tree but he's indoors with us right do you know which one he lives in shit that is ripe we're leaving that's an improvement that's nice how collapsed is it i'll go in with her yeah the eyes they never go in the same direction one's always to the left and one to the right 13 13 and you went from focusing on kerrion to kicking in doors you know someone there what is there in the way of guards out in the open now and those giants strolling about are we within eyeshot of that thing right now is there anyone our size any humanoid guards around nothing i'm guessing the best time to sneak into any of these places is during the day lady's chambers anyone it's full of prostitutes grog full what did you roll scanlan's forte come on sam riegel ladies and gentleman he played gavroche in les mis gavroche right here gavroche act cool everybody act cool who are you to talk crazy eyes well i'm 27 but i don't know how old she is low key it's been washed away with the rain we're going straight there as we walk up i'd like to trail back by grog in the rain the killing's going to start soon it's not going to stop we're going to protect them all of them (laughter) all right i got them all how dark is it i'm looking specifically for ways in the building other than the front door 20 there's nothing between us and the building if you roll a two you can get hurt where are the guards in the front inside the gate at the house we still have to go over and in grog can you bend that shit open yeah well if grog can frigging make a hole in there-- that's a hangnail on his pinky toe yeah sure well we're all just walking very quietly 34 i'm going straight to the cellar door i give it a little (clunk) to see what i feel i get to work did what i already did it earlier when you weren't here 14 that's 27 i lean my head in really fast and just see if i can hear anything and roll a one no i said it's good it's good let's go right you agree we're never wrong i pull out my flametongue dagger my ears are bigger than yours let me have a listen get down definitely look at them i don't hear anything either i think we should just bust in i keep forgetting the rogue skill so really i rolled a 20 for perception i can no longer roll lower than ten unless i roll a one but if it's a two or nine it's actually a ten for me is that one person the old guy the balding guy he's just reporting in he's his frigging money collector not directly above all right there's nobody right above us but there's people in the house no they're on another floor or in another room no we didn't send anyone i just-- scanlan you or me you want to go invisible or do you want me to creep in zombie guards aren't going to-- giants are stupid they're stupid i mean there are the guys out front i'll go up and see what i see just above us not far away i'm good on that not dexterity constitution i'm feeling a little weak i'm pretty dex-y already i'm going to check and see if it gives at all or if there's anything to it it gives all right so i'm going to go up no stealthing up all right so okay hold on i get advantage 23 oh 33 i am listening intently and feeling through as many pockets as i can find around me can i make anything out through there i'd like to-- everybody hold i just want to wait for one minute and see what progresses while they're talking i say we've got two gentlemen up here i think it's time to start killing send up the goliath oh it went closet to music room dart my eyes around is there anything that's useful in here which way are the voices coming from oh between the two so it is out door hallway so we're stealthing right so i pull both of their hands and i say-- grog and keyleth i start pulling them through-- that's all right out the door along the hallway towards the voices too bad one's going that way and the other's going that way i put my hand up in the air and i click my boots together (click) feel that adrenaline rush and i kick the door as hard as i can and go right in marisha taliesin and it's kiefer sutherland 13 half-elves what are you guys talking about kill him us too is it up to us go i am running straight towards what's-his-name kerrion is at the desk so i just run right towards the desk i step against the desk leap up in the air and go (stabbing sound) into his shoulders yeah no i'm on the desk in front of him going for his chest first and i get advantage on everything is a-- it's a 30 and this is surprise attack so it's a critical hit plus the sneak attack damage this guy is going down one plus seven is eight-- what gets doubled just the dice but not the sneak attack damage okay so that was-- okay two plus seven is nine nine ten 11 12 18 23 29 33 66 for the first attack darling 66 here comes the second dagger into him at advantage is 28 so that obviously hits and that is seven and then the third dagger comes down is 29 and that also hits so i've shanked his ass that's an eight (stabbing noises) i give him a vex wink can i ask a technical question according to assassinate any hit i score against a creature that is surprised is a critical hit any hit so are the two subsequent attacks-- that's sneak attack this says in addition any hit you score against a creature that is surprised is a critical hit okay okay got it well i thought they were like 03 seconds apart so i thought it was so fast double the last two attacks which were much less gunslinger warlock okay i'll use uncanny dodge for the first one that hits no yeah uncanny dodge on that attack so four that's nothing all right i throw a dagger in his face that is a 28 that is eight points of damage yeah do a bank shot off the ceiling i saw that spark in the air and i start knifing right into it so hearing him go (grunts) and seeing a spark right in front of me i start knifing at that point disadvantage but i get advantage so it cancels out oh no i don't i'm sorry the first one misses that was it so the first two were terrible that's terrible that's also terrible i whiff i just (whooshing) still bleeding yeah i'm going to stay there i back up is keyleth on the desk and i'm on the desk no i'll stay where i am the guy you charmed happy halloween folks i walk towards the door i take a rag out of my pocket and i roll it up and i shove it into kerrion's mouth while grog is tying him up i thought he
