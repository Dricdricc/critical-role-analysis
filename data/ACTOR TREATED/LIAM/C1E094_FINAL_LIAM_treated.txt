away that's right and also don't need to party or anything but three cheers to you you just survived hell and back yes percy pass the bottle this is out of character yes we should yes we should it was a funny moment in time when you met us taryon we had a bit of a list we've had a couple lists and we've checked an awful lot off of them and we're real tired we're thinking of taking it easy for a bit tinker design-- it's true also we feel very badly about doty obviously and i hope that you can build a replacement but in all the years that you were with him did you ever have a sweetheart or an acquaintance even i mean if you can push yourself to go to the nine hells you can go out to a tavern with us and meet people do you-- this is forward do you go rogue or ranger or-- taco or hot dog or-- we've got to teach you some slang buddy you've got to learn some slang maybe we could get to that tomorrow can i insight him to see if this is bullshit or legitimate tears i'm outta luck too hold on hold on oh it's terrible five but then tell the number where's my money taryon wait wait wait vex or vax i was also curious if the tears felt like crocodile tears or-- yeah yeah were you really like-- right so it's bullshit absolutely but in this moment a little bullshitty we can talk about this tomorrow let's just go get him drunk he'll probably tell you if he's drunk i'm sorry you're right
