it's kind of there (groans) did i lose the big or the small clears that athlete's foot though gone percy i think you and i are on tiberius duty 15 i have a question if i have advantage for other reasons-- i have a cloak of elvenkind which gives me advantage-- does the advantage and disadvantage cancel out into one right 25 and what's the terrain is it just flat out out in the open to see or is it scoured with ins and outs peaks and valleys it's fine it's an illusion vax pokes his head through the illusionary lava and goes we're in here here's another option my foot hurts but i'm not too bad how are you we could go look we need to undo the stone that has taken over tiberius and kima where did your kin take our big friend easy easy you honestly would not be here if it weren't for the illithid it's true she disappeared with our goliath friend yes you did but that was just 30 minutes ago i think we should all rest for a moment i think vex'ahlia and i should go out for an hour or two just to see which direction-- i mean they are not going to back to emon i was pretty awesome 30 minutes ago now i'm just slightly less awesome like axe for men more like a shadowcat kind of thing well that does sound useful but concretely right now we need nappies but we are essentially powerless i think it is safe to assume she's brought grog back to her seat of power why would she go anywhere else she's at her strongest where she is sleep one last thing before we lay our heads down for the night pike do you have any salve or anything you could help me put on my foot or could your god help with my little toe it stings a bit i mean a clockwork foot from percy does sound cool literally that's ben-gay all that improv school paid off (all laugh) can i apply my luck feat to her i think i see pike's deity in my toenail (all laugh) and put a knife on it i would take a brass claw lady kima clarota may i suggest you take the first watch rated m for mature we're busted up she's suffering from ptsd why are you poking the badger scanlan i'm very cold (all laugh) that's a good idea come here trinky trink who wants nibbles this is suddenly turning into labyrinth beyond the goblin city trinket's doing that thing where he pulls with his front feet and drags with his behind this will greatly enhance your ability to move forward with us won't it maybe on the way out plus ten 33 oh trinket rolled a one foot flakes anyone foot flakes with the stalagmite coming up yes meaning it's all solid stone that color or loose gravel and rock vex'ahlia you know the underdark are there any critters crawling around in that pit can we see any sort of civilized construction here or is this all the work of nature or some living thing 18 like goliath that still might be useful even if it doesn't find grog could you describe the dimensions of this one more time so from our left to our right 150 feet and is it a big circular shape i say we take a wall we're seeing the remains of buildings scattered throughout maybe we could go from-- well there's little islands of structure left we could just-- stand bridge stand bridge stand bridge vax starts feeling along one side of the wall does the ground look firm and more stable on the edges or is it all just the same hand on the wall no but i mean-- yes i'm not stepping out yet i'm looking at the ground is it pebbles and rock all the way to the sides is it 200 trinket weighs a ton all of us together haven't you seen his wang flopping around under his tail well i'm not going to leave her sneak right in there how far is the closest little island of remaining structure that you referenced the gods reward deeds not words want to run those numbers again for the calculator keyleth take the gnomes take the gnomes daggers out i grab him by the cloak what is it what is it keyleth's the only one who sees it though at this moment yes the twins pull him up and one-- liam and and we saw the duergar get pulled under by skeletal arms yeah the bones pulled down right so it's not just this thing 17 i don't need this foot okay no there's undead things in there tibber-hoods 17 all right well i use my bonus action to click my boots of haste together boot of haste but aren't magic items resistant to-- okay yeah start sneak attack from behind 32 for the first attack so no one's right next to it i'm the closest one you block me every chance you get with this one so that was the first attack so first attack is nine there's more coming here comes the poison dagger which is 23 that is ten because of the boots of haste i get a third attack and that misses entirely in fact i think i threw my dagger into the bones a one yeah it's 15 you're in the wrong group to being saying that shit man (all laugh) right you're a bullet falling from the sky you're gnomic lawn art you're further than five feet away because had you been five feet away i could have sneak attacked spirit her on with anger good job attacking before it goes 27 11 that's telekinesis kyle (all laugh) i'm still hasted so i'm going to use a bonus action to go stealth what oh it's blinded but do i still need that to sneak attack though or does it matter never mind i'm running at it and since kima's right there i'm going to stab the bejesus out of it i'm going to use luck on that roll okay great so that is a 29 okay (incoherent mumbling) so 19 goes to 38 and then the damage gets added to that right with the sneak attack and the damage gets doubled-- the bonus at the end okay all right so what that is is 47 okay and then with that knife in i'm going to stick the other knife in and attempt to attack it and then drag it to the ground grapple it to the ground with my body as i attack second attack is a 25 okay that's seven i'll grapple okay 20 natural 20 (all cheer) with haste i have a third attack i'm going to drag across its throat that is a 25 and that's seven it's mostly in our favor i giggle-snort you can add that to your roll so add inspiration it's advantage so pick the higher oh oh oh it's got that healing factor ain't he grappled i'm holding it good luck do i get advantage on this okay good 27 here comes the one if it hits it could miss you could do a regular arrow three successes or three fails that's first fail okay so clarota's right by it so i'm going to roll along the back of the thing and sneak attack right into its back right there yeah roll around next to him one dagger in that is a 29 (counts quietly) okay that is 33 plus sneak attack damage so three seven shit 18 20 that's 40 plus four 44 51 i want to carve his shoulder blade out and away like a piece of turkey-- no critical's the double oh sorry scale that back to-- 20 it was 20 plus two 22 29 next dagger's out that was a bad roll but i'm going to use one of my lucks to do that again that hits that's 27 so that is seven points of damage last dagger out that's 26 for eight points of damage this is really awkward for the rest of us just so you know we really like her i love it (all laugh) it's scared of her they're cursed air guitar us out of here and you said it's flickering the light probably a campfire i'll go take a look 25 everyone rest while i go peek because i'm fine disadvantage but the cloak then cancels it out so 25 does it smell good into my earring (whispers) come now we found him double-edged i do not is it a pony suit is it spider gwen what's she wearing
