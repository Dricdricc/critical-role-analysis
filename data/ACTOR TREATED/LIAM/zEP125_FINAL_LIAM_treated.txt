every time you open your mouth that wide an entire new universe is born (laughter) oh man vax'ildan vessar here from the afterlife you know most of the time i sit here in a big black room wondering where the fuck i am or what's going to happen next probably nothing but once in a while the raven queen hands me a sheet of paper to help promote projects and this week it is far cry 5 (clears throat) i got this four minutes ago far cry 5 is available on march 27th on ps4 xbox one and pc go to farcrycom-- we don't have any computers here-- to learn more and pick up a copy the latest installment of far cry is set in fictional hope county montana where a fanatical doomsday cult known as the project at eden's gate has taken control you are the hero of the story in a thrilling world that hits back with every punch and where the places you discover and the locals you ally with will shape your story in ways you'll never see coming also in celebration of the upcoming release nerdist's dan casey kyle hill and geek & sundry's own erika ishii are filming a special far cry 5 training video where they took on challenges players will face in-game shooting car drifting dog training and more go to nerdistcom or youtubecom/nerdist to check it out and tell them critical role sent you send me some comic books because i'm really bored here the story looks dark that is true very true yeah or a higher faced die like an eight-sider or a 12-sider it is executive we're just getting over being sick no cruises i mean it is not totally unheard of the legends in history are full of stories of the gods dabbling with mortals i don't know what happened for you today but-- it is not common but it does happen hello guy it would take quite a while longer i think it's too early for you to have checked today also sometimes people steal your mail you can get robbed on the road shit happens i was not able to accompany her to the pillow trove sam and because i am shabby shabbily dressed you know i was thinking on the walk back here that i would probably like to get a cloak of some kind i know where everything is in every pocket of this coat it has been with me through a lot what i will probably just get a cloak i'm not bothered it seems like maybe-- sam and you know water is not very hard to come by so i can-- that's what i'm saying is the sewer first because you are all going to be dirty like me also i don't think that's the main issue they're very strict at the gate for who gets in and some of us might not have a problem but more than one of us might it seems more like you are hung up on it than i am that's why i want to pay for a cloak are we going to-- (laughter) two things one fjord will you pass me these cookies over here thank you second of all are we going to try to tackle this sewer this evening or is this something that we're going to do tomorrow yeah oh i'm not opposed to going down there i just mean are we waiting until cover of night or are we doing this-- no no you've been bad yeah that's also dim light though as well it's not super bright unless i-- this game is amazing i would like to keep my eye out for a decent clothing shop that is 11 i would like to get something that is brown muted nothing gaudy probably don't have that anyway i'll take the brown one yeah it's 50 gold okay i have that of course i can do that i ask for the largest size they have and i get a woolen cap as well yeah okay i have that ruin are there any clowns in it that is a-- why i'm looking it up-- a ten any sounds going on in there you have to think about it for a while the boulder from raiders do you want nott down there it's what you do you're very good that's a nintendo controller go further away from people everything's going to be fine jester were we told that there was some sort of webbing i see any of that as we go 19 know how much diarrhea blasting they did in the middle ages (groaning) that's all that's in the haversack blockages hey i'm at the back vier from breaking open is the torch in your punching hand eight i would like to start backing up towards in this direction towards nott away oh no i would use a caleb bonus action to dry heave and then i will use my action to cast fire bolt towards the rat by yasha ja (groans) that it is a-- oh no that's okay it's a 13 ja d10 it's five hit points of damage everyone's catching their disease here before we move i am standing with two flickering calebs next to me and all three of us look at molly like jim from the office and they go away (laughter) what were you down to yeah that's my max yeah i'm sitting at 14 yeah that's your job ah you know i've been worse it's okay i'm okay if who hits me very hard if she hits me very hard i am a dead man if she hits me very hard i'm probably okay i know that's just-- you know it's just a-- you have a monster on your chest generally are you asking me right now no because i am with all of you and those were just mice the rats are not making webbing there's something else it's probably a giant spider well i would theorize that perhaps their diet is 20% food and 80% diarrhea so it's not very surprising that they explode into fecal matter you could just say nine no they had pinkeye in all their parts you're coming back after a break 16 marisha and i have read a lot of books lots of them have i ever read anything about the science of larger insectoid creatures okay but it's not familiar to me like youtubers if we kill the beasts that are down here then it might be worthwhile to also check the bodies of the guards you know because they're not going back to the to their families you following me well they're not going to use it just a suggestion we don't have to do this i'm not even sure how i feel about it but i have just learned how to create a somewhat spectral servant to me one that is unseen i could send it in to poke about and if anything is going to happen it could happen to it first instead of us yeah it could poke at things and you know yeah if you burn its web it will do the same thing i think that's actually a very good idea okay also i will say that you were worried about burning their dead bodies but if we burn the dead bodies they might burn we're not going to help them but if any coin have or any items that are magical in nature will be fine so it's okay yeah that's possible this thing that i can do this servant that i can make it's not going to be able to open these things it's very weak that's true i pull a stick out of my coat and i hold it between thumb and pinky like this and there's a string wrapped around it and i take my fingers and i pull along the string which begins to glow a faint gold glow and a being same height and about same skinny-ass proportions as myself appears before me it doesn't appear you tell me because you're the dungeon master well the rats have already started so schmidt i want you to go to these larger bundles and give them a little pokey-poo i have to stay within 60 feet of schmidt (whispers) schmidt bring me the bracer what what did you say i did not understand your accent shh yeah we all wonder that well not moving i can do it from a distance yeah i would like to stand behind everybody i can do this from 120 feet away once every six seconds i'm going to use fire bolt i would go (whoosh whoosh) and hit them both just as a test to the one on the right i do it again okay well he's dead should i just keep chipping away well this is every six seconds so i could just stand here for a minute going (whoosh whoosh whoosh) and not get close so i guess i'll take the next 30 or 40 seconds if that's what it takes i'll focus on one and just keep burning it away (singing) we are the worst we are the worst caleb stands still for a second and looks around do i hear anything oh in my sleeve oh that's a one so i don't hear anything jester put it on the ground and take ten steps back away from it (whoosh) if we deem it safe maybe someone could look out this other exit because probably something is down here with us but mayhaps above the grate this thing lives in a house perhaps i don't know i'm spitballing that is also good that is two reasons to do it is jester right up with the halfling i am going to walk up to jester and stand next to her and then i am going to send schmidt forward to this halfling to try to maybe lift up his its i can't tell you the chin of this halfling well if i can't see-- oh well okay well i would say if i can't see if i knew i can't see if i were really in this place instead of sitting as this table if i couldn't see coming up i would go (poofing) and send out dancing lights there you go while this death is happening caleb is schmidt go like this to the halfling caleb's going hey guy hey hey hey 15 f√ºnfzehn can i get either inside or behind that crate that's in the corner with difficult terrain okay for an action i am going to cast the blur spell on myself again und i will use my bonus action to have schmidt come i'm assuming he's not affected by webs well then i will summon him to stand above me on the box there you go freemasons he's actually a half orc i mean beau is pretty fucking amazing in combat it's like an airplane healing word maybe okay i can see a straight line from the spider to me so i think-- yeah okay all right i'm going to use my movement to crawl out of the box so i can get a better bead on it hopefully i'll go as far forward and to the side as i can to get a better angle okay so i am going to steady my arm against the other arm and point at it and blacken my hand and send a fire bolt at it here it goes we'll see if it hits probably not no i don't think it does that is a 11 then before the end of my turn i'm going to (snapping) and schmidt silently comes up as close as he can get next to me ja aw man that's that fjord edge right there schmidt it's schmidt yasha is a heavy metal album that's pretty dope yeah spider's an asshole we're all still figuring it out because sightlines are a problem here i would like to move to dead center where jester just was actually so i have a clear sight on the chamber behind me and ahead of me yeah i can see everywhere more or less in here i pull the diamond out from my coat and get ready and i hold as soon as i see the spider i'm going to release chromatic orb it's about 90 feet i prepped acid on this thing and i missed bad i got a total of nine so that did not hit yeah no just nine worth the risk that's exciting raid put him in a mocking bag molly actually since i see that jester has this covered i'm going to start burning out the dead people and rooting through their pockets and stuff that's good oh man full of lessons for america today i'm only burning the dead ones (fire billowing) thed is dead baby it's a nickelback tattoo (laughter) caleb is blithely burning over here and has no idea what's going on behind him of course i am i'm waiting for the dm to fill in the blanks that's five bodies i don't know if i got them all but are there any coin purses as well yeah i will quietly gather that up and put it into my bag am i able to carry that i don't even know okay 85-- what was it sam and yeah 85 gold i am not telling you that i found that at all you know i'm looking but you don't know what i found sorry because everyone is so lovely can you tell me-- 85 okay i don't give a fuck what vex did vex is retired in whitestone right now she's not here i'm clearly lawful good clearly yes yes there was a bunch of weapons and armor we should reconnoiter to look at what we have throwback jester will you come look at my eyes they feel a little bloodshot i'm not feeling well after my encounter with the rats wait come over here come over here i walk away from the group i don't know if she follows me or not there was gold in there i would like you to have it it's more than i had before here is 100 gold were on those people so you take it because i know that you need money i know that you need money and i'm very you know look at this and i do a little joke that's sad and funny at the same time you carry the gold because i can't carry it all that's fine well that's why you wanted money i assume from your mother was to help us out in the position we're in yeah so you take this you're a better you know i'm always thinking about things and i'm not very good with amounts and money so you carry it you know i just had a really bad day today that's all it was i guess i'm sorry as well no that was i'm fine i'm going to stare at the wall because i don't know how to deal with attention very well i am definitely not looking you in the eye nothing from me what time of the day is it but what time of the day is it because i know very very close to what time it is i know sundown sunup what time does the sun set does it look dark of course i am that's the feat i took it's siri does it look like stores are open that's all i'm asking let's go to this room party you are talking about also nott mask up for sure yeah for sure maybe earmuffs it's very cold that did not work very well for me several hours ago i think maybe you want to use tangible things here use the earmuffs use the hat use the mask you also have a hood so it's nighttime with the hood up in the dark yeah yeah we're not supposed to be here i have a hood on yeah on the way there too i also turn to one of these guards and say excuse me could you point me where we are right now which way to the nestled nook from here you've heard of this bookstore you don't have to pretend with me it's fine thank you you know i grew up with this language side note i did not come in this building i'm hanging back and giving identify a whirl on what's in my bag that other armor outside as a ritual it's 11 minutes it's not so much restive as active the bag's closed you don't see shit i heard you coming you're loud you're a lot and that's liam to marisha campaign three next week what's the plan now to go to this place no we are going to the pillow house ja the pillow trove the pillow place also as long as we're in here-- i couldn't get in earlier but we're here now-- there is a stop i wanted you to go with me where are we now that's a bummer that's up to him not me liam is very different than caleb hm no i remember everything that happens in the last month i don't caleb does i have a clippy i have a magic clippy time of day i know that's part of the feat i know the hour of the day i am so cheating by following the rules in the book on the stroll fjord i want to talk to you about how that went back there can we walk alone for a minute let's drag back two things one is i didn't bring it up even though maybe beauregard knows but i found something in there that i think is up your alley i found some armor beyond just crownsguard armor down there i mean listen my friend you spit out salt water you've got a sword that's covered in fucking anemones and shit this armor is like the little mermaid armor it's all for you i found it but i would like to trade it for you yeah you have that glove and i know i handed it over willingly just yesterday but i have a checkered past and an interesting history with flame fire there's no real reason you'd be very good with that glove but i feel like i would like to have that glove and i would love for you to have this armor i took a look at it while you guys were inside and it would allow you to move freely in the ocean or in rivers or lakes underwater and keep you safe in water i don't trust you yet i don't trust any of these people yet except for-- no i don't trust any of these people yet ja i've made mistakes in my life i've harmed people not in a long time you know i thought i was going to be something someday a long time ago and now i don't oh god ask me again in a couple of days i will prepare an answer that is better than this for you i promise thank you thank you no you've go to go higher oh hi you want to be part of the bro moment or a beau moment i thought you were i thought you'd walked up we went to the bathhouse to get clean by the way part of the reason i didn't wash up at the leaky tap is because in medieval times they didn't have baths i thought this isn't the sheraton they don't have a bath i was under the assumption that you had to be de rolo level to have a bath in your house more of a voyeuristic position that we're talking about here you kept your eyes wide shut is what you're saying if the money's right and if it's not stupid is a good philosophy for this group we can have my cat tomorrow to link the two groups oh boy he got kicked to shit today well you know it's hazy because he's never really kicked to death he's just kicked off of the material plane i'm not going to lie it does hurt when he's gone but i always know he can come back if i have the coin it's a little funny frumpkin has a good sense of humor about it exactly who kicks a fucking cat exactly is my point you can do a lot of things and have a very bad day but who kicks a cat oh he had such a face i will never forget this face (laughter) maybe i mean you might as well be at home picking the wings off flies you kick a cat what is wrong with you and in new jersey on second thought who am i to judge it's fine you know frumpkin will be back tomorrow morning because i am going to stay up late and do what i have to do but aren't we going to have a rager tonight at this place in the fancy part of town but really nice you said you paid for it you know you don't want it to go to waste there's probably a very nice sitting room or tavern or something underneath this place it's a shame to let it go to waste (singing) bar wars nothing but bar wars that guy is socially awkward this is fight club really show me your tats how big is this place let's play for another six hours i don't want to stop charlie the dog that's not a surprise sam has deep a cappella roots you all know that what's the address though
