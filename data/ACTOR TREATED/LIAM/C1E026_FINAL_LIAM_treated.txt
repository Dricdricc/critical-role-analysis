between 100 and 400 is when we're doing stuff yes this is the final chance for y'all to jump on joe madureira's kickstarter battle chasers nightwar they have absolutely killed their kickstarter they hit their goal their initial goal about two or three days in and they have been hitting every single stretch goal they've had they've got one last mystery stretch goal left to hit so it's a good time to get in and just get them to the very tippy tippy top of their campaign which is about to end if you guys don't know really quick because i've been talking about it for two weeks joe madureira amazing comic book legend has drawn everything it looks like nobody else's and has a good history in game dev as well created darksiders with his company vigil games that he helped found and now he has founded airship syndicate and they're making an rpg in the style of jrpgs that you've loved in your lives but also with joe's ridonkulous art style so go get on it hey everybody that robe just takes it to a whole new level i'm somewhat entranced let him get it out of his system steampunk i worry too but he did lose his entire family i am assuming but he lost his entire family to those people it's a fair point we don't want to be corrupted by the very evil that we mean to stamp out in this world she was trying to kill us but your point is taken but she wasn't the secretary she was trying to kill i don't know i mean i see what keyleth's saying but i don't really want to cramp your style scanlan we're like the a-team and that's your specialty i don't really want to-- see you should just shit when you feel the urge tibs we were just discussing the future of the group and the direction we've been taking and a point was introduced that maybe perhaps we started as a sort of a-- mercenary group is a bit strong-- but this alliance we have formed out of convenience we all needed to eat but now that we're at the stature we are in a keep in emon friends to the emperor we want to figure out what we're doing here do we want to be just powerful badasses who walk around getting what they want or are we trying to enact some positive change in this world well there's no question that you are an invaluable member of vox machina and our friend and our family and that is not in question well i think the point is your abilities in arcane wonder are expanding daily exponentially and perhaps be a little tentative do a little practice run in the woods on your own once in a while and see what the effects are before you go whipping it out keyleth clearly we all love you as family and nobody blames you but you once killed a child and none of us blame you for that and that happened in the heat of battle i'm well aware and it all falls apart no one agrees with you today more than i and i think we can adjust our perspective slightly right grog see absolutely not intentional no well i've got these little scars right here and then there was what's-his-name awesome pants who was there we know she knows what's up but whether she can be used as a reliable witness is-- we've got multiple witnesses they were incinerated i buzz over to that specific guard and say do you have a lost and found here i have this really badass serpent-style belt sometimes it crawls around on its own sometimes it's just a belt and i lost it here the other night and i'm really hoping-- i mean it ties everything together is there anyone i can check with 19 i step forward uriel with all respect i needn't remind you what the group of people before you put themselves through on your behalf and your family's behalf we almost lost one of our own and if that counts for nothing here then nothing makes sense but if that is not enough let us start here one thing at a time that's true but one thing at a time we had prior knowledge of the briarwoods' intentions before this evening and i myself went to spy on them i will subject myself to any test to any wizard or mage in this city who you know can ascertain the truth to look through my eyes to see my memories i don't know shit about magic but there are people who do and don't take our word for it anyone have them look in here do you not want the truth this is why i offer myself completely into your control and put myself under your supervision and any user of the arcane arts you want to peer inside my mind let them step up to the plate because i have nothing to hide uriel your own family was not themselves and you know that look into my mind now today you don't need to guess anything well one may smile and smile and still be a villain it's tuvan throat singing and when are you to look into my mind it freaking ends here right away there is no spoon we've no intention of going anywhere i'm sorry i was just talking to one of your friends have you seen a belt that is shaped like a snake sometimes it moves around on its own and it answers to the name simon but usually it's just a belt and looks really cool have you seen it is there a lost and found i can check out it's very dear to me where's that other guy he was more receptive to this do i see that other guy it's on all the fan art it really makes sense to have it on me keep an eye out for it 100 gold to any chap who finds it and holds onto it for me i'm a nice guy (laughter) that's terrible six i'll risk it all is he playing some sort of long game here how did she flee when she was unconscious allura all i know how to do is break locks but i've seen these people do things with magic that have defied expectations why can no one look into my memory you have looked across miles cannot anyone look into my mind and see are there no spells that can divine if someone's speaking true are we talking about that motherfucker's teeth i feel like i've failed you fucking politics so we tell them that we're going to their political-- the people that they're trying to create a political relationship with we're just going off to invade your political allies you're pretty thanks for the cups guys the cup well let's go check on this poor little shit in the dungeon grog come on let's go have a talk with someone let's go arm in arm in one big line i have one me too i did well i rolled 18 on them are we certain he's not describing a dragon what about this what if you supplied us with a small stream of produce for our servants here at the keep for cooking for feeding them for feeding us when we're here it'll be a sight less than 500 it wouldn't be nothing you could still give us something quickly presently we will find you guys we were told to sit and spin basically i mean what's wrong with earning some brownie points in the eyes of uriel yes tomorrow morning at the latest we have a little bit of business yeah i take him by the hand and say we will see you presently and you can take that to the bank hide your bull hide your wife i'm not going i'm just going to go hang out up on the wall outside the keep just be glad you're not an old woman i wasn't there for any of that i was upstairs on the roof just thinking i hide behind-- i don't want to get hit so i'm going to crouch down a little bit carefully behind one of the pieces of wall yeah rough landings sometimes easy be careful why i suppose i was the others are downstairs interrogating that boy where have you been do you want to have a drink i've got a flask you normally drink water you want a shot though i pull out my flask and i'm amazed because i've never seen this and i hand it over to him do you want to pass that bad boy back is it hot oh it's empty well i guess that was worth it tiberius-- i just got him drunk no no he took a shot of the old firewater and i don't know we might want to slap him a bit-- let's find keyleth i gave him his first drinky i'm sorry do you think you could pull him out of it i thought he was going to say no he didn't leave me any vax walks away off the roof out of here i'm gone i think that the hallucinatory terrain wouldn't work i felt like they could see right through me do you think you could fix him because he's a lot of firepower if we're going to go-- fine that was fine that was the heat of the moment she was angry we're a team running water if i create a trap here can you bind some magic to it is there a possibility dm that i could-- if he's sobered up-- if i set a trap that a spell of his could be bound to it somehow and go off i have no idea all right so i can look into it for the future but not today can we leave trinket to watch i actually picked his pocket and took his bottle of endless water don't you have a bottle of water like that oh oh well and the biggest you have are the bulls you said and you're certain this is a feathered beast or no i think i'm better served waiting to strike if it grabs one of them i'll deal more damage if it grabs me i'll deal no damage but if it grabs scanlan cow i can-- wait what's going on are we turning into cows i don't understand magic just like the brothels eh boy if uriel could see us now (laughter) my cow is going stealth 23 how fast can the rest of us do anything it's gone 17 i'd like to use a bonus action to click boots of haste together and i think if i do that i have two actions at that point right just attack so what i want to do is click the boots of haste together use the original action to run as far as i can towards the bird and then use my final action to sneak attack the thing since it's got keyleth in its talons that's up to you all right it would just be one-- i mean if i use the dash to run as far as i can that would leave me with one attack probably i'm trying to be a boy scout here wouldn't the boots of haste clicking be the bonus action yeah that is 22 to hit all right and that's not a whole lot that's ten ten yeah oh yeah then i missed fuck-sticks keyleth just get out of its fucking hands and fall you can change we'll catch you we'll do something just fall oh make an acrobatics check my intelligence is not six what a heroic move amazing the cows take off into the night sky i've got haste double me yo i got haste is what she cries out heroically yo i heard you liked cows so i gave you some cows with your cow but he's as heavy as a dust mote so he just goes like this all the way down right never go full gandalf tables have turned motherfucker tables have turned hey you're not a cow anymore oh awesome as the twins are flying i say hey did you notice we have the same pattern twins the remainder of that damage went into its hit points fly after that motherfucker can you track it with advantage i rolled a two i'm not used to being flying really we're going to take out the mom and train the babies yeah we're going to capture those babies and we're going to train them is it the same stealth roll or an additional stealth roll to go forward at this point oh well i mean i knew i rolled shitty 13 that seems complicated he's controlling it while he's blithering can i make an additional cow stealth check to come up behind the guy near him not even near him just to get a better vantage point does that cancel out with my advantage from my cloak shut up baby i know it (laughter) yeah 31 touching what i whack him in the back of the head let's get ready to rumble i pause ask him if he's considered whitestone i walk out from behind him and just walk past
