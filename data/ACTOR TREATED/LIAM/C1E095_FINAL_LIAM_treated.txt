who was that man that was taliesin jaffe mayor of ren faire two-hour combat scenario probably thinks he has three birthdays a year right so farts farts so many shit rolls everything's going to start to get a little intertwined here now yeah yeah so overarching theme is there was a lot of zephra and chill (laughter) i'm still learning the lingo getting to know korren a bit more keyleth helped me-- i let a lot of blood and made a small altar to the raven queen in zephra and it's been all flowered and vined out and while we spent most of our time-- oh tattoos want to talk tattoos we went together yours took much longer than mine did yeah yeah and about two-thirds of the way through yours they started on mine which is just a pair of antlers on the right bicep here i did not on my face yeah keyleth for life so we spent a lot of time in zephra but since have-druid-will-travel we met up with these two quite a bit about once a month we would have three- or four-day weekends we'd spent time in whitestone we went to vasselheim a lot the twins spent a lot of time in the library reading a ton i spent a lot of time at the raven queen's temple getting to know the people there getting to know what the hell a cleric or a priest or a paladin of the raven queen does since i didn't really have any time to do that i tried to do a little observing too in zephra as well i didn't want to interfere with their customs but it's like working at a funeral home and over time you just get used to it a couple of bits and pieces i saw everybody really i went on a man's weekend with grog and killed things that was awesome talked a lot of shop with pike god talk the girls went off on their own a little bit so i spent time trying to figure out what it was percival does in his workshop he lent me a book about the history of whitestone it's beautiful once you're not screaming running on fire you can really take in art and pass notes also tried to locate dr dranzel in an effort to find scanlan but
