11 yeah you go first okay so i will go-- i will destroy the initiative ranking i will send my globules of light into the darkness to see if it has any effect and then i'm going to back up-- no let’s say two of them at the same time i will back up my full movement while frumpkin runs into the edge of that darkness frumpkin will run forward out of the darkness towards the action yeah and poke his head out actually closer to-- he'll come out between molly's legs peek right out there i'm sitting down in the muck in the sewer and i'm now watching and listening to use comprehend languages through frumpkin i like that an eight-year-old boy delivered those points barnacle blow you just did that like the glitter guy blood maledict this language spell runs out in an hour let's speed this up between the couch cushions do they say in xhorhas we trust on them oh let me take a look at it what does anybody have a torch or anything no okay i need ten minutes ten minutes with this thing i'm going to as a ritual spell cast identify on the dodecahedron (whispering) but it's next level shit oh yeah i throw a dirty rag over it it is extremely powerful whatever it is no what do we want our next step to be (sighs) i was going to say let's wake up the elf well i don't remember it but caleb does because he has photographic memory so matt has to tell me-- (laughter) there is always some truth to porn caleb says jester my idea is you know most people are not like that crownsguard bastard most people like cats so maybe if frumpkin woke him up you know with a couple of licks he would wake up in a better-- that's also true it's all yours comprehend languages i understand everything he thinks we're with the empire do we have any of that crownsguard armor didn't we collect some jester give me one of the crownsguard helmets from your backpack i take this helmet i set it on the ground in front of the elf and then i start to piss on it frumpkin comes over and also pisses on it i shake it and put it away can you yeah i cast a spell so i could try to understand your tongue it's under a dirty rag what is your intention for the people in this empire this kingdom no your people's intention for all those who live here yeah you know that deep-dish pizza there what will you do if we say no we leave him only if we leave the beacon with the gentleman but if we leave him on his own-- i think that this thing is a great responsibility i think we should kill him seems dangerous to me it does if we leave this gentleman here and take the beacon it becomes his life's work to find us so we either leave him and it or we take it and kill him i don't-- why are you-- i don't it’s on the ground under the dirty rag ja i'm going to take a few steps back these two individuals were responsible for blowing a hole in that tower yes i'm not contradicting what you're saying i'm sorry when you say what use do we have for it it's a dangerous thing what do they do there i don't know much about the cobalt soul what can you tell me question when he said thuron did i hear thuron or did i hear some other word like eagle or swift or something so i didn't hear bob right did it have a-- same question context of the name anything no we're in the dwendalian empire that's close to a death sentence how about we give him some crownsguard armor i suggest leave it for him i defer to the group say what i am able to tell a great many things about a great many things and that is beyond me i do not we're taking his shit he left all his shit-- his armor he's wearing but all his other shit was left around we scooped it up where he went well whatever it is the empire just got it back also as a sidebar if we want the other half of our earlier plan to work we need to get to dolan we need the crownsguard inside sutan's house as quickly as possible that could have easily been a blank piece of paper it wasn't i looked at it plenty sure all the question marks i memorized all the question marks no that was too mysterious all right come on we're going back up we're either fighting crownsguard or getting out of here it's a long story go one two three don't know who you're point-- oh everybody we took cover in the sewers has the danger passed 15 15 that is correct right we have not been paid i send frumpkin scurrying between people's legs into the crowd put my hand on beau's shoulder and go blind do frumpkin and i see the doohickus the dodecahedron i’m going to cast disguise self as a crownsguard and just follow just see what's happening don't drop it don't drop it as a crownsguard i was walking alongside i start doing that thing where i was taking steps but not walking with them and then i started walking backwards (laughter) i thought it was like black and glowing it’s white and glowing pretty good for me pretty good for me that's 14 yeah dressed as a crownguard one in my hand and one on the ground but i've got it like this oh i just want to get it away from the crowd this thing seems dangerous to me let's just-- a little further back like another ten feet i don't know if this is going to blow it's better that it's just you and me so what's around yeah good so i cast friends on this crownsguard no it's not concentration it is-- yeah advantage to charisma rolls if he’s not under attack or thinks he’s threatened advantage on charisma checks at one creature of your choice that isn't hostile towards you so listen don't die for this i will take this just walk ahead this thing blew a hole in the side of that tower okay 15 the first was a one we've seen balls of fire take out half a city block i turn into an alley wait are there other guards around me i'm sorry does that give me advantage stealth it is a nine are there any doors or anything in here i'll take the left and just keep going ordinarily i would say yes and i might want to put something else in there but for the time being i don't understand this thing enough let's table that for now i'm worried what will happen if this specifically goes into that bag because that is an extra-dimensional pocket and i don't know what this is and i am worried that it could potentially create-- sure let's go with that but maybe if we could procure a lead box to put this inside of that will shield it from any possible searching that could happen for it a large lead box yeah we need to find dolan fast we need to i'm serious find a lead box to put this thing in because someone's going to want this very badly i wish i could be a fly on the wall when those wizards hear this story from the crownsguard just like-- (disinterested voice) yes very good take a lollipop from the bowl and get out (laughter) you think the basement with a dead person is safe what is a super long time like ten years what is that that's a conversation for another day let's go just a shitty hardware store man okay well i'm going to take my cloak off and cover it i’ve changed my mind i think it can wait until morning but for sure-- well if she has one good but it's a lot of disarray well then let's go break into a store and get a lead box not that particular material because lead shields things from magical-- from divination magic but i would know that when i saw it i know alchemy i know all sorts of materials for now good that's it that is a great idea the big bad of campaign two i will say that on the walk i would instantly identify the stone identify from sutan's house once-a-day walkie-talkie yes i am i go take a look at this skeleton i would like to try to ascertain how long this fucker has been here yeah not great at all like all my skill rolls seven here's the thing we can hide this here it's a calculated risk which i am fan of generally but my thread my magic would let me know if someone-- no never mind no i can put a magical lock on the door to this basement as well as well as an alarm well the thread will allow me me to know if someone i didn't want to be in here came in here (distant clattering) but you know i think you and i should sleep down here tonight actually yes (laughter) i worry-- well i'll tell you my concerns and that is that this thing is beyond comprehension even and the desire to get it back is going to be great this-- and i pull out the sending stone-- is just a stone that i stole from sutan's house this i'm not worried about would you put this in your backpack please oh you’re not with us i'll have to ask jester to put this in her backpack but this thing was worth blowing up a tower for you cannot spy on a thing as far as i know you can spy on a place you can spy on a person this is why i want the lead box all right okay well let’s hide it ja from normal people i put the same shitty rag on it that was on it before two plus three that’s five molly and caleb put the skull on top of it together did you say there were crates down here too okay i really think we should stay down here with it why don’t you and i stay down here for the night you have anything you want me to identify leave it i can do that you know what i have i’m not leaving i will stay with this thing you go up when they come back you come back down my gut tells me to stay close to this thing i’m glad the entrance to this is in the back of the building right well nott you go up you can just message me yeah and you come down here when they leave i’m going to take the big item and put it on my person i’m going to hold it actually i am not like looking into the abyss i just don’t understand it and i’m just holding it there okay jester had all the shit right cue the horror strings (violin screeching) jester's face pushes through the door give her advantage oh my god can i come in now how about now it was like a pokémon though hanging out with my new friend everybody is dead down here make believe is tricky guys just a quick aside while all of this is going on i place the thing in my lap and i pick up the skull oh so many secrets huh yorick (gravelly) maybe you should tear it off your chest i don't think that's a good idea it's driving you crazy maybe not yet it's probably a good idea you're funny we're going to drag this out as long as possible tell them i'm not going to run off with it what about in the game oh that was so brief that was like five minutes ago how's it going up there it's a scroll case right does anybody know you took this i set it on the ground i pull nott closer to me and i give nott a kiss on the forehead thank you yeah you are too kind to me well you know i think maybe you have guessed it before now but i care a great deal for you and that is no small gift thank you another day you know a little bit of me is worried that this scroll case will explode so i think we should check that out first yeah okay i can get this done in about an hour i think first nott will you take the scroll case and put it on the other side of the room yeah i'm tapped so this is all ritual spells now so i will use a ritual spell to identify the scroll case how big is this room down here okay this is going to be funny i take another ten minutes to summon schmidt come with me outside okay okay schmidt go open the scroll case come on i shut the door that is what i was afraid of so at this point back up a little bit and i open the door and back up to see what i see i back away from it so not a ball of fiery death okay so it's cleared away schmidt's gone i assume well if it wasn't damage-dealing he's still there he has two one or two one hit point okay so it's clear next ritual spell that i will cast i will gather the other items except for the dodecahedron well we're about to find out the dodecahedron is in my satchel at this point i push all the other items towards the case and whatever is there and i use ritual magic to cast detect magic everywhere i just cast it i rearrange my satchel so it's back by my butt so i don't have to look right at it okay we have a little bit of work to do i pick up the scrolls and examine them (gasps) come here come here i pick her up and i hug her this will be good for the group this will be good for you and me this is good it's something that i was not able to do i've been trying to figure it out for months and i have not been able to figure it out and now i have it okay let's look at these things for everybody else okay ho ho ho let's identify all this shit i spend the next 40 or so minutes-- ah yeah beau might like these these are good yeah these are good okay so all right we'll put these away this is a very good blade this might be a good blade for you why don't you hold on to it you hold onto that oh let me see i thought that was the daggers so the daggers are not magic not magic no this is bigger than you fjord or molly would like this they can decide they can decide i mean really these boots are good for anybody these are good for-- yeah no i'll tell you on christmas morning and not before we couldn't do this at all last campaign now you have to wait 20 minutes oh boy why that is the red flag not the arcane rug that was destroyed and removed covering his precious things not jester disguising herself as the high-richter and leaving witnesses who had seen someone who was not the richter going in before the richter-- yeah ulog rifled through her desk and took some papers from there but i did not see fjord tear him a new asshole well you know i want this to work so whatever they need i definitely do not agree but whatever makes it work well i have no interest in being a leader do you no do you know that i was going to go to that school one day yeah didn't work out oh i didn't get anywhere near it i'm from a small town and there was a lot of hubbub for me and maybe you know a gathering-up of coin but i fucked it up (whispers) yeah (clears throat) that is not for me to say but i have no interest in going i will do it on my own correction i will learn with your help that's the idea ja yeah well you know anything worth going after takes some elbow grease and hard work so i haven't had a friend in a very long time the last few months have been unexpected i do not and i'll tell you another secret i like them too i get that they're angry i don't agree with them but i get it or you i would argue well you want to bed down with a terrifying artifact of awesome power okay okay night nott get out of here i love you guys i don't mean the mighty nein you're assholes but i love you guys we did it we reclaimed our dignity we did it oh man here comes my extra one hit point plus my con modifier it's a total of six so i'm sitting at a big 25 now wow this ain't your kids' d&d right there yeah sure i've just been nerding out over my leveling up over here oh i rolled a one matthew i rolled it really badly i'm not good at dice it doesn't always work out for you anyway it can be thin as a sheet of parchment it doesn't need to be as-- am i here i've been doing this with my spells it needs to be sealed all the way around and be able to close are we all in a group though sorry i really did have my head up the ass of level four okay like a lead-- i would pay premium price to get a hold of a lead box right away yeah but this is more like an experience like sleep no more you have to go and-- yeah you have to see it for yourself we do have a lot to do but this is a functional trip as well this is a functional trip as well a gentleman like pumat sol-- gentlemen like pumat sols-- would most likely-- because they understand divination and the needs of the arcane we want you to be in on it yeah he would not be surprised by the question also come over here please well whoever-- everybody hears this come closer yeah so-- i look around to see if anyone was distracted by fjord’s large belch all right i know you’re all a big fan of my sticky fingers i took this from sutan’s house it is a sending stone it's a communication device this was in sutan’s house this was under the rug that we destroyed and removed yes of course we did what we had to do we improvised like fjord told me the other day you have to improvise this stone has a twin somewhere and we can talk with it i don’t know who it is honestly my opinion is the probability of someone trying to find us searching for this thing is like looking for a needle in a haystack in a newly made warzone however in the meantime i was wondering if you’d hold it inside of your fancy bag because-- i believe not because inside your bag is somewhere else it is not even on this plane let’s put that in your bag right away because we don’t know what’s on the other side of it there is a very very small chance the answer is yes so please put it in your bag right now yeah that is what i said that i was going to do do we want to do it before pumat or after pumat all we could do is say hello to a stranger we don’t know who it is it would hear our voice that is true just keep it in the bag for now just in case yeah we could certainly roll this over in our minds and see if there’s something we could do with it if someone is going to look for this thing-- and again probability very low-- but if they were going to look it’d be right away it’d be a couple of weeks i believe possible that at some point a message could come through it but we don’t know i just want-- for the next two to four weeks-- i would prefer to keep it either in a lead-lined container or in that bag chances are small but if someone was really determined it’s possible i would agree with fjord's sentiment if we took it out of my own bag-- there's four of pumats so one of those pumats would see it coming out of my own stuff yeah that’s also true no that he's nice we could also go to a breakfast shop and do it there (pumat voice) respectfully we are sorry how much precisely was that one again she is very useful in the right circumstances we definitely should i will buy that box for us how much was it also i assume it is out of my reach price-wise and i'm on a budget but do you deal in arcane knowledge pre-prepared scrolls of any kind what is the range what are your lowest rung i guess i'm curious to know dm a question from liam can cantrips be added if they're found okay you know i am interested in everything from the second level and below do you have a menu give me a moment player's handbook hold your horses no i am very good thank you oh no small critters let's get back to business i don't know what you have on tap here but i'm looking for something just a cantrip pretty common shocking-- you know how it works that is the one excellent pause the other thing-- the other one that i am interested in that is not really my forte but many wizards believe it is of great benefit do you have the shield spell how much will that run me i will take the pair i will take those thank you very much herr sol that is arschloch so no which who's on first fiction or well sum it up for me give me the tenser's floating disk pitch we can relate i'm a big reader if you finish that i don't know if you are the kind of fellow who likes to keep every book he reads but-- oh ja that makes sense okay well i will look for it elsewhere thank you oh okay would you be able to put in an order for this book for me i understand but you know many people you are obviously a very knowledgeable fellow who has vast connections it's a dirty book all right well i wait for your full review thank you true i got distracted you know so i put the box right down next to me and i put my coat-- okay so this is better than it was before you have monster calves do you want to carry this now i am-- no people carry boxes the lead is just to protect this item from divination i am worried about crossing two planes of existence it might not be that at all but it is definitely not worth chancing tell me what you have experience with things of this nature okay well that's fine i'm going to walk about 200 feet away from you when you put it in that bag-- it takes about two weeks so i guess we’ll find out oh yes very good things the daggers are just daggers okay who cares about daggers honestly but this-- i hold up this longsword which i can barely hold up this would be good for either of you two i will let you decide fjord here this is a very strong sword it is very good against creatures that is for you to look at then these boots would make anyone better but i think that beauregard might benefit from them the most i could be wrong i'm going to give them to beau and let you decide there's another one it's just gone missing i mean we will probably never see her again that seems a little foolish to me could one of us carry it until she returns who could really use it not you you are so good with a sword of course yes i thought you would like those was i right i was right wasn't i once per day so you can choose a moment to get the jump i mean anybody would but-- yeah but you know beauregard really is the most capable fighter in this group at this moment in time what that’s just the truth can you handle the truth oh i love making people happy but also we did not get the full catch-up fjord what about the remnants of-- i know everything is verkakte the high-richter is dead that's half the job done in a way we did not predict but what about lord sutan did you talk to dolan and are they going to get the crownsguard in there we can't do anything dolan was going to handle that part of this absolutely noticed that the very expensive magical rug is gone listen this could all appear like the knights turned on the high-richter i thought we wanted to get rid of lord sutan yeah and actual connections to the myriad it’ll flip the situation dolan i believe was saying that with the high-richter in place she was favoring sutan and now she is gone dolan will hopefully take that seat if he takes that seat dolan is not going to protect lord sutan in the way that he claimed that the high-richter was i don't know maybe we walk away from the whole thing discuss it as a possibility well here's the thing if dolan assumes that seat-- we have no idea if that's going to happen but if dolan does take that richter's seat sutan if nothing happens to him if no guards go into sutan's house he knows that his rug is gone he realizes someone has been in his home 100% he looks through the home himself finds our fake message from the myriad or whoever would he retaliate on dolan do we care well it was dolan who said i believe he had the relationship with orentha so he was going to report this stuff to orentha and have crownsguard go in now due to the circumstances of the evening we have missed the element of a quick surprise they did not rush in the way we had hoped so he's already realized somebody has jacked his shit i'm not worried really about him finding us but he had a bad night when he came home but if we don't give a shit about dolan then there's no problem really but maybe we do this is just the first layer of the onion there's eight more names to come you fake-name-making motherfucker
