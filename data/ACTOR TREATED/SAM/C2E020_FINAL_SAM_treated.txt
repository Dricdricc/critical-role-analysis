button collection i used to collect stamps i used to collect different kinds of vials of different sorts of fluids and things like that i collect soles of shoes not shoes just the soles yeah they come in many different shapes and sizes the cobblers throw them away when they're bad you can fish them out of the trash and you can have a whole bunch of them nothing i mean you can play a little drum thing with them sure if you string them together they make a roman gladiator belt sort of a thing ooh i could be a little bit taller i think if you put two on top of each other and push them in it looks like lips are talking i feel like we've gotten to know each other so well yes under your gigantic arm thank you happens every time it rains let's take the whole fucking tree a magical shelter you need more paper caleb can do it if he sets his mind to it are we waiting here for a while oh we're on a moving cart as we travel i'm going to try to make acid probably not a great idea but i'm going to-- yeah i bought a kit i've been trying to do it for a while but we've never stopped 16 plus proficiency is 19 but now i roll at disadvantage nine that's a 12 yeah one vial of acid great do we know anything about where we're going yeah but it's a big swamp are any of us good at like wood stuff is this me am i the girl are we going to stop we're moving use mending the road goes through the swamp that's specific please be a one please be a one please be a one have we stopped the cart should we stop moving the cart should we continue on or-- maybe it's febron maybe that's a-- we press on how far is it don't worry what shit i don't know right now we're saving jester so many trees oh boy you know what we never do tap into our pool of luck yeah we never use it we've never ever used it ever you know the dodecahedron thing i'll take it 12 dun-dun-dun-dun lollipop wow i'm feeling so fast i will dash you know to catch up to them i guess i bonus action dash then i get two attacks two actions now right whoa that's still out of range of hand crossbow well no it's not it's that i have to fire at disadvantage all right sure i'll do that i guess that's true okay i'll use one action to get closer still okay i'll test the air and do a lob shot okay ooh two plus something so it's nine i'm sorry caleb i failed you (mockingly) i can't do anything i suck it has disadvantage to perceive blind or deaf because that gator is blind does that mean it counts as sneak attack okay then i will bolt bolt bolt three attacks they all hit 19 15 13 plus things i'll roll again sure one of them is a natural 20 they all get sneak attack oh okay got it well it was the second one yes okay --is 17 plus four 21 plus i'll use fury of the small making it 26 just once a day then second does not get sneak attack even though it's at disadvantage six but that's doubled four so eight eight for that one then one more that's ten it still can't stop thinking about mollymauk though i'm going to move behind that rock over there (yelping) that's it sure damn it sure i'm going to be using uncanny dodge for the first time (yelping) we're both reptiles man come on be cool i don't know maybe he's dumb man this is exciting that's not enough i use my first action to try and resist the grapple and escape (stuttering) yes whatever's-- yes acrobatics ooh 18 is it engaged with beau can i get a sneak attack on it okay great i will shoot it in the face ooh not great 12 what's that mean cool 17 oh wow okay that's a hit ooh they're all bad 12 if that was one side of the throat i'll go for the other side oh terrible 11 oh still advantage or that's just once a turn oh wow okay that hits that's an 18 five more points of damage but it might in a second because i'm going to run behind that tree i'm going to get away get away as fast and as far as i can sure any way you think it won't see me that hits i will use my-- wait can i use uncanny dodge again because it's gone around yeah uncanny dodge to make it 14 (yelling) again i just got out oh that's nice of him yeah that hits out matt you are knocked prone and it's going to try and bite you that's what it was doing on its turn it's 18 now because of the haste but i don't know i'm dead do i have haste if i'm unconscious you're calling someone the spell is active because it makes you faster this feels wrong do it just do it i'll take it i don't feel right about this i even die fast i just failed two death saves from that pun you got the kill you were barely in the fight the lowest level possible that was scary i should not have been this close where were you i was doing everything up there a slop dolly what's a slop dolly oh sorry matt is there something you'd like to discuss with the table arms out of sockets maybe it was separated from

(deep voice) please step away from the vehicle we're bringing her into the bar i guess not do you drink liquor kiri booze liam taliesin and here i'll give you-- that's true that's a bad idea let's go in alfield we can look in a few more minutes no she's on the wagon they always fight for the check you're building a stage for something is there some sort of circus in town you said a silver per person we'll be fine we found him we won we send the message back to the gentleman and we'll collect our money oh that's right that's not-- okay i'm sorry i was confused oh boy can you use mending on

share 12 i'll take the rest 27 from me 17 you're the worst 1030 a soft 1030 oh boy there's four rooms one of them is yasha and the weirdo-- okay as we go into our room i say to caleb it's not really haunted is it have him take care of it well we know what's in it there's inventory so if anything's missing it's on him it's on dent the only thing on the cart is your thing that you bought at the festival and some crocodile skins that is true (squeaking) (squeaking) well thank you you know i don't want to burden you with my shit you've got your own fish to fry and your own battles to wage and i don't want you to have to worry about me or anything that means a lot to me and-- oh hello that's the point i just want you to be okay it sounds like this person who corrupted you is out there still and we need to find him and you know kill him or whatever if that's something that you want to do i'm fine focusing on that i've got my own issues but i'm fine taking care of yours first the thing is your story that you poured out to me and beau the other day-- it was very sad and i'm so sorry that you had to go through it but i have to say in a way i'm a little bit jealous because you've done this horrible thing-- not to make light of it or anything but it's bad-- and we can all tell that you're wearing it in your dirty clothes and your mussed hair-- well i know but still-- you know when you're dirty and it rains and it streaks down and dries that's the sort of thing you've got going on right now but you've got a lot of dirt on you no all i'm saying is i feel like you can get revenge you can maybe even get redemption for what you've done and you can become a better person you can do good to counteract the bad that you've done in your past and maybe someday there will be an end to your suffering all right thank you for the offer good night caleb oh god (electric guitar riff) you filled that whole thing we haven't used it yet i'll take it playing the kenku (exaggerated american accent) but only if he does an american accent (exaggerated american accent) i'm from california
