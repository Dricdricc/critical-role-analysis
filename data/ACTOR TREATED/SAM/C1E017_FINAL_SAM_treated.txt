oh really it's the asp hole it's just a bar that i like to go to down at the asp hole yeah we'll find the asp hole so we're standing outside the place where we just left pike while he's doing that scanlan is feeling still terribly sad about leaving pike so overcome with emotion that he must step into the ruins one last time just to see the place where she's going to be for the next several months years and before i do so i drink one of my potions that i bought from what's-his-butt gilmore the glorious gilmore yes i don't know how it works but i'm going to drink it anyway okay i drink it i go inside the ruins and look around and touch some of the walls and look at the stonework and everything i want to see where she's going to be so i know she's safe overcome with a little bit of verklempt emotion i shed a single tear i feel uncomfortable it must be the emotion i find a side chamber or a little nook somewhere where i can have some privacy i say a little prayer and i take a big dump on the floor well my stomach was rumbling sometimes it just affects me i have weak nerves and as i'm squatting i hum to myself (singing) how do i say goodbye to what we almost had i left a magic dump nope we should leave the dump it's already magical poo so i leave and rejoin my fellows wiping the tear from my eye and the poo from my bottom i took a potion that will let me see through my poo and check in on pike from time to time i certainly hope not as long as some of my cellular remains are there i might be able to see a little bit into the room (laughs) it's poo i feel great right now by the way it's magic poo he's a god of some sort to who these are dwarves they're not dwarves bellows' respite kord's strength to you who are the options i'm more of his manager than his friend

has his eye on you a talented musician master of disguise and dashingly handsome in his own mind scanlan sings songs almost as much as he sings his own praises born a poor gnome scanlan used his endless charm and soaring tenor voice to croon for coin and support his single mother one day he was discovered by a half-orc promoter and joined dr dranzel's spectacular traveling troupe where he learned the ways of the world and honed his skills as a bard extraordinaire a loner much of his life scanlan has never quite come to terms with the violent death of his mother at the hands of a goblin invasion while his years on the road provided many shall we say educational experiences with the opposite sex deep down scanlan yearns for the one thing he's never known the true love of a fellow gnome still scanlan considers himself a lover first performer second and fighter distant third on the battlefield he'll support his allies but rarely draws blood unless it's to protect fellow gnome pike count on scanlan for a hearty laugh a rollicking song and a twinkle in his eye that melts hearts and makes the females swoon remind me what was on our plate what's on our plate it's more of a poo
