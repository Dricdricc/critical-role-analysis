bottle of wine that's not very much this is a small town beau everyone talks to everyone you taught us that i was never here we never had this conversation i'm very ugly for a halfling why do we need to take it with us us traipsing through town with a giant head seems like it would draw focus why don't we just put it somewhere and send the authorities out here to find it later what are they going to do with it it's a big head we can hide it maybe some of us have skills to hide things just to game this out you caleb someone who is not suspected of a crime is going to bring the severed head of a member of the circus to the police-- either way you caleb someone who is not suspected of a crime is going to point the police to the severed head of a member of the circus with no evidence showing what that thing was or that it was evil and that will somehow not implicate other people who were not with us at the time how is this going to prove their innocence just showing a head it's good and i'll never do it again (laughter) (shouting) we'll come to your house with your share of the reward (laughter) you're strong though i'll help you i'll help you that's all right i'm strong one two three i'm not coming with you what if you're in trouble you're very hurt you've had a terrible night unless you're dead no one's going to be around to save you if you get into trouble yeah that's not good her hands are very warm oh god that's true but i didn't have my fingers in the holes it's nighttime the moonlight makes everything sort of look purple 26 did you say a shoe a shoe my shoe we took a short rest on the thing if you want to hit dice it up we have to kill these fucking guards don't we she calls it a shoe it's a shoe ring do i have to go too but i was just a bystander i was walking down here and i saw these two ruffians and i was going to go get help zero (laughter) three minus three is zero racism they keep regular hours here kill them all we're not criminals we're not me and caleb were just travelling ever since we broke out of that-- nothing what's going on over there who is going to go get the little girl weirdly he's dripping wet a little halfling girl (high-pitched) i mean-- i'm sorry i'm really nervous i'm very nervous i'm sorry it's just your guards shackled both my wrists and my ankles and i can't move to get into a good position look i have some evidence to submit look at my hands and also the hands of jester we're covered in the thing's blood we were there too we helped the killing of the creature i'm sorry for your loss where are your people from

i'm no longer associated with them and i can help you hunt them down if you'd like one it's not a natural one laura and this is even more awkward just put me back down put me back down no the chains are pulling me one way and you're pulling me the other way just come down to my level come down here oh thank you i would kiss you if i could where did you go were you on the lam for a long time he was an evil fiend when he joined the circus who brought him in no he was literally an evil fiend he controlled the girl also beau crushed her windpipe i never heard of that game yeah yeah the tickets are probably worth something out of the tent those aren't invented no i think jester-- jester i think it's safe to say that this first case is closed so we could open some sort of private investigation service out of a tent aw they took the tent you got to jump on the tent when it becomes available well do we have to leave i mean i'm not wanted anymore (whispers) that's progressive (laughter) we're here (laughter) oh no um is she coming a little bit you're very big oh no there's no comma i'm just nott the brave (laughter) you have to roll don't you well it was mainly caleb we had to get out i mean it was a bad place we would have died for sure that's true for sure but they treated us very badly and we needed to get out of there any place is-- i mean we've been travelling
