am frequently used as punishment 16 i'll be number two all as much as i don't want to rely on our prisoner this would be a good opportunity to throw a light down the hallway obby says do magic trick thank you it's a 7/5/7 meter poem not where i'm from you wrote that ahead of time four we hold devan above us as a human shield and keep running that's pretty smart we could all go leaving tarvis here obby the rat runs forward this will not work i run who me or them me too 25 yes is the acid still going i'm sorry i panicked you know why they call me obby the rat rats survive we'll never know obby

and i will sneak attack it with a dagger wait which one is it yeah i'll go straight from where i am yeah from the side nope 11 with my bonus action i still have some movement right i will disengage and hop over that chest so i'm more behind it right there aptly named spell guys we're playing dungeons & dragons just like on stranger things hey liam those are no longer mint in box okay i will attack the first one with a dagger again hoping to hit it this time nope 13 oh okay so eight plus sneak attack damage right ten no problem don't need it i'm going to try to move well no first i'll use my bonus action the feature that only i can do is sleight of hand on my bonus action it says that i can try to open a trap or a lock i'm going to try to pry open its mouth the one that is holding devan it's a trap or a lock maybe i have a crowbar so i'm going to jam it in and try to pop it open just enough for her hand to get out 15 no problem two hours it's okay obby the rat can take them both by myself apparently i want to go to him all right obby focuses still on big one is travis within five feet of him i mean tarvis natural one that's no good sorry and then i will use my bonus and move to disengage and move so i'm on the other side of the big one hopefully out of range of the little one (singing) quicker than a ray of frost you can dash right obby the rat would like to move in and attack so i will take a couple steps towards him and i get a 14 seven it's not a sneak attack right travis is out of the way seven points dagger i will bonus action try to pull the dagger out with sleight of hand not good slightly better ten oh he cares do we know what that is we are here to get a large jewel not gold there's no other doors right yes sir i retrieve my disgusting daggers from
