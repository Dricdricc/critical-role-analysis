okay here safely or should i get us something special with my dalliance yes but their shelters are destroyed now so i have an alternative i could do a bit of dalliancing no no so i will take a minute and cast mordenkainen's magnificent mansion can i enchant it with a little song or something so i'll sing (singing) it's a sick house it's mighty mighty it's letting it all hang-- that's it would you like to come into my place it's a little modest shack that i've been working on no no it's a place where we can rest for the evening totally safe and comfortable it's on a slightly different plane from ours so nothing can actually hurt us there or get to us i haven't checked in a while actually this is my first time doing this it's totally safe don't worry don't worry how many people can fit in there it's pretty big everybody how many are there this is my place all right i don't want any riffraff in there listen there's a guest list there's a guy at the door-- oh really the one with her face just sheared off all right not really my type i like full-faced people but i'll take it i'll take my chance you know if there's anyone from your immediate family that you'd like to give lodging to tonight-- okay we'll take them all we'll take them all in we'll take them all in ashari people don't worry about your shelter for tonight let scanlan shorthalt take care of you in every way shape and form imaginable come with me through this weird magic door into another plane believe me it's going to be okay hi i step in after her yes i've made some changes to the place living quarters are upstairs there's a kitchen parlor game room over there billiards all sorts of stuff we have a music room there are a hundred attendants who can wait on us i've assigned some of them specific jobs five are going to play music for us wherever we want especially during our meals oh yes yes here are you attacking my attendants they're my people jesus christ-- grog grog easy easy they're not ghosts they're not ghosts they are supernatural spirits-- some would say ghosts-- that are good they serve us they serve me-- they're slave ghosts well no they like it for some reason i can command them to do literally anything and they like it watch this watch this i call one over you there you there can you please braid my chest hair do you like this job see this is what i'm telling you thank you you're dismissed back to the music room you can tip me i'll pass it out later it never occurred to me to do this before for some reason no this is a skill that i recently acquired i would not hold out on you this is a new skill that i've just learned and i'm still making improvements to the house you'll see that our dining room has a portrait of myself in it not the one that i had commissioned but one that i had envisioned before it's just me in a smoking jacket standing in front of a fireplace with me in a smoking jacket above it stephen colbert-style and we all have our own separate rooms all of the beds are circular they all have a mirror over them mine is a waterbed so be careful on we go to the rest of it i am way ahead of you grog i'm way ahead of you as i said there are 100 servants here 50 of them are assigned to me and my own personal service the rest are available to you in whatever capacity you'd like them rooms are all upstairs there's individual rooms for all of us mine is at the end of the hallway and is slightly bigger than the rest you will find comfortable beds and things in every room the two rooms next to mine are reserved-- one is for pike the other across the hallway is for kaylie just in case she ever drops by don't worry it's not weird keeping her close to my heart it's not super-duper-- fine fine forget it when you have a daughter you can worry about her as much as i do only invited once a day but that's all we'll need right we could take a break it does take a while to cast it takes a minute to cast i'd like to keep a few secrets if you don't mind yes i can bend my thumb all the way back you know what i totally forgot to build trinket a place to sleep no no kaylie's room is locked let me just think about this for a second there's the third pantry the third pantry could possibly work it has some just mostly-- no no it's full we can't use that the front the front hall all right yes there's a whole basement area it's a large space it's for training and working with weapons you can have five of them jesus ghost cow what's going on over there muscle-ups is there a big thing that says wod on it ooh how did you do that weirdly i'm doing the same thing upstairs (laughter) we have a music room i actually have a trombone (sad trombone sound) anything i can help you with vex should we retire to my room for this (excited gasp) i was not expecting that i run up to my room to make sure that everything's neat light a bunch of candles i'm lying in bed black satin sheets oh i forgot you were coming i should warn you we're not alone and i look over to the five musicians and i ask them to strike up a little-- little bossa nova whatever it's you know it's my special place where i like to come and think about philosophy and life well many people do (gulps) it goes up and down a bit it's a water bed is that-- did we see that before what did you do you took gern's magical broom oh my gods because it flies what is it with you and flying i could make you fly yes that's right i will try i will examine the broom and make some sort of check on it oh that's not good 14 i don't can i examine it to see if there's any markings any hidden anything on it investigation 21 common gnome pig latin you don't see the words though there's some words here that might be a clue to the code word basically we need to find the code word what do we know about gern did you try the others coral carol you probably need to hold it i don't either try on coral on carol on stimpy on fatty arbuckle i can't read the words i point it out to her weirdly you are not the first floating chick i've had in my bed but that is amazing you're flying nope you owe me nothing that's what friends are for i shake her little elf hand okay as high as they can be on the top floor you're going to have to remember that now i instruct the band to start playing flight of the bumblebee oh shit you look great up there but you should not have stolen that he was our friend he helped us we should do something to repay the debt we can't possibly find him now if we can't help him you're going to have to help someone else to make up for the lost karma perhaps i will pick someone for you to help someday to repay us both all right i will mark that down all right guys it didn't work you can go it's nice in here phillip phillip waffle presses eat drink you're looking delighted and delightful sure sure there's mimosas there's-- breakfast beer sure there's milk from a cow with a broken nose it'll be fine when we leave this place all these people die anyway i don't know we'll leave trinket and then we'll try it again and if trinket's still here we'll know it's just-- no all right we'll leave the broom and see if it's still here oh vex is there something you'd like to admit to the rest of the group they'll see you use it sooner or later gern our friend i think we should hear vax's opinion of this did we steal that i thought it was just a-- that's true sure watch your eyes watch your eyes i start eating a moving target there's lots of chickens by the way tinker oh no she's day drunk again keyleth vex swore to me that she would only use it for good i think you broke through oh look look another round of chickens has just arrived for us to eat i don't know what breakfast is so i just keep commanding them to make chickens what is our next-- shoot i kept a to-do list for us but i didn't bring it tonight oh i thought you were going to say something that was a belch does that make her the leader or something is that how all the dragons got through i'm still not quite sure as a dragon did they say anything about her goals or motivations her ambitions to emon kill everybody so perhaps we should inquire if you think this-- raishan has tried to pretend to be a human woman in any other place should we ask around or was it just the one ruse here to gain entry for her companions all right well don't trust anyone keep it coming i forgot to tell them to make them sorry it's all chicken oh waffles too chicken and waffles that's right maybe someone else should be in charge of the food next time we come here my tastes are a little-- singular no i just came up with the chicken this morning when i woke up grog had some brass knuckles to get was that a thing did we get those all right wait did we have to go make a trip to anyone else's homeland how's whitestone oh that's right maybe that should be our next-- and what were we trying to get there another one of the articles of confederation okay but then there's the sphinx what's that vax so it's grog's herd or the sphinx to get something on the way and then or tbd find something else to do i guess grog's thing is the most promising we know that there's knuckles there we know that there's people we'll know there is frostweald near kraghammer as well and that's in the direction of both grog's herd and the frostweald yeah we should probably go there let's do that you think they'll attack us but we're with you you're our ally we do of course you can borrow my hat you could wear this hat might not fit on your head you could maybe put it on one of your knuckles if you're too scared to do it we can go elsewhere sorry i will never say that again we all hold up our hands it seems to me that no matter where we go we are putting ourselves in peril so it's really just a question of which peril do we want to face first i thought odessa's boyfriend had a vestige we can instantly transport anywhere so sphinx first say no more all right let's go to the sphinx then where's that the frostweald we've been there do you remember any trees there we'll never know let's go to the frostweald do you remember any trees or we could just go to westruun is westruun still there we spent a whole day in that park you need a signal boost and how far are we now a day's travel two days' travel you said we're not very fast in mist form are we are we like a day i haven't done this before is it freaky is it super freaky all right three i'm still thinking about what were those big gashes in the ground back there oh i'm reverting too i'm a follower 29 we're all good who has your daughter beasts what beasts and that spot that we saw just outside of town that's where gold is given to the dragon do you know anything of that wait what to do what to attack half-orcs that work for a dragon the orcs what what you'll be okay we're going to keep going good luck no we have to keep going we can't face these goliaths and dragons and orc guards this is craziness i mean we'll be fine no you're using way too many prepositions were there six of them where's the guard can we see him wait he was about to tell us who it is it always works and it catches whoever you want what's wrong like a used car lot wait what how do you have all these things you killed him was he related to you in some way you're using too-big words what would be our mission you killed this one quite easily i'm going to check out his body see if there's any booty on his body i'll leave all his human teeth i'm not gonna take that shit are we going to do anything to the rest of them we can all mist and go into the city and check it out it doesn't matter if they see us they can't do anything to us you can stay behind as grog why don't you all go in i'll stay back with grog 93 just massage each other yes the best of mates i wasn't aware that you knew what that word meant yes like talking-talking or you just-- do you see a mouth on it or anything all the time okay no grog i'm not try one more time sure that's a good idea actually can i hold the sword how big is it can you hold the top part and i'll just hold it by the handle the hilty-part okay grog hand me the sword i don't hear it but maybe if you handed it to me i could do i believe him not good not good seven grog you want to give me the sword and i will cast suggestion on him i haven't used it in a while and i don't have my thing well 18 if i'm not using my thing well it's heavy oh i talk to it oi craven edge have you been talking to my friend grog no craven edge how do i prove i'm worthy i don't think i can i don't think i want to so i think i'll try to give the sword back to grog is this magic well it's fine natural 20 take this back will you yes it did it's very compelling i don't know if you should have this grog all right i won't tell anyone but i might have to ask some questions about this does it tell you to kill things a lot i know it does it just told me to kill something does it tell you to kill things yeah we should not tell the others about this this is very strange they might freak out i'm going to ask about this when next we see pike i'll ask her about it find out if it's good or bad or neutral because i don't know anything about this right i don't know anything about this 12 yeah i don't know don't know anything about this i'll do some investigating in the meantime try not to kill anyone in our party if it tells you to well okay let's just keep this between us just like that time in emon when we-- --double-teamed-- yep it was a-- nothing happened here how was your trip there's a central stronghold of some sort is it a fortress it's a house and if we were to make our way into it somehow what would our mission be we could take out that guard what was his name cole or something well we could find one of your goliath friends hold them hostage and draw out kevdak that way we could do some sort of a diversion set a fire or something that would draw them out or set a fire to the house they live in do you want to march in there solo while we stealth-- no no while we all stealth around in the rooftops watching ready to act tell us this if we walk in with you into town is that not good should you walk into town alone and we lurk in the shadows you don't want to do this now it seems like now or never we may not know where he is after this do we still have mist possibilities could have taken them
