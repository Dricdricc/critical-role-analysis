i played a character named orc 4 who among other things hates humans enjoys grog and is dumb oh i think he hates them i think he hates most things no he just hates he's a hater really they should spend more of the game talking about his wants and needs and his ambitions and likes in life but no he hates both just hates a lot of stuff feels like too long nice (raspy voice) hello (rasping) hello my name is ur-eden goodthink and i'm the olog you want to see if you're hurt because me is a sawbones i'm an olog so i'm rather big but i'm also a sawbones which means if you have a toothache or something you come to me i pull the tooth right out probably half of your jaw too if you got a broken bone i pull the arm off if you got a rash i pull your skin off so really i take care of all your medical needs somebody came to me with-- they were having some stress dreams i ripped their head off solved the problem right away yeah usually most things can be solved without insurance but yeah i'm here to help anyone who gets injured and also to kill some man-filth do you want to go with me to kill something would that break your boredom well those two fellows having the fist fight we could go kill one of them i think it's rarr versus oog over there you could be right yeah they do all the uruks do hoshgrish is that true did sauron really talk to you because sometimes i hear voices but then i turn around and it's just an orc talking to me that i didn't see yeah but i didn't see you yeah that's the problem with these things you know what he sounds like to me a medical condition i should probably get my axe chop up your head and see what's in there making that noise all right yes let's go get them let's go i pick up my quarterstaff and start stomping towards the tower that's where good leaders go i also got a one i could have used my deflect missiles i'll do that next time 21 you can call me eden all right i'll pick up my quarterstaff with two hands and i will hit one of them (laughs) the one on the left hiyah ooh not good 11 i have a second attack ooh this one is better 26 all right 1d8 plus four i don't know how to do this okay that's eight points of damage but let's do other things too i'm going to use my stunning strike right i'm going to use a ki point yes 14 okay the stunning strike so when i hit him i knowing my medical knowledge that i have so well i aim for the one place that i know hurts the most the wang on you so i jab him right between the legs oh right in the gronk right in the gronk sharply hit nice and low gronk hit take that you glob i believe so oh wait a bonus i don't know how this guy works bonus action strike you can do that all right great i will if i hit a stunned person does he become unstunned no oh no i'm good i'm done oh that's crazy i already took two hits can i jab at the guy next to me all right sorry laura i'm interfering are you the scar artist i was just jabbing the other guy i rolled a 23 another eight points such a thinker this one 21 are there any other ways around are there ladders oh we're going to beat this guy i'm ignoring this guy i'm going to charge into the stairwell does he have to roll a negative four he does not hit me sneak attack come on you shugs come with me up the stairs oh that looks like a problem i will solve it i will attack him with my quarterstaff ten plus seven ooh 17 yes so that hit goes for ooh 12 points and you said he looked stronger than the rest i will use my flurry of blows i would like to flurry 19 plus seven that's another nine points of damage 20 natural 20 one that's two plus four so that's six and then one more six plus seven is only a 13 eight plus four another 12 points of damage like zorro he was this glob that i killed two towns over he would always write a z on his victims but my name is eden so i'm going to try and write an e (grunts) can i make a lowercase e (roaring) he committed suicide he said he was so scared of you mozuu do the uprisers the rebels look different do they have anything different about them in their eyes that's where he slumbers we should probably go in persuasion right ur-grandma oh oh yes do you need medical attention my lord yes all right i grab my healer's kit and i will use my really dirty bandages to wrap him up i don't really have anything to fasten it with so i hock a loogie on one and then fasten it to the other piece and hope that holds oh yes 1d6 plus nine 12 points we follow barfta-- oh wait that's you my name's ur-eden ur-eden goodthink you can call me eden all right do you need some healing then some of those aren't eyeballs by the way i think we should follow you now all right i could heal you right now or we could use hit dice and take a short rest and that way i would save my ability to heal you later oh you're still here if we're going to do this for you by the dark lord's name i feel that our group of four should have some sort of group name yeah a callsign or something is that something you could hook us up with or the orc four the orc four the forcs can we get little patches that say get forc-ed across my back let's take on after them do i get ki points back all holy moly i'm so powerful wow hit dice it will say right there no shrak is feces a gronk is a dick how will we chase after these bad guys are we going to ride on something or should we just walk do we need a cart are you scared of a carangor i've killed so many carangor i haven't either the scatagorus all right well then we will go on foot right is anyone good with animals travis and maybe we should walk (laughter) i've noticed that one of those eyes is a wolf's eye and the other is an acorn is that going to seven what is it but the forcs can take them forcs it's dinner time (laughs) thank you lady guinevere (laughter) totally black 17 so there's two close together and two others and my flurry of blows can that be used on multiple targets all right so i'll run up to the first and quarterstaff attack ooh yeah 23 to hit seven all right i will flurry of blows and strike him with my hand ew 11 i'll strike again with my hand (yelps) oh that one's better 19 six points of damage with my hand right my bonus-- all right well then i will quarterstaff him in the gut oh yeah 18 plus seven ooh 25 one so five is that a part of the flurry of blows attack or is that when i bonus attack okay so if i hit someone with a flurry of blows he must succeed on a dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone all right forcs appetizer course is over i don't know how far i can take this metaphor (laughter) salad course yes 17 yes mozuu they have chosen you hoping that'll be enough light it must cast some light it's a 20 and a one does the torso light the torch i don't know what that means maybe we should go seems like they keep coming maybe we should run mozuu do we have your blessing to flee i'm leader you hear that bow before me he's been bowing to me i'm going to run oh i'm going to run and hope he falls off like a big bucking bronco i'll use my step of the wind to go faster and jump really far are we leaving i thought that was the plan why (shouting) guys are you coming or what guys i'm 80 feet away and my darkvision can't see that far so all i heard was an explosion in the dark so i drop to my knee and i say as the only surviving member of the forcs i will say a word to thank the great dark lord for choosing me to carry on the mantle of this mission and i will keep running as fast as i can away it's like benji they fought bravely they were my friends they took care of me oh i'm hearing voices again two voices oh god three voices he speaks in mysterious ways oh well i'll end it all right here oh hi hi how'd it go i'm sorry i left but when he made me leaver-- leader oh i thought he said leaver all right shall we continue eastward which way is that i'm pretty hurt too and you're hurt as well should we take another rest i can heal us if you want and we can keep going all right gather around i will need to use all of my healing potential for this what hurts i cake some mud onto all of her wounds and heal her 13 points well where do you hurt what ails you i will take my hair-- yes i have a little bit i shake off the dandruff make it into a tea that he drinks but it's filled with protein yeah that heals 11 points i keep a little flask of grog i'll swig that can i heal myself a bit oh yeah 11 points back up in it
