well i've been getting a lot of questions lately about like how do you write these ad things i make it sound like oh i just come up with it on the fly it's not true i spend a lot of time in fact i have a file here of rejected ads that i didn't deem good enough to use to promote our friends at d&d beyond dndbeyondcom go there sign up use their service like we do here's just a few i'm just going to rifle through my files this one's terrible it was a pirate one i was going to wear an eye patch and go ahoy and welcome to d&d be-yarrrgh grab your duffel set the binnacle and follow the freebooters to dnd beyond dot carrrrrrm but it didn't make sense this one was-- i was going to do a travis impression yo bros how about that cowboys game right when prescott hit hurns on that outside post-route fuck i nearly spilled my natty lite all over my emmitt smith commemorative snuggie man i love sports the smell of grass the sound of marching bands the sight of 22 men pounding each other for-- all right here's an early draft of the now-famous d&d beyond jingle i went through many drafts of the lyrics before i landed on the primo ones that we got (sings) you got your perfect wizard his tomes and his supplies but he burned his entire family to death and now he's traumatized (laughter) this one what was this one our tests indicate that your rash has spread to the groin ar-- nope that's not it that was a different file i had this one this one's really conceptual here i'll do it matt matt matt matt that's all it says it just keeps going and saying matt it wouldn't have worked this is why it's rejected oh this one this one is specific for-- we're all excited to meet laura and travis's baby so i consulted with some computer whizzes we did some facial recognition to find out what their baby might look like it's got travis's eyes laura's eyebrows and why don't you just feast your eyes on this beauty it is definitely your mouth that's travis's beard then the other one i had was flowers for you to say sorry for that last bit that concludes the file that's all i've got the other things in here were just the pictures that i cut out yep this is the final one there's more rejected ones but i'll read you those another day i got my flask for tonight it really is anthony kiedis we'll do a side by side we'll put it on twitter we'll post it later but all of that is to say d&d beyond thank you that's amazing oh wow short and sweet were we on our way to something were we going to some place blushing tankard is that a place to stay we don't know we just got here ooh what-- (yelling and blowing) oh are you drawing something it's a dick i knew it oh you didn't even need to where are we dropping can we stay at this place as well or do we-- give me that i want to smell it because you put your lips to it did you just change your shirt travis how did that happen sorry focus i don't think she's coming fire bolt well can i have one to examine you have a bunch of

pockets 23 no 27 anything other than money who were they not looking for work we're just on a job yeah they prefer the term toadstools i don't know if we can learn that dance let's just work on something simple we're going to take a moment to work out a couple of moves in case it comes up just some basic hand moves i'm much shorter than you i like it caleb maybe can do some special effects maybe i should sit it out a team drinking competition why would she come out of the room ooh they said that they would send someone to the room right molly didn't you say that they would send someone to the room like a babysitter you could pay one of their women to watch our little kiri they're working women we rent them for a time oh yeah that's true we could get a sturdy strapping gigolo man to go up there and watch out for kiri yes she is a wallflower tonight three man-hours caleb we may need a third person to join our dance now you can't dance you're not a dancer are you sure i guess we can-- beau no third it was kiri first caleb second you're three we should rehearse we don't know when we're going to need the dance yet this is good you have an opportunity for later if you choose to use it have you ever been with someone are you sure insight check 20 okay he seems to be telling the truth with the hooker with the hooker okay let's go make the rounds the nerdiest raver if there's any more of those sparklers or poppers around-- steal some that is not the snitch just because it's gold doesn't mean it's a snitch okay all right thank you no i want something more powerful can you make something gulp i swoop back into the shadows and mingle sorry that was my fault no i-- i should have known i can't talk to people they're always shitty it's a 100% accurate prediction by the way beau thank you for the other day for talking to caleb through his you know just be sensitive around him i know that that's not your strong suit but he doesn't deal well with harsh criticism all the time i'm used to it tell me something how did you know about this place yeah how did you know that the gnomes here get down with the funky fresh rhythm all night what job what's a cobalt soul what kind of a faction of monks are you evil are you a bad guy i don't think so but i don't know you seem to know a lot about a lot of things and sketchy things too what was that job i thought you grew up-- didn't your parents make wine or something what was this about a job wait little townsgirl her parents are wine makers now you're a brutal assassin martial artist who can kill anything what happened in between those two things yeah right sure you no like what what kind of stuff you were bootlegging your old man's hooch wow is he a bad person so you took matters into your own hands and got in trouble and were sent off to boarding school with monks who are librarians and taught you how to kill with your fists wait this was not by choice you were abducted by monks oh my gosh are you okay was it hard i've never thought of you as an optimistic person but that's a very positive way of looking at it i would very much i'll just take a little sip in case we have to do the hour of power later wow that's amazing the trick is to not overmix you don't want to overmix oh sorry we've been walking with your friend beau time is of the essence he might be with a lady of the night later tonight you might have to teach him quickly cram school yeah tonight when it doesn't matter you roll great yes please yes caleb what is it well i think we're going to drink first i do like to dance should i do the spell that you told me the disguising spell before the dance all right i'll do that oh because the shadows won't match okay i will but you'll keep an eye out in case anyone-- all right thank you i'll try if you want to join us you could just point and clap off to the side you don't have to dance you can be there to like-- you saw the guys who kicked you in the face they had planned-out moves that were really cool all right we'll do choreography to the right and left and you two be in the middle and just freestyle what wands the wand of smiles that's probably it for the day so petty are we all going who's the worst at drinking then maybe you should sit this one out do we want this to be the thing that we find out on i've never had a drink in my life maybe you can be-- you could be the manager of the team yes you can use your clerical mysticism to confuse and disrupt our enemy all right so i'll wait until there's-- he's trash talking don't listen to him maybe we should do our dance to distract his competitor now it was 15 but 12 oh no no caleb no all right fjord tanya it was always about money she's the worst negotiator ever i'm scared all right i've looked in the-- by the way matt-- i've looked in the thing the-- the dodecahedron all right i'll try hello sir all right i'll try no i don't have this (stammering) hello i'm otto sorry yes it's a five

absolutely yes you're way stronger her koi pond sure do we have our money wait all of our money is gone i accuse jester of stealing our money you're right it's stupid we as detectives should think clearly about this and figure out when was the money stolen did you all have your money after the competition between the competition and bedtime our money was stolen is kiri with us kiri did you steal our money that cuts down on our detective work a lot but it was only the five who competed who were robbed it could be because we won and blemmy's crew stole our money so we're going to talk to irena and then we're going to maybe find blemmy or maybe just follow locate object i'm wearing it no i only keep my valuable things in other pockets within how many feet well let's sees if she talks first does she i haven't talked to her molly could use his masculine wiles to talk to-- you have pan wiles she did it i still think she did it bacon we'll go check me too ask irena about the little girl who was here last night irena if molly was interested would you like-- no just like-- nevermind let's go to rissa don't you guys use scissors when you have sex with each other this is real that's what i was trying to get to wait us we have to answer truthfully you're not my type i like you you're nice yes they're probably not going to use them they're just one drink they would keep all the hundreds of gold one more question irena where does the pianist live yeah the guy playing the piano what's his name we never asked already we're not there yet now okay makes sense let's run kiri's our little daughter she's a bird how does it work what the fuck was that am i allowed to rob him marisha and or get it back for you what would you do if you had the thing back or-- it's okay calm down cleff you know you seem to have a fine eye and talent for mechanical devices do you ever have any need of alchemical combinations with your mechanical devices i think i have a little oil if you need it as a sign of good faith didn't we get oil at some point wait oh wait no i have holy water that is not the same thing all right she's working for us we need her social security number for a 1099 by the way (laughter) well okay then we're fine he's adorable yes wow so many daddy issues she's not charming on one of them or both should i pour this vial of acid on them no now where does he live now by the way ice sailor sounds like the coolest job what does that even mean mixed with ice road truckers what what's wrong you feel bad we don't have any should i shoot them down while they run everyone everywhere on the way out can i just ask that gentleman do you make any of those things that we've seen around here (stammering) the pistols do you make those here oh thank you good day the iron lot our list of suspects is as follows the pianist blemmy rissa the girl fitz and ashton we've eliminated as possible suspects fitz and ashton really they're really lame the pianist because you did locate object within his-- rissa because she was in zone of truth that leaves our suspects blemmy and the girl but she has your copper pieces you did could you find those specific silver pieces or the money she stole from us so we go find blemmy silver falls that's the residential area where the finger towers apartments are silver falls sam matt and let's go will you be able to cast it again why did you-- just while we stroll through the town sure i guess what are you searching for follow her she's a bloodhound was it blemmy they all had nasty beards duncan valkin ruth and tanya the first guy was duncan valkin was the next guy oh we're going to circle around no wait can we surround it first jesus we surround the building i will take out my wire and-- i whisper to beau using message what do you see you can reply to this message no we don't know what you're doing should we draw them out we're just going to bust in what if they have traps and bombs i will kill them all you went down a chimney what god were they worshiping it's very clear we have kiri already we take these four children with us and we keep going but we still have weeks left don't we you have a means of contacting the gentleman you could ask for a three-day extension caleb you have a photographic memory as you remind us every session how long do we have until our time is up with the gentleman how long would it take do we think to get up north there if we went straight a week so we've got a couple weeks we have a day or two to spend on some prison breaking beauregard don't you think they should be reunited with their father who loves them very much and wants to be with them and take them to an orphanage it would be horrible if they were taken away from their home and given to some people who would do horrible things to them or mistreat them for their whole childhoods leaving them as cold heartless resting bitches that was an intimidation tactic i would never hurt a child no i wouldn't i love children that was an accident were you an orphan were you an orphan sorry eight hours right i have some human jerky left over well we know how much the prostitutes cost to watch kiri the children do owe us a little bit oh schusters oh yeah going to lean those up against the door jamb we'll do recon for the afternoon and then we'll attack tomorrow morning unless this guy comes in the next week if that happens
