of all time ashley what's going on with you anything to plug any other projects that you're working on before his arrival but he takes a while to come back yeah for sure is that now is sleep now we'll wait a few hours we were protecting it for you the goddess ioun told me to protect it in a circle reminiscent of the circle of my third eye as ioun wills it yes ioun be pleased i will i'm a holy man it's supposed to be awkward we can't hear him so you'll have to talk hello percy what a tough thing for you to do he's a sword he cuts that's his thing sure that sounds fun what's a hit point if vax has a trammel and grog has a trammel who has the third trammel someone who can fly you can fly don't you have to be super strong to use these trammels no i'm fine with that can she fly how that's all we'll need but that's when we'll need to use the trammels sometimes they're on the ankles what are all of us doing i'm praying into a book sure how can we get grog to fly though because these pillars can't go all the way to the heavens can they no no we're focused i guess we could use these pillars but it seems like a waste of your spell to get him halfway up towards vecna if vecna is flying if he's straight above us all right no plan can you do them on top of each other my plan is to not run away because we're going to die fighting or we're going to save the world right so i definitely won't be running away definitely i may run away i'll tell your story and i'll tell it very well (gasps) wow that's a deal i have an idea about grog flying that just occurred to me trinket's big trinket could be polymorphed into something else big like a flying eagle of some sort and actually be useful yes but with big risk comes big reward it's a plan b what flying things have we seen that are scary i can't polymorph i could true polymorph trinket and permanently make him a wyvern it can be dispelled just at an action even if it becomes permanent wow a simple level three dispel magic can get rid of a 9th-level permanent polymorph i'm not going to waste my true polymorph on that just standard polymorph yeah but it could still be dispelled i was just talking about polymorph yes liam and yeah true what's more important yeah well let's see here he has a challenge rating doesn't he this trinket so monsters of a six i don't even know i'll look at the list oh yeah i mean if i true polymorph him trinket i could do a wyvern or a young white dragon or-- is j'mon a brass or bronze travis and i could do a young brass young white dragon or a wyvern or i could have another scanlan scanlan two can cast polymorph we'll see (laughs) or not i'm pretty sure it will be apparent that he is not a real person that's true well you'll know because come on this charm can't be replicated sure yeah he could be the meat man but i think you have to use truesight it doesn't just happen he can can certainly try that's nice he can for a while yeah these are good catch phrases for sure all right i need the strength of two mes to win this fight so i'm going to drop to my knees and wish to the gods that there was somehow more of me that i could somehow be in two places at the same time i wish for more me me-more me but more m√°s scanlan oh yeah shit (laughs) you guys can sleep then i'll sleep you wait for me sorry it's already being done shit we should have done that when we were waiting for fucking vax i didn't know it takes that long (whispers) okay oh my god hello scanlan is it you you're shorter than i thought you'd be all right let's just see if you're really scanlan oh okay let's see i whip out my little measuring tape one inch by one inch by one inch mm-hmm that part's the same i think there's only one way to find out (singing) naa matt and all right this worked scanlan let's go to sleep i'll spoon you oh we have extra items because he doesn't have any of my items does he yes yes i will put him in the armor of-- acid-- no i have acid you had cold oh we had two acids yeah so it's acid resistance wand of plus one what is that yeah great do that he's also got bracers of defense gloves of missile snaring and a dragon slayer longsword sure why not last year i was a crime boss but the last few days have been really fun yeah yeah he doesn't know what's going to hit him we're the shits laura and myself my other hand scanlan one 19 scanlan two 21 not good ten what what's this (cheering and laughing) oh boy i cover tiny scanlan's eyes nope does scanlan two take my initiative or no the best natural 20 which made a 23 oh sorry scanlan two is also 21 i'm just watching and i turn to scanlan two and say so that's a gloomstalker and that guy i'm not sure what he is but he looks really cool we've been fighting silently yes yeah you're fine do you have a name we can kill you any second so be scared of us if you're an evil person what come on insta-kill this thing i run out and i say wait don't kill it i'm just kidding it's fine arkhan hi how do you know this gentleman well it was the worst kind of swamp it was one with no water lady briarwood the queen what kind of queen hm that's no good 11 you serve this queen devil's advocate maybe not i don't know maybe-- whatcha doing over there johnson no that's not great we'll figure it out later is that true wait when did he say he couldn't die he said he would fight like a man who is dead but he wasn't-- oh no you're right i touch him to see if he's real kind of squishy really soft yeah pudgy the outer walls of the city how are we going to take down entire walls without being-- we don't know where these crystals are all right is it walking you got to stay within 60 feet of us 30 feet and can we kind of stay under the shadow of the gloomstalker oh 29 and 20 his head has muscles making their way down all right but if we interfere with that forcefield and it somehow hits us we're going to be hurting one punch man yeah well you're going to roll well when it counts the wall has an ac of 18 20 i don't think we're going to be able to move we're all in the same enclosed space 19 and 30 oh no maybe she doesn't see you maybe she's talking to the gloomstalker into the earring i say this is our chance we leave him as a distraction and we go they don't know we're here we can run are they hovering how did you know we would be here there's no way to see out downstairs there seems to be some windows on this side right i mean i'm in there somewhere i think i would be near the window where i could kind of see-- what's your name ar-can arkhan he can just move with me it's fine sure near the downstairs windows where i can see-- oh they're armored up all right so then i'm upstairs they they ten so did scanlan two no this is new for me this is new matt just manage the ten people and three creatures on the field right now and you'll be fine just do what you do it's vex's job to keep us in radius he's going to know we're here they're going to tell him is she aiming for the dragon big d we have tape we could get tape is this an attack roll that it's about to make scanlan two is going to use cutting words to reduce the damage dex scanlan one 18 scanlan two 25 can reduce damage by d12 five five less the testosterone in his group just went from a half to one math (laughter) can i cutting words one of us has scanlan prime steps up okay then never mind got it scanlan one turns to scanlan two and sings a song of healing i'm prime right now ever but not healed with a healing thing or a potion then never mind that oh boy a little all right it's all good guys we're going to be fine then scanlan one will heal himself with a bonus action healing word and then he'll grab scanlan two and dimension door behind the dragon on the ground back there yeah back ten feet that would be great wait this was scanlan one scanlan one will walk around the side of the thing hey i've got all the words to make the girls like me she's grappled now so if we hit her it automatically hits right is bigby's hand a magic attack or a physical attack it's a melee spell attack okay then i'll change my plans and i'll do that scanlan two will cast bigby's hand at level-6 and pound her really hard shit is that 6d8 or 8d8 bigby's hand i always forget and it starts at 4d8 oh so it's only 6d8 yes you know what i'm going to do it at level-7 then okay that's fine all right so a bunch of d8s 17 plus 11 yeah one two three four five i like these 29 29 and then i guess as his bonus action he'll inspire vax who's not even here scanlan two only knows the songs of scanlan so he will sing weirdly hollowly (singing) when i get that feeling i want clarota healing (laughter) and then he moves he ducks back behind there yeah just peeking out a little so he can see where bigby's hand is so romantic she's going to die that would be crazy (whispered) chop off her hand with your rage matt don't forget those two guys that is not a place pew pew come on arkhan she's okay scanlan two's going to cast counterspell against a bat what does that mean snatched he doesn't like this no no it doesn't say that it's special why don't you plan a backup just in case guys what are those shirts can you hold up that shirt again oh there it is ooh they were to each other ashley johnson clutch bicoastal roll i can do something i can do one thing scanlan one will just hold his turn until those gloomstalkers are in range or until they move and then he'll cast i don't know frigging wand of magic missiles i don't know he's 150 feet away i can run 25 feet and then reach 120 feet i'm five feet shy he already did 150 getting to your turn so he'll be able to do another 150-- it's scanlan two's turn he's going to bonus action bigby's hand grapple one of the gloomstalkers the one we've been working on not punches grapple they're easily killed well do you want to kill them or save them for riding on well i'll just hold him for you one we're saving for him ooh then never mind we kill it it's an attack oh my god that was the most sniper thing you've ever done is he there no bueno radiant something right don't do that just to get there as fast as you can is it your turn keyleth vecna gives up we're fighting her again i don't know if you can cut the whole tower down they'll probably try to stop you don't you think do we see invisible doors can she talk can you make her talk you knocked her up maybe they'll think that it's just a fashion thing and they'll let her through i need a house can i take her branches and make one oh it's the giving tree (groaning) let's just charge in this is a fricking giant right we've killed giants this is the best plan stealth oh shit i rolled a two and a two so that's 15 and 15 we're going inside we don't need it anymore i mean what are you going to do with a flying thing in a narrow stairway we've seen inside we scryed inside it's a very narrow stairway going up oh yeah meet us up top (under his breath) he ain't going to survive that what are they doing pike can't you kill masses of undead wisdom intelligence or charisma has your wisdom gone up at all felicia day (gasping) oh no you just killed two of our friends pike no we should just run up the giant's going to take more than one hit everyone all healed up to full laura and should we pause and heal or-- if you take a potion you're full right don't you have your thing going or no is that gone oh i didn't know that wait we're doing a short rest wait who needs it don't you have a healing spell no no because it maximizes it bye vasselheim seems terrible we have potions can't we drink potions no we have other ones though no vasselheim it's a big tower there's lots of shit up there scanlan's got healing scanlan two's got healing we can pump you guys up how many can you include scanlan two has tons of healing spells that he can use so use them he's going to be dead soon anyway yeah i can heal you and heal you and heal you until you're all done it's a level one bullshit spell slot no short rest heal some people i'll heal some more we got this we got lots of healing great i will take it as well you said up to six people i'll take that i will cast healing word or scanlan two will cast healing word at 2nd-level for you yeah that's-- i don't have cure wounds that's nine more points for you yeah oh wait i can sing a song of rest yeah that makes sense i will heal you another 2nd-level healing spell that's another 12 points scanlan two we did it with an earring sorry you weren't on we're all on iphones and you're on a windows phone wait we're doing things that last an hour shit this is inspiring wow that was so inspiring i mean who's going to die pike can have one that's me technically he's not going to last that long guys pike i accept your blessing no what does it mean well what does it mean what could it mean just then the real scanlan comes back from peeing he's like what'd i miss guys (laughter) we're trying to decide whether we went left or right up the stairs what about the zombies no no his slave zombies scanlan two is okay he made a 17 scanlan one had a one i don't know dispel magic good question if only the person in here with me was also of gnome size oh wait she is we'll dimension door out i don't know how this spell works i hope it works we might get hit on the way out a charisma save is this magic okay 20 i've never had to make a charisma saving throw before wait did you switch your boots two shirtless hunky dudes holding each other in crazy poses yes we did fire stays where it is typically it doesn't move up full of chemicals that's all she has right scanlan will invoke the blessing of the knowing mistress i can't see anything everything's silver oh god i'm blind i'm just kidding i can see fine now's the time polymorph only lasts-- is it an hour or ten minutes i've got to learn this yeah sure scanlan two is going to dump a 3rd-level spell into the tome of isolation to reveal the hidden text is it only revealed to scanlan two or is it revealed to everyone no i do need to to reveal the text it's hidden otherwise i have a book i need to read standard undead i could hold one i could hold one paralyze one of them both of you guys got big damage unleash everything right as he runs scanlan says don't fuck this up (high-pitched) is that my girl is that my baby girl it's my baby girl-- yeah do that revivify them take the bands off and revivify them take it off of gilmore he's still alive save her right now i go grab her and hold her these are big spells aren't they shaun can you get them out of here no he's
