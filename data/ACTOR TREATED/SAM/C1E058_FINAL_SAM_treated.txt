yeah i’m hurt so maybe it wouldn’t work okay well what i was going to cast before he ran away was bigby’s hand and try to grapple him (singing) bigby's hand 5 what bigby but the hand is still there he’s somehow immune to hand-based attacks what if it were a foot would that have the same effect shit well then i flip him off with it but the british way (all laugh) all right i’m up well that didn’t work so i guess i’ll drop that and instead - jesus what else can he resist fucking shit how far is he from me okay i’ll use half of my movement to get up and i will stare daggers at him and cast eyebite against him yeah i’ll just do one of these and i'll sing at him i'll sing (singing) i hate rakasha so put another arrow in his body baby (others join in singing) i hate rakasha so come and take the time and fight with me (all laugh) fucking -

before we bid adieu i wanted - i can't believe we're leaving you again but i just wanted to clear the air a bit you know a short while ago i proposed marriage i've been thinking about it a lot - - and i hope you have been too anyway listen before you do what you're going to do and we're going to go off on our way i just wanted to say that i am here to officially absolve you of that proposal and i rescind it i was foolish to do so and i don't want there to be any strings attached when we leave and i think really with you on the cusp of parting ways and me seeing my daughter and everything everything's come into a bit of a clearer focus and i think i've always been in love with the idea of you you know you're so perfect and beautiful and smart and - but i don't want to love an idea i want to love a girl and i think in all of this time of pining after you i forgot to just hang out with you and know you as a person and i'm sorry for that so i'm sorry for objectifying you or whatever laura and we'll be friends we'll be friends listen i will always love you but i don't want this to be a barrier in our friendship anymore so i'm taking it off the table and besides all i really want is to matter to someone and i do now and that's very new for me and confusing and exhilarating and i've got to figure out how to do it and well i'll work on that and you work on whatever you're working on and i will say this before we leave i'm a little older than you so i can give you some advice i will say speaking as someone who has lost out on years of a relationship with someone i care deeply about if you have someone out there that you love you should tell that person or at least tell someone about it it's a weight that you're going to continue to bear and you're going to miss out on months and years of either knowing or not knowing you don't have to tell me but you're the bravest woman i know and you should be brave enough to just admit your feelings anyway i just wanted to say - ah it's not happening sorry just so i'm clear off the table now i'm sorry i just have to let you down all right well oh hugs of course of course yeah i go to see vex real quick yeah oi you oi remember when i did you a favor and you came to my room and i taught you how to fly the broom and you said you owed me one here's the payback you have to wear this fucking hat every time you fly (all laugh) it looks really cool thank you that would make me so happy the debt is paid yes the silhouette is beautiful on you ooh give it a try what to do in whitestone for 48 hours is it a profession of love (laughs) damn it it was that guy with the burnt chicken yes (laughs) shall we do we have to say a magic word can we say a magic word all right wait did it happen already we're still here but we weren't in the feywild were we maybe we'll find out who knows what we'll encounter wait what does she have is that a pike quilt
