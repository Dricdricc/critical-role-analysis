i don't really have anything prepared this week guys instead i thought i'd tell you a little story about something that happened to a friend of mine her name is jessie we grew up together in a small town when she went away to college she didn't want to go because she was a homebody her parents said just go have fun you'll love it she got to college a couple of weeks into it she and her roommate went out at night she came home she fell asleep they were a little tipsy she woke up in the middle of the night to this scratching sound and she couldn't figure out what it was she just went back to sleep got up again heard another scratching sound what was it she couldn't figure it out she went back to sleep the next morning she woke up her roommate the skin had been ripped off of her body and the cat that they shared had also been turned essentially inside out and on the wall in the blood of her roommate was written use code criticalrole for $3 off that's a lot of blood and it's a lot of savings for the new loot crate whose theme is horror channel your best final girl with items from the walking dead nightmare on elm street friday the 13th texas chainsaw massacre halloween and the story i just told hey should we open them up guys this is definitely horror let's open them and see what horror items we have look it's dark knight what's the pin the pin says loot year oh it's like goodyear but in all seriousness loot crate is a big supporter of the show so we want to support them go online go to lootcratecom/criticalrole sign up get subscriptions for all of your friends and all of your dead friends who died tragically in a horror (stage whispering) they're our fucking sponsors leave the box on the goddamn table is it about your friend who went to college (chuckles) we have no idea yeah i don't think so she took his designs we're all extremely emotional but we need to move quickly if we're going to do anything we need to collect all the guns there's only one so yes that's the one i don't think we can he's just a shadow isn't he orthax it's in the gun well that didn't kill it did it just got it out of the gun we have an airship maybe it can take us somewhere with trees wait does that send one of us back to her one living soul holding a dead soul going through yes no disrespect he's an object right now so if one of used the stone holding him it'd be carrying him like a sword he'd go through okay 16 18 shame intelligence check i could but-- oh my god why don't we ask kynan what it is maybe he's seen her use it yeah open that little box travis i open the latch box or she opens the latch box we all simultaneously tear it open should i take it out and take a look yeah could be i'll open it and look it over not good do i add jack of all trades is that a thing now 16 i am proficient in this 14 a gate scroll the scroll allows an arcane caster to use an action to cast the 9th-level spell gate am i an arcane caster also i might not be able to do it because it says level nine if the spell is higher than the level the caster can use then they must make a spellcasting ability check to succeed but it's a waste of a 9th-level spell or we could use this to go save our friend or it could bring a healer to us right now i don't know how death magic works i don't know if eight hours makes this huge difference all right but we have to collect things first we need all the guns even the broken ones if any one finds any of these they could be retrofitted or used for evil in the future and that's something that percy would not want ever i need to go find our dog he probably won't be able to be found but he could be somewhere and i feel like we should look in this cavern don't you think someone has to stay with him 1d12 i can keep him and he can help me look for the dog does he make one too 30 just scratch him behind his ear sorry maybe we'll do more next time we sleep yeah it's going to be a great night we'll hang out tell stories about percy cry a bunch yeah you're right all right what time is it how long have we been awake should we let the airship know so they don't keep hovering we have flares but we don't-- i guess is there anything we need from them they can bring the arm back to ank'harel weren't we supposed to bring her arm back to ank'harel we'll mail it okay we're not there how'd it go with damon i knew it aren't we not supposed to tell anybody about whitestone didn't we have some blood pact don't ever say the word whitestone also isn't it invisible great all right well maybe they'll find it anyway sure i'll house it up sounds good yeah we're still a team well we're not going to let him sleep alone we'll put him on a table and we'll all sleep around him on the floor it'll be super weird well we're recovered how'd you guys sleep everyone sleep okay not great got to find a tree where we going laura and okay that's where pike is right in the castle and that's where she was last seen resurrection what does that do does it just bring him back i don't know vex we could save 500 gold what was that ash no pike no or we could buy him a better tombstone if we had the extra money in the gun go to percy check just a check 11 how'd you do that pikey well you were dead weren't you could we throw the gun into the little hole under whitestone castle there is acid we could do the same exact thing on what can you do that to an object i would like to inspire her at least is that something that will help i think matt would i inspire pike or percy i see all right i'll inspire pike then i assume she's going to bring something to the ritual right i assume i inspire her the only way i know how which is being an ass so i'll inspire her with a shitty limerick i know a gunman with a white coif-a who acted evil and had a bad cough-a he learned that someone had possessed his big gun so i threw that shit in the lava (laughter) didn't you have that thing that brings your god to help once a day he's so quiet we should just let him sleep pike you're in a temple don't curse but-- ashley you did it you have one job ashley one job it's like that little doll hand on snl he's awake he's alive ow your home our home deader than dead she's torn asunder we have parts of her two i thought one was a fake okay all right that's a weird request when you just wake up well you spent last night on a table which is much beneath a man of your station yeah i wanted to use a gate spell to save you instantly but everyone else in the group said no they wanted to save it for something else (laughter) it's a hard yes i'm expecting (laughter) what do we have get it identified does it have to be a magic user to wear it groggy percy but you already have a vestige no groggy so does this go to percy that's pretty cool didn't he give us something to give to them did we do that yes we gave them what you told us to they told us you weren't potty-trained until you were six is that true you arm wrestle for

through the invisible wall could be a seal it's in marquesian what's the thing does it say something yes we do have to start planning for the next leg of our journey she froze she froze in a weird position (laughter) i am currently holding gilmore's severed head in my hands right blood spilled dripping-- percy died yeah percy died we need to resurrect him ready one two three (yelling) wise do we need to talk about our plans or are we waiting for percy for that i'll pull jarett aside real quick if that's all right well while she reads i pull jarett aside and i say listen i know you've had
