so guys i know we don't get political on this show a lot this is a place where we can get lost in the story and the characters and not think about government shutdowns or dems or republicans and all that but tonight i'm going to change all that i'm going political not just political i'm going super political because tonight-- it's a big announcement-- i'm going to announce my candidacy i'm running a campaign i'm going to run for the office of president of d&d beyond this is not a joke i am running a year-long campaign that will culminate in a vote and you will elect i hope me to be the president of d&d beyond you might have questions first of all is there a president of d&d beyond i don't know is it an elected office probably not but that doesn't matter to me because i am driven to make this happen tonight i'm going to kick off my campaign as every great campaign does-- play that music-- with a rousing inspirational campaign speech ahem when in the course of tabletop rpgs it becomes necessary to throw off the shackles of paper and pencil and assume the organizational powers of the ipad we hold these truths to be self-evident that all player characters are created equal except bards who are more awesome that all monsters shall be organized not by the color of their skin but by the challenge rating of their character that all people enjoy freedom of religion except in wildemount because they be assholes that monks somehow be allowed to attack like 14 times a round and that everyone sign up for d&d beyond for too long d&d beyond has suffered under the terrible leadership of someone i didn't look it up but whoever they are i know they have failed for example have you seen the guy they've tapped to do their advertising terrible friends if you elect me i will-- insert campaign promise here now i don't know what my campaign promises are but i will for the next rally ooh and slogans i need a slogan and you guys can help something like make exandria great again or i like pike or we are all the sam we believe in or something if you have a good slogan for me for my campaign go on twitter and tweet it to @dndbeyond with the hashtag samforpresident in conclusion-- conclusion conclusion conclusion-- what do we have to fear but fear itself those who refuse to learn from history are doomed to televise the revolution so ask not what your country can do for you let them eat cake and mr gorbachev tear down this wall thank you and god bless d&d beyond (cheering and applause) there'll be more campaign events as the year progresses i'll need to choose a campaign manager i'll need some slogans i'll need some logos one of you will be running against me we'll find this out as the year progresses i won't lose i'll get dani carr to do it it should be the phrase you could use that tonight wow are we all at the top of the tower are some of us at the bottom of the tower next one were we all together we were all together at the base of the tower is there a door on the other side 22 look at all of us you eat a hamburger with a fork and knife are you a communist oh boy we haven't been attacked yet we just heard a commotion inside okay what are we doing should we go in and investigate through one of these cracks sure is the damage what does that mean why don't we get close to the door in case something comes out and we'll ready our attacks oh then that's works well for our previously aforementioned plan if we can get that far i will use action and bonus to get over there-ish how far can i get okay and i'm somewhat obscured by the aquarium okay and i'll hold action of the tinkertop boltblaster in case anything comes out healing potion so you marked that down but that doesn't apply until my next round okay i rolled a 26 to hit okay do i get sneak attack or does she see me he it okay that is 18 plus eight that's 26 points of-- no plus five sorry 25 points of damage yes i turn to the group and go ah we do six oh god what is that is that an auto-crit we're stunned right this is the round plus anything to it oh wow (singing) lollipop lollipop oh lolly-lollipop travis and spell melee there's another one is she still stunned or is this out of-- i'll go first i don't know how powerful they are but i don't think i can kill one on one shot we got to get you out of this grapple oh no he's had the worst luck i think seeing the predicament that beau is in i'm going to cast phantasmal force against one of the ones that is grappling her i assumed good so they fail it doesn't much matter i want one of them to drop her grapple i'm going to do the one closer to me and the image that they see and feel is that of a tiny goblin girl jumping on its face and biting it in the eye i can roll for damage they suffer three points of damage and they have a goblin on their face covering their eye just the one creature because i'm hasted do i get a second attack okay i will now attack the other one with my tinkertop boltblaster oh wait do i get to add a plus four yeah one okay that's something 17 to hit okay and sneak attack 26 points of damage no 26 points of damage i'll do fury of the small that's an extra seven-- what are we at now then i will very conspicuously bonus action fire again that's 26 to hit plus another ten points of damage i'll move into the bushes there i know i can't hide but towards the tower patient defense whatever that is let me look each round on your turn i can deal damage my god this is a long-ass spell while the target is affected the spell treats the phantasm as if it's real the target rationalizes any illogical outcomes from interacting with the phantasm got it that makes sense i buy that yeah no that makes sense then this is the one that misses right beau you're still alive you're so dumb that you have to write down-- yeah there's four of them focusing on stronger things the goblin's still on its face i think you had it move but you didn't have it do an action yet i don't think i don't think you did an action for it you just tried to move monks are insane because i'm a rogue i'm going to go bolt bolt bolt and fire three times we got 25 25 and 11 nope 20 and then really low shit i didn't specify which one i've got to reroll all of them i'm rerolling all of them it's all good i didn't know i was going to have advantage all right first attack is 22 second attack is 26 third attack is 25 the one that looked real rough 17 plus five 22 the first time i rolled the first two hit and the last one missed want to go with those so two hits i would love the bolt to-- oh boy i would love for the bolts to go-- fjord's right in front of it right i would love the bolt to go out through its head and stop just shy of fjord's face so i should roll for those damage okay both were the same both were seven points is that the one that has the phantasmal force on it yes so that one also takes an extra five points of psychic damage from a goblin on its face it's a confusing fight ugh what does that do end it yash yeah you go first you're way closer i'll swim closer i'll fire actually with one hand i will take another swig of booze if i can under the water somehow and with the other hand i'll fire natural 20 do i double it dice damage is doubled (counting) 23 let's see here it's a crossbow bolt i would again like the crossbow bolt to tickle fjord's ear as it whizzes by yeah just a little sorry accidentally because i rolled a natural 20 i shoot again shit sorry sorry it's the thing it does it but the salt water-- (exaggerated swedish accent) no i don't roll for kelp while we're around down here can i swim around look for any other trap doors or doors or doors perception four four oh wait plus i get pluses on that 13 there's a door or something over here he cares about you oh that was a journey three why don't you guys go out there together on a walkaround just a little-- you guys could go together is all i'm saying no fjord fjord and jessie could go together sure but so are you and you could show him-- go on have fun take your time do you need any money i could try to move some of the seaweed with mage hand or something (whooshing) no but i will it's my job will it sting me i'll go down i'll push through and see how far i can get it's just dark and i'm at the top of it right that's where the roots were and it was growing up through the tunnel or something oof i don't see any signs of life or light or structures oh i'm terrible with this 18 what what was that (screaming) they went for my jugular i'll take out my wire and make a little phone call come in caleb hello will you let the group know that it's a 40-foot climb through dark grossness and then there's a chamber down here you can reply to this message i don't want to go back through it again so i'm going to stick down here if you guys want to come just come you can reply to this message last time you went down into one of these we had to make a very quick exit do we have a plan for making a very quick exit this is ball three travis and ball two wait you have two in you a skeleton is someone writing this stuff down do you have it all marisha i don't remember we're picking up coins matt 25 keep going five minutes she's searching for coins don't you need someone to stay with you in case you have to make-- what if you turn evil she did it better hand him that hat

sucks so bad yeah do something fuck yes wow that was amazing matt shit [break] i forgot to hand these out at the break if anyone wants a durian candy durian fruit candies guys yeah it smells and is made out of durian no it's got a wrapping on it you have to take the wrapping off it's a wrap-- it's good mmm do you open it like that or do you do one of these (flick) and then use it captain captain should i go under and ready the cannons captain aye-aye captain (screaming) yes special officer action you're the boatswain no you have access to these actions as well cannon attacks deal an additional 1d10 bludgeoning damage if the attack roll is one or two the cannon misfires and cannot be fired again it's an extra action other than just regular loading got it good synergy options how many cannons do we have how many on the side that's facing our interlopers huh captain the cannons are armed and ready give me the order for all of us or just for our boat you could throw fireballs and shit never mind 20 it's not jackfruit durian did we roll for the ship their sails do engage you want more while he's doing that captain should we turn to engage or no captain captain they're vulnerable turn so we can finish them off (gleeful quiet cheering) yes yes pack the good powder (laughter) they've got magic they could unflip their ship we don't know you have the order men fire sure three attacks which way did we turn doesn't matter okay seven seven 14 there's plus six to hit so 13 13 20 13 13 20 30 points of damage i want to do this fight maybe the cannon blast flipped it back over again and they've got a second wind i want to kill things with my cannons should we go rescue them get their shit the cannons are loaded again or all of them what if it's the same thieves who robbed us twice (laughter) taliesin way to break the game manacles i'm not on manacle duty fire (laughter) no we got one salty criss i'm sorry what was that last part you lost 14 crew are you wanted in a city there sidebar (clicks tongue) captain we're not welcome in one of these towns maybe we could make some sort of a trade give them some pirates that they've been looking for in exchange for immunity or at least clemency leniency not darktow what's his symbol there's also some coin that needs to be-- are we dividing it up among the group i'll do the math that's where i'm from i don't know am i hi what about me what do you mean what about me i just want to get off this fucking water i wouldn't mind swinging by if we're going that way just for a quick check in i don't know what our ultimate plan is do we need to go to any more ball places how do we do that ship no fjord do you have closure here on the open seas are you good did you learn who you are let's go speaking of stinky caleb what did we get what's all the stuff like a douche floats like in the air floats like a lantern what else what else to make you super strong more than once or just once we could get into a tower or something i do as am i my armor class is less than yours i do jester and laura are fighting right now i'll look at it we'll play cards for it tusktooth what about orly he's a reputable nicodranian we don't have that kind of-- intrigue secrets oh boy backstory we do yes oh well i don't know we're 100% sure that we're doing that but if we did it would be nice to just sort of swing through and see what-- because they said there was some damage so maybe just kind of see what damage has been done and if anyone-- you know (stuttering) yeah i'd like to check in just see how the place is doing and you know if everything's still there you know just make sure that everything's okay yeah it's a little complicated i really didn't like most of it certainly not my clan as i've told you guys you know there's a few folks that i didn't mind so much there was one gentleman i wouldn't mind just checking in on make sure he's okay (stuttering) no just a friend of mine that i just wanted-- no they're not my friends at all they're bad no this was just this halfling man who lived in the town near where the goblins lived and so i maybe just want to see if he's okay he was very special to me and i just want to-- i'm worried about him do you have anyone like that well you do just-- not at home yes oh i would assume not no they're not okay with me i did not leave under good circumstances with them if we pass through i would either not want to see them or if we did be ready for a fight mm-hmm (stuttering) yeah i don't really-- i'm sorry i'm just so nervous about it i don't want to see the clan ever again if i can help it well we might have to go through it to get past it but yeah i don't really consider myself one of them anymore and i just want to see if my friend is okay this trip on the water was not fun but-- but we did some good i feel like we're a little closer as a group and we got those books for you right and when we get some paper and some ink you can learn some new spells yes you would know that i have a knack for stealing things or what (gasps) well yeah i've found that it's pretty fun you can make people think things that aren't real and you can even change things from one thing to another you're very good at that aren't you [music] we should sleep good night wow what a way to start the year i know
