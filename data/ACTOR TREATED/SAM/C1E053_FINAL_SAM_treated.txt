fountain and hold it against a dragon this is our battle we're trying to kill these dragons two vestiges an army of 40 barbarians we're going to have to make that plan at some point i do have a napoleon complex no we kill it and run because we know where the dragon is we have an army we have an opportunity this is it we're never going to have an army and what if the machine fails we need a plan that doesn't rely on technology i'm sorry if we have 40 goliaths throw 40 chains attached to-- fine 30 goliaths would throw 30 chains with 30 spikes on them at this dragon i bet a few would hit yes we are super powerful they're strong we're smart let's do this so what we're never going to kill any of the dragons then because that will happen at some point and they won't react then it's-- this is our mission to kill these dragons all right if we find something cool we kill the dragon can i assist you guys not with music i'll send an invisible guy in there to start pressing on the floor and walls oi this-- what i don't even see what you're talking about oh i would've totally missed that (laughter) 13 want to throw a pillow down there well go get the pillow try again not me pikey pike

carefully worded letter we can't roam the city for days trying-- looking for some dead guy's daughter come on well then we should go bust her out should we sleep first and go at dawn what time is it wake his ass up that's you pike listen we have this herd they will be our allies for exactly one day in theory so if we do not use them to attack dragons can we at least use them to do something because they will no longer ever be our allies again after today we could use them to go try to kill the dragon on their own we could use them to try to kill something or someone else for us we could use them to try to help clear the city if we convinced them that it was in their best interest to-- 'this' you know we're all gathered here together so i'd like to take this opportunity with wilhand's blessing to propose marriage to you pike trickfoot will you make me the happiest gnome ever i'm sorry i couldn't contain myself any longer i know i'm sorry i've been thinking about it all night

fine she didn't say no oh yes i just don't know where she is so it's a bit stressful that's all she's safe though right just say yes yeah i thought so we're going to try to convince them to delay if they won't delay then we say all right let's go fight and we send them into battle you don't have to answer now no it's fine i was it was i was impetuous and silly and i don't know sometimes i get hamhanded around you-- i'm very smooth with everybody else i don't know what it is yes yes but you can't you're like a priest or something you can't lie i don't know i-- there was personal stuff in

who're abandoning you in the face of a tough fight i'm dead that's not very nice well i'm just a guest here so i don't want to spill anyone's blood in someone else's throne room so i'll be the bigger man and take a step back maybe we should just let them leave saves i'm getting pretty sick and tired of being called tiny listen i don't want to-- oi forget it guys why are we trying-- why are we trying to convince this asshole to fight with us let's just let him leave he's a coward does that include your wife or someone he might need it episode title barack is here what's that mean
