a range no it just lasts i'm coming great we're still peasants oh okay okay should we scout around and see if there's anything else around the hideout that we should be aware of or any other hiding places or safehouses we need friends is there a central meeting place is that a place where you can really chat up brand new people or is there a pub i guess it's not really a pub town is it okay we could go there what's the other one that sounds fun i might we're not trying to hide are we i rolled an 18 for something i'm better deceiving g'day sir i wish i had a yo-yo oh the wheel and stick

what he does everything i have is short i can just go in there and open it from the inside it's not concentration so i can just jump in there correct it's not concentration i don't think i can say i want to go ten feet in that direction before i do why are we trying to get in here i thought it was to meet people i don't think there's anyone in there okay good enough for me i go in we do have earrings 17 all right how big is this thing that's keeping the door shut a couple hundred pounds 40 or 50 pounds and how high off the ground could i touch it all right i'm going to try and lift it off athletics hmm not good 12 it's not going to do much there's a big heavy thing i get the sharp side all right i feel like there's some sort of spell i could use all right let's just do it your way yeah i've got a million things i could do bigby's is probably concentration but i've also got a potion of strength i thought it was no i want to follow this through plus strength 12 (laughter) i'm going to take damage oh i can't say god damn it in here i'm in pelor's-- sorry pelor god bless you gesundheit pelor man all right well jeez louise seems like overkill what about a thunderwave can i do that all

bigby's hand i'll just bigby's hand it's up there you can make it but percy can't you could probably yeah but i could blast it would be very dramatic to the right and up the saga of the door hey oi

me so five extra to that is 11 right no oh i see four so that's a nine all right i'm doing it step back all right i summon bigby's hand the mightiest hand that will ever unlock a door ever (singing) bigby's hand 12 plus eight 20 it took three spells to open this door three spells three spells and i injured myself welcome percy all of us 15 who reynal okay it couldn't just be ash from the thing that is burning paper it's a golden ticket copy they're making guns to do what someone who is working with sylas right okay i'm going to go up on the altar was there a small something on the altar can i tell how he died 23 not teeth are there any holy symbols or anything that we might take to give to keyleth to i don't know wasn't she gonna-- i don't know do some holy shit 19 what's that i grab percy and i make us both go invisible so what is that a 3rd-level invisibility spell ugh what if she was a good guy what if it's a good banshee some of the banshees that i've met have been decent we're rolling for initiative i'm glad i used half my spells trying to get into this goddamn place jesus matt i got a seven well i can't do anything 11 i also always have advantage so do i get to roll a third time not only do i shake it off i gird my loins so we're fighting it with wooden stakes does our meal help us with that at all okay 16 what no no he can't oh god very quickly should we flee in a little bit okay oh that's right god damn it shit i'll just lightning bolt her him it whatever it is oh just damage oh 8d6 do i get my hand cone so 19 8d6 great nope that's it i just need help counting 16 five 21 27 34 okay i will move back a bit away from the thing and i will-- oh we have people okay and then i can as a bonus action still get a bonus i will heal him this doofus here okay yeah (singing) i'm bring health points back yeah you mothafuckas don't know how to act-- yeah that's all i got (singing) take it to the bridge yeah but maybe i should do it at a-- just get you up okay 1d4 plus something two plus whatever six eight it's 1d4 plus five so it's seven points that's two it does if he dies once comes back and dies again is that two hey should we leave damn it all right i don't think eyebite's going to work against it so fuck i'll cast bigby's hand at 6th-level then i don't have any more 5th-level slots so i'm just going to make it even bigger i don't even know what it does okay yes i think-- i'm going to bitch-slap it but the forceful hand so i can just push it far away from us possibly to the front door yeah it takes no damage for that all right so then i'll just hit it i'll just hit it hard 14 plus what am i adding oh nine plus nine 6d8 i don't even know what those are that's a ten there they go i got one i'll just roll it six times 24 even at 6th-level that's all it did what what but i'm so little and wee yes i lift myself up with bigby's hand yeah that was a great idea whoa oh shit percy i will also sing for him a song of rest which is just another d6 yeah oh are we clear of danger what are we doing here should we check this other room first before we go quickly though quickly 22 any provisions that we can take water food well let's leave them a sign we're supposed to be sowing discontent right so let's leave a sign that someone was here and fucked up their shit do you want me to pee on the altar no don't leave your dagger it's your only one left whoa this is our sign that's a lot of words deception please (sings a ditty) i'm just a peasant boy 32 i blacked out the windows at night use the green one this is you doing greenery natural 20 easy or a six so the ground is cursed well poo you know what we need to do hydroponics no ground just grow it above guys i just want to say that i killed a door and a banshee so-- yeah the door was harder to kill who's that is that who they were talking about today the group oh sir kerrion i thought they said something else you think if we find him kill him and leave his body on some sort of public display it would sow some seeds of rebellion we could grog could you do something nasty to his body all right ask around let's just go house to house and kill everyone in all of them yes we could be mormons until noon tomorrow right yeah 17 i don't even know where that is on the sheet logenzes sir kerrion only one way to find out burn every house down except for those three mansions and see who runs out you want to all be peasants again can we not just disguise ourselves in tattered clothes oh wait we could just leave the bear behind he could guard this safe house and then we could go find another safe house all right fine seeming it is we're all peasants and he's a donkey and i'm a little boy of course you can i'll give you two crazy eyes is there a basement oi grandma any yo-yos in there oh until noon thanks grandmama let's just take a walkabout and see if there's anything else around the area are there guards out front or anything or is it just a gate do you want me to go in just whoever's in there well you know i'm just a little peasant boy is anyone else on the street i bet it's empty i mean it's a temple the other one was i thought so too i can just pop in there and see who's in there and pop out i'm just a peasant boy you wouldn't kill a harmless peasant boy let's get out of here take a walk we're going to take a walk towards the lady's chamber we're not going in have we passed any people can i go talk to them oi excuse me my papa sent me to send a present a gift of sorts to a sir keri kurion kerrion we're just looking to see where we can deliver

(laughter) (singing) consider yourself (speaking) oh that's a different show but they're allowed to assemble to the-- to the house and who is she to you wait she's the one who killed a bunch of your people right like a flintstone's vitamin except it's assassination do you need some healing are you okay scanlan can make you feel good he's probably been up tinkering all night any other safe houses potential candidates yes but after we kill this thing we're going to need to know where to go thoughts we need a place to retreat to immediately it's an amphitheater isn't it shouldn't we have a backup plan in case they turn us out onto the street that's a good plan they probably have some good wine all right let's go assassinate someone they also have technology now they have weapons guns that they're developing it could be a threat to many many other people as the oldest among us i say that he's fine well i assume so how old are you people yeah let's go vax you have your daggers back

because i rolled a two they're watching tv ooh thank you is our meal still affecting us yes let's go in quick there's two guards should we do a diversion for the guards yes but once we go through the fence they might i don't know all right you want to sneak in all right sure if i puffed some smoke would it draw attention to us okay then never mind is that going to burn his hands it's raining it'll be fine why don't you just hit it with something but that'll be loud plus ten 17 they might okay wait what you rolled a three and it becomes a 20 one room at a time we have to get up through this latch and there's people right above us i think you should have some fun too but before we do anything do you want me to send a cloud up there of gross smoke to smoke out the area liam and it'll be fine what could go wrong this is a stealth mission we'll be in and out of here in six minutes if we do this right let's go go go bonne chance vive la résistance hold two gentlemen grog up first 18
