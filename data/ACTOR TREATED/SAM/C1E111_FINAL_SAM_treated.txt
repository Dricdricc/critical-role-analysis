told me to start paying attention to the cadence of the steps to see if they change in any discernible way 15 he's big i think it's just a vanity pressure knobs human bones only ones and 20s tonight and say goodbye is vax in the room the brazier's the source of the furnace i assume wait before we do that i'm going to enter the room and look around at the walls and the ceiling i'm looking for markings indications of instructions arrows any hidden words-- ooh a lot 29 wait so the wall that we came in through i think there's magical buttons in here and we need to find them so i'm going to look in the mirror i go to the opposite corner and do the same thing even in the mirror they were upper and lower corner yeah it's so far i don't know can i see it oh yeah 14 plus six that's 20 keyleth do that same thing to the lower one same marking same symbol let's do that to the other walls and see if we can find other ones so we push those but there's a hidden button in there so we're going to need four people not the buttons that we can see what are these symbols here i think they're buttons as well was there anything there what do they do what do these lines do wait you guys are blowing on the arcane symbols and that's two lines boom blow laura blow wait so we've got one two two four except we have two twos and no three and then why not three okay all right can we do a sweep for more possibly not too long i'll look in my memory one hour but i have to be close to it how big is this room from the doorway to the mirror is it less than 60 feet oh then i can be out of the door am i right with what i wrote down there yeah from the brazier-- frasier crane looking at the door that we came in right i think matt you're wrong guys shadow of war it's a great game by-- i don't know who makes it warner brothers yes so now we've just got to do it all right should we leave the room and have mr invisible start tapping buttons all right we'll do that would a person who cannot fly be able to touch the top buttons shit want to give him a pole or something do we have a stick in the bag matt can he hold a lance or is that violating some-- he's not allowed to hold weapons i conjure an unseen servant whom i will name simon two all right simon two take this lance we're going to go tell you what buttons to press over there good speed-- good speed (laughter) okay so two upper right two pokes oh wait yes we're going to go mirror image of this so project that across the room oh that was the mistake yes mirror image of this so upper left let's try that any door so below it two presses just like your name simon two okay opposite corner up one press and then below that bottom corner four presses simon two is coming with us we can see it grog any roll want to fly through here can we fly i know that's why we just fly through what are you talking about why would vecna keep the thing that could kill vecna near vecna all right let's swoop in and swoop out you want to go to sleep in this undead city so sacrificing vasselheim so that we can feel better about a fight well let's stay on the path and see how long it takes is that purple eyeliner they need somebody who can help them

going too oh wait shit your fucking ring all right into the temple come on let's just fucking go to the fucking temple oh we're all rolling stealth 25 he's so excited about that temple so a rock just fell and is in pieces no we're trying to go towards the temple oh the filter the censer are the undead all around the temple are there any bone laying around i am going to pick up two bones give them to simon two and tell him to go across the street 50 feet away from us and wait there in some building hold these bones smash and grab you could go in there and get that thing be out before they even saw you in there he's 50 feet away right now and he's waiting to make noise he could he could go and pick it up and come right back with it if he picks up the crystal and it doesn't work or it doesn't move we need an escape plan right how many can fit on the carpet we don't need to discuss this now we need to get the crystal and get the fuck out of here yeah of course no he can't he's done with his wings we have too many people for the carpet and the broom we can leave trinket i can burn a spell and be a giant eagle or something we could just run up away every organ in a body has an entrance and an exit right wait no lungs don't they just have the one i can recall simon 2 i can send him across the room make a bunch of noise draw a bunch of people over there you run grab the crystal and then we hustle out of there and there's going to be a floating crystal that marches across simon 2 is going to go get the thing let's say they all start watching the thing come towards us grog are you here are you with us can you throw something across the room to make a noise this is a terrible plan guys i'm just going to say this one more time before we do this he's way faster than simon 2 simon 2 could create a distraction he could (snatching noise) all right simon 2 come back with your bones all right simon 2 go to the middle of the room throw the bones away far then grab the crystal you don't have pockets run back to us away yeah should he cover it with a blanket or something do you have a hood so it blocks the light all right so go put this handkerchief on the thing pick it up and bring it back to us go simon 2 you're our only hope he's holding a blanket taliesin and give me the bones i put the bones down here's a handkerchief you'll put it over the crystal pick up the crystal and bring it back to us right before he picks it up hock a rock as far as you can that's a good guy that simon 2 they were innocent 77 you've served us well what about a tunnel or anything i didn't do
