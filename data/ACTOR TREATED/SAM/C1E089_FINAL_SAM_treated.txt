incompetent plan and ambushed by a surprise from a kraken we nevertheless stayed 'true to ourselves and to our bravery found the lodestones and despite nearly dying came back to 'tell the tale proving ourselves as heroes of vesrah and to each other i was aided by young 'percival in my fight abandoned by the antlers and the elves and by the end of the fight it was 'just me and the big guy duking it out i blacked out for a moment but before i did i'm sure he 'saw my bravery and was impressed that's why he dragged me to safety and presented me to percival 'for healing' that's enough for now it's not-- this is the abridged-- i don't want to bore the readers with too much detail somehow i got to the rift door and i didn't get there on my own so thank you thank you big guy for dragging me there i appreciate it oh taryon darrington we passed briefly in whitestone i'll switch to gnome and i'll say oh you're friendly with these people as well they've taken me in and they're showing me the ropes of adventure and we've already done quite a lot we were on a boat that was attacked and we almost died but i destroyed the beast that was attacking us with a bit of magic i have a lot of tricks magical things that i think you might even understand because it seems that you are a magic user yourself the resurrection thing that you just did was amazing i've never seen anything like it and it was quite astounding for somehow who's not really here hello oh sorry sorry by the way how is my accent i haven't had a chance to practice gnome on an actual gnome in a long long time since i was a boy oh i apologize profusely for butchering your language i learned it by books and as i've said i've only had a chance to speak it once before to a gnome who visited my family's estate a long time ago i didn't catch the fellow's name he was part of a performing troupe that my father hired to entertain us on new year's eve and they came in stayed a few days i remember quite vividly though that they left in a hurry something went on with one of the members of the troupe and my father's handmaiden and he was very upset with it and he chased them all off in the morning i didn't get to continue practicing with him all i know is my father was so upset something happened in his room he had to burn his bedsheets and i think he got a new bed i don't know quite what happened but it was quite a dramatic thing i was only about 12 or 13 at the time well he had a sharp wit to him and-- not very attractive young man but-- that's amazing really and is it true that you live hundreds of years and-- is-- oh i-- i was misinformed i will i-- i will-- i was planning on doing at least one chapter in my book about the smaller races and that would be an excellent-- -- an excellent fitting uh addendum

you're giving this to me you're giving this to me i drop to my knees my lady i cannot express to you what this means to be accepted as a full-fledged member of this team and-- (sounds of protest) -- i suppose finding that lodestone and helping you on your 'acapakay'-- -- was enough to win over your good graces i've watched you in these last few battles and you have been powerful-- i wasn't done powerful confident and enthralling and i vow to use this to the betterment of our entire team to make sure that none of us fall in battle not me not percy not you not either of the elves not short

it out you and me 'til the very end of that fight and well as one seasoned warrior to another-- do you have any tips any notes for me any thoughts to improve my warfare skills should i move more
