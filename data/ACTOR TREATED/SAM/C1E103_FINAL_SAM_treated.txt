my kids are they going to have their little fans on tonight to keep them cool are they going to light candles in their room i don't know they are definitely watching twitch maybe if they can find the living room it's dark oh yeah they have their wine aerator they each have their cell phones they're okay (laughter) i walk up to her and i set down his armor and don't say anything there's nothing left he was obliterated is it all diamonds it-- yes it could be vecna watching us wait can i take a closer look at it and see if i can i don't know identify it somehow no but can i just see sure two plus five can i try to remove it from the ocular cavity yeah my tiny ocular hands nine i can inspire myself i suppose two right i didn't cutting words anyone those count as inspiration right i'll inspire myself just to give it a serious try that's plus ten so that's a 19 plus i guess three for jack of all trades 22 oh no insta-death no i'm not oh is this magic do i get advantage way better but still terrible 12 a one 13 it's the same thing so it's 13 can i see it was speaking to me i don't exactly remember but it had some really strong arguments i guess yeah it was offering me things it was telling me it could help i've never felt that way before it was amazing can you try is it beneath the ground is it invisible it burrowed i don't trust that thing i mean i don't trust it near us percy i think you need to give it to me to hold no i can take care of it better than you just give it to me trust me i want revenge on this eye give it to me so i can get revenge i think i should hold it what if it can still hear us sense where we are that is true that is a very good point if we rest i may be able to make them how big is that but how big how many i can make them we just need an animal as much as the animal i mean i know you're grieving but we could give trinket up for this it was worth a try taking out a loan to buy diamonds we could try mine first and if it doesn't work-- but i need to rest i can't do anything today give it to me i'll take care of it i'll send it away to a place where only i can get it but it's a personal plane it's my plane i am not i don't know how this works my daughter taught me this spell i've never used it before it goes into a little pocket dimension is what she told me i don't even know what that means here let's try something just give me something i'll send it there now i don't know what that'll do give me trinket i can't do trinket it has to be less than five pounds yes yeah give me anything sure all right i will use wrist pocket i don't know where they are i literally have no idea but watch this i don't know how i even do that no the eye i can get rid of the eye maybe we should vote on this should we give it to me who says aye i don't have that much i don't have enough aren't you low pike like 11 or something i turn him into diamonds no it can work on anything i think i've never turned anything into diamonds you're right in retrospect i should have been doing this literally every day i just learned the spell a week ago yeah but look at this it's gone it's back cool right you guys need more healing i could try to give us more she says to a nearby tree i can't try anything today no everybody but grog a whole new show by the way audience travis pointed out as we left they might not know what we were talking about when we all said oh we're going to jack off now it means unplug our microphone cords we're not-- why was liam crying in the hallway jacking in i can verify that none of us listened or read anything about what just happened we were jacking off the whole time (laughter) you need to rest you've got to get your spells back man (whispering) get on that (laughter) it's powder from the movie powder what has happened just come down she's a doctor it's fine it's three bpm i've got one perception oh it's passive good morning i come down and join everybody i look in my pocket to where i was keeping the dust that was vax is there anything there this is you i feel like i should still keep this wait have we tried-- hey can you cut your hand do you bleed how did this happen you made a deal with your god or something if we defeat him do you go away so if we win you lose well that's a brave choice i don't mind it it's fine we have vax now no matter what happens later this was a brave choice i'm not sure i would have made the same but we're stronger together and thank you for coming back it's a harder choice to come back it's easier to walk away i know this thank you for coming back maybe this will make you more fun to be around too you used to have this death wish but now it's done now you pop a beer it's his birthday he can do whatever he wants wow ice cold it's super greedy (laughter) oh good you

our game what are we trying to get okay so our game is to intimidate him into having him give you one of the wishes back what happened to the deck of cards why are we going back to get-- oh he has more wishes not more cards he has more wishes and he should give one to us what would you wish for you don't seem enthusiastic about that wish that's a better wish for you for sure and we have two of them that's true it'd be nice having you around for a bit peace on-- yeah well probably do you just get one wish because i could be a littler taller a little buffer what would i wish for take this hat
