i can't remember it now me i'm the worst 13 no you can tell us about the ritual ritual yes it was successful remind me what it was again there's been so many rituals lately not the tomb takers that was the splinter group right that is not a good answer fjord say something caleb are we doing this all right i'll follow suit (hisses) let's gamble i watched her play last time i could do-- i don't-- (stutters) why don't you do it i'll just drink-- i need just a little loosener oh god have we seen anything suspicious from the deals or the-- plus four did you start with 50 though that's the first thing we've ever won (laughter) we did yes we fought and killed a giant spider of sorts is that the goliath sorad we're very strong as you can see yasha is very strong (quickly) we don't know anything about that we had nothing to do with it i'll offer him a napkin he seems like he needs-- he's schvitzing i mean it's not even humid in here (whispering) he's got a problem how do we know that you can clear our name we've proven to you that we're lucky you know our reputation we don't know anything about you if i may we passed a test for you would you pass one for us may i have three of those vials just the empty ones if i were to fill two of these vials with ordinary alcohol and one with something else would you be able to tell which is which with your discerning eye and your years of experience i'll take out my shitty flask as my good one is gone fill two vials with alcohol and then take out my vial of acid and pour it into the third are they reasonably the same colorish all right i'll take a little splash of alcohol and some darker stuff and mix it around all right this one is the acid these two are booze and now i will try to (rapid movement)-- 15 yes if you die i'm sorry ooh shit that's baller i don't know what to roll it's 1d6 or something what do i-- i got to look it's here acid vial 2d6 11 (gulp) (gulp) yep yeah that's good that was impressive i mean you pass the test sir (growling) (nervous humming) you know dander why are you locking your ipad between every move trying to throw it in the garbage but it hit your balloon can i wander over and see if i can overhear anything 12 if you're not going to answer any questions can we please direct some to yasha over here where were you where'd you go why did you leave she left us before we were ambushed in alfield and when she left us this time we almost died in this plot to overthrow the empire or whatever it was with crick soldiers maybe it's related if you told us what it was we could help you lots of pressure maximum amount of pressure i am not it seemed like the gentleman-- who's very impressive by the way-- knows a lot about stuff including the fact that we were involved in a plot to frame the sutan fellow do you think he would know if the xhorhas invasion at the same time as our little plan was a bigger conspiracy were we set up i don't know but it seems coinky-dinky that we were there on a night when towers were exploding you're so coy what was it oh xhorhas assassins tried to steal a box of some sort that was a weapon of mass destruction or a portal to another dimension or some sort of fount of energy that powers their race we have no idea but they stole it we encountered them in the sewers we did not kill the xhorhas assassin but he was killed shortly thereafter and we stole his magical dodecahedron all you need to know is the people from xhorhas are dead now do you know people from xhorhas who are you yes you're a cr-- can i say crick is that okay do i have to be a crick to say it you're from that part of the world you don't know if you were born there or grew up there don't we need to talk to kara no she's right here today ah i'll eat you do you know lucien too i think they're talking about the sword jester has it doesn't she taliesin and jester by the way you seriously-- your farts have been disgusting tonight i've been sitting next to you all night  and it's just foul foul we can pass out the sword later but do you think it's something you could use what does she wield usually could you have it as a backup weapon or something could you dual wield sure i could use it as a makeshift shelter can i just clock the tabaxi and see where that satchel with our blood in it is did she happen to put it down while she was over why why would i do that i do not people hate me there's no part of this that i want but if you'd like to go over there i'll be your second yeah i'd be comfortable talking to that little crazy gnome all right we can go talk to the ogre all right sure can we go by the bar though going to swing by the bar i need a refill going to give the bartender my flask and say could you fill this entire thing up thank you i don't tip (laughter) we'll go over to the ogre i guess what do you call a deer with no eyes no eye deer (laughter) it didn't work it looks so painful good to meet you no it wasn't me i didn't do anything let's go is dolan gone already got it 104 gold how many silver what did you say oh oh i think there was one thing tell us everything about you are you fucking kidding me leave leave horris leave it could be but you have secrets too and you're a pair you know i distinctly remember a moment when we were the shady pair of this group but now it looks like you guys are now i'm hungry for pears angsty teen would you like a drink here it's filled with many alcohols from different taverns i stole three empty vials from that place i'm very excited about them they're empty but they're still really shiny but seriously were you dead jester would like to cast zone of truth she says (as jester) i would like to play truth or dare but without the dare i got a one natural one ten dollars to 826la (cheering) what that's even better okay you're in like your life reset somehow or you just don't remember everything before two years ago is nothing to you black any of them i have three of them (dink) that's amazing i would ask about how you discovered that because that would not be something that i would ever just do just to just see but we'll leave that for another day question go back two beats you said who cares about what happened before do you really not want to know your past answer truthfully yasha has a crush on me nonagon i'm sorry to belabor this but what if you had a good life before this what if you were famous or rich or had friends or family empty empty no what do you mean yes you can imagine what it's like what it's like to not feel anything before this moment have you died before that's true but it's not who you are is the moonweaver not real if you always lie and bullshit how are we ever going to believe you he has to be telling the truth which tattoos are the old ones i mean i don't want to see your naked body or anything but do you have some what does that mean what does it mean caleb what does it mean red eyes or something get out the black light they're not tattoos they're just markings they were just there no that's very interesting good to know i feel like we should do this every night but i will say this lucien it's terrible it's like a kid with a soft mustache that's not like a real-- you know like a-- i think that you need to know where you've been to know where you're going and i respect your feelings-- i feel like when you're ready to know your past i would support that and i would help you find it me too is the spell gone goddamn it yasha tell us everything fuck i think we all-- did we all find out no the one-- you mean the-- anyone need to go to pumat's she's never met pumats sols it's a quartet it's a doo-wop group they all sing bass seems pretty aggressive for a favor germans don't tell jokes (laughter) zemnians experience only pain (laughter) is everybody going to go (as jester) i have the diarrhea (laughter) (laughs) whoa tough if you need a loan i can-- were there any throwing weapons that you have even if they're enchanted would she like that she doesn't like to throw daggers she only likes to throw-- what does it do it comes right back to you a dagger that comes back to you caleb did you hear that that's incredible oh i'm fine he's already-- they're already making me something throwing a dagger just seems so inelegant to me i don't know why they're meant to cut food and to eat food with is my flask coming along all right add any sort of shiny finish to it or some extra flair or baubles to it that would be fine thank you all right thank you jester's not with us should we go on our mission or should we get rid of horris drop off horris and then go do we know where we're going for this mission okay it was an accident there was nothing suspicious about it yes yes dweez i'll hold onto caleb as well oh ugh thank you who's piloting our boat she's piloting-- do you know how to drive a boat (scared noise) oh okay you're so needlessly scaring me for no reason i'm going to place on my ring of water walking that i stole from jester what do i do with it (shouting) what do i do with it no i've never thrown anything in my life as he's talking i throw a gold coin at his head that's a d20 i mean that's a natural 20 do you want me to redo redo way less dexterity what ten
