little dainty gnome (laughter) right good thank god don't kill the giant don't kill him don't kill him we need him we have a mind flayer we have magicians we have all sorts of things he is our wrecking ball he's our way in yeah yeah he is our ticket into the palace one many have before we're capturing the giant and don't remind him i'm here that's what it says in the book what's the spell name orion and oh a lariat of truth double grapple she's getting closer to me you're going to talk you're just appealing to his reason twice don't fall on me where's my dice where's my 20 oh here it is plus what 17 do we get free attacks on him (laughter) i'll take it that's a plus that's a positive we are grappling the hell out of him grog you might have to talk to him again just hold him how did you do it you had another one (whispers) okay he's asleep okay we have a mind flayer yeah clarota is a mind flayer it's his bag until it resists that's no good we need to rest and it lasts for 30 days put him in the bag of holding don't worry about his dinner right now let's figure out how we're going to control it okay let's manacle it let's at least try to hold it chain it up no they're inorganic i can't do anything to those i have poison i have drow poison from a previous adventure that's a knockout drug isn't it damn it 20 you don't have the spell right with our puny chains we also have our never-ending rope don't we sure yeah why not she's just casting right i'm going to inspire her somehow i'm going to inspire her with a song spellcasting dc what's your dc what's he saying oh it's not giant she's the one the accent is on the 'kh' is it like a french person (french accent) i don't know what you're saying oh 'unh' oh i understand now where he's asking where we should tell him she's going to translate go ahead and translate that i speak keyleth (laughter) we did he didn't give it tiny that's clever you found booty beautiful things should go to pike i think i just feel that the gold of the javelin would match the gold of your heart sounds a little read-y bolt of lightning five feet wide basically it's just lightning but in a javelin fomorian just before we rest does anyone have knowledge of his race and his species any of his weaknesses or strengths can i do a history check that's a one nature check just to see what are his strengths and weakness what about his race foh-moh-ree-ans it doesn't have to do it with all its heart do we know what sorts of things he either hates or likes that's pretty good too i'll sleep near you kima suit yourself well let's rest in shifts no we don't want to seem aggressive towards him that's a good question we're not going to mount our full attack are we we could until when you want it out of the temple or giant that metal well not everything i can get the giant inside the temple it will never work it'll never work how would you get the stone cold enough you would need all sorts of sides to add to it to fold into it it's a terrible idea all right how far is the forest before the city that plan is growing on me let's take a rest tomorrow we can stealth in and get some intel a suicide mission he was born for this we should do some recon there might be beings or creatures around there that we can distract use to our advantage something all right but we don't know how we're going to break that thing we don't have acid how much we do have that yellow vial we don't know it could make it stronger i have a dagger that i never use great rusty instruments i use my minor illusion to create a (failure horn sound) (laughter) oh pike chatroom please help out ashley good that's good good on metal how about a giant dropped him i think what vax is proposing is to create a diversion down there while we work on the metal try to weaken it great let's hear it your name is confusing to us this is why we wanted to call you clarence sorry sorry seems too complicated complicated engineering and it's made of metal and glass so if it falls it would be bad on the brain yeah we should go have a look tomorrow morning why because-- no we're not going to get caught yeah we should go we should know all we can know oh shit oh god that's our giant we will fill that cask with ale this is a promise cask all right shall some of us stealth ahead to the temple to see what we can see or should we set out on foot as well yeah it's just a foot don't go crazy with it pike yes what is the plan are some of us setting out on foot or are we just sending-- on foot on the carpet okay just recon all right i'm with you what does it do it's just us two farewell pike i'll miss you what my love all right off we go (sings) i can show you the world i leave it to you 18 many figures we need that big brain on our side unless we all go in from the top what will we be doing in the meantime we rage (laughter) evacuate it via air may i throw a wrinkle into things those bats didn't look good those are eyes that he's using to watch things above so we gotta get through the bats first or distract the bats or get rid of the bats no no no the bats will ruin our element of surprise we don't even know what we're doing so that's either a distraction or taking care of bats yeah but if we float then we're going to float right through the fog grog had annette back in emon she was great we have camouflage no no he'll need a door to let in other people yeah we are can we-- before we make this journey can we sound off who's on what duty who's on damaging-the-device duty who's on-- who's on the shutting-off-those-doors duty is that a thing that we need to assign to someone that could be you but you're not going to be there you'll still stay behind i will inspire him (sings) everything is awesome sam and and when he attacks us what do we do we're effed just to clarify before we go i am dropping a giant mouse in there right laura and okay come on let's go have some fun good pep talk ooh oh kima clarota are you going to put your-- we're a well-oiled machine how are we getting there (groans) it's also an easy way out i have one more plan just to throw it out there just occurred to me it just occurred to me it could get us into the temple a different way but not into the chamber i could make us all look like illithids he could read our minds but we'll be outside typically it's yes and clarota but all right (laughter) what are we telling the-- hey hey what are we telling the giant to do knock the cross or attack k'varn i make him a mouse (laughter) all right let's go how does grog get anywhere i forget us too is trinket worth it (laughter) there's just a limited number of spells of course trinket is worth it i was saying-- i was being bizarro scanlan don't take offense but we can leave kima she can't do anything for us up here she has no ranged attacks she's useless in a sexy way we're still doing shifts then it's the same issue to fly a mile wait what did you do you're staying oh what are kima and clarota-- i'm going to in front of us using minor illusion i'm just going to create a floating bald eagle thing to distract the bats with it's just flying around stealth isn't dexterity is it 23 the bats wait when we've arrived is anyone going back no who's going back and you're going back to pick up the others i'm flying i'm flying bats persuade those bats i'm not with her i don't even know this is going on it could be anything before he does can i-- i'm going to just see if there's any magic protecting these-- the metal or the joints 23 yeah of course is there any purchase like can a hand grip the metal pole you're not with us you stayed on the carpet and do what loud we can fly up and just drop him down like a big giant bomb we can take him up up up and just drop him how much does he weigh a ton that'll break it (laughs) let's drop a-- let's drop a giant bomb on him i don't-- i think dropping three tons on him is going have much more-- all right who's flying the mouse up i'm polymorphing him i'll make him drop come on let's do this on the carpet go do we die with honor cages of bad guys i think matt had things printed in a 3d printer for this so it's pretty pretty cool i won't let you die pike that's a crazy roof party okay drop it drop it like it's hot i'll cast inspiration on this gentleman for his throw oh pike grog percy you get inspiration and vax (sings) and so i come to you with inspiration vex or vax when he falls (yelps) un-polymorph it's a falling giant the german judge doesn't like it but because he is enchanted he can still attack right not me you don't pick me up (laughs) two question sorry what happened to the big mind-control device is that disabled so the mind flayers as far as we know might not even be under-- okay we might have to get grog out of there somehow we need to run you have inspiration should you need it thanks for the clarification guys come on this is like piece of cake there's one guy there's like eight of us yeah don't fall yeah i think that's fair okay let's leave keyleth here and just go yeah just go she's grappling you're the worst oh boy our healer is about to die boy oh boy you say you can take a hit okay chain lightning scroll it's the biggest thing i have it's a scroll of chain lightning i can't cast it at my level so it's gonna be just a 50-50 shot whether it even works ability modifier ten plus five seven eight nine-- i need one more okay (nervous laugh) someone do math 15 20 21 25 30 (clears throat) 44 i can choose the other the other guys in the cage in the cages yeah then yeah yeah that i have a bonus action there's nothing-- oh and a move i think i'll stick but as a bonus-- shoot i've used all my inspiration already right i can't do cantrips as a bonus right okay then never mind (grog voice) i would like to run that was your stealth with advantage 18 because she cast enhance dexterity thank you keyleth whew grog you okay strength may i use my cutting words it's not an attack okay then a strength saving throw oh with advantage oh good ee not good ten oh into the room but i don't want to be in there 17 no 19 no problem easy easy thank you pike i stand i look at the creature no i don't look at the creature (laughs) i just sort of look near the creature and i will punch it in its face with bigby's hand hand is an object that has an ac of 20 strength of 26 blah blah blah it's the clenched fist it's a melee attack it's like-- d20 ten (laughs) right yeah i'm not very strong damn all right are you still hurting grog as my bonus action i'm going to give grog some more healing yeah
