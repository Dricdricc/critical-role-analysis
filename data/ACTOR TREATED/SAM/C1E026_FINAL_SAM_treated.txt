not everyone we're missing two a male and a female maybe he needed some comforting i'm not saying that okay but if there's a sock or a gun on the doorknob don't go in oh beard check all right let's go (laughter) my god grog percy's a hoarder or he's in serious distress the hoarder we must find him don't you think our friend's in trouble i proceed down to his tinkering lab doesn't he have some sort of lab downstairs well that goes with your character can i reach the eye vent no he's working too hard maybe we should just leave him be seems focused driven like a madman i don't think you do would you like a meal brought down all right if you're making things a little ladder for the little perch here might be nice just in the future but not now that seems low priority all right so we go back up tell the fellows percy's in a mood he's creating right now i think we should just leave him be yes i know percy's hate-smelting downstairs yes i feel responsible \ what no spit it out what did he say it seems important is it fuck is it shit thought he was just trash-talking you think there's more to it well we all have some secrets that's a fair point though we'll keep an eye on him he seems to be in a fragile state right now did we kill her i thought we just made her sleep and then walked away tiberius you killed an old woman are you saying that we should take it down a notch or maybe not brutally destroy the bad guys i made her go to sleep that was peaceful are you taking moral exception to some of our behavior well this is something perhaps you should pray on and think on if there's something you'd like us to change about our behavior we can consider that we're all friends we're allies here we should pay respect to you all right you know this is constructive criticism and we'll take it as such and i for one will maybe not desecrate and denigrate bodies oh i'll shit on things maybe not people he can't count this is an intervention we love you very much but you killed an old lady kill softer let's table this we'll stick a pin in this discussion we'll all be thinking long and hard about this did she see the fight there were those guards too there was guards outside the door oh yeah well he's not feeling well today after the events of last night so he stayed behind i get advantage and i rolled a 27 cleric tristan also treated him last night for his vampire-inflicted wound i know this all looks really bad on the surface and we did not want to cause any disturbance within these hallowed walls but there was a danger we acted perhaps too abruptly and without telling you if you're worried about lies within your own ranks i think you should start with him help him oh (chanting) what ability objection that's it i just wanted to say that please continue i just want it noted that we object strongly to this are we still allowed free rein to roam about as we please are we under arrest for anything are we allowed to speak with allura i look forward to the second parade you'll throw for us after our names are cleared we'll break in tonight and find it keyleth what happened your magic didn't work but asum lied it must mean that we have something to fear from uriel or someone else close proof would help hey don't we have a prisoner can't we question the prisoner we should question him he could have proof we get it you want her body now's not the time what the shit happened in there it looks bad but she was a threat yes but that might not be proof enough for them someone could have corrupted your mind what sort of proof do you think they would accept the head of lady briarwood no one insight checked her all right so wait what are our avenues we're going to have to columbo this what are our avenues of finding proof we have a prisoner we can question who knows if that will yield anything and then we might have to go gather evidence which means leaving town against his word no and then the next step will be to seek out seeker asum how many errands do you have to run all right go run your errands we've got a mystery to solve he's got a list it's a busy day coming soon on friday nights the adventures of tiberius's errands 700 to 1000 every friday night on twitch wait what say that again they're our handlers probably we're all going a ring of what i think i do grog keep in mind these are our allies we hate old people (laughter) legit what old people we are vox machina i'm sure word of us has spread far and wide we're a pretty big deal why have you made this journey to us however despite what my companion is saying we are not agreeing to go after this winged beast quite yet we hear your plight and we sympathize and we will do what we can but we have very pressing matters right now is there a deadline of some sort when is your next harvesting season to your farm we are friends of the elderly obviously and also of the farming community so we are very interested in helping you may we talk about it a bit before we decide how and when we would tackle this problem and have they ever messed with a human here my business card we were just having a conversation about how we should try to be nice from now on but we do have very pressing matters i call up to cordell oi cordell remember when i told you not to let anyone linger outside the keep by all means use your judgment over the orders of your master that's fine we had a really bad dinner last night that's all kit buss ladies and gentlemen we're the worst i mean his friends all died so let's not have this conversation in front of the prisoner what's your name boy are vampires have there been any strange goings-on in their residence sounds you've heard people disappearing boxes coming in or out we can protect you we are safe here in this keep and you're surrounded by very powerful allies now you also caught us on a day where we're trying to be nicer to people (laughter) from the briarwoods so moody he's a friend i know it doesn't seem like it from the condition of your paw but he's a friend he's in the same boat as you trying to stay safe from danger yes well have we stationed a guard down there all right i'll go talk to cordell that's his name right is that kendrick or shayne oh the girl jarett all right we'll get jarett oh jarett we need you to watch a prisoner for us downstairs in our jail cell which we had built and are now using you'll be guarding the prisoner to make sure he doesn't escape but also making sure he stays safe he possesses information that's very valuable to us and one of the people who hires you might try to kill him so if percy tries to go in there can you stop him without hurting either party you think you could take percy wow jarett you're ballsy just out of curiosity if he was running at you what would you do (laughter) a little bit do you need anything to help all right well keep him safe and there's an extra five gold in it for you i don't know ten ten gold i don't know how money works we'll talk to vex
