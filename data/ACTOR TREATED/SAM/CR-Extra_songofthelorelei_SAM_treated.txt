use a level one spell so liam if we can't hear did we see that happen oma kill grandma oh yeah where is she wrong character with claws you're going to get 3d6 plus five no 3d6 plus 15 you had told us in an email that she gets 1d6 plus five and we get 1d6 plus four but some of that she must have resistance to math is the worst part maths johnny maths you're a werewolf slashing piercing and bludgeoning is reduced by half iron woe what does that even mean benicio i attack grandma yeah with glaive action ooh that's no good that's only 15 to hit meemaw attack again 21 yeah okay that is 13 points of damage i don't know how much of that she actually takes five points of those are fire damage and eight of them are slashing then with my bonus action since i am a polearm master i will hit her with the back of the weapon as well it's a bonus attack which is only 16 to hit fail no i'll stay put guard dad claw attacks are with advantage oh okay no you don't shopcritrolecom is that what it is you can't cast without-- if it was a verbal spell-- oh boy we're in it now guys (baby voice) the iron woe are you going to barf come on aurra boy portia you might die you might straight up die oh
