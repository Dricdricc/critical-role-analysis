skull oh it's an animal skull can i discern what kind of animal skull it is eight still alive everything's okay it's all gold and silver made of gems or stone or bone oh god listen grog i don't think it's very valuable it's pretty amazing this is cool but what would we do with it we can't trade it i bet something still worships it and that thing could come back and be mad if we take it i wouldn't mind getting a closer look at that skull we can't walk over there without disturbing candles right i can grab it i do have a big hand what do we do do we just leave and come up with a good story okay here how about this let me cut your face when we run out you'll be bleeding and crying and it'll be horrible and we'll just make something up yeah yeah sure right above the eyebrow so there's lots of blood yeah okay cool i'll take out my-- not mythcarver i take out my other longsword my aberration bane longsword i'll slice him right over one of the eyebrows (yelling) there are bears everywhere bears little bears big bears there was a bear right on grog it was horrible i was in the mouth of a bear and grog cut the thing from asshole to lips to get me out of there it was crazy did you bet to see whether we would live or die some candles big skull a gemmed skull not gemmed a gem-like skull not diamonds not rubies opal something it was a worthless endeavor we're sorry we went seems like a place of worship or devotion and we didn't want to mess with it vex what do you think is a semi-precious gemstone skull worth going in and getting what time is it and we've been awake for a while natural 20 except disadvantage because i'm exhausted 16 plus two oh all i know is my mansion spell has been ticked off so i used it at least once in the last 47 hours yeah i'm close he was just going to get us to the outskirts that was always the plan he knows things about the feywild that we don't know also if it turns out he's not who he says he is-- we'll find out who he really is later all right let's just put vex and vax grog can i ride on you yeah i just need to be reading no grog weirdly smells better than trinket today you hear music can i listen i want to hear some music but this is the theater do i recognize the music it's a stream it's nothing can you make us a bridge keyleth well that's even better should we send vax ahead oi you lot i just had a thought if there's music there could be some sort of charm effect would you like me to come with and maybe counter that charm effect all right i put down my book and hop off of grog and go up there i don't think you cast it on me did you am i there yet i'm exhausted same what is it oh hey that's 18 that's not bad can i be doing countercharm can i hum a little tune is that how it works i don't know how it works it lasts six seconds all right i'll keep humming sure i'll hum loudly shit we'll stealth and if it starts to feel icky then i'll do it can i sing to him through the earring no we talked about that before i'm going to stay behind where we going i start singing countercharm (jazzy saxophone riff) yeah i already had advantage 13 save check ten check or save ten he was very close to death i'm doing the russian bottle dance from fiddler on the roof right now check 11 you should do more than believe that you should probably know that there seems to be some distortion going on i'm doing that thing with the wolfman where i'm miming a lasso and pulling him closer to me to dance closer oh god you're going to kill me saving throw not at disadvantage natural 20 natural 20 wow i throw my white man's overbite back on it's just me and some instruments now you have to come get me strength or athletics saving or check ten am i okay i instinctually start freaking grog dry hump dancing oh what i was dancing it was amazing there were lights wow that was amazing can we get those weapons somehow the musical weapons i guess we can't get them can we we'll flip a coin right grog disadvantage one matt did my countercharm help at all but did you need it hey i did it right it didn't help i still was charmed that's not good hello we come in peace we mean you no harm if we've tread into your territory we will exit immediately and we apologize for offending you or your gods we seek passage through this marshland to what lies beyond it we are searching for-- the shademirk bog it's a source of great evil that's been corrupting this plane and ours i'm not tasty a new ipad for no reason this is so exciting yes that's right a favor to you well we would be happy to help if we can we are here to do good anyway we've already done some we conquered the devastating campsite of soradun the happy and we're up to doing more tasks like that if it would help if you are not powerful enough to conquer them how would we have a chance that is true we probably do we made quick work of the camp it was a proud moment for us one that will be storied for generations where can we find this site the lights i think we'll take the deal happy to enter into this contract with you no problem is there a timetable to this do we have to do this now can we do this on the way out of the feywild do we have your word that we have completely safe passage we don't have to worry about any other sort of monsters getting us in our sleep on the way there how many total are there we can probably take them we could probably kill them all i'm just throwing that out there i could probably convince them to destroy it themselves i'm more inclined to turn around and fight these lions and tigers and bears oh my because pixies who knows i'm okay with at least going to do some recon but there are lots of them and they're fast and invisible help from whom oh just her reading after two and half more i have about four and a half like doghouse size are they made out of toadstools we're doing stealth checks are we adding plus ten five yeah i don't want to go near this place we should either talk to them or run away right now to break a piece of the circle i don't think she would ever get close to it they have some sort of shield up tell me this vex vax people with high perception where are the animal men are they watching us right now i think they're out there somewhere can't you go underground and pop up what we could do grog and i could run back i could cut him over the eye and say it was horrible it was quite a fight but we won if they block it with their magical little crystals all over the place then they'll also know we're here and they will attack us wait can you still tree-bamf us out of harm's way if we needed to i don't have the mansion i haven't slept in days if we do hallucinatory terrain and it fails the pixies will straight-up attack us everything here has attacked us we have to get the animal men here to see it or else it isn't worth it i will buy into this idea if we have a plan for when the pixies are about to literally attack us five minutes from now wait where are we running towards the what we're leaving kiki and just running the pixies see it too though strong eight i rolled twice because of disadvantage both were ones i'm tired from reading wait are we trapped in here because we were deceitful to these wolf-men or because the pixies are trapping everybody we entered so why are we trapped here because we lied that is way better than our first idea and yet still terrible if i read for a few more hours first sure okay looks like a seven nope that's a one it's either a one or a 20 and it was all a dream what a shitty ending who knew it was terribly hacky and derivative and it read like fifty shades of grey what something different about me i feel so interesting it could be like a crazy grandma in the woods oh i got sleep oh i had two points of exhaustion i thought it was just one no i already did it do i get spells back oh sure i love singing happy tunes about fairies how about i just sing a happy tune i'll sing a song about myself the best kind of songs (singing) cube glorious cube you really should try it if you're in the mood i won't even hide it i'll pull down my trousers for any gal or dude o cube glorious cube wonderful cube magical cube we might have straws not only did we run into them but they forced us against our will to attempt to do you harm i cut his eyebrow and then he fucked himself by trying to smash through the barrier that i assume you created we did everything in our power to protect you and to not harm you if our druid's spellcasting frightened you we apologize but we didn't know what else to do and our gray stone friend how can we buy his freedom what what do you mean wait earthbind that's it it's on i call out to the main pixie wait what's your name how many are there we were put between a rock and hard place and we had no choice really it was a bad situation if grog is permanently corrupted we know that we can download a fresh one from backblazecom (laughter) we should've fought the fucking werewolves 21 for me i got sleep i'll do counterspell at level six they're so far and i don't know what they can do probably a lot i'll step towards that tree in front of me in front of the bear and the girl that cluster of the pixies over there i'll see if i can get three of them in a fireball if i can the leader and the ones closest to the leader but i don't know if i'm within range oh yeah i have lots of charges don't i i haven't used them in a long time i'll use two a 4th-level spell right so it's 9d6 range is 150 feet radius is 20 feet wait they can do that too it's dead or it still might work after that that one use okay can i move any more or am i all moved out i'll inspire keyleth i'll turn to her and say (singing) it's been a hard fey's night and you've got to unfreeze grog it's been a hard fey's night because we've been fighting like a dog oh boy advantage against magic i don't know bard shit no it's not war caster it's something else i probably didn't get it anyway actually both rolls were shitty and i only rolled a total of five on the better one i'm a what i'm a badger gnome cunning matt this is our punishment for-- yeah that was a wisdom it's just saves against magic for those three things what happened so wait he's not a kitty cat shouldn't have gone in that cave man that's grog the red thing near you is grog it's a contested thing don't they want to counterspell that defying statistics one roll at a time oh my god i was not expecting that and therefore have no idea what i'll do so there's pixies everywhere which one is there one behind me you can't see one that i can see actually there's one around the tree i wasn't expecting to move i can't see the leader right shit not ready for this shit okay i'll turn around and let's just hope that it works this time i don't know i wasn't expecting to move how close am i to that one near the tree can i move to her the closest one to me and how close am i okay i'm going to run to it her it whatever because i don't think they can-- well maybe they can counterspell this but i'll do a thunderwave yeah at level two i do have a sword shit i'm the worst at this shit i'm the worst at this i am going to be a beaver again that's it that's all i can do who's alive still i'll inspire shit i'm failing i'll inspire vax the girl i don't want to inspire him i want to inspire her vex the girl i'll say (singing) vex is natural vex is fun vex is good when she's one-on-one i don't know i was a badger i don't know what's been going on you're fast and slow you've got some inspiration lady i was right to inspire her after all someone's got to live are you calling for the fucking werewolves do i see any of them shit i'm going to run as far as i can into the open and see if i can see any of them while i'm yelling where are they behind that tree you mean behind grog and stuff do i have a clear shot without killing my friends with a lightning bolt well then i won't do that i'll cast bigby's hand at level seven and punch into that just a big old punch pummeling hand punching hand 25 8d8 i don't even have any 45 is that all the pixies i got nothing left that was my action and bonus we called because our plan worked perfectly and we were able to fulfill your deal to the letter as we had always intended i think i'm still at disadvantage with disadvantage it's a 30 i'm okay with 30 we'll never know keyleth do you need help you can't do it to two people at the same time sorry grog probably don't use any of your lower-level spells i'm ready i've eaten a lot of things today grog care to do the honors should we loot the mini city they're tiny thimbles full of nothing 17 for me everyone was bad including us and we lived that's it i would love to i used my 7th-level spell to kill a pixie maybe we can sleep in the treetops where lord ukurat sleeps we'll give him garmelie if we have to no show thursday
