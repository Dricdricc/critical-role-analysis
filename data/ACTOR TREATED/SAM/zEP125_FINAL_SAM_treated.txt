new god give us a hint that is cool but do you talk to him you were in alfield it seems like it's harder to get over to the pillow trove maybe you could have them forward your mail to here or something like that or if we had some sort of a po box we need to get you some nicer clothes then we've been sitting drinking right we've been plotting our next moves this is your jam what time is it actually what season is it are we north is it going to get cold can you pick me up earmuffs that sounds amazing i will do that are all the sewer grates blocked with a lock to this one count again before i go can i borrow that ring of water walking not that one that one or that one i know what those are yeah that's it (laughter) all right i'll go down there with yasha matt you climb down and join yasha there you can see the slight decline behind you as it progresses away from the direction of where this current seems to have happened once again the smell is stagnant a combination of waste product and whatever else has rotted and congealed down there that smell of bacteria-filled liquid and water continuing upward it curves a little bit to the right and out of sight with a faint bit of torchlight that bounces off the slick wall there is a weird humid warmness to the air down here it's not extremely pleasant you don't see anything else in here other than what look to be clusters of waste combined with sticks and whatever else has washed down here through previous storms and has begun to build up blockages here and there maybe a foot two feet across it's fine just come down it's a trap we're all going to die monsters are down i'm going to get down and take a little bit of the smear and-- do i taste anything 19 plus five no plus three it's old diarrhea familiar this is bloody stool (groaning) i know this taste i know it well it's sort of like pringles where you just can't have one so something's been killed and dragged that way i'm going to look for footprints that's a one i'll be right behind them middle-rear as i see everybody doing this i'm going to take a big swig of liquor yep yep it's definitely because of that look at this sewer is that real wet 20 there's a couple rats within range of my allies right so that i could get sneak attack okay i'll disengage back away down that hall that way get far enough away then turn around back go (whimper) and fire my crossbow at the one next to jester no that's molly 15 plus four i think okay that's a lot of d6s right yeah okay so 15 it's a small hole the bolt makes that's it tomato juice bath (laughter) where's our order all right nott will go forward next to caleb and peer around and fire another crossbow i know i haven't been in any gas i don't know what's going on all i can see is you guys going (yelling) like weirdos so i'll fire 18 there's sneak attack damage too right that's a lot in the teens i guess i will-- if there's a way to pin the rat to the wall i'll do that i would never hit you i care for you caleb i am extremely scared right now but i think that we killed the monster and we can go back to surface now right that was clearly something down here that's been killing people spiders don't like rats do they did you see the one that kind of looked like a dog though that was freaky are we going that way we're going a different way stealth checks can you help someone there jester not me i don't need it ten not so good or a body you think its dead should we go try to cut it down without alerting them wait should we get ready for some sort of distraction or to do something to the other web first no no i just-- steal from the dead bodies i agree yeah i like that idea but then we'll get to see it and get the drop on it yeah what if they're still alive oh yeah that's good or maybe they just were wrapped up five minutes ago and they're totally fine she wonders if the giant spider heard it should we get into some sort of position so we're not all clumped together i'll go behind caleb there's things behind us too i'm going to go 15 feet behind us that's a one it's not behind us nothing back here wait no but that's a person all clear in the back no need it snuck up on us five because we save it for when it really counts i'm probably screaming (screaming) you have a one with the stand he's busy that's all of the poison damage we are all going to die because of the golden snitch okay i'm going to shout out i think this is the monster i will nervously fire my hand crossbow at the beast hoping not to hit any of my friends 12 plus something six 18 yeah (counting) 14 plus fury of the small 17 points (cheering) yeah i scramble away in caleb's direction and that cocoon guy there i'm going to hide right behind him okay a 15 healing word no it's not do your thing what happened to the healing coming wow we killed it is someone going to heal fjord okay oh boy i'll stay put and hold my attack until i can see the whites of its pincers as a bonus action i'll cast mage hand and start digging around some rocks see if there's anything over there not anymore yeah i don't know you can use the bonus action granted by your cunning action to control the hand got it then nevermind i'm holding my attack wow from where i'm hidden to where it was when it appeared how far is that so i have to roll with disadvantage ooh not as good 11 throw your throwing stars it's impossible he can say anything with that voice and it would sound awful (infernal voice) can i have a fishing rod (laughter) i'll come with you then you're safe now whispers far cry 5 i've heard about it i'm going to say in halfling to the man it's okay just calm down everything's going to be fine i start cutting him out i'm going to cut him out do you have the stuff or did you-- yes but she was a horrible person ooh i'm going to get closer to thed and say in thieves' cant-- you can trust us we're one of you natural 20 (cheering) they're cool we've heard that before i could try watch out for poo rats yeah (clicks tongue) i can look around thieves' cant is a written or spoken thing 19 19 (whispers) money pot (louder) it says money pot that's one of our one-shots that's one of our things but that's not-- it can't-- it's not us we weren't down here before were we maybe maybe this is the name-- maybe they've named all the entrances and exits or something like that should we try to jimmy this lock and get out okay well do we need to get the spider first i'm taking at least one button off of every single person in the-- yeah we've got to go up i don't know guys all right i'll try

two okay 18 we can move it up first wait to get the spider inside the hotel we'll need a clever disguise for it a hat a beard perhaps i could do a spell and make myself look like someone else mask and earmuffs should make me look just perfect i like it good idea don't tell them about the bag ooh the card that says give to travis why did all those people want to rebel against her she seems nice
