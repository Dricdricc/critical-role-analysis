here oh that's fair what if we hide could we hide could we put up an illusion to hide won't you lose your other spell if you do the spell okay she got sword so far we have to ask him some questions but we have to leave right one more opportunity oskar yes we need to-- yes how far are we from the entrance where we came down into the sewer should i go back up to the entrance and make sure we're not being followed or anything questions i don't know anything about this shit okay i'm going to head back and look at the entrance seven no the language of love it walks away whispers on a 15 liam what are you looking forward to in chicago is it the sausages the brats the deep-dish more whispers just whispers it's all whispers oh guys d&d beyond right what is there to say that hasn't already been said by me i'm drunk 120 feet away (laughter) yes it's very clear they said it four or five times (whispers) that's the way we were going to go what are you guys doing coming this way we were going the other way oh god not yet but now i will be we came back up oh shit this is going to be great why do you get advantage he showed it to us except for the 112 platinum we just got should we go check it out why don't we take that thing from them those guys don't know what that is let's go get it sure if we want it do we want it i'm casting mage hand just in case i'm just following behind behind jester by 30 feet or so may i-- seeing caleb walk away with the object i'm going to cast silent image and make the image of the object glowing about 30 feet away from them on the ground (dissonant humming) yeah i guess my spell dc is-- it's plus-- oh sorry hold on silent image is-- come on d&d beyond it's plus three is my spellcasting modifier okay it just gives you-- advantage to charisma rolls i'm staying put and as soon as the guard gets close i'll make it slowly rise up into the sky just like 12 13 feet up this is silent image i can move it i just can't make it make a sound (giggles) it’s bigger than that i'm still doing illusion shit have i finished that i'll make it inflate and then salvador dalí start dripping just like (humming) it's going to start to boil and fizzle into steam and dissipate then i'll try to rejoin them i know who they're talking about what's going on where are we going the secret cellar where i found-- nothing where we found a skeleton yes long enough for the body to decompose wait wait why does it need to be lead i mean you can turn anything into lead can't you oh why does it have to be that particular material pumat would have something smart look at us we’re like a team break the stone oh intrigue who what who are you talking about this is the place are you with us this is the place i was talking to you about the skeleton’s right over there what what would that do all right very smart as always with the skelly if we slept in our rooms-- but what if someone breaks in and we're here then we're attached to these objects i mean i'll sleep down here if you want maybe we can get rid of the skelly first what’s wrong caleb all right i’m game what i mean we don’t know what fjord and the grumpy one have discovered maybe we should go upstairs and reconnoiter with them and then come down here when it’s time for beddy-bye all right i’ll stay with you then oh yes i can do that should i do that and then come back later you’re just going to stay here in this dank dark room with a skeleton by yourself no dinner all right all right i’ll be back in less than an hour flush two floors below we're putting a skull-- (laughter) yorick so we've got some stuff what did we get this i will taste it i will lick the safe it's ironic it's not what we want you did very well considering it's after midnight and you got a metal box for free i don't know can i tell it's lead-- i mean iron not lead okay just a straight intelligence check 15 oh it's a very well-made safe he's downstairs for now but i am in constant communication with him i take out my piece of wire and i do my incantation and i whisper to it and i say did the skeleton come to life and kill you please respond to this message he's a prankster (laughter) yeah lauren spinach should we change to a different hotel wait she was selling this place because of us i should put on my pants why does he need to leave the city why do you need to leave who's suspicious of you you can take caleb and my room we'll be spending the night somewhere else i get to spend the night with that guy i'll take caleb's share and give it to him i can take it downstairs later and have cay-cay take a look at it why don't i just have caleb look-- i'll take the daggers unless you can use them to throw i can throw them at things i think that's how they say it in kentucky i think that was more you than the dagger though for safety (loudly) yes because of-- oh all right yeah because of the thing caleb's idea i'm the help all right sure i take out my wire i do my incantation i send a message to him i say caleb are we going to abscond with the dodecahedron in the dead of night you can reply to this message and only i can hear your reply yes we are we're not going to steal it he's scared of that thing why would we take it away from you we do what we need to do to survive so what the plan was to leave no trace not take nothing he was very clear at the outset that we were doing this for money no we caused a giant explosion we destroyed a rug we broke into two different places mollymauk was seen by guards outside of both there was plenty of traces we left behind i opened a box that froze me for an hour yeah i'm pretty sure someone's going to notice that that box has been opened i'm just saying him taking a scroll is small potatoes what caleb does is well thought-out and always intentional and smart stockholm syndrome no i'm not explain that to me what are you implying sure the scorpion rides on the turtle's back whatever caleb says happens next (laughter) stay away from the water is what i take from it all right so you are all apologizing for not trusting caleb's judgment not you all right and what exactly have you done to earn our trust i'm not talking about life or death i've saved your lives caleb has saved your lives-- tonight caleb got that dodeca-fuckballs out of there by himself he has slain things he has saved things and i have as well if we're talking about trust what on earth have any of you people done to earn our trust what have you done that we have requested ever i like you when we signed up for this job caleb was very explicit he said we are doing this for coin and treasure and that's what we got there was no surprises here we're in it for what we can grab for ourselves i think there's a bit of a misconception here caleb and i have a very special relationship it is that of a parent and a child but i am the parent you do understand that correct i protect him he's my boy and i keep him safe i want him to thrive and get better and better and more powerful and stronger because he can achieve great things when i found him he was nothing he was a scared little boy in the corner of a jail cell as we have gotten more comfortable he has gotten more comfortable and come out of his shell it's my job to protect him because i love him and i am his protector not because he protects me he's going to be a great man someday that seems like it would be suspicious i don't know that i'll have a talk with him that's very nice beau yeah i could tell that there was at least six more fucks in there that you held back (laughter) as soon as you give me the stuff you want identified and you'll have to trust me that we won't run away with it in the dead of night hey you're the one who hypnotized me into talking about stuff yeah you think that's what friends do to each other i don't think so you think that's cool beau i was not stealing i was searching for something to steal that's besides the point i don't have friends he hasn't taught me that one yet all right maybe you guys can have a talk with her tonight i know she's drunk but-- i'm going to leave now have a good night don't break into our room i'll go down with caleb i stole this fucking scroll for you the one from the richter’s i got it i went back and got it no thank you for saving me tonight you brought me back from the dead oh i think you used a potion on me didn't you here take one of mine i have two it's okay of course you keep me safe thank you we lived huh the folks upstairs gave me some more things for you to check out as well are these things you can do okay oh all right (explosion) oh no oh shit was it loud enough that anyone else could hear it was that agoura hills earthquake smoke i forget how this works does he have your hit points was there anything in the box it's a good spell what did we get what did we get what did we get yes sinterklaas oh and these daggers too it's a longsword can i use that (fake crying) too big for me i know my limits well should we go to sleep oh here's your 19 platinum and your two gold and one extra platinum for some reason as if that were supposed to smooth things over oh and also they don't trust us they think we need to cooperate more they're trying-- they are very upset-- they were very upset that we tried to take the scroll box because they are in the firm belief that it would have left some sort of clue that would have led the authorities to us by stealing something after we had broken into two houses stolen other things torn up a rug-- not stealing the seal sure also she was dressed as the richter not wearing the correct outfit sure but they are under the impression that and this a fair point that we are not very communicative or we don't behave as much as part of a team as they would prefer i said that i would tell you and discuss and so that's where it stands with the weirdos i think what would make it work is letting them take the lead a bit and following oh no not at all but we can just see how it goes playing ball i suppose the soltryce academy thing what you didn't get in did you do something wrong or bad you don't have to tell me what it was or what you did but is it something that you can be forgiven for our own academy all right it'll take a little longer probably i'm not a good teacher all right well i'll help wherever i can i do enjoy seeing you get new spells and new skills i think for me too i've had more people throw rocks at me than conversations and it's nice you know what it's nice with them too they don't seem to mind that you know my teeth are a little-- people find that off-putting sometimes well they're not as smart as you are so that's nice i prefer the skeleton actually i'll go on that side of the room night caleb how do you do this on d&d beyond (surprised sounds) i'm in the room where do we go bring your dice so we can roll how do you play dungeons & dragons i got scared of the skeleton so i came over here that was like two minutes we had no time to do anything i roll a d8 eight when i leveled up it already gave me two extra hit points why okay so now i add the extra eight oh my god i just got ten extra hit points no she's dead now ooh that’s a lot do we have to find dolan now we've got to get our nip on ooh wait maybe not oh god we haven't fed the horses in days so we left the horses at a stable or something okay they're not dead in an alley somewhere get a big catapult and just-- wait we know a smuggler who was the guy who first showed us around the city yeah their sister i totally forgot about that or maybe pumat would have some sort of a magical-encasing-- he doesn't care does he we should write tusk love and sell it on the store was he in alfield she they were they in alfield bryce fayled fell-lid fee-lid if caleb was in the room when bryce said it then caleb would know there was no sister well if matt doesn't recall the sister then it was claudia mystery solved we did it well that takes one thing off the list we still need the lead box get horris out of town the gentleman what else that's the gentleman also the leaky nip i mean the evening nip should we go there he was telling us about blacksmiths before there's the spark hammer smith we could go to the spark hammer smith in the pentamarket i think we actually have been there before yannick jan he got 75 new spells i'm a student of magic we're going to go to the spark hammer smith's smithy's can it just be lead-lined is that a thing everybody knows her mom what is that what does it do one little interjection couldn’t we use the sending thing to find out information if we sent a message we could disguise our voice and say we’ve been made send instructions and find out what happens sometimes if you scroll through and find a listing for mom we could probably divvy up the equipment at pumat's he won’t ask any questions you did not what that seems terrible oh my god (banjo music) this is normal it’s okay wait mr pumat what is it made of what does it do i've heard of the material but does it have any other magical properties okay yeah to replenish mr pumat i have another request i know that i had requested would it be possible to invent a small haversack just the pocket thing but do you have any sort of magic incantation ability-- if i gave you a flask could you make it never run out of alcohol how much would that r&d cost me i'll take it (laughter) oh wow that's nothing it's nothing at all sure here take it yep all up front go to your d&d beyond app it has all the manuals maybe you should cancel the order have him make something else a flask did we get any healing potions do you need any more caleb it gets caught in the corners good stuff we still haven't gone there have we we've heard about it like seven times wait he likes small critters like me he's cool right what was the first one we'll be twinsies wait a minute what does that mean nothing whatcha reading they will probably have it sounds like shite caleb there are much better books out there goodbye to the tap why are we going there now oh to the box thing is the skeleton alive can we put the box in the-- oh wait we can't put the box in the bag crossing the streams still crossing the streams yes the items i'll take those why do we only have one how many weapons can you wield gone forever i defer to the wisdom of the group we merely follow your expert wisdom no i am sincere what is that crazy expression (laughter) i forgot we had that the gentleman we were going to investigate kara who was going to the bar that the gentleman frequents if it happens if it comes up oh yeah we have to send the guards to find the evidence oh god and we stole a seal hmm oh boy oh did we get paid fuck that so we'll go to the evening nip are we gonna do this are we doing the gentleman i'm so scared right now mazel tov who what what who's that he's actually a robot an hour ago you were telling me that i had to trust you people you lying
