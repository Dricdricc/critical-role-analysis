chair'otoa we should've yes yes we should get off the streets right away i know a place we can go we can go to near the river there's a river near here okay how far is the river yes i will lead them to a spot on the river bank that i know no we can't leave no we can't leave i mean you can leave but i need to stay i don't know but i know that-- i don't know i don't know where he is but i know that we'll find clues here or we may find clues here i need to look i need to look and i need to start right away and i suppose you all can go if you want but-- this is about as quiet a spot as i know in town i don't want to go to a pub or anything okay all right so you probably have some questions for me and that's all right i know i'm sorry i'm sorry for surprising you back there and i'm sorry that i didn't tell you more before i don't know but i feel like-- i don't think any of us need to pretend that we all don't have some secrets we've all been keeping some secrets from each other sometimes i feel like even maybe the thing that brought us together is that we're bonded by dishonesty a little bit well some of us anyway for me anyway i've been holding onto some secrets i feel like it's almost like putting up an armor or something to protect you from the past or from regrets or something and i feel like for some of us it could also be like a chain weighing us down and keeping us from moving forward maybe it's time now to remove that chain and be open and honest so that we can move ahead so yes i'll tell you what you want to know what do you want to know okay well hi my name is nott the brave and i am a little goblin girl but once upon a time i was veth a young halfling woman and before that a halfling child who grew up being told that she was not pretty and not brave and not coordinated and not smart and just not yeah i was then you know time went by and i got a little bit older i was made fun of quite a bit i had this-- people thought i was strange because i collected things i had lots of collections they were really outstanding i collected wax seals and pieces of colored paper and some buttons and fabric all kinds yeah i'm afraid not they didn't think so i had brothers and people in town who would ridicule me yes i lived here one day i was playing a game with some other boys and they dared one of their friends to give me a kiss the boy was very nice and he actually seemed to like it he and i became friendly and eventually we did what people do and got married he didn't mind my strangeness and i helped him get his apothecary up and running he was a brilliant chemist and could make acids and potions and oils and bleaches for fabrics and dyes and all sorts of things i helped him and he took care of me eventually we had a baby named luke and he was a bright boy very smart he learned to talk very early and walk very early such a smart boy that's who you saw back there is my son i think so we had a rough winter in felderwin there was not a lot of crops i think some of the animals had died that winter this river i've brought you to this is a beautiful place i used to come here with yeza it's also an important place because this is the-- the goblins would come from over there they would come and raid us from the other side of the river i think after that winter they got particularly hungry and more dangerous and more daring they came into town and raided more and more until one day they took us they took me and my husband and my child they held us in one of their camps i don't know if it was days or weeks i'm not sure luke was not doing well he was starting to starve and i knew that we needed to get out of there somehow yeza is a very bright man but he's not a fighter so i had to do what i had to do we ran in the dead of night they weren't fast i've been chased a lot in my life by boys making fun of me i'm pretty fast so i told them to run to the river and i broke off and i ran a different way the goblins followed me when they found me they surrounded me and i fought i had a vial of acid that yeza had handed me and i threw it in the face of the one trying to catch us they didn't like that they took me back to their camp i think he died from his wounds and he was something like their leader and he had a wife she brought me to another woman in a hood a magic woman i don't know who she was i never saw her eyes or anything this goblin told the woman make her suffer and they did they brought me to this river and they drowned me in it i can still feel the water in my lungs and my ears and my nose and then nothing until i woke up and saw the hands those hands the skin then i looked in a puddle i could see what they made me they made me everything that i thought i was not pretty not good just not i'll be honest i've started forgetting what it feels like to be a halfling to be me i don't remember everything any more i feel like every day i'm more and more goblin i don't like it at all i don't like myself at all i'm sorry i didn't tell you i'm sorry i lied and i'm sorry caleb that i didn't tell you i should've told you you would've understood and maybe you could've helped me i don't know i feel like you're almost there almost strong enough to help but i didn't want to distract you from your path anyway that's how i got to you that's why i can't be in that town and he can't see me like this my son can't see me like this no one there can i've sent him things well i only recently started signing the letters i don't know if he believes it or not i don't know what he would think of me the people in that town they're taught to kill a goblin on sight or run and get help children are told rhymes if he saw me like this i don't even know if he would believe it's me since i've been like this well they turned me and then they kept me around they used me like a slave really i would clean out their messes and clean up after the meals i would help their one that tortured i would help him for months maybe six months then i ran that's when i found you shortly after so maybe a year no more more than a year year and a half i don't know not exactly it's all sort of a blur i don't think we have time he's gone they could be killing him now these people that have him i will try to restrain myself but honestly i don't know for how long what do you mean okay if you think so mr clay this feels much worse it feels terrible actually this is terrible this is how you all are all the time this is not fun yes lots is there such a place yeza brenatto that's fine but-- and i'm sorry caleb i'm sorry for what i said before i feel like part of what we'll need to do to find him is to know what he was doing before he was taken and that involves you i don't want to force you to do anything you don't want to but i need you now i need you to tell me what you know what these people might be doing or might have taken him to or done with him do you want to get somewhere safer first no i'm not sure at all they're staying i gave them some money edith seemed to think that they were okay for the time being and that there's not going to be any more imminent attacks no idea no one does well i'm not i don't know but i know that i needed to see him i forgot what he looked like and he forgot what i looked like i feel like that's impossible that's unsustainable we need to know the ones we love and i don't know what that was i don't know how he felt but for me it's a step as painful as it was it will be a step towards something yeah it was great it was-- it sucked it was terrible you guys have rubbed off on me i guess right how how would i convince-- go to tell them how do they get there it's a dangerous journey even for us you saw the borders do we know any place safe closer is alfield safe okay yes please do absolutely yes i believe in you jester you can do this you have two more words okay that's something so shall we ride around a bit you slept with your teacher i know there's more pressing matters but what did she teach you cool it was that's why you looked at me that day twinsies do you know them it was that big i mean i don't want them to see me either because they'll kill me and everyone i'm with anyone in town so i think we'll be hiding for some time arms cuts or burns from cuts what would they do crystals do you still feel that way why would they have taken my husband he was not a magic person he was just a chemist what instincts i don't either he was very brilliant in his work but i never saw him do any magicky things he was good at what he did he could refine anything if they took my husband where would they have taken him their headquarters are in rexxentrum at a school at a-- the whole city is their headquarters do they have magical means of transport so he could already be there when did you get your new name wellshit it seems like if we are going to chase down my husband you're going to have to go into danger too much danger and-- yes no i just had more questions was that one of these people that we saw they had pointy ears they're elves right then what one of them look mean is that someone who would have-- do you know her to be someone who would be-- someone who could harness chemicals and-- would she be interested in the things that yeza was helping could she be the one who is visiting my home then do we have-- because i don't know how this all connects do we know why the cricks also attacked did they sense a disturbance in their juice or whatever that stuff is the dunamis we've had the thingy for a long time it doesn't explain why they would attack here now or had one so they had one of our dodecahedrons here i feel like there's a difference between using someone and relying on someone you do he could give two shits all right sure yes it would make me happy to even know that he's alive to get some sort confirmation that someone saw him alive or is that a bad idea that's a bad idea how moms gone wild what is the process by which you would well do you think caleb that they would sense that is that a magical force is that a divine force that would make me very happy okay except someone has to ask about-- it's a wrench yeah i'm going to look like just a gnome like tea i have some tobacco i can give him some advice on places to look this is not nighttime yet we're just-- i mean we have one with us-- two with us local doctor oh someone who might have repaired one of the soldiers or something like that okay dr demi leric medicine woman next time on colum-beau one more question (multiple columbo impressions) yeah well it's spelled weird g-e-o-f-f this is serious guys my husband is missing yeah we should look wait he was he was taken by kryn not by-- weird name tell me what jeff fucking said wait he saw that happen well shit this changes everything it could definitely hurt if she sends a message and he's with the rexxentrum folks-- they might be able to sense that why don't we try mr clay's idea first see if he's alive and then we'll try to send a message has anyone gone down and followed the tunnels so our choices are-- in the tunnel so we could continue following this tunnel for several hundred miles and see where it goes or we could take my son to alfield or we could head to rexxentrum and start tracking down caleb's old teachers they are i thought they bamfed out i'm all for it what do we do do we know anyone who can help us we can't get back there for weeks we know folks there okay or we could just walk 90 feet ahead oh okay it's the most powerful spell back to the inn she's running she has to go do the other d&d streaming show that she's on how did you know wow [break] shit we should have talked about this during the fucking break what do we do oh in the tunnel you're not talking about my husband who i want to know if he's alive or not that is a hot take it's funny that you said that because-- and it may have been because i was not drunk at the time i was thinking when you were talking caleb or bren about rexxentrum and how it's heavily protected and guarded and how it's impossible to get in and make an assault on it i immediately thought well what if we went in with the kryn and attacked with them i don't know that they've ganked him first of all he might be dead he might be ganked but he might not be ganked by who we think ganked him i assume it's a hard place to attack or infiltrate poke the tunnel to do what what was your name before this (laughter) can we go to sleep so we can find out if my husband's alive thank you i promise you if you stay with us you will also go through some horrible horrible things oh good i'm like nine so i don't know about retiring yet i want to be me again yes yes i hope that someday it can happen that's true he's a very powerful wizard that would be nice well i guess it remains to be seen yeah i suppose that one in nicodranas was pretty cool though he had slicked-back hair-- wow that's weird let's stick with nott for now when i'm back again i'll change it absolutely nothing makes sense that was as caleb in canon (laughter) when everyone's serious taliesin is the comic relief yeza brenatto what we've heard that before that's in xhorhas yes it's in there the cricks took him does that mean he's alive thank you caduceus how's yasha because she's been to fucking xhorhas before does she know anything about this place what is that what's deluxin' no it is not we're talking about hundreds of miles well yes if that's all right with you i don't want to drag you all to the center of xhorhas where the beasts live and the capital city where the empress is it seems like if we go to rexxentrum we're in deep trouble if we go to xhorhas we're in even worse trouble (huffs) how do we get there i mean are we really going to go through tunnels for several weeks until we get-- then when we get there what do we say hey everybody we're here in town to sell our wares if we go over land we'll be going right through the front of the war if we go under land we'll be underground for weeks if you did send him a message i would urge you to do something hopeful stay alive and we'll try to find you well he is short even for halflings and he has bushy brown hair long sideburns i always tell him to cut them but he always keeps them long he likes them long oh sure yes i can i will disguise self big nose not a great chin bushy dark hair long sideburns sort of narrow shoulders (whispering) not a looker-- but he is to me he was wonderful travis taliesin and is do you count the time that i was dead and a goblin travis and because i lost my ring five years then married young thank you for sure we do we're going to luke first to the son sending him on a wagon or something sure but we still have to tell them where to go and when to go we'll go there yes absolutely was there a jeff fellow he's a fighter okay well let's go talk to edith first i guess ask her if she wants to leave (sighs) good that means i didn't lie to my son i believe it yes all right let's go to edith yes yes i mean we talked about someone else going over there i don't know how do we convey this message (sighs) everyone likes you you're lovable don't you think so fjord but like really okay you're going to say i have a message from veth she wants you to go far away where it's safe to alfield use the money she gave you men will be here tomorrow to escort you we're going to hire somebody i don't know jeff's friend (like jester) would you like to take a survey and tell me how my service was jeff jeff's friends weird opener cool whatever it fucking takes yes absolutely give him 80 to bryce okay so what do we do do we go in the tunnels do you want to go in the tunnels okay buy more pockets hi i'm here to buy some pockets you brought us here for money belts my husband is being kidnapped by crick terrorists sure nope this is a full scene oh fuck you okay off to the tunnels travis sam and any guards around there fjord caduceus any ideas on how to get our cart down into the tunnel to get past the guards it's been weeks they're not down there this is folly the easiest way to check is for sorry jester to go look you just pointed to two orange pockets two weeks so 16 days the answer is yes whatever it costs done take care of it who's going in laura and no but who's going past she's super strong oh yeah you're right there's not really anywhere to look yeah and then what this won't be a problem when i'm the president (laughter) elephant ape giant constrictor snake giant elk dig aww it was so close yeah it did cast it again do it again they didn't just burrow from xhorhas they floated nope can you send some light down there caleb go look the ball you'll break it just send some dancing lights he went in yes yes is that deception all right do we have anything to float on a boat or anything fuck yes are they creepy traps on the ceiling sure i'll look for traps investigation perception 17 looks okay there's nothing to hide from you need your spells for other things guys there's no one i would rather go rescue my husband with marisha and no we never did you're right you're right we never-- we always talked about going to tal'dorei-- (laughter) dun dun dun what are you talking about you just used two to be a badger twice we're going to xhorhas to do what aww around the corner-- it's 1000 miles away ooh should we roll for level eight what do we do how do we do this when i'm president they'll just level up for you how do you do this oh god i'm lost already manage levels there we go
