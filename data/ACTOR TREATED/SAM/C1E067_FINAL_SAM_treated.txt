guys i'm a little disappointed tonight because i prepared an epic presentation tonight it was multimedia there were song elements there were rhyming-verse sonnets i wrote a great poem about how backblaze is unlimited and you can get it for just five dollars a month about how it backs up-- you get all your data anywhere in the world on the web or on your phones and you can get a full-featured preview of it by going to backblazecom/criticalrole i wrote all this stuff down on my laptop but my laptop had a catastrophic hard drive failure today and i didn't back it up with backblaze and this is what i'm talking about guys this is my art that i made my art there was a whole piece about you that would've brought you to tears you'll never get to hear any of it there was nothing about you but it was beautiful artwork that i made that you'll never get to hear however i do remember one little piece of it i wrote this song from scratch about backblaze it's an original piece not based on any broadway musical and it goes like this (singing) 525600 fanfics 525000 doodles of grog 525000 nudies of percleth how do you back up a critter's hard drive how about backblaze how about backblaze sam wrote this song okay good that's it (cheering) oh yeah you would be even more hard if you knew that i was talking to lin-manuel today laura and no that's just a little humblebrag we should probably run that intro right whoa what's up with us oh yeah do you get a rogue spell ew (laughter) sure or it could've been cloaky's alarm system that means that whoever killed cloaky got in through not the front door that was her trying to get out after she was stabbed to death right no you're right that is better detective work than mine but how'd they get out without-- so whoever the murderer is set the trap as he/she was leaving better give me the gun can you reverse lookup on the telephone that's tampering with evidence that's a definite felony i don't know what you're talking about that was a scientific experiment we have to look otherwise we have no leads at all wait wait should we not scry from a different place than the place we're staying at yeah you can it's the wire except terrible we know that she used some magic she disguised her hand with some illusion spell do we leave the gun outside the room you could always put it in the bag of holding shoot them with the gun vax's face (singing) scrying eyes-- (singing) they see your tell who let's find out where she is if she's still in the city we can maybe hunt her down and track her down today is there any ocean in town make gun fingers at least so she's going for the other vestige whisper is that what's in the ocean and she knows everything that we know it's in the ozmit sea i can make us all cows that is about it (clears throat) whisper blade forged from metal pulled from the far realm was center to many dark rituals now it lies at the bottom of the ozmit sea sunken with the lost ship the shrew in a storm 300 years ago near an island of trees no it's an island of grass there's no trees on the island oh glass i can't read (laughs) an island of grass island of glass it's continents it would take weeks i've got a 15 history well it doesn't look like we can just magically get to her i would like to steal that airship but even then though it would take us a week okay let's game this out what's the worse-case scenario she has one vestige she may have two the spire of conflux in the abyssal plane and the plate of dawnmartyr in the elemental plane of fire i mean those are going to be super hard to find even for her she has people working for her clearly no but i mean it won't be her alone she might want to join up with the dragons kevdak well let's not rank the bad people we've met she got away we tried i don't know that we'll get there in time yes we'd have to rest in order to do misty step-- we have one teleportation circle she's on a boat she's not on a magic boat she can't magically get back to the shore without sailing there if we sail out on an airship or a boat-- well yes she's slow moving she's on a boat it'll take her days to get wherever she's going we need to find her and we can keep scrying on the airship and catch up to her slowly she's a slow moving target even after she-- we don't right now but we will soon nope one day me and percy maybe two hours we can keep scrying from the airship well we use what sailors do up at the stars right we scry at night we can listen for clues maybe the crew members will shout out a oh we're at longitude blah blah blah latitude blah blah blah okay wait to play this out a bit more we know where she's going we know where glintshore is roughly if we got a local-- well we can find a local who does a sailor or something who can help us navigate our way there i don't think she's getting next to a tree it was near it was near the island of glass wait before we get the gun unfucked is there any use to it being fucked like can we have play-acting conversations around it like oh this is where we should go next hope you're listening we can go to that place where-- back to the asshole what does he want so give him whitestone we can make him a fake one and give it to him for one favor we can make a fake gem how hard is that one thing that occurred to me that may not help us at all mistress asharru the dead girl she was part of an organization maybe they would want to help us because of revenge a fugitive so other than chasing her going for the next vestige on the list the third option is wish her good luck and continue on with our mission ignoring the fact that she exists well we got to find out who's going to un-fuck it she disguises her appearance so how we know her might not be how you have seen her she has sometimes shown herself as an old woman did she come through here what was the job and she had some fellows traveling with her where were they staying in our rooms that gives me the heebie-jeebies because we went to draconia hello hi i make the best deals i know the best words sometimes it's vex but many times it's me what am i persuading him to do oh my general charm persuasion you say 29 that's lovely but we can't find her without some assistance we need to get this curse off of the thing that found your assassin don't have any magic wielders among you we also may need some naval assistance-- bay of jifs it's pronounced there is a skyport near here is that true controlled by the local government how long would it take to get this person who can remove a curse 750 do we have that to spare are you a gem lover i like you what do we have kine up front wow jesus laura grog i mean yes grog would be good at that yes let's do that i like that idea all right we'll go i guess we're going to go try to find an airship which one's which 25 (sings) indala no i have no idea what we're doing here i mean i assume we're trying to find out how much it costs for a seven day rental including a pilot or two we're getting the information probably come back and steal it okay well you're pretty good at this too yeah go for it we're on an elevator i think so natural 20 love me some airships be pleased we are here to inquire about some business if you don't mind okay we go over there we die hello be pleased beep beep my associate and i would like to inquire about renting an airship chartering it for a trip is that the crappier one or the better one matt it's the smaller one so i can do my homework how much do you think a week's charter would run on an airship as passengers okay our mission is a bit of a hush-hush one we better not disclose that yes that would be preferable for sure it's our guy damon how fast did this one make the kessel run does damon recognize us captain damon hello yes we've flown together before on the friendly skies it was and would have been more dangerous had we not been there to protect you and your ship oh maybe we don't want any of this on the record for right now oh shit this would be a week or less for the mission maybe even tomorrow morning we'd be going north correct into the ozmit sea and to a location that we would disclose to you once we get airborne but also consider this we are on a mission that's very important to the security of both marquet and other continents and we have friends in high places and i will flash our little badge the badge that j'mon sa ord gave us yes i didn't think you would-- yes i hand it over i didn't know it would do that we'll probably need sparkling water stat lots of brandy for the trip yes i will definitely need someone with a knowledge of the sea both in the air and down below the waters below can the ship be prepared to leave tomorrow morning yes grog yes it is i think you should ring the bell to make this an official deal we'll have to discuss with our associates but be prepared as quickly as possible excellent thank you damon oh one more thing i asked you this last time but are you still single okay good to know because vex really liked him last time you know what everyone thinks i like them that's part of my wink-y charm (nudge-wink sound) we could have been using this all over the place real quick guys real quick real quick though on the way back i'm going to go to the casino just real quick it's a shortcut friend we get outside i pull grog into a little alleyway and i say listen friend i'm going to go in there and do a little business can you do me a favor i need you to keep your eyes open can i minor illusion a face of one of those guys who did the deal with me yeah it's for him to

please can we all right so like 200 gold then thank you i want to go away from this place yes ah it would've been so much sweeter if we could've stolen the airship but getting it for free feels right ladies your chariot awaits all right laura i did mention that while you were getting whispered to 15 shall we lay it on them then we're going to go near the island of glass aka glintshore well we're not going there we're going near it to find a shipwreck the other ship may already be there and if we can find the other ship then we've found our destination just to get in the area it'll take us another day or two to find this ship has teera been around there does she know anything of that particular shipwreck to the shipwreck have you heard of that shipwreck the shrew yep keyleth make sure you learn your scrying spells for tomorrow do we still have that ball the scry-ball two three days how will we see them is there someone who stands watch at night but we're looking for the boat not the island yes off the sea three maybe four feet no i don't know couple hundred feet you're the captain is it morning time you want to do that morning scry now that it's been de-cursed will that mess up-- keyleth can you make the breeze behind us and can you make it rather strong well you said it lasts eight hours well we can't let them escape she had five killers with her when she killed those-- it's fine we'll throw them a life raft or something up above the ship you're going to take a lot of damage we should probably make sure that this is the right boat wait but keyleth knows what the boat looks like can keyleth look through the-- we have a telescope of some sort can she look and see if the boat looks right did you see any identifying marks on the boat we'd know if she's still underwater or if she's on land let's scry yeah we told him to go up above it this is like the hindenburg flying up to a rowboat a flare to warn the people on land how do we get to land quickly we should split some should go to the beach some should continue with plan drop keyleth-- how are you getting to the beach you can't fly i can make you a thing that flies to get you there i don't know giant eagle all right grog you and me come on let's go it won't reach it's too far grog i can make you a thing that flies should i all right i make him a giant eagle using polymorph i can't do it to me though so you're on your own oh yeah good call and kill them but we've got to sink the ship what are they going to do they don't have anything that can fight us they're deck hands the guy on deck who just went like this on the beach we're going around along the beach is there a tree line i shout down to grog i don't think she's on the beach man it's all glass we should go inland i'm scanning
