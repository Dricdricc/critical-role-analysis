whoa were you just talking about me whoa that's crazy i was just talking about me too oh that's right i saw some of that i had my ghostwriter write for me i have a biographer and a ghostwriter yeah sure no just that i don't have any dice but i can use orion's and they're going to be awesome great thanks we don't have 600 gold who's our treasurer should we pay another month it's okay it gets better you know her name but you've never seen her before oh so you could recognize her how many years ago was this what are the other ones well this is certainly tragic but looking forward what do we know of this meeting event party what are we doing well do they know percy's among us and if we kill them how much will you pay us just kidding we ask other people that we could go into town and find you a bushy mustache it's worked for me many times well that cap is more of a hat while wearing this hat you can use an action to cast disguise spell oh cast a disguise spell do you have to be a spellcaster to use it okay well this hat of disguise percival it requires some attunement i don't know how capable you are with magical items i can make us all into birds what do we do in the week prepare recon wait we're going to get cash and come back and it won't take us a whole week to prepare for this party all we need is a couple disguises we could go do some recon we should do some research some reconnaissance while someone goes for the money listen we could all go get the money and be back in four days right split the party by air though check yourself kiki-- you i would assume use polymorph as i do ooh that's so sexy does that last for longer than a day damn you can be an animal as long as you want well then like me flying there would not be an option we'd have to stop rest walk sleep i'll come too i'm tiberius stormwind from draconia well put chief negotiator as we walk do we see tiberius fly over our heads well is gilmore around we'll just peruse yeah we'll window shop i don't know unforced error sherri if i may what keyleth was trying to say was that she never got a chance to go to college and that she wanted to get that university experience well that didn't work hey can you serve me now i was wondering if you had a small box of some sort that could carry a magical item and perhaps shield it from detection i just need one you're a woman of the world and i'm sure you have fine taste judging by your appearance it is quite fine if i may say so myself if i were a little taller i would probably ask you out on a date which one is the fancier of the two hm i want ostentatiousness yes please that thanks thank you 200 to you also i know gilmore is otherwise entertained can you try to identify something for me do you have that-- i mean judging by the glint in your eye and beauty in your heart i'm sure you have many skills i don't know about but i'm wondering if you could identify this small red vial with a floating something in it that i procured quite some time ago do you remember that have i tried this once before me and pike found some stuff in somebody's house i don't even remember this was a year ago a lot persuasion it's 35 wait 31 31 thank you so much thank you well thank you so much two more questions then i'll leave you alone one where can i go get business cards printed up in this town it's a calling card never mind forget it yes oh great thank you i'll go investigate that and one other thing you know those books that my friend was asking about could we maybe make those happen for her i know that you had quoted her a low low price of 25 i'd be prepared to pay even more than that for them and compose you a little song about yourself so i have to pay you and sing to you all right i bring out my-- something (laughter) okay

on your shoulder we want to get out of here cast the thing let's go still want to split the party i jump in yes i did my old stomping grounds sure don't worry you will how much she's very fond of the carpet she loves the hand-woven carpets it's just very tragic yes who's the man we need to see about that nostoc greyspine she's-- that time of the month well no not all of us if you'll recall there were more of us when we came down here and some of us aren't here because they died 21 so before you berate us know that we are mourning the loss of two of our members and a bear lots of illithid a whole city of illithid they were mind controlled it was crazy we're not just making this up it really happened at gilmore's i am going to cast suggestion on him i don't have my hand cone out 17 i'm going to suggest to him that he is an honorable man and we had a deal and that he should honor it to the fullest extent of the word i also as a cantrip-- oh god i hope it's not concentration forget it i'm not going to remember the blood we spilled for your people and your safety oh i go to give him a business card but then i realize i never got them printed so yes gilmore's if you're ever overdark

get into the briarwoods' estate and talk to them where's the feast to be held yes that might be very strange yes even if you wear this disguise hat percy how are you going to get into this event it's a private event you can't just be some random person yeah but that's going to arouse all kinds of suspicion why don't you disguise yourself as-- what about vax he can sneak in ooh pike you could be pike you would be a very big pike i can also do that or he can no problem i know it's a few days off but we should have some sort of safe word some sort of attack word grog any suggestions (whistles) she gambles now she's crazy we don't even need that much if you'd just said to kill someone we'd probably do it i went to get business cards i'm going to get two sets one says scanlan shorthalt one says burt reynolds oh no i'm going to give him inspiration for one of them (singing) do you want to build a machine gun inspiration d10 percy that's amazing what do you call it diplomacy we'll need

invisibility is going to wear off so find a shadow yes we're friends here yes he also has a bit of a cold sort of like sandpaper on a chalkboard this is not vax we will be as quiet as a house mouse however if you need us to act just utter the word jenga who me who us keyleth i hope you phoned ahead and gave them your order for a vegan meal let's go mingle you walk away i jump up and give him a little high five then as an hour has passed i beckon to vax and find a shadowy area real vax because my thing is wearing off buddy as we move i release and then recast invisibility on him when i see that there's a moment where everyone's distracted i assume i sit at the kiddie table because i'm so tiny i am risen already i'm standing already yes oh sorry lord briarwood down here hi lord briarwood
