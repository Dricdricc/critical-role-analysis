yeah that can't happen no way oh shit it's in my car it's okay i'm good it's literally in my other car but i have my pdf i play zedd in the ratchet and clank game that just came out it's a good game it's getting good reviews i haven't seen what i did in it but i assume it's nerdy bluetooth put your weed in there which is it which is it three milking a cow 15 wait what is our overall goal here are we to slay a bunch of orcs or are we to follow them somewhere okay well let's follow silently then we won't know where the camp is oh can you they were just hunting let's follow them (whispers) i don't know whoa it's a cozy camp there's fire there's bears oh there's the guy hanging up in the tree okay we have options people can we rest are we rested yeah we had a night in the-- wait no we just killed those-- okay so we're down a couple spells or whatever yeah okay hey oi so do i create a distraction while you go around back do we go in guns blazing what's the plan i can distract so a distraction that would get everyone to run towards me and ignore you sure sure i'll draw them away from the tents no that is for my recreational use only also takes a minute to cast interesting idea it's an interesting idea i like it too it's not concentration i mean it's concentration for a minute but then after it's cast it's okay but we still have to get them out of the camp and into the door unless i make the door in the camp i can't do both i'm fine with distractions but i can't go to the back of the camp and set a door and to the front of the camp and draw them out i'm really good at distractions so i'm to sneak in and make a door and await further instructions how far away are we but we're talking like 150 feet 200 feet okay well we're fine i can make the door from 300 feet away so we're fine so i can make the door right now before we do anything except there's going to be a glowing door in their camp all right okay i'm going to go ahead and do it all right flank around flank around it's going to take me a minute to cast the spell you have a minute to get into position oh she's not a good sneaker i'm staying next to keyleth because i can do this from a range wait don't do the distraction yet i haven't set the-- i'm right next to you we want to do it-- we want to distract around here no he knows we're back right now but that's where we will end up i'm going to start casting the door and i'm going to do it back behind camp on the treeline or whatever you know just out of eyeshot of them do you want me to go in and you can cast something i'll get their attention and you can cast something okay there's not many that you can conjure it's pixies and little things it's okay she knows what she's doing no she doesn't no there's not i will say this to be fair to marisha the spell does say your dm will have a list of the creatures (laughter) it does at the end of the spell it says the dm will have the creatures centaurs are not fey are they front and center see this matt oh shit yeah good job 15 but it doesn't matter i'm walking forward i'm going to cast the resilient sphere on myself and i'm going to roll into camp hamster-style don't i'm going to start singing to get their attention (sings 'tro-lo-lo') very stupid you did great you exposed the trap you saved-- if i had just gone out i would have fallen in the hole 11 we're still trying to draw them out right oh shit we healed up each other oh no is he going to crush the dryad he died those seem like opposite commands he just got up did the two that were on me attack can i act like they're hurting me ugh ah ooh oh deception 27 (sounds of pain) (sounds of pain) yeah it's my turn no no it's bottom of the round i'm the last guy and then you oh shit do i keep them here or do i go to work okay i'm going to very quickly drop the orb and dimension door into one of the tents i had wanted to go to not the one that laura was saying the other one that's the one i was going to go to because it's closer to the door are they human or are they dancer i say come with me if you want to live and do i have any movement can i try to unbind them okay that's what i'll do we did ooh stage right oh snap oh boy well maybe it's another spell or something yeah have i freed them from their shackles okay the construction of the tent can i lift up the back and shuttle them out that way or do i have to cut through it or anything i don't want to waste too much time in there you know what i'll walk them out the front door point them towards the mansion and say run do not walk to my beautiful beautiful house to the right stage right when i get out just enough to get them around the tent yeah and on their way and i yell to them wipe your feet before you go in (laughter) that's pretty much all i can move you think okay do i have a bonus action all right i will-- i can only really see keyleth around right everyone else is hiding i will inspire keyleth as my bonus action i will sing to her
