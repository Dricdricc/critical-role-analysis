drinking i always listen to caleb he's my right-hand man poutine you're proficient in mail fraud well if she’s issued any sort of royal official things yeah there should be some sort of record we're leaving a bag of gold in a trash receptacle extremely like you'd be a fan step one is find documents this is the most exciting thing we’ve ever done oh so find addresses and documents ooh cue the music i do i saw their home he lived-- all of us one thing at a time all of us all right let's go who wants to go knocky-knocky no i just saw a window and a door right in disguise or as is (pigeon cooing) (pigeon cooing) what are we signaling for okay a flock of pigeons come down (pigeon cooing) (as pigeons) high-richter ren sutan is his name we blew it (as pigeon) high-richter how did it go we got some good information we got sutan's address and ren's address oh my god so you're saying that we could use other handwriting as well and it wouldn't be out of the ordinary as long as it beared the signature and seal of said place ooh a letterhead constellation bridge constellation bridge so we're going there with the express purpose of-- that's in the tri-spire so we need to go through the sewers to get there what are we looking for at ren's okay from his papa okay i don't think anyone can make it through the gates except for you will you be able to get in we'll sneak on in through the sewers they're talking about going straight in through the gate because they're you know respectable at the leaky-- monk shit where was that oh i'm not there (laughter) it's not him it's a pigeon there's a metagaming pigeon in this (laughter) you're probably more familiar with silk bindings got it you want to let them go off on their own they have to break in somewhere they're going to be-- i mean i'm with you caleb if you don't want to go then let's go back to the leaky tap we don't have to go i don't care it sounds scary to me that's a good idea we found him go go away go go away shoo go away 14 oh sorry i mean we've got mollymauk with us why don't you just do the same thing to him i don't appreciate this at all i feel like i'm being singled out because i'm a woman (laughter) if there is an office okay look like you're just-- cough and stuff oh i've got it i've got it faster what if caleb burns all of your clothing and you go in as a burn victim yes yes we do mother's love yes good idea did you add your intelligence bonus oh great how will we know when to go go go go go like noah through the ark (baby wails) oh no me that's a negative one (shriek) oh god you're using it to attack you can do that your modifier's right there 21 what are we doing in here we have to go back to the office we could -- you're right maybe we should just leave molly and fjord will be fine we'll just leave we have some-- we could-- i'm looking what do we got we could do enemy of my enemy (stammering) you could set the place on fire you could-- i don't know what to do shh okay let's go we're going to run out the door wait out of the hospital or just out of the room just out of the room we got to go no is this the doctor that we saw before (hisses) intimidation negative three how is that possible 13 i’m going to scamper towards the office if i can as fast as i can oh god nine they got me they got me guys oh no this couldn’t have gone better enemy of my enemy now are you fast all right fine i’m not leaving you i’m much faster than you we’re going to start to run 15 from me anything from his dad he’s heavily guarded there was no way to get close enough we almost had to kill an orderly it’s very embarrassing it was a good dry run for our real heist that we’re going to be doing in a day so we’re working out the kinks… well don’t worry about that because they definitely saw our real faces oh yes you’re right they only saw my real face so maybe that’s okay no no do you need me to write something i could do that-- we are so much better than the other people at planning like this (laughter) in block letters can’t be traced to anyone that sort of thing make it look like evil calligraphy ooh yeah a check traceable sounds official no no take out the part where you say “do you like me if so check this box” (laughter) what scroll it because we’re going to-- just shoot the dog with an arrow and kill it show the dog your dick all right sure i need a few papers i would like to talk to caleb (clears throat) oh caleb nott here i have a favor to ask of you i absconded with some items recently and i wanted you to take a look at them with your keen eye it was not-- i didn’t break in anywhere-- i mean we did but it was cool because other people were with me it’s when we went down into the basement to scout around for other entrances into the bottom of the leaky tap i found a skeleton that had these bracelets on her him they yeah i don't know i didn't really have time to look at it a very old dead person could be ancient i didn't think about that but yes i don't think it's haunted or anything it just seemed like someone-- it was stuffed way in the corner behind some boxes like someone wanted to-- i didn't-- i mean-- i'm really just interested in these (laughter) these are just bracelets that i found i was wondering if you could use your magic skills no but they're shiny and nice ooh maybe i could are they big all right okay i understand well we can go back and i can show you if you'd like but it didn't seem like-- how do you do that where you look at something and you just see what it is it's so cool it's very impressive really i don't know you know so many spells and so many things you're very strong i'm continually impressed by you i must say how strong would you say you are on a scale of one to 20 is that the way you'll get even stronger through study and books would magical items help further your abilities or blessings all right oh i'm fine i'm just fascinated by all things wizard and i want you to succeed that's all i have great faith in you i know you'll do great things and i just want to help you get there sure yes anything anything to help the cause okay sounds good maybe two strings what if you take a letter and just sign it “knights of requital” and rip off the rest so who knows what it was it's just from them she doesn't like red doors she doesn't like the knights of requital yes i did my handwriting is not as good it feels nice to participate in a democracy like this one monk one vote (laughter) yes don't worry about that i'll eat everything we leave behind which is our first house that we're attacking and we know that there's a guard and a dog out there so you guys need to distract the guard and the sausage i'll drink instead can't we just go to the sewers the gate it seems like they're not looking right now no they're not looking we can just go natural one plus eight ooh it’s the same guy it's the same guy what guy i cast message a few times we’re here where are you where have you been what’s ulog’s job in this whispers whispers d&d beyond far cry 5 it’s five better than far cry 0 yes montana no i don’t think so more of a spring… 13 must be getting tired we can get in through the gate and then we get to the tree or we’re going to go straight into the cellar we worry about that later that’s very risky now because what if the guards says “i don’t know you” you know then the plan never starts if we do that at the end at least we have a fighting chance okay you can cough or something i will signal you when we are grapple throwing ooh that's good i rolled an 18 watch my nails ooh i thought you were a monk of some sort you're all legs and no arms what is this why do-- all right yeah are you i don't know i feel like i'm more precise than you but no you're strong you go for it i don't-- parchment boulder shears yes on three one two three okay you're throwing it ooh strength it's not staying on reel it back in reel it back in give me that give me that (squeaks) yes natural one

wait do we have to cast-- do we have to have a-- distraction oh we're going to shimmy across because what if the guard looks up and sees us so we do that now now no we're going through the roof now i
