to you for a while you see he's not really there nine do they look sad i mean we have in the past if we are confident we can get away with it we would we could-- there's a lot of people in that caravan though it seems like a risky maneuver we could probably get away with it why you want to follow them and rob their shit i mean sure let's go do it oh okay no we were more small-time thieves we wouldn't typically hijack moving caravans usually we'd wait until they parked somewhere and then just go sneak on and steal something out of the back but if you need me to teach you how to steal you can tag along sometime all right yes please should leave a guard with the-- and believe sounds good maybe you shouldn't go oh that's very nice of you we do that's very nice of you thank you what did i do to deserve this i'll sit up with you jester and take first watch 1b no it's pretty good it was violin class what what's going on why did we leave you on watch you can't see in the dark okay let me sneak around and look right we don't want to wake everyone because-- what if it's nothing then they'll be upset with us there's nothing more dangerous than-- no she's the most irritable sorry i'm going to go look i can see in the dark i'm going to dart off in a flanking maneuver 18 plus stuff 26 buffalo-type creatures or buffalo how far am i from the camp cool i'm going to pull out a piece of copper wire and remembering the motions that caleb taught me i'm going to twirl it around in my hand and hold it up to my mouth and whisper a message just to caleb i'm going to say it's three buffalo or buffalo-type objects creatures what do you want me to do (fwoosh) yes you can all right yes i can hear you it's just one back and forth i can talk to him he can reply once that's it is it oh it is ooh this is exciting i've never had magic before you don't know you're drawing hamsters he said to come back so i'm coming back on the way back i'm going to see if they're eating or sleeping what are they doing they could be good for meat we could go kill them and eat them for meat you said to do the hand movements and the whispery thing and i did it and it worked yes oh but we could've eaten those buffalo-type creatures three large beasts of burden wait we could use them to pull the cart they went that way in the dark i don't know i don't know what they were but they looked big and able to pull the cart you want to go cow-tipping don't you what happened are we going to go after them or are we going to go back to sleep let's go laura and 12 travis and you'll never know what they were sorry stop it are we supposed to come back that was fast you really fought five guys in an alleyway that fast oh no he's injured why are you drinking salt water oh (in sam's voice) why are you drinking salt water (laughter) it's the lowest form of humor are you all right fjord were you in the ocean did anyone die we're not going to let you run into the dirt should we get back on the road then how is horse doing today how's horse maybe for short we'll call him wc what does it mean it's a pun (laughter) let's do that have we seen these things before i think they're-- well we don't know what they're called we just fought them i don't know what they're called we fought one before you just hurt them until they die very oh this'll help hey side note where's my fucking wine is it gone oh wow what a cool map the enemies are just all over that direction right 15 so revealing-- i have an idea we need to move away from here right fjord all right i think i can do something that would make them fire many of their arrows at something but not us should i do that and then as soon as they fire their arrows we can run diversions that's what it's called it's a diversion all right may i move is that a thing i take out a bit of fleece and repeating the words and doing the hand gestures that i've been taught and tracing the image of a creature on the fleece i will make a silent image of the guard who told us 30 gold a gnoll i'm going to have the image of that guard dash across slowly dash across this alleyway like that way yes not dash just walk in a way that he could be easily shot okay great that long-haired guard individual ooh nice i cast a spell can i also move as soon as the arrows flew by i'm going to dash across the alley yep as far as i can go look at two unicorns inside they're inside the-- oh wait is this an ability check nope don't worry though i touched all your dice so they're going to roll great tonight six and nott six huh (panicked stuttering) i'm going to drink from my flask n-o-l-l beau bow beau and bow she's in patient defense she's going to be fine you're going to be fine whoa or the guy in front of you is that a crownsguard no the guy next to him oof what does that mean 6d6 nott's going to poke her head into the window where beau is inside beau is within a few feet of a baddie right i'm going to shoot the baddie next to beau 15 nine points that's including sneak attack damage plus fury of the small so 11 points of damage ten points of-- wait what did i say nine 12 thank you movement i will use to climb up into the second floor window that's not me the one next to your right there you go that was good but it's disadvantage that's better athletics it's a straight ten (screams) i say this is fine (laughter) okay i'll use a bonus action to get-- is towards the window less fiery sure it was two threes rough half cover i'm done hey look at that it's me in the window so your duplicate is somehow less useful than trinket is that what you're saying (laughter) she may move if you move away from her 30 feet she may just come with you oh shit but you can leave her out in the open hits no super advantage the grassy gnoll no really thank you sam how many are engaged with you right now hey you have to save first now close out of that you still have your action right i touched one that's why they rolled so shit just a little perspective here the gnolls pushing away the cart how many are there and what are they-- no obvious weak points on the cart or anything it's going to take my bonus action to do so then i will not look at the cart i'm sure it will but i don't know if i could kill one in one shot instead i will using my goblin feet claws just dig in and i'm going to go upside down so i can see into where beau is and shoot one of the ones next to her i don't know the ones next to her ugh well i got to hit them the one that i hit before that is 17 cool i'm going to go pop back up to the top floor and use my bonus action to hide nope ten into the house there's a really loud ticking clock in the room with you i can take a shot at the cart but what is one arrow going to do does he have any disadvantage or anything he left no okay (sad trombone) there's two gnolls in front of me that i can see right the other one i will point at and i will remove a tiny rotten tart from my pocket and crumple it onto the floor and take a feather and move it around over the crumbs and say hey what happens to a frog's wagon when it breaks down it gets toad away and i will cast hideous laughter on the gnoll 13 the untouched one okay all right i'll use my bonus action to hide oh i have to stealth oh god damn okay that's 13 that's the one you just hit how many are over there oh i didn't see it hellish snap (engine revving) start up the full those guards are killing more than we are don't you want to ask that nameless guard how he wants to do this is it our turn soon caleb and me i would like to jump down from the wall and run as fast as i can after the leader and the cart oh disadvantage jesus 11 dash everything oh this is a saving throw that's not disadvantage 16 oh god oh god oh god oh god yeah but it's a spider sense your duplicate can cast spells what don't blow my cover okay what hits oh shit (gasping) oh my gods i was just going to follow them from afar i forgot they had bows and arrows i thought they wouldn't see me because of the smoke oh boy we don't have those feed and mead should we divvy it up equally the rod bawn one i think he's got two glass eyes
