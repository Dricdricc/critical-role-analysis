they're all horrible okay ready nope that's disgusting wow okay sure maggie is such a sad sack of shit that no one will tickle her tit it would make her so glad to be had by a lad her drawers cream at the thought of it taliesin what did you give me i will cast bigby's hand and make it an interposing hand between keyleth and the pit fiend so now he'll just attack me instead does it stop him from moving towards her is that how it happens it's like a wall oh shit it's probably super strong so what does that mean it's a roll shit well that didn't do much yes can you please do this as ashley

say that shit yep i don't know what to do well if i can't move out of the way then i'll try to lightning bolt the pit fiend i mean we're trying to kill the pit fiend right that's not going to do shit to a pit fiend pit fiend would be 45 feet up right so i cannot because i can only get 30 feet i could hop and do it i will hold my action until the pit fiend comes in range otiluke's resilient sphere am i affected by this i'm going to get health yeah well i hit myself by falling out of the sky do i get the temporary hit points that pike had granted me two turns ago she gave me five okay great but i look really cool with a fire beard and stuff so i look cool mid-battle bribery thanks for abandoning us so we all saw vex wake up throw a bag of money and walk into my house very unusual with a broom dragging behind her oh boy guys this is a fight 12 guys why did we come to the fire plane maybe the lava is a secret passage grog you should swim down and find out guys should i read another limerick while he's doing this he passes again i'm going to construct a small lever system unless it is trapped in my sphere 21 if i'm using my cone which was up for my last one i did not cutting words on this one so he's got advantage i'm going to cutting words that with my reaction that's a hit so i'm going to cutting words that i'm going to sing (singing) your evilness is killing me and i must confess i want to flee but when you see me you lose your mind baby it's a sign pit fiend baby now you're mine three fuck i'm going to draw mythcarver and look at it admire it for a moment turn to pike who's right next to me and healing words her with just a simple touch can i demonstrate on you taliesin i'm going to do this just that they've never worked a day in their life ten points of healing to pikey but that changes things fuck i stick to the plan hand cone up i'm going to try and dominate what's-his-butt the pit fiend yes it's at disadvantage so it's a straight roll but i know it's going to be pretty tough it's a wisdom save damn it nothing's working pike is dead-- yeah but i can't leave her the thing is i've made a promise to stay alive so i'm going to run away toward the mansion sure oh sure that's not good 21 i don't want to go in the mansion i want to stay outside i'm going to go back to my barrel around where taliesin was before hide back there yeah you're in the mansion i do this and say you wouldn't hit a guy with glasses would you why why i mean yeah no matches my beard now those don't reach into the mansion got to flank it's all good you're going to die
