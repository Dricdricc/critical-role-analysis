small body she speaks arrival language now oh yeah i'm asleep at night she's in the room she's hitched she was going to come see us i'm currently-- doty is brushing my teeth i've seen it in the

keep's roof is that okay oh thank you (screams) i lift my head up what's going on pretty calm fight music matt can i stand up yet am i still tied up i will yeah (panting) what took you people so long i was on a horse for what felt like days no you know me better than that please tell me that someone brought my toothbrush please don't smell it i'm very embarrassed i went to sleep i don't know what this is i mean she's taking me she's paid by my father probably and what you work for my father on a regular basis oh that's nearly nothing i'm worth far more than that i am so cool well we should bind her and search her make sure she's not holding any weapons or anything i respect that but i did get a bruise right here from the horse falling over so i'm not totally okay i left yes i left of my own accord they knew i was leaving well this is just some paid shithead so i don't think we should kill her or anything like that i want to take her belongings and send her on her way that's a separate question isn't it we're very close-- proximity i mean seems foolish not to at least go have it out with him this is unacceptable behavior i think in any relationship this is not cool right well yes there's that too you want her to get paid she kidnapped me what she committed a crime against me i don't want her to get money i'm sorry i guess i was raised with a different appreciation for money but pike your family came in and robbed us and you gave them a bunch of gold then this person kidnapped me and you want to give her 5000 gold you think he'll be guilted i live in the city i'll just walk in it's my house yes i'm taryon fucking darrington people shake when they see me walking down the street here who i abstain with an attitude i would like an apology and as to the amount that was promised do you think that was a fair amount i accept your apology and as i said i admire your diligence and faith to your contract you don't get any of your belongings back is that all right you don't get any of your magical belongings back i want it yeah but we'll i guess walk in together and you can present me to my father this seems so stupid but sure i'll go along with it fine and then we can send her to look after that little creep that you're always talking about that's gross that's disgusting yeah let's go talk to my dad and get this settled and then we'll figure out your next assignment or whatever yes thank you these are my friends they should be treated with respect no the town was never the problem it's a fine place to grow up sure yeah oi for what no you're right we can't punish people who are just hired to do a job it's fine yes i hired you and now we're so close here let's go to my dad's house but i need to make an entrance i'll be on broom yes behind me and i should be front and center you guys can flank-- yes thank you is this a trick question there's everything most things are special about me what there's vampires here no wait what i mean sure they're the bluest of blue my town here it doesn't have very many high hills but still stay on the ground will you thank you tell the master of the house that we've arrived yes excellent to see you too you've been keeping the grounds quite nice papa you'll wait for us outside the grounds and we'll give you your next assignment soon are you you sent that woman to kidnap me she bound and gagged me and threw me on the back of a horse that's how you brought me home i am literally the least hard man to find i tell everyone my name i wear a gold helmet and i walk around talking about myself yes i was i was living a new life as i told you i would i was finding myself and becoming someone well i was in danger for much of my time away but that's not a bad thing sometimes becoming an adventurer or whatever i am now it wasn't supposed to be easy it was supposed to be hard and it was and it had risks but along the way i did much and i stand before you now as a different man than who left one who has been through a lot and knows the dangers of the world but is also a survivor you know when i left i told you i was going to prove myself to you that i would bring you back stories of my exploits and show you what kind of a man i really was and i wrote a lot of them down in a book but i don't think i want to show it to you because i don't think you deserve to see it you never supported me as a child and you don't now financially yes but not as a father and the things i did while i was away-- well the book is a diary now it's for me not for you yes i know that's all you seem to care about it's not all that matters i know that i carry your blood and that means a lot to you and what is that i don't believe you where's the money where's the family money it's all right they're with me i don't understand the way we lived the way you talked made it seem like there was endless money forever my lack of respect what happened how did you ruin us like this in the myriad i'm having trouble wrapping my head around this you're saying everything i've lived has all been built on this deal with this shady group you're a criminal you're just a criminal we didn't build anything as a family but papa you never told me any of this you were cold to us and you told us a bare minimum of what you did and how you ran things i didn't know any of this how would i and now i have to fix it for you by marrying some girl that's still a marriage no it's not i have to be here i have to be with her i have to live in her castle or she in mine (sighs) listen i've learned a lot from these people over the last year or so and one thing i've learned is that you are who you are whether you have a lot of money or not and i don't have that much anymore and i'm still okay with that and it's not because of the things i own it's because of the deeds that i do you've done some bad deeds in your life and it sounds like you've done them to preserve our family and preserve our legacy but that's not a reason to do them yes i'm sure that's true and i assume i'm somehow complicit in this i'll have to think about this what have you done to our name do people know of this and if i marry this girl it will just all go away they're far too big and if i say no and they take all of our possessions and our estate everything what then we're ruined how could you do this to us you never told us that you always talked about bloodlines and legacies and the darrington name but you never told us you were proud you never comforted us you never cared what i wanted to do or who i wanted to be i'm cursed with this name now darrington you've sullied our name by enforcing these taxes and just being an asshole to everyone around our whole city and now i have to live with it or marry this girl to save it listen i'm sorry i left and i'm sorry i took all of that gold i did not know it was everything but what you're asking me is-- i'll need to think i'm sorry yes you can i'm going to go see mother and sister might my friends stay here the night grumpy lillian oh okay well good to see you have a good afternoon thank you it's good to see you again yes let's leave the room he's acting differently than i recall it's been a while i'm not used to seeing him like this and honestly i don't know how to take it it seems like i have to laura and grog says i do marriage he was a weird character choice i don't know i thought a meager amount 50000 gold thank you tell her she did good no i'm not cool with my sister she's not that great i guess i suppose she knows about this yes that's right she was being groomed as the heir to the family and i was being shut out my mother is here somewhere too she's pretty quiet i guess talk to them but we can't go after the myriad they're powerful and dark no he offered services and look where it got him we could go talk to them but i don't see how that's going to change anything gross no i like being besties with you i don't want some rando lydia why not everything he is is his status though this place where he lives his servants if he's got nothing then he's just he'll die that is maybe true but listen i've been working on this for a year and i'm starting to get really nervous i'm down to my last few bits of gold and i don't know how that would feel to run out no i'm not thrifty yes money would have solved this i assume i would be a fine husband i feel like i'd be okay yes it's true i'd assume they are not safe here we'd have to convince them to leave or protect them somehow or make a deal to at least protect them in poverty all right well a quick stop to talk to my sister possibly and then let's go at least investigate this contact i appreciate you all being here for me i'm sorry i didn't realize that this was going to happen and i don't want-- if you fellows want to go back and just continue on i can solve this i'll try maybe i should sleep with bells on percy can you make me some all right i'll walk through the place and look for sis (singing) me neither mercer no grog jumped off a roof and died yeah you do yeah for some of it i had no i think i had their names written down
