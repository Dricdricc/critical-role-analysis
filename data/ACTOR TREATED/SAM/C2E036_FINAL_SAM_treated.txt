lights run don't walk to backblaze on broadway (applause) i like that one of your own shitty puns made you drop the voice entirely thank you taliesin for this stunning broadway style or listen to it that's tomorrow night we're going to jump in the shat it's out where is it i still haven't seen it oh wow oh that's so cool yeah and killing all of his friends we could sleep on it i'll come with (whispering) oh no heal him take the axe out of him i'll ask him would you like us to leave the axe in or take it out can't you do healing or anything spared do you want me to go get deuce all right i'll run up there and get him if you press on it can you get his hand to move mr clay you look-- are you okay yeah are you cold i have this cloak that would maybe fit one of your shoulders well if you can muster the strength it would be great if you could come downstairs and maybe help save an individual's life look you just saved a life that's good news right yes we are a tight crew that follows orders as well caleb is our leader and we-- we are enforcers of justice and saw that justice needed to be done a whole boat just for a message are you pirates freedom fighters you said that you're sister ship to captain avantika ah yes we did know that where is avantika is it a secret island so it's an island tell us about-- oh sorry oh all right tell us about avantika wait we already know what the islands are swavain islands i can't even read my writing that's where we were told avantika is i think those could be little pointers do you live on the island does avantika live on the island the island is cursed so she docked there for a while or-- the next one it's a dangerous game who knows how it will end yeah can you tell us because this is a bit shredded you were here before right you were here did the wind blow you out or did you fight against the wind to leave was this east is this west where is this you've met avantika right sorry to interrupt i don't want to cut off your weird evangelizing but you've met avantika have you seen her use any magic you survived this brutal attack you are extremely strong everyone else died you had an axe in your head you had an axe in your head you survived it's nothing to you it's nothing missed all the major organs (laughter) what else do we need to know anything how about this ship you know this ship is there anything funky on the ship how much food stores do we have how many days of food and water you know what we should do first since we have a carpenter on board on the side of the ship it says the mist we should get some new letters going yes the mistress of the loins i don't know what would be a good name that's not bad we took the mist and now it's the mistake fog are there any intact maps like larger scale maps of the ocean caduceus are you down here all right is he tied up are you tied up yeah yeah you have now officially been conscribed to the mighty nein-- --for the purposes of this sea voyage at the end of which you will be compensated for your duties if you kill any of us you will be thrown overboard also as a result of us not mostly knowing how to sail you are also the first mate congratulations welcome to the mighty nein you're the first mate why don't you give us an order let's call him-- sam and we found some crucial information he's your first mate now and-- yeah don't worry we took the ax out and we have this map that goes to the swaven islands we heard the name earlier matt and that's where we'll find avantika who seems to be some sort of cultist right i mean i assume she's a cultist maybe she just is a very nice religious person yeah but he said creepy he said that they were supposed to collect this sphere and if it wasn't available to go look for others how many have you swallowed this is where they were going to head after they got the ball yes he said that darktow port but he also said it was far away from the one that avantika was at he said it was far away from the one where-- aren't you just a little bit scared that this person avantika has spent all this time and resources trying to get these things and you've got one in you and we're going right towards her isn't that a little scary but she might just chop you open and take it oh yes yes do we have to pick right now or can we-- oh wow those are two different directions (laughs) it's the mistake now we renamed the ship or the ss mistake m-y-s-t-a-k-e we're all about spelling things wrong so maybe we should do that you're the captain wait farther damage control we can send a letter cruise director bursar bartender i've seen the love boat fjord should we have a quick ship's meeting okay crew meeting everyone all right thank you to get more hands we could either go back to the place that we exploded and murdered and risk being spotted by the coast guard we can't change the boat's appearance or we could go further to-- port damali or some other place on the coast that i don't know or this other place this island that's like 300 miles away what's the next city up do we have a lifeboat or any sort of buoy or anything are we hiring a crew are we kidnapping a crew do we have enough money okay ooh yes how so oh disparage the dead's name so that when people-- and then when anyone finds out that we did it they'll be like good for them for killing those bastards right seems like it would take days well it's the middle of the night now so it's not going to spread till morning right let's take a nap we'll just coast here can we coast do we have an anchor can we anchor can we just do doughnuts we don't have any light on here we're fine the plan is we're going to find a cove and hide the ship sneak in get some crew sneak back or we're just going to sail right into a different port also in nicodranas grab a crew while we start a whisper campaign and bolt are you talking to me or-- what yes (skittering) the stars no we're on the planet it didn't feel very good did it what do we do about that you mean just laugh extra hard and pretend like we're having a great time yes absolutely and we want to stay together and if they're thinking that this is not working out we have to do something to change that i don't know about going in and starting to lie to a bunch of people is that going to make them-- all right i'll start thinking about what we can do oh no you did what you had to do i needed to be with the group otherwise i would've been stranded there alone and that wouldn't have been good next time you can just tell me though yeah it's all right i need it it did temporarily i'm still very scared of the water and i like being on the boat but getting off is going to be a trick but it's all right yeah yeah we're cool it's just these other people that're all messed up i know we'll keep them together if all else fails fake a heart attack everyone will go to your aid and then when they save you we'll be like yeah we saved him yeah okay good no we're on the world 14 are there any distinct flags or colors hanging from our rigging okay can i skitter up there and see what it is if it were to unfurl can i pull it down is there a thing we'll ask fjord about it when he wakes up on the crossover does this mean anything to you maybe we should change it on the next crossover tell jester to paint it that's fine we're going back find a cove it's the same city right do we have one on this ship if you've seen one before we've got to chip that off carpenter first mate hold your carpentry duties for now and go change the name of the ship the mistake no one will know in a different font back to your duties please keep doing this motion oh this is the paint can upside-down and you're dipping should we leave anyone on the ship do we need to leave someone on the ship no you're the charmer i'll stay on the ship how am i going to go convince crew to work for us then what am i supposed to-- i have no job out there i can do that who's going to hire a crew we don't even know the parts of the boat that we need to fill you have to come with us no yasha stays with our first mate gallan-- if yasha has to move the ship she might as well abandon it there's nothing she can do she's not going to outrun a naval vessel what are you going to do you're one man you're going to sail the ship away (sputtering sighs) i don't like this what will you be able to do by staying on the ship if another vessel-- no if you're on the ship and a zhelezo boat comes out-- with one person you you're the sailor do it in a different language what other languages do you speak a hell boat is that really the only other language you speak is infernal what are you don't forget to spray it with perfume no let's take the skiff in if you want to take the skiff we can take the skiff yasha's staying on the boat with-- are there any-- yes i am the whisper campaign but wait before we go is there anyone walking about the docks you know like dockhands okay should we buy anyone off to be like this ship's fine we checked it yeah or if anyone comes asking they're like oh yeah these guys just came in from i don't know marquet or something the guy we just gave the papers to go bribe him ten gold do it yeah you're the sailor guy this is your whole episode augustus gloop i come wandering up (laughter) i look like cap'n crunch by the way (laughter) yeah short hat white moustache maybe we should go elsewhere let's go elsewhere i'll do investigation it's not a roll not great investigation 17 wasn't a good roll but i have a lot of plus let's adjust-- the whisper campaign succeeded but we should adjust it right if they're looking for jester why don't we put in a little doubt right they're looking for a blue-skinned tiefling why don't we just say oh i heard it was a green-skinned dwarf or something like that just do a little confusion so maybe they're not sure who it was who killed herself on the dock i heard she was already crazy or something like that and then maybe the ship that was taken didn't it have that distinct three-mast silhouette that you would definitely recognize yeah we could do some of that yeah sure a little flourish what what is it mr clay we want your input as you are definitely part of this team and you see her every hundred years the curse he's in the other port how long is the walk an hour we'd have to re-spellify ourselves oh how do you send a message to him you mean like spell message he's not going to respond to that all right think hard about this come to open quay lose all the thes you still have more words why do we know that he likes or hangs out with oh we can say marius needs help come to open quay-- laura and no shit now is that 17 that she's-- come now also the mistake is a boat how much do you charge on a weekly rate we might be gone a month or two he's literally our only job candidate choose your quarters we're trying to be quiet wow please sponsor our show please sponsor how big was the full one going to be (russian accent) rose gold is best gold (regular accent) i'm wearing an apple watch with a rose gold band on it (russian accent) it is the best color yeah we've got to show-- maybe this jogs orly's memory orly-- why am i showing this to you but here here's a piece of a map we retrieved we'd like to go there but keep it secret from the rest of the crew oh you were right fjord (laughs) as the crow swims those could just be vines not only will we do it we will do it in solidarity with you and your quest because we are a team a cohesive unit that acts as one when one member wants something we all want something right guys put it in on three ocean one two three now it's a-- laura and it's a new thing urukayxl marisha you have to give $100 to 826la every time we roll a one we have to donate $100 from our own wallets he's dead i'll take a watch six-- nine want any booze oh you don't drink mind if i drink all right well you joined us a little late in our adventures but many of us-- not me of course-- but many of us were maybe outcasts or whatever before over the course of spending some time together and traveling and doing some good things mostly good things but a few bad things together we've come to rely on each other and well it doesn't feel like we're outcasts as much anymore just trying to maintain that sense of a unit because even though we've made some mistakes and we'll probably continue to it feels like we're a little bit better when we're together this other fellow in the group mollymauk he sort of showed us that by dying i'm just trying to keep us together we all have our own things right i'm sure you have your own thing that's good thank you he will definitely need lots of healing on this island between you and me jester's a really bad cleric so-- it'd be good if you could just stick-- if i go right you go left you stick with caleb okay you have sisters and brothers oh that's right you told us you had a large family but they're all scattered about right are they trying to save your town is it a town is it your home they're out there trying to find a solution for whatever ails it you've had no contact with them well i hope no one breaks in i'm not a religious lady but i will tell you that for me this journey with this group has been a bit of a sign i know that you're questioning whether it was for you but-- a sign that there could be for all of us another chapter i'm going to drink now what is it what's going on like some poop no oh no laura asks a good question oh do you want someone to roll for yasha whoa best roll ever 11 whoa no not our crew ooh not my strength eight 15 plus-- action surge (like sesame street's the count) a two a d a 12 ah ah ah what how does this-- huh who whoa that was awesome okay why not i will nope that's not a d20 a ten and a one great my rolls were better is anyone in melee range with anyone else i'm going to shoot at that one okay 15 sneak attack 18 points of damage fire again bonus action oh not good 11 hits whoa no sneak attack eight points of damage i've got you nameless deckhand i'll use my movement to run over to the deckhand and be like you're okay now you're fine anything oh okay there were six-- punch attack yeah let's talk it out oof wind physics is it carrying our deckhand over open water now okay i will fire at the thing with my crossbows yeah there's only one left

one more time 18 to hit only eight more points of damage oh no ooh percentage dice oh nice oh no it's his condition it's a heart condition he always has had one since he was a boy yes he needs mouth to mouth resuscitation no no no my mouth is too small for a human jaw to make perfect contact no i can't get my mouth wide enough too many teeth are in the way that would be good you or beau really all right i think it'll help-- he's still not out of the woods i think we all need to pray yes oh maybe he's okay wow you guys we saved his life with the power of friendship yeah but we all were there to pitch in more friendship just more friendship (hisses) it's working there's a harpy dead on deck right i'm going to definitely butcher one of them and try to take some meat for myself and for the
