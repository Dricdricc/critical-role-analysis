you don't have to worry about it it'll be near me and that would be great his name is bixby i'll take a tea that's normal (laughter) did they not budget correctly for this how's that bruise feel for

distracted make hay while the sun shines i suppose and you have some sort of plan they're rewriting something they always rewrite something i could probably do my line a little better feedback or something (slurred) make hay while the sun shines i suppose and you have some sort of plan we made different choices (whispers) take one was fine you know pierce is fucking taking forever with this tea also i don't think he owns a car he was back with the starbucks we whip out our fucking iphones and we start making phone calls did we sign our contracts yet (laughter) what do we do wait are there currently liams in the control room (laughs) trademark it sam and i'm going to assist my character name is is sam okay this is good with advantage we can bust through the window bixby get over here that's a good roll we're trying weird candy too wait should we stealth let's stealth out of here do i have to roll for bixby i got a five bixby got a three (laughter) impassable maybe there's a vault down here there's a lot of old vaults down here you can't go over there what if that thing grabs you should we create a diversion what else do we have a bow and daggers i'll take the bow are there any arrows how are we going to get past the big claw thing what if it grabs one of us i got a five ashley's here she's not working on this game maybe they were editing something from a previous game we run towards the light this is hell for what what are we rolling eight you're going to od on advil at summer camp yeah how many arrows do i have yeah ooh there's 25 arrows i'm pretty bad i can't kill the dog i told my friend i would-- i will not take a shot at it i will nock an arrow and be ready but i will not provoke something that isn't threatening us it's a block should be a block okay i'm holding bixby i rolled a 19 for me and a three for bixby i'm proficient in stealth does that mean anything this wasn't the thing you had prepared he's rolling with us tonight the whole map and we just blew right past it hey laura you know how beasts work 17 can i command the beast is that an action to command the beast i'm a beastmaster ranger with a dog shit when we were in the recording studio i should have had advantage on everything because my favored terrain is recording studios (laughter) wait the beast knows we're there and is eating protein right now i'm going to-- wait is that a pool okay i'm going to set bixby down and tell him to protect laura well she's a dainty girl not at all (laughs) no i set the thing down and i take my bow and arrow and i'm going to attempt to shoot the beast i'm going to roll i don't know what i add to it well is it this plus four for the bow okay so that's a 12 no i'm a level-one ranger wait i get movement still don't i i'm going to use my movement to run behind taliesin plus six the thing we're fighting cowered you're grappled i say bixby go retrieve my arrow that i shot over there and then i will nock another one am i too close to it to attack this okay well then i'm going to step out from around taliesin so i got a good shot am i in danger of hitting travis okay so i will fire again okay what do i add plus four 20 i look at laura see i'm good is he drowning okay i'll use my movement to retrieve bixby i'm a beastmaster i command beasts it's dead we know this right oh shit what is that move is it a blue prius we've got to go find ashley but the tower's only one leg we can't climb one leg of a tower you can certainly have a go was that it you are pretty big i'm going to tell bixby hey bixby hey buddy can you watch our back and if anything comes bark i think he understood me just stay stay and watch i'm not going to let her go up there by herself take your phone and text us well maybe text still works and now an animal handling check (laughter) where and what do you want us to do bixby bixby come i'm sorry boy yeah so maybe we go up can we go across the rooftops did you see did you see a way a path so we can just walk across the rooftops towards the cafeteria wait from our vantage point does it look like warner brothers studios is the epicenter of this or can we see parts of burbank and television city but does it seem to be originating from here is it just everywhere (laughs) god he really is dumb all right i'll start going across the rooftops or whatever i'm holding him i promised my friend that i would take care of him this weekend a promise made is a promise kept travis as we go i turn to travis and say hey man listen just level with me this was a single-scale session for me are you getting double-scale yeah are they paying you more than me come on just level with me i asked my agent she said it was most favored nations i need that money i just value my talents as much as yours and i think i should be compensated just as much yeah of course how close are we at this point we've got to climb down and do we have to traverse ooze to get to it there's vines travis okay but before we go laura grab that dagger of yours why don't you cut off that vine that way we'll have at least a rope we can use for something okay that's six feet right eight feet how long's this vine that we can cut down here natural 20 (oohing) i'm carrying the dog do you want to rest take that back you're going to need that hit point you want to take a little rest if we rest you might feel one point better wait did you take some damage back there maybe we should rest for a second yeah that was back so wait there's no ooze what are we going to make a raft or something laura i'll give you a piggyback ride and i'll carry this dog at the same time i'm 19 i got 19 they're on my back i'm carrying laura laura's got the dog you're stealing my dog laura where are you going i am going to follow them quite quickly he just had tentacles shoot out of his arm he's fine none of our phones are working anymore wait did we jump four years into the future not with the show are there monsters attacking you was that a snapchat filter what was that how did she do that much less than 24 hours so we're in the cafeteria oh no the radiation again ashley said to go to the tower she tried she took military showers maybe they're not fully formed yet maybe this is where they're born wait was liam ever liam it's dead conan o'brien oh it's liam o'brien and conan o'brien what are those things down there is that wreckage do they make a conan mini i turn to travis and say dude are you making one-and-a-half scale just tell me is it close to what i'm getting it's higher than that can you talk to somebody about it for me all right let's go kill this thing does it see us are we stealthing oh okay eight bixby takes my initiative oh boy cast taliesin what are you talking about but that thing's magic you're a voice actor how many daggers do you have left i tell the pug to go find that dagger and then i will turn do i have a shot at travis's liam okay i'll take a couple steps nock my arrow and say watch your backs travis watch your six that's what they say in games and i'll turn the bow like this sideways and i'll fire pug life 16 that's a 20 what do i roll it just says plus two seven you didn't get a shot at him i'm sorry buddy but these are fun oh no 12 i know liam too well i know all of his moves no save no nothing with advil-tage how's the pug doing is he getting closer to the knife great there's a guy right next to me isn't there yeah he's flanked by an ally this is the thing you try to pull all the time okay i'll lean down and grab the dagger flick it to laura and then i'll look up to conan o'brien and i'll draw my bow and arrow and i'll look for that red mane of hair i'll just fire one straight at it yes that is a 23 oh it's an eight plus two is ten points of damage you're a hack conan a hack your best days are behind you bixby throw your body in front of it i've got some good spells just ask me oh shit maybe he is how do you know it missed i didn't roll or anything okay nice sorry bixby just throw the sword wait oh are there no more o'briens but wait are there bad guys that haven't gone they haven't had turns in a while 12 okay let's see do i have a clear shot at the last-- is there one remaining liam okay i'll scoot over a couple paces actually no sorry i won't shoot at that one because i got to leave something for you guys to do i'll shoot at conan again so i will fire another one right at conan all right okay 17 in your face another eight plus two is ten one finger of death he loves casting spells he knows how to do it well yeah i bought them for you guys what's that one no i'm so curious i'll take a bite of zagnut no save i can't halve it with some sort of constitution save or something it just happens i'm now where i was before i got the 25 hit point boost 11 damn you're going to pay for that conan o'brien it has a range of 30 you could stand on the dog and get another foot that's almost ten feet there's a car you can jump up on the car yeah you want to try this big hunk by the way here travis every time it's a guilt trip we've got to get him down sure it was all right i'm going to start heading towards the tower with all of my movement and for my attack i command bixby to attack travis and i say to travis i am worth than you motherfucker i should be getting double scale i have more experience i have more nuance you can do one thing big beefy characters and that's it oh no more liams oh god again i am unconscious as i fall i say you did this travis you have my life on your conscience wait do i make a death saving throw i don't know how this works next round i was your only ranged attacker but wait wasn't he at disadvantage for other things what are you going to do in my frozen state i say mouth to mouth (laughter) that's your whole turn (strained) mouth to mouth wait i'm far away from travis hey my dog gets an attack of opportunity no fails no my arm blame my agent (strained) mouth to mouth oh thank god oh but those were temporary hit points from ashley right ooh so i'm at 30 god matt's so powerful what did they bamf out oh that hits i have an arm again damn that matt is so powerful he needs to be nerfed am i too close for a ranged weapon attack not knowing what's going on with laura i'll use my movement to quickly give her mouth to mouth because i think she's frozen she might be hyperventilating it's a natural one (laughter) (moaning) ow braces what invisalign whoa (laughing) in what manner would you like to kill this put it on a shirt just say more like conan o'dyin' i don't know wait can't liches get back up again it is going to heal itself but that's it we did it wait what huh i don't know sorry someone told me i had some zagnut in my teeth we can all fit here let's see how this live show goes -- getting double scale for this i'm a little older than that apparently they undid that i never asked for it to be undone i look like i am around your guys' age they do age differently they are on a slower scale than you guys you guys are half-elves so you're only barely different so if you're 27 years old that means that you guys are teenagers yeah but if you're 27-year-old half-elves do you look like you're 18-year-olds we are working on that game emma is real warner brothers games is a game place where we record much pierce is awesome if you could play as another character of vox machina body switch for a day who would it be i think i would if i could switch characters well grog is pretty fun man it's a pretty fun character and he does big damages and stuff yeah i think grog it's fun to be dumb i have a team of writers (laughter) that is so flattering could possibly do something cool for you guys mean give travis a starting lineup on the titans for one game maybe preseason game you played some ball if you were given the shot just one shot you get one play what position are you going to play defense/offense so you're blocking it said how much do the giants washington's team and the eagles suck i refuse to say the name of washington's team question liam what was your inspiration for this story have you seen it yet how much time do i spend on my goblet i spend one minute before the episode gluing something to the bottom and it's whatever i can find lying around that day (giggles) not a fair question neither are useful they are just energy sucks i have a newfound respect for laura having just played a beastmaster ranger it's tough to have this stupid animal around all the time that you have to deal with who can't really do anything and could die at any minute i know but it's hard to do that i have a newfound respect for you i still don't like trinket question who does pike like we don't know you know how do you know because ashley told you or because pike told you on the airship you're the captain titty ruxpin is the worst porn by the way i would be cabin boy wait is that what we established you're cabin boy or i'm cabin boy i'm cabin boy and you're the captain someone wants to know travis what class were you in the game we just played fighter i do not say pick up in my real life pick up i didn't know stealing was bad why do people want to send me money oh oh yeah this guy says 50 or so tickets remain 11 vip and 56 general tickets remain les mis but there's other ones that are good too was there anything on your character sheets tonight that you did not get to do but wish you had done that wasn't on your sheet was it i have favored terrain of voiceover booths and i didn't get to use it from the twitter checking it out criticalobrien tag here we go question if your character could get the kill on any one of the dragons which one would you want it to be on and why wait green dragon's the dickish one right that's a great question there's so many great submissions that we could not sort through them all this week so we're moving it to next week there's some amazing designs what are all these baby questions for i disagreed completely he was so good great job prepping liam it's similar to if you watch a lot of porn does that desensitize you to-- i think the answer's yes why did conan choose you you can answer that how's this going to work we do the show and then the vips can stick around after the show wow this is going to be so much fun do i get to wear makeup on stage and if it doesn't go well they can put civil war up and everyone gets a nice show matt does some scares in every episode we should not have done that there was a question-- shit i've already forgotten it yeah and i got to liam and he jumped off the fucking ledge out of range of all of my spells and any help i could have given there was one question earlier that said laura and travis how did it feel rping as a couple tonight no i have a lot of great nuggets from the past but you and me have some-- we had done some screen acting as children i have a pizza hut commercial that i'm quite proud of where i was the dweeb cousin norman the nerd google it now yep hot cheeto's up there sure that is true we don't know i had no idea i had a daughter i had no idea that changes all kinds of things for my guy i just dumped pike i dumped pike who knew that was going to happen she was pretty broken up over it new york comic con are we going back to new york comic con we went last year let's start combining them do you guys watch the live show tpk character-- if you could have one thing answered about the current campaign from matt mercer what would it be what are you dying to know that he hasn't told us yet i feel that drive to know i want to know anything has matt ever had to crash with one of you guys because marisha got mad at him after a game am i a joke to you that is not a good question to end on man so many trying to bone my daughter that's a good one ninjas can you close out the night with your patented phrase
