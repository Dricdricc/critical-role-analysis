i think you mean upgraded i can't open this there's lego stuff my kid's gonna love this lego dimensions fun pack of-- that's liam neeson voltron that's not voltron i'm so stupid no i'm pretty sure that's voltron guys ooh 'how to build a tabletop rpg character' that's very helpful i will read that okay i just wanted to say the things that we're supposed to say which is our sponsor lootcrate this was their last month's theme 'build' this month's theme is 'primal' featuring brands like x-men overwatch and predator if you go to lootcratecom/criticalrole and use the promo code 'criticalrole' one word you get 10% off i've prepared a very very small bit tonight because i knew we had the unboxing to do i thought for our international audience they might like to know how to say lootcrate in different languages so i did some really good research not five minutes on google translate i'll tell you that much in spanish lootcrate is 'las ganancias cajas' in german it's 'der zaster casten' in japanese it's 'senri-hin kureto' in latin it's 'praedam corbis' in dutch it's 'buit krat' in swedish we're talking 'plundra spjällĺda' and in klingon (yells in klingon) (all cheer) oh and in pig latin it's 'am-say's ick-day is ig-bay' all right good taliesin's on an iphone 2 over there one of them was taliesin's announcement that he has some show on wednesday nights don't worry we'll get like three more taliesin just made a robot 17 more announcements guys yes to become underwater sea-breathers i mean technically i could it would use a lot of my spell abilities but i could give four of my little coins to people and those coins could be used to alter yourself to be a water-breathing madman like me well sort of just you but with gills sure yeah you could do that i could also think of a spell that would give you a clever rastafarian crab sidekick well yes if we want to recover all our abilities for tomorrow at dawn we swim no (laughs) crafting goggles would it be helpful to craft something that would allow us to speak or-- i am i would say the best at crafting actually i've spent my whole life doing it i have no idea but the adventure is to try right and i certainly will give it a go a bubble around what ooh the firearm the firearm has to be enclosed not you but it would only last one shot blow a hole in the side then water would get out that might be something we could try to make i suppose we could take apart trinket that's your bear right that's your robot bear we could take apart that oh well then never mind we don't touch doty we lure the kraken onto land yes antlers i mean if you inspected them you would know that they say 'td' on them they're sort of personal to me i've had them minted i don't think that would work it's sort of a thing that i can do and i'm pretty cool at it none taken i respect the question and i respect you wanting to work with someone of my skill set and aptitude i saw your work back there at the last fight and well the gunslinger was rendered useless and everyone else was fighting on the other boat against lesser allies uh enemies i mean you and i held off that beast together and it was quite amazing to watch i made the kill it was 100% mine but you were there and it was a good assist and i appreciate it i have a question for you as well my rod of mercurial form we know that it can turn into a crossbow how many crossbow arrows do i own any 40 okay great thank you yes i would love that thank you how much do i owe you for it it seems like you're just fucking with me (all laugh) let's call it an even five gold well i don't want there to be any sort of implied favors or anything that i have to return later if you're all right with it i'd like to just keep this business thank you i mean are we doing that i can do four of those alter self coins yeah we're treading water ooh i like this she is smart yes yes absolutely i volunteer to be a rider or a captain of the ship sort of a harness around the big man i think that would be quite a formidable steed all right just strategizing chum i don't know what at will means but i'm very impressed i do what do we need it for oh to put the-- the things in that we're finding oh yes yes of course and they would be great keepsakes oh well if we find an extra one perhaps i could take that back as a-- yes new guy here-- no nope nope new guy here just a process question i'm new to these sort of strategy seshes that you guys have is this how it always is with people just throwing out random bad ideas constantly for like 15 minutes wow because i really-- this is a big fight for me i've never fought anything quite so big is there a chance that we might perish because it doesn't seem like we have a good plan right now all right that does make me feel better that sounds like the stupidest fucking plan i've ever heard i've read some of those all right oh did you do alter self just now no more spells (dolphin noises) well if i may the big fellow over there said that he had some sort of vials that you could breathe air out of is that true may i examine it no it's not what is the thing that you have hm please don't leave me behind i would love to but there's no one to ride that makes sense it's amazing like a lure i don't like any of this when i was treading water before was it difficult in armor was it-- and if i were to remove my armor would i be weak and squishy uh-huh but it's shiny i have a robe i have a robe i can just wrap myself in my robe it has some colorful patches on it yes but they're not shiny stitch up the front of my robe all right i would yes thank you thank you thank you so much you lot are taking good care of me i appreciate that thank you this is going to be fun right tomorrow yes all right this reminds me of one of my caretakers when i was younger stitching up some of my play clothes it's a nice feeling thank you so much skyfuck (keanu reeves as johnny utah impression) he's not coming back trinket-form how many of us need my coins to become altered oh well then i can just-- you won't be able to swim very fast though she can't use alter self and pass without a trace yes yeah i need one for me so four of them you could just have water breathing and be riding a whale but if you get tossed from the whale can you swim and then you can use it if you need it you're a whale i know every knot in the book the double-sloop the reverse-cowgirl i know 'em all i've got the itsy-bitsy spider i know the rusty trombone i've got-- yep got the figure eight the figure four the hidden figures i've got a bunch of 'em yep oh yes that one that one's good (all laugh) bigly man over there do you want a coin in case you lose your whale form what about you percival all right you say 'alter self' and slam it against your body and it'll make you with gills and stuff does he speak-- he speaks common right he understands what i'm saying make big big hit say 'alter self'-- all right i guess i'll make four coins and pass them out to percy little elf boy little elf girl and jumbo oh have you heard the legend of taryon darrington good then we're equals that's very confusing okay okay were your parents fond of you because to name
