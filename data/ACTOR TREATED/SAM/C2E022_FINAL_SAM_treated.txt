d&d beyond everyone yeah there's an animated thing that if you haven't seen you should check out that's pretty cool as announced during the stream of many eyes this past weekend new adventures waterdeep dragon heist and waterdeep dungeon of the mad mage are now available-- on laura's phone-- for preorder on d&d beyond check out the d&d beyond marketplace now to learn more and order now and the great thing about d&d beyond guys is that it simplifies managing your stats and inventory so you can just focus on creating creating new encounters creating new characters creating new monsters and i thought i would inspire our audience by showing them what kind of-- some samples of some new monsters that they could create now you could use the same old stats but maybe you give them a little new spin or a new flair and to help i made some artistic interpretations of some of my new monsters so these are some new monsters you can create you guys have all heard of a bulette we fought them well this is a bull-ette it's a female bullet you can tell 'cause it's pink yeah i printed out a picture of a bullet and i colored it in pink and it only fires once so it's a very quick encounter you've heard of a displacer beast this is a despacito beast it's the same thing as a displacer beast except you hear dub-a-dub-a puerto rico dub-a-dub-a ay bandito when it goes invisible no i drew these you guys have heard of an owlbear well what about putting a little creative spin on it and making it a bowel-bear it has crippling ibs oh there's more guys yeah it has a shit-spray attack here's one i'm pretty proud of you guys there's a monster in the manual called the giant wasp well this is the giant wasp but he's a white anglo-saxon person a wasp you know a wasp-y guy he's a wasp yeah that's not true i don't know okay there's two more okay there's two more this is a bone dirtdevil it's a bone devil that cleans up after every fight yeah i drew that one last but not least it's a fanta-core (laughter) you like the bone dirtdevil guys there were more that i didn't even draw there was the lin manuel miranda-boleth (laughter) check out more on my website but there's fish men and possibly fish women right down there that could come out and kill us in our sleep what if there's unlimited numbers of them what if there's a whole-- you only saw like five did you keep going down into the tunnels we're just going to gloss over the fact that fjord has three bird nicknames that does not sound good it's like a sound board wait if you get really excited you should go (air horn blaring) are we going to sleep for today i did not oh i did we have to save it for tomorrow second as well that's a four high roll oh shit no we're on watch we haven't seen anything it's just a dream we should wake everyone up fjord (cawing) don't wake up kiri though she deserves a really nice night's sleep i'm going to give her my blanket i remember saying that we should hide the corpses and cali actually said don't do it there's no point to it so we should blame cali that's what cali said why don't we just blow up the hole why do we want to go down there there's crazy people down there you could just say be quiet thank you we woke her up though but it was cute is our rope still dangling down the hole if it comes up should we grab it i fired and missed with a natural one you're going down there by yourselves take good care of him he can't make it without you he will not come back alive he will have no chance of survival okay i'm going to cast message are you still alive you can reply to this message oh yeah while yasha's waiting she can clean up the bodies you can reply to this message (singing) run away run away this is your five-foot greatsword (laughter) it's much better

watch i don't like water probably i don't like it though taking the piss i'll stay with kiri you guys can go and i can stay with kiri i'm not good at many things (groans) (groans) i'll stay with kiri and if there's trouble we'll see what happens pass without a trace i mean i don't like fighting but sure we could tie the rope-- oh we can't tie the rope to you because now it's tied on the other side so you're a fast swimmer can you still cast spells oh okay sure my duty is to take care of kiri right sounds like caleb wow jesus what is happening why is there a remote control ooh it just got blue

good the booby-looking thing take the stubble off of it come on yasha come on yasha plan ahead yes let's did you guys scan the area for despacito beasts ooh that's a lot of spells if we survive this yeah hasty wow i'll send a message to caleb are you guys alive and do you need anything you can reply to this message uh-oh that's it i'm going to think about it she got shocked so hard we saw parts of her dream (laughter) were you saying the curse of the islands i hand the books to little kiri and i say keep these safe good idea i'll take a little bit of fleece and rip it and cast silent image and make a wall of stone around kiri just say don't move go over to the water put my foot in and then-- withdraw it and take a big swig (laughter) sheâ€™s got like 100 more points this is your thing you are strong so you're rerolling for him you're great at jumping over small bodies of liquid marisha you're super fast remember you're super fast see kiri i think they would have called if they really needed me i think no news is good news and-- that's probably a good sign and the water looks cold anyway and you could get hypothermia so you know i've got to protect you and yeah that's my turn (laughter) refresh it's in your notebook somewhere your character sheet you printed it out somewhere right mildly hurt guilt attack i'll take one more swig and i'll jump in the water bonus action dash where are they let me at them i'll save you all get this water off me ah i'll shake like a dog can you see into our world cat's paw's gone these dice are wrong and bad dice and they should be put away forever did laura go to deliver the baby right now seeing my friend caleb down i'm filled with a mighty rage and i will draw my crossbow load my burning bolt and run at it screaming and firing that's a 20 to hit (counting) fury of the small 21 plus the burning bolt is another three 24 total on the first hit is it still alive bonus action shot 22 to hit it's just one now another eight points that's it oh no you're all grouped together oh no is he within the cube decides to kill liam forever that's only three squares right it doesn't have to be in front of you it says in any direction you're looting him before he-- not attractive wow i didn't even need it because i wasn't hurt at all in the fight the baby can hear all of this roll for dilation i'll help him oh okay i can do that are there any boxes or treasure chests with disadvantage that's an eight i'll take those if you're going to meditate maybe go back and check on the little bird i think she's okay i left her in an invisible-- i made a false rock let's hear it liam is it locked there's a locked box two boxes okay yes sounds good to me i'll try-- should i try to open the box what is it what are they oh okay i'll cast mage hand from afar and try to unlock the big box oh an 18 and a 19 (sing-song) whoopie-doopie-doopie-doopie-doop click no i'm opening it fuck off grandpa is it a super long blade or is it like a rapier-type thing no i don't think-- we'll melt it down and sell it for raw gold could be the end of a sending stone or something should we take them all ah you're a cyclops kill her he's teaching you magic listen carefully you'll learn new spells this way what did he just say oh yes okay should i open it all right i'll finger it from afar it's a one i'll open it what is this thieves' tools i'll never figure this out dexterity plus-- i rolled a ten there's no blade well this was a metal box no let's wait in real time 11 minutes no he said before that it didn't look like the blade made the gash in the eye touch it meaning his penis oh he's dead he died what the fuck was that what just happened did the ship sink or maybe he's cursed and he's going to turn evil and kill us all in our sleep or maybe your father is a sperm whale and that's how you survived because you're half whale or fish i think that that's likely they wanted this eye thing for having the thing inside of you maybe they can sense it we solved it just like his dreams can you breathe can you breathe underwater or it can only be on the full moon or something i know mythology can i just point out not to be a jerk-- can we put them all in the bag what do you mean where they're supposed to be they stole it from the smugglers any shortswords better than my shortsword i like mine do they seem sharper or deadlier we're back up on the upper level should we blow up the tunnel i don't but two of us do wait do i we have two of them among us i think it's molly and fjord they were probably smugglers that were keeping the safe house for the gentleman or taken prisoner oh my god we're the worst people ever this makes me feel awkward that was really good guys yes it is she was really rude to you and-- find our way out i think we have (cocks crossbow) a troll to find or we could just leave did you just salt bae them wait where was it
