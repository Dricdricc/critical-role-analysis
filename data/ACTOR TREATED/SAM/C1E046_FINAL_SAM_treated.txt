again i'm just sticking with my method here 8d6 thank you thank you did you do this one too 28 i think i would like to if there's a way i'd like to angle it somehow so that he will drop right on top of grog i feel like grog can do something to a falling behemoth damn it all right yes let's do that so grog can feel like he gets part of this too and if i can i'd like to burn a big s in his chest what what is it you shouldn't have looked at me when i cast my spell i was wrong to doubt you you're a horrible person communicable diseases what a nice guy he is certainly not someone we should
