circular tower yes behind it that's my action that's it do i see him does he see me okay like a matador pawn to rook four woodchuck to gray squirrel woodchuck to gray squirrel five master d&d players i tried the doorknob i didn't really give it all the effort you can't see keyleth popping out of the-- i'm going to cast healing word on myself at level one it's three plus six right great awesome nine more points guys i can see grog i could take a pot shot at him but that would just kick the hornet's nest a bit i could score eight points of damage on him and then die i need to just heal in that case i will dominate grog oh wait shit no i can't do that is he worked up is he raging can i tell okay forget that then forget it i could put on my hat of disguise (laughter) no just so that you guys would think i'm a kindly old man who just walked onto the battlefield if i use my bonus action healing word to heal myself can i also use my action to cast a higher level healing word on myself or is that-- okay then i will cast minor image minor illusion or whatever it's called that only has 60-feet range 30-feet range 60-feet range shit you know what i'll do major image then fine fuck it i'm going to do major image and it's going to sure look like scanlan is just walking right out to the edge of the water right there not from there he's just going to appear right there he's going to come out from around that corner and look out like he's looking for a target you have to shoot i thought you said you were holding your action got it wait for the tower i thought you said i'm holding an action until i see anyone okay that's my action then i'm done second question six inches soft (laughter) third question shaved wait how the fuck did grog get all the way over there that's amazing that's true if it's anything like hide & seek you'd probably be like i really have to pee right now i stuck my face out and i got 140 points of damage he may not even be playing with us shit are you double poisoned yeah i know you have to see the people you're doing it to i don't have a plan tonight bonus action healing word do i know where that goes no i don't know how those things work i heard a bunch of smashing kitty-corner to me and i haven't seen anything else cool what that sounds great i'm going to have major image scanlan ice skate across the water in a jaunty way he's walking on water as i've always wanted to do marisha and he's not a real thing he can do anything he's going to walk across the water going hey over here hey while he's creating that distraction i'm going to peek around and see if i see anything around the tower yeah anything 15 okay i duck back that's it yeah naturally sparkling you would be just dumb enough to do that (sings with background music) (sings with background music) man liam's rp is so good tonight the last move though was so goth hi guys scanlan shorthalt here thanks it's lofty knowing where percy is i'm going to peek around the corner sure but i kind of know he's up there and i heard booms distantly over here feeling a red-hot anger towards percy for shooting me-- and also gaming out that there's people over here right centered on this spot i'm going to cast anti-gravity reverse gravity 50-foot radius keyleth for sure are they always attached nice 100 feet up because you said the top is like 90 feet up so i want her to go all the way up to the ceiling i'll duck back behind the thing and i will say drat it didn't work on percy i'll use my bonus action to say percy i wasn't aiming at you shit he doesn't hear anything pretty good oh jesus bonus action healing word yep i just sang a little song to myself okay so for all who care i'm up to 63 and i'm going to look at keyleth say into my earring friends let's go fucking kill vax at least find him this is not a fair fight without him and then i will dimension door to the opposite corner again oh yeah whose turn hello bye-bye has he hit the anti-gravity field yet i didn't know you were even there unintended consequences don't worry i'll get rid of it on the next round-- oh wait you'll plummet to your death can you only send him moves in gif form sure sure i'm going to do a mr bean followed by a-- he could be somewhere over there liam and matt could i see her by the way when she flew over and down like that my turn jesus christ i don't know what to do i only see keyleth i've only seen keyleth this whole game do i see grog up there flying okay i will peek around the corner i kind of know where keyleth is i kind of know where grog is no one has responded to my text message of let's go find vax bonus action healing word oh wait wrong one jesus i don't know what to do i'm not going to go after keyleth without backup you don't speak english all right so i'm going to announce to everyone i am going to search for vax hold your fire and i'll walk i guess around this thing can i get around it without-- actually no i don't know where he is at all yeah all right i'm going to start going this way i'll use dash to keep going really no one's near the lightning towers i guess i could have dropped anti-gravity i forgot you want me to get rid of it i forgot i'm sorry can i do it now matt no it's fine you just gave up for legitimately six seconds are you jumping across the river does he have to leave the ground to jump across for what we're all flying now water bed i'm still walking across this room as fast as my little feets can carry me and i'm kind of out of low-level spells at this point but it won't be a bonus action anymore will it can i do a bonus action at a higher level if i don't do a spell for my action ugh wow that is insane i will not do that yet no i'll do that i'm so down okay oh yeah level three so that heals me another 12 points yeah man that's my bonus action then i'll use my action to sneak out and look-- oh wait i can get out and around back here right i'll do that and when i get out the door i'm looking around what do i see i see everybody floating in the air this is crazy do i let them go i need help finding vax but i don't even know if they're on my side right now they haven't responded to my text okay then i'm going to release the gravity that's first blood (laughter) he's sending you a gif right now of dramatic chipmunk we've got a rogue there's no door is it a refrigerator but it can't go through stone scanlan's up scanlan's going to peek around the corner i'm going to throw in a firebolt right in the front door wand of fireballs two charges that's 9d6 15 i got him guys he's real rough bonus action i'm going to put on gloves of swim/climb i think i got them in pathfinder i don't know what they are great that's it first blood 28 we got a little liam there liam talked yeah man demise that's nice it's a good throw i can i'm going to dash right towards keyleth no just run how far away am i so more than 30 fuck you (laughter) goddamn it goddamn it all right i mean i'll just-- sorry changing my mind seeing if this works what is the save wisdom she's so wise she's not immune to charm though i've already charmed her once yeah fuck it one more thing to check sorry this is a brand new spell i've never used it what's the range it's 30 feet great i will dominate person yeah it's not going to work because she's super wise but i'll try 22 it's fine as my bonus action i will say to her that spell was an inspiration and we're still on the same team right okay me too what's up who's next hey he was a blur came over shot at you and left oh shit counterspell level six ah wait the range is 30 feet oh okay sorry probably yeah yeah it says range 60 it's used as a reaction wait what no counterspell is ten plus the level wait what got it so that's 13 plus six is 19 yeah i go verily you are-- bad person we're both making mistakes i know i do too we're making stupid mistakes because we're so anxious we really are what lighting that was keyleth's turn why would colville do this to us he's a kind and gentle lord wow all this work destroyed i run after keyleth and i say wait i forgot feeblemind i will use wish to cast feeblemind on her to impossible to defeat spells (groaning) 11 she can still fucking wild shape every turn yes i'll duck somewhere so she can't see me you said feeblemind has a super long range right i didn't move at all i'm going to move back over this way he's checking if you do it before the roll or not i am calling it now keyleth still wins how does she know where i am what's that even mean not overwhelmed just whelmed a strength saving throw okay these aren't good 14 can i cutting words no right jesus you can do that you can hit grab and pull all on one action but like bigby's hand can either hit or grab not hit and grab and pull and she's pulling me away so her intelligence and charisma went to one but her wisdom still exists okay good to know all right can i use verbally-based spells okay then i will cast underwater and cast dimension door we just asked that and i will since i don't know where i am i will bamf to a place that i do know which is-- where would i go let's go to the room across the water over there right there near the pacman teleporter yeah yeah closer to the water's edge but yes how many he sees me through all that fucking rubble i'm dead i hold up my gun and say need one motherfucker i'm going to cutting words that with my little taunt and reduce it by-- oh that's true never mind well then i'll cutting words the damage you can do that right okay well then you hit they're all bad hits massive hit it's going to have to be a really good roll nope oh it's a d12 i've been doing d8s this whole time one ow ow what he can hold three attacks and one attack is three he's going to shoot me eight times sure yeah i will cutting words top of the round i get my reaction back then i'm dead on me aw 17 you know what i would have done on the third attack first blood you did a lot of nothing damage to both of them and then hid you'll never win vax scanlan from the grave 11 you're going to heal me the new campaign will be all texts i'm prone i get half who will tell my story taliesin and you did first blood i cast slowly decompose aww weirdly taking away all of keyleth's intelligence has made her a more effective fighter it's so fixed can't be done don't you get it the math's not there you have to deliver more than 200 points of damage in a single round to kill her you can't do it without us the math is not there first blood and grog just suffocated oh each time and she hit him twice a little you can't win i'm jamming we jamming can you get to the middle and stay there until the whole island kills her would you say she's jamming into the wall it's cramming do it yeah but you can draw first blood crush him that's you you can do 5th-level spells damn it's 6d8 halved thunder damage no because she saved she doesn't get pushed until the next turn and that's when the irresistible dance kicks in delayed response the ghost of scanlan floats in front of you in 30 days she'll know what happened like a sensory deprivation tank thanks to marvel puzzle quest
