casting it at i'm going to open the door and look 'cause why not okay can i look around the guest bedroom just kinda snoop around up in things i'm taking a dump on the guest bed (laughter) but also just covering it up with a blanket afterwards oh (grunts) i'm invisible it's poop (laughter) scanlan's just like i hate this mission (strained) don't say 'pinched off' to me (laughter) is there is a door next to me for another room oh i'm just finishing okay she could probably hear muffled from behind the door (grunts) aren't you right next to the guy kill him my invisible pantaloons i phantom pooped did i find anything in there by the way i'm coming with him if i can get there ask for oh you're gonna ask the chat room something intelligence some sort of a mind thing who's you two oh boy it

spells back i'm gonna look all over the great hall and see if there's any cool stuff in there hey what's the darkness right next to me is there a door there what is that oh i'm gonna open it oh god i don't even know what that is (laughs) 15 what does that mean if i get close to the door without going through it can i see the guy okay well then i will just-- fuck (laughs) well if i can't see him then i will just yell at him i'll yell with vicious mockery i don't like you very much for poisoning me and my friends you're a poopy head (laughter) ooh that does seven points of damage it's vicious mockery it's an attack (sings) traps traps traps-traps-traps a labyrinth he's just not a nice man can i look at the door and see if the trap will go off again if we step through it again 20 i'm going to go in and look around some more look around for potions and stuff who's the singer here people can i do a-- can i investigate it or arcana it yeah that's a one oh wait no that's a seven these dice are horrible anyway it doesn't matter it's bad tiberius do you want to drink this for what uh mental note make more t-shirts guys guys the chatroom just solved the israeli-palestinian conflict (laughter) i can sing to you and give you an extra little roll are you vex or vax (laughs) all right i'll sing to you and-- are you gonna use a dice (sings) heal the vax make him a better elf sam and (sings) there are duergar dying if you cared enough for the adventurers you'd bring vax back to help us with the stabby-stab thank you thank you thank you you get a 1d6 for that to win wait they're above us oh here here at-- where we are now yes here no no no she just said there's a link upstairs the link from-- to k'varn that we need to-- let's leave this decision up to grog ah yes i have an idea but also are there two stairs up to the top floor perhaps we should use more than one one half of our band go up create a diversion the other half sneak up and kill kill kill that's one option the other option-- ah i do have an idea about gaining the upper hand on our first meeting with this army that's upstairs an intimidation technique of some sort i can't anymore much as i would love to no but we've heard over our eavesdropping that some of these duergar bastards are scared of that strange chimera sort of hodgepodge human centipede thing we could be one of those with a little bit of deception and all of us sort of piling on each other we could act like a big scary monster and go up and freak the fuck out of them they would probably be at least for the moment intimidated a bit and we could get a few licks in before they realized we're just a pile of idiots running at them (laughter) but that could be the diversion at least can you transform into anything how about the type of beast that we know would scare them like that big triceratops thing that we saw with the big metal thing on it does it involve shitting on a bed (laughter) he has a name their god maybe you should think it first think it through first so some of us are stealthing you're being a big god who talks loud and is riding a scorpion how about this-- so just to clarify are we all going up the same staircase or are we going up two separate staircases vex and vax-- you don't know what-- there could be a million rooms up there the dimension door's off the table but don't use the god thing but don't use the god thing until we get to the big group the big thing if you see a guard don't turn into a god you gotta see like more than five people before you turn into a god i have some inspiration dice to give out that i can give out as bonus actions can i give it out before we go into battle okay good to know but i can't mass give it out just have to give it to one person okay and do we want to send clarota and kima off through a different staircase so we have at least a backup plan in those action movies when there's one guy who goes away for a while he comes back at the end and saves the day if we did that-- cut the red wire wait which is the main chamber that you just-- oh that we were listening to at the door we're doing this i can do it hi scanlan here i don't wanna brag but i'm a regular ben franklin over here he's a guy he's a gnome i knew once i mean mine's so fricking powerful do you want me to shock 'em one at a time they were already in a line i say (chants) you ugly you ugly yo mama says you ugly and i cast vicious mockery (laughter) 19 just a five yes i shamed him to death i'm with them we're the stealth party who's going in first concentrate don't cast too much shit we weren't talking our door is open that's an attack right there you want it to be a lot but not too much (laughter) traps natural 20 nothing oh for dex plus nothing guys tune in every week for this kind of intense action (grog voice) i would like to rage i step into the room lining myself up with those two pig creature beast things in a line yeah can i also catch the king or no going for the guys i don't want to scald you you're already hurting i'm going to go straight across the piggies and make them squeal with lightning oh shit there's a trap 17 plus what 19 i cast lightning on the two beasts in a straight line if i can get the king i'll try 29 and then for bonus action i inspire vax with a little ditty (sings) i want to sing a song of inspiration of inspiration (laughter) as he does i sing (sings) dodge that sexy attack-oh white boy (laughter) five 14 okay okay okay i'm fine i'm fine i've got more than him ooh i forgot about her that was almost the name of this show not as catchy you still trying to be a god yeah you're all the way over somewhere else right i gave you some dice i gave you i gave you some dice it's not going to be enough though not great 14 i have no dexterity the old dominate thank you my love don't you shoot me oh no he's stoned i think you pee on the body and it cures them let's try it and find out i'm next to the king right i'm near the king over there okay i just make eye contact with him and i mentally tell him that he really has the urge to try to do a headstand lay down his weapon and he really just wants to see if he can do it (laughter) suggestion 19 through the hand cone through the hand cone can i also as my bonus action-- who's around me who needs inspiration who needs inspiring who's-- yeah oh shit i'll give pike some inspiration 'cause she's my awesome sweetheart hit (higher voice) hit still alive no longer alive (laughs) what he is you never know he might just start doing a headstand (laughter) he's so easily influenced (high-pitched) someone grab me and leave pike it's all on you dude keyleth keyleth get us out of here hi you're two feet tall he's a dragon with my knowledge of the arcane arts do i have any knowledge that using my dispel magic spell would work on grog or do i just have to try it does it take my move to just stand up but i don't have to be standing to cast a spell-- all right i'll stand up and i will-- jesus is it better for me to get out of there or get the king yeah but keyleth is right behind him i am a tiny tiny boy i can only do-- okay i swing my singing dawnblade at him (laughs) i have a dawn blade it's just so lame though it's so weak a natural 20 (cheering) so that's eight plus seven plus the dawn blade gets another bonus attack at disadvantage i've never hit anyone with a sword before five five plus-- ten-- i don't know what am i adding i've never used a sword before six i-- as i draw back the blade i say oh you should've stood on your head and i lop it off (sings) scanlan make you feel good oh great great i don't know how to use swords yay we've lost grog again son of a-- wait we gotta get our stone friends out no we don't all run out they're stone
