balloon the smell-over-skype plugin and of course the nintendo virtual boy but this new one i invented for our friends at d&d beyond it's an invention that i made-- i call it the d&d beyond merciri it's all the organizational power of d&d beyond in a tricked-out smart speaker with a helpful voice that some of you might recognize i'll demonstrate it for you right now guys okay merciri what's the best way to organize your d&d characters and campaigns hey see it works merciri tell me about the halfling race okay merciri cancel merciri who's the best player on critical role okay that's fine

bugs fine merciri could you please list the most handsome male cast members with a beard who are not taliesin liam or sam fuck you wait can you do that list one more time merciri yeah so she doesn't even have a beard merciri that's true okay merciri roll a d20 for me merciri roll another d20 for me fuck you oh my fucking god well i guess it's back to the drawing board guys let's wrap this up merciri could you tell the people where they can find d&d beyond okay thank you thank you guys look for this in stores soon and thank you merciri it did i'm a good inventor i'll be in the chat saying i know right the whole time i'll do the travis thing ready no we have them here whoa it's bigger than everyone is there another one oh shit we're taking this one to kinko's later to make copies he's really good i love it when you abandon it halfway through the word but my husband we spent three months searching for your backstory (laughter) i hear in xhorhas they have a captain there who has lots of eyeballs that you can ingest into your body yes lots of golden eyeballs that you can put in your belly all right what are we preparing me too but i'm not very perceptive i'll go with you i'm with marisha-- i mean beau wherever she is yasha's in the back sorry matt where would we put it otherwise where's the tripod and stuff right now we don't know that it might be very nice there let's just make sure you don't get captured and your bag doesn't get grabbed we're just looking on the bright side of things are you scared or a firefly we could catch it in a jar see look beau we have a plan profit yeah just roll a nature check it's fine traps no they wouldn't think anyone would be following them they covered up the thing with 200 feet of earth and rocks we're in the bored-out tunnel that the worm made right there's no water near us because we passed water on the way in you know that thing where you've gone so far that you can't really-- we can't turn around can we it feels like it would be a waste of a day we've got to keep going you could tattoo with it vivid dreams man me three xhorhas is that it getting good at this we're making the right choice it really is sexy on we go oh my god no ah well you said it sounds wet what does that even mean or it could just be wet or fjord could be dicking around with his cheek trick yes yes yes good idea don't fuck me gil you got this you don't got this i do i do and it's even a little bit yellow you should probably paint a dick on it i mean you could tag the whole place yes it's a speakeasy but it's like a pray-easy you could be the bouncer nice they they he it matt and we all took feats that make us immune to surprise right what's wrong with you why am i rolling these weird dice today this is a great map they look like stalagmites no i was hanging out with beau wherever beau is yeah sure that's not 25 to 20 12 for me as well it's going to be easy painting what did we see these attacks fail they don't move fast but-- oops no you're going to die oh okay they don't hurt i don't think so what me miss hit there's no save against this grapple it was a great game painting dicks i lose all the close men in my life she punched and it does nothing wait they can do that even though they're stunned five times i will not try to leave the grapple instead i will fire a crossbow bolt at this one that has me grappled with advantage because it's stunned oh not good both of them not good 15 bonus action fire again 28 yeah oh there's a couple ones okay 22 plus i'll do fury of the small that's another eight that's 30 points of damage good good that's all i've got banishment what okay let's go do we need to loot the bodies ropers what's that a tongue yeah i'll take that to my belly this is not the right way but if we go back the thing will be back i'll shoot an arrow 28 12 points of bolt damage oh no it's getting closer i back up a little another five feet i'm going to carefully aim and fire a gun at it my pistol it is disadvantage because it's longer than 30 feet away right so it would be not great 13 reload you're going to make it live you were eaten by it i think they were a couple i think they were married beau did you get hurt what are you doing over there well we only have about another two weeks of walking before we get to xhorhas unless you make us a wagon with paint and also horses and pavement what about bicycles you could paint eight bicycles it's a weird dream i had do one of you magic-y people have some way of next time we see a monster instead of killing it we could command it to carry us or something next time on we go out of the tunnels why'd you say shit what's going on okay well we'll come up with another plan you guys are smart let's go to sleep so we can start early in the morning barf shut up no what is that what's the oh no what is that that's even worse than oh shit what is that is he okay like i can't breathe i can't live anymore yes i know we'll find him you've experienced the same thing you've drowned oh that's right well you didn't know how would you have known no it's all right i'm sorry that i wasn't more helpful in that earlier fight when i panicked and didn't go in the water but it's not so bad if you're down in the water with your friends fuck you (laughter) i assume they've been making food for us and stuff it would pass the time it's like listening to a podcast when you're driving to work oh just like the path we're on around what around her waist around her buttocks what while i'm listening to beau i'm going to fold my arms so no one can see the shape of my nipples right now (laughter) he can't see in the dark are the rocks around here dug out like someone was digging 28 from above or from-- he just wanted to play parcheesi sneaking in so we could go up to get out if we wanted to get out we can go see the sun for a couple of hours get some vitamin d and then come back down edible pigeons no if we go topside what are the possible benefits of doing that we're going to xhorhas we could go up and maybe find a horse or something and coax it down here to take us faster i don't know if this miner fellow who was eaten alive left a couple of horses tied up there-- why would you bring them into the mountain you would leave them tied up on top the worm's hammer caduceus cast talk to objects ask the hammer who was your owner if we go up you said there's a lot of entrances and exits to this place we know that the cricks have been making many attacks so maybe this is where they go this is grand central and then they shoot off to different places to attack i don't either may i use my cloak caleb 21 against a tiny little thing tongues i am your leader i'm only a half really i'm half i can also offer you this-- i have a pouch of smoking tobacco you could smoke this and it will make you forget your troubles yes jesus 17 no don't eat it it's for smoking really you can eat it ugh all right they're very small though so in relation to them it may well be-- you can ask them is it cute or not if you rescue this thing could it be cute ever trade your dog for it just trade nugget for it the cat no you can't they're on our tail want me to take them out or at least-- disarm them they both have weapons go to sleep while they're shouting at each other i'm going to turn invisible and i'm going to sneak back there back towards them am i nearing them mm-hmm i'm going to try to sneak up on the one with the spear and get close to he or she and grab the spear out of their hand 20 i'll throw it the opposite direction down the tunnel away from us then while he or she is going to get their spear i'm going to try and grapple the weird one the one that's all weird and shit oh not advantage okay 19 what we were specifically told yeah i am your mommy yeah deal with it open ugh caduceus where are you when i need you hey bees i'm going to-- oh you two meaning me and chris ah con save 21 i've got one you're commanding me too don't make mommy (much deeper) mad (laughter) who are you (deeper) what do you want spurt what stick a bunch of what run your centipault what does it do all right show us the centipault maybe we should set up some sort of target for the young man he's going to shoot centipedes at you that's ingenious 18 do you know these tunnels at all have you explored since the worm came through what was that what did you just do don't beat your skunk but you're quiet and you can stealth right you snuck up on us very well sure how long do kobolds live do you like it down here do you want to come with us there's other places yes there's light and other terrain we don't know that we don't know xhorhas might love kobolds that's super duper sad right now spurt 30 feet ahead yeah no my boy he was my boy he died as he lived as a spurt 23 is that dani because he's a what it's secrets do we see into the chamber across on the other side it's not a chamber it's huge right i'm terrible at this five what do we do we can sneak in we can create a diversion but then to what end we're going to run in there and do what do we think that the kryn went through and were allowed to pass let's offer them some food is that the splatter of dead spurt here lies spurt pugil sticks then they know we are here we could have it there in case we need to retreat jester can get across the entire span i could turn invisible i could create a diversion sure or just emerge from the lava wait what about us what about the rest of us you're just going to leave us focus is this a real manticore or is it an image of one what about yasha you can't take yasha she's bigger than you i can run and i'm invisible into what dragonfly are you going to bamf with him weren't you going to dimension door how far can you go that is not across the way that is just to the other side of the bridge maybe yeah do you need me to do anything to make the diversion look even more realistic because i could-- oh you're huffing literally right now you got silver paint all over (laughter) jester it was so wonderful having nugget around he's going to be fine this is going to go so good mighty nein we have to do this for the memory of spurt for spurt the kobold who was just introduced to us and killed doesn't everyone have the creative lead of d&d next to them when they play a game invisible invisible i think we should start with the monster because if i go out there and trip the jig is up jar of peanut butter get ready for a dick (laughter) major image visuals and sounds perfect plan foiled on the first step is invisibility it's concentration i can't do anything else i would say 20 seven oh no the giant totally sees you oh no it's just us oh that's pretty fast your movement's 45 i'll be short 30 feet no i'll be short 30 feet oh that's lava he can't walk in there shield charge to hit miss polymorph probably 15 feet cows can-- i mean they're fast they have four legs (singing) what does the cow say matt and with what does the cow get an attack of cow-portunity that didn't damage the cow at all did it what the fuck yeah sure what does that do again okay i will stealthily-- one minute i will stealthily emerge-- yes it's probably been one round now correct i will stealthily make my way to the bridge around the-- 15 not great oh wait i also get-- i have the hood the cloak but it's all canceled out sure yeah i'll just kill them both i can use an action to dash okay i'll action dash but not up the bridge around the side closest to me uh-huh sure yeah sure that hits oh yeah i think so i'll do whatever you call it to halve that oh it doesn't just automatically drop what kind of check ten under the bridge and-- (pained screaming) i'm coming for you spurt and then i will press my body to the bridge and bonus action just hide thank jesus terrible this is stealth 18 good that's good cast jesus i think it worked our deceptions are so deceptive do not they haven't found me yet (screeching) 19 do i have to make a concentration check 18 i believe so i close my eyes and imagine my beautiful husband waiting for me needing me and i run across the lava with my ring of water walking not right at the giant i'll go around in a-- sure i'll try to leap on some rocks are there chunks in the water all right i'll do that just a check ten my armor class as of today is 18 yeah absolutely less it's nine other beautiful book chris perkins ladies and gentlemen book designer lead book designer did chris just say that sure if he rolls a one on all of them i'll be okay i'm not at full hp can i use my whatever it's called-- uncanny dodge it doesn't work it's an effect he did say i'm within 60 feet of nott i mean i'm dead so-- i'm unconscious oh oh great it's actually pretty close (screams) (screams) (screams) am i on fire then i will stick my head out through the door and shoot a crossbow bolt at that giant that is stalking my friend caleb not great 16 i shoot him again bonus action not great 17 okay that's it but talks is going to be on this tuesday
