well i gave him a nickname to the nickname a sub-nick (laughter) no i rubbed peanut butter all over my chest (laughs) oh wow i do smell it now yeah that's nice Â let's try reasoning with them whoa that's not bad there's a lot of gasping going on wait does travis not-- he rolled a natural 20 15 hey then we're all above 13 it's pretty good this bodes well (grog voice) would like-- it might work (laughter) she just disappeared well don't say that (laughter) whoa oh yeah okay hey question if i hold a turn do i hold the whole turn can i hold my action but do the bonus action how does it work okay then i am going to just move i am going to act i am going to do things so i turn to the guy who just hit me and i am going to cast dominate person on him i will sing some sort of song to dominate him with (gasps) really they're not humanoid i would know that well then i guess i won't do that okay (laughter) yeah okay well then we just die (laughter) yeah no i have options i'll be fine should i go for the guy who-- i'll do (blows raspberry) i'll cast lightning bolt on him that's always a good go-to is it six or eight thank you okay six six four what is that oh really oh that's awesome now i lost track 32 i would like to inspire our new fellow zahra with a quick little ditty (singing) ooh you so scary ooh you so scary ooh you so scary you fighty long time (laughter) and if i move away from him he'll hit me can i snuggle between his legs and maybe he'll forget i'm there it might anger him or it might entice him (laughter) spell save dc top right she's a mother figure oh for the barf take us as in-- grog can you ask them take us as in lead us or on their back oh that is good information just like in hunt for red october we'll mass suggest that they take a bath later short rest hey dm how many hit points do i have have they increased at all i don't know d8 15 plus two four i got it already i am ready to rock he'll be dead by the time he gets here it's really cool did lyra give me-- wow i feel so warm and cuddly okay i'm sorry i was just distracted because we're in a dire situation and i miss the love of my life pike i'm sure you can't identify with that aldor a little well we have something in common then and thank you for your stone of warmth or whatever it was i'll just call it a stone of warmth 20 jeff (laughter) drink if you think we've been sent on some sort of suicide mission-- well i'm a master of words should we abandon all hope and just flee is that what you're suggesting as our leader or should we carry it through and prove everyone wrong you know what retrace your steps we go well actually grog-- could someone ask ace and gary if we're there or if we have further to travel i hope he can hit a wall well you're the leader shouldn't you be-- let's carry on then don't mess with the magic yes but the healing potion might do something let's just keep going you are a very kind soul i will check it for traps five everyone there are definitely no traps here (laughs) she's a stickler trinket's here (laughter) he does things i've got a wide range i like to keep people guessing it's my thing i wouldn't want that either of all the bears i've known he's top five top five what else can we do to prepare oh boy already dex 17 oh plus four 21 my scanlan-sense is tingling does that take up our whole path now did they laugh thanks for that update how do we get around what do we do oh okay let's yes (singing) from a distance the world is they like to eat giants that would help so we could go in with an offering we could we could just walk in there i could be holding lyra as my captive and say i've brought you this captive to eat well you know you're very appealing what's it called what's the title aw that's cool did you consider the title day dreaming i just thought because it's like a pun consider it we might depends what he asks yeah let's do it we don't have time to do any of this stuff no we walk in he's beckoning us let's walk in i'm walking in i'm going ahead i'll take the bag is that you hello it's less than that we're 30 feet away now rimefang yes and i use mage hand to lift the diamond out of the bag and dangle it in front of the dragon we've brought you this diamond we've come from the slayer's take we represent the guild and we are here to formally apologize for sending a few of our members here in the past and promise that we never shall again and as a gift of apology and hopefully brotherhood we offer you this diamond there are many more to come there is a diamond of much greater size and value in this pouch but first we want to hear that you are going to allow us safe passage out of here before we turn it over to you please allow us safe passage and then you said roll for persuasion and i rolled a 19 that was so cool your guardians are well aware of our power and position and did not want to offend you by turning us away i'm called burt reynolds and i take great offense at that you can call me mr reynolds or simply burt oh versus a dragon what is it persuasion seven low second to last natural 20 but it becomes 18 oh lots of red circles not the dragon although probably the dragon too oh you're running away from it what's that do what's that my eyes begin to change to a dark shade as i turn my gaze to the dragon and cast eyebite on him eyebite i would like to sicken him give him a little tummy-ache through my hand cone of clarity it's 19 it can just choose to succeed what but that was a cool spell okay can i throw with a bonus action a bag got it then i will move a few steps away i can still move and stuff right i would like to move away from this group of soon-to-be-blasted-with-dragon-fire people just a few yards away to my left that's fine sure that's great and give some inspiration to lyra i'll say (singing) when the moon hits your eye like a big pizza pie that's aldor-e (cheering) well i wrote it for you which one are you doing but he's not fighting for us because of a spell right now we convinced him felicia and i appreciate the chat please keep it coming plus three wait she gets my inspiration on this throw grog go get his axe it's really big how close am i all right yes hi scanlan here i'll do (singing) it's bigby's hand bigby's hand shamone i'll just punch him in his dragon face oh i have to roll for that that's the spell attack bonus thing okay 19 4d8 i'm taking yours and i hope that's okay ten 13 18 21 plus something i'm 20 feet away i will go 18 feet away from it and drop the grenade yeah closer to it can i keep moving no i had to move closer to it but if i leave he's going to whack me wait how close did i put the grenade to him no i wanted to put it two feet away from him hello i'm a little gnome that was crass hey percy wait what did he do whoa but can i sing real quick maybe it'll fling me away from the grenade but it's not a concussion grenade is it a concussion grenade it's already armed isn't it 20 i'm already low to the ground all right the grenade worked (cheering) wait what did you just shoot at us nice 11 no he has one he's got one more if he chooses to use it he might save it for later in the fight no he won't i cast a spell on it as it retreats from me because i am a war caster and i will cast bigby's hand to grapple that shit and pull him back down (cheering) don't you fly away from me motherfucker it's the grapple one to pull its wings together so it can't fly away 18 plus eight 26 you will leave when burt reynolds tells you to leave (laughter) 2d6 that's another 18 of course it does and thus ends scanlan travis and that hits i will be very soon it's a dragon do i roll does he roll 8d4 can i roll 4d8s 8d4 i'm at 19 now i will stand taking a potion is an action or a bonus i will dimension door way over there and i'll take one of those four healing potions that someone gave us were they moderate okay i definitely have one so i'll take it trinket's protected how high up i will first use my bonus action on myself can i cast healing word on myself okay d4 plus five that's nothing actually wait can i just take a potion as a bonus action okay i'll just do that i'll take a greater heal 4d4 plus four anyway i'll roll it later sorry (counts quietly) plus four is 11 okay i'm pretty much back up to-- i'm how far but how far (whispering) sniper shot (louder) from the shadows i cast lightning bolt which has a hundred-foot range if the angle is nice and clean it's my spell what is it 17 it was 8d6 but now it's 4d6 right all right what is that (counts quietly) 26 13 oh god come on vex come on do it for trinket oh what is that it sounds hellish i run over to lyra cast seeming on myself to give myself the appearance of aldor and i pour a potion into her mouth and i wake her up you did good baby baby i can't change height so i release seeming and i'm back to normal inspiration okay i inspire them i will sing something i don't know what i'm so out of it we just killed a dragon (laughter) 11 may i have that one please i'm sorry by the way your lips taste like bubblegum 6d10 you'll see you're going to get the paper yeah sure that'll work the bear too what because if the answer is yes we refuse this is our leader from now on i think this is a great idea you're right so do we collect our money so it's 9000 total we'll make you an honorary member we did it i have to split
