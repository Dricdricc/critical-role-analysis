but didn't bargain for love at a hex-fuel outpost in the desert world of crypto-diphthong nine icarus' ship the sts peacock docks with a mysterious vessel piloted by the most beautiful gorgon he's ever laid his eyes on the leggy legendary ecto-crystal smuggler named crasnogorofst nine all of her faces are as gorgeous as her name with icarus and crasnogorofst nine together will the universe ever be the same think of it like ender's game meets dune but with asimov dialog and heinlein twists and a little dash of i don't know the name of the wind or something it's available it doesn't currently

we doing next week are we announcing that one-shot travis willingham one-shot that is a high-concept piece that could be a disaster good job vampire laura i'm not hungry yeah can we talk for a second about who was that up there gary gygax matthew colville was he undead or was he just a man was he you liam o'brien know all sorts of stuff about vampires i sam riegel do not i didn't even see interview with a vampire was it well we're not going back there now it blew up we can't go back up it exploded i am but i unlike vax from vox machina don't have darkvision do we have anything that glows all right do you want me to go down there i'm going to go so fast and dart ahead like 40 feet yeah maybe we should do that sure oh god last time someone licked something tasted something-- that looks so gross with the teeth the tongue with the-- ugh how's it look down there laura guys i took off my shoes and i've got to say it feels so much better it's the eyebrows well i put on this part and i was like it needs something else oh yeah you could have a feast i don't eat rats you mean live forever in the sewers what if we need-- don't you want to solve this there's got to be a cure right are we taliesin are we tired who's thinking princes and queens of death we almost were killed by werewolves and bigger vampires we'd be the lowest-- i don't know anything about vampires but we could be private first class vampires i also learned that i could kill a man in seconds flat i killed a person i don't know what came over me it was amazing i killed max wait who did you kill did you know who she was oh that girl yeah and i guess i probably caused that other boy to die i've killed two people travis so we're just committing after an hour of being a vampire we're saying you know what fuck it let's be vampires forever it's going to really hurt your commercial auditions really you have a good commercial voice yeah i think so young mom sure yeah sports are played there his vampire powers are amazing he clutched this very warm mug i just touched myself and you didn't know because i'm so fast that i-- just adjusted a little bit let's go are you on point like a hi-chew that's what you've established now is there a way to continue on down the sewer path or that's it all right let's turn around if we follow the arrow where the sanctuary was pointing yeah i don't give a shit under mulholland that's far you're proficient in hobo this marking means can of beans what if these are taggers taggers what's our endgame here we've been walking for miles are there any other tunnels or any other peeks up into the daylight or up top what's up travis speak in code speak in pig latin i'm drawing my xlr whip i'm going yes i take off after it it says you are capable of an incredibly fast response time i don't know what does that mean may use your dodge skill against firearms you don't suffer penalties-- i have grace that makes me climb any vertical surface no matter how slippery or flimsy just 1d10 one no i have plenty you don't need to give me any more i've got five over here i'm just not giving them back to you when i'm done because that's silly what do i do i roll one of these but i don't catch him or what oh i will try to grapple him with my mic cable i'm going to try and wrap it around his snout so he can't open his snout strength brawl that's my forte oh boy three successes i'm trying to hog tie him while i say get over here i need help oh he talks i think we like warm blood we like mammals i'm going to try to tie him more secure two successes one fail yes it's a blood die it's a one hog tying him i went to a rodeo once i don't know it talks who are you what are you we'll unhand you if you tell us who and what you are or lock or rock no this is your tunnel we just became vampires an hour ago oh god i knew they were true how long does the tunnel go where can we find an exit we're new at this you've been here for what a millennia or something we've been vampires for i guess two weeks right no one guided us through the change we had no bar mitzvah or whatever you call it we have powers all right look at this and i walk up around the tunnel like in a loop-de-loop yeah but i'm not a lizard he's an agent at uta if i untie you do you promise not to run away i will untie the beast is he more crocodile he's been released i release him in real life or as a vampire do you know what the size and shape is liam is this the old zoo collecting old lizard maps of la treble there's music in there i'm pretty sure you said treble twice no there's music it's fine without a proper introduction how will we know who we're talking to we really need you in there with us who should go in first why we choose leaders based on size it should be on intelligence yes absolutely but not because he's strong i'm the dumbest one thanks taliesin out of those guys i think sam's probably the dummy duh that sounds good going to the big house i've got some ideas theater training so if you could undo it and make us humans again i think we'll be on our way that sounds amazing liam and it would be really great but we're still getting used to this though apparently not i mean we haven't compared sat scores or anything but we will later tonight sure 1600 yeah that's true there was also i mean some sort of void under the game table right that could have plunged people down below he might be a critter they're everywhere critters are everywhere we're good at catching rats passage to the surface sure it doesn't seem like a great message to deliver to someone just saying like they might be upset with us but i feel like if it's nighttime we should probably hurry because we can't be up there when the sun comes up but what about our friends our family you're just going to give up everyone you know and love to be immortal sewer vampires i love hanging out with you but it's not like we can podcast from down here i'll think about it does anyone speak spanish what does los globos mean the globos what does that mean i'm going to try to turn into a bat three successes (straining) we can't be bats but maybe we can walk through walls and shit yeah of course it's all coiled up of course not but i don't know if an xlr cable will hold us wait i'll lift you up my powers i can walk up walls and shit can't i there's no wall to walk up oh he can help we'll sign like a player's handbook all right so you boost me up great i'll hang with liam got to stay close non-success four i'm going to be wearing this costume every day for the next few days this is my halloween costume laura my eyes are up here okay is it night still so wait there's a gate that prevents us from leaving this crypt we were so fast that we got here in like ten minutes are there humans around is

stealthy right okay how about this me and laura will go around i'll chase them toward you laura can keep them contained and we'll drive them to you guys rather than us trying to chase them we'll drive them this way but it's a cemetery and they're hipsters they could be joking around with each other you don't have superhuman strength right you're just liam and it's a blood die i'm sure he's just looking for someone we're going to hunt i'm going to circle around somebody and try to drive them to travis i've got fangs do i have fangs okay all right laura come with me act like my girlfriend or something we're going to go talk to those people and push them toward travis are there any people around is there anyone who looks stout or like they have a lot of blood in them is there anyone standing alone-ish or lagging behind their group yeah me too i'm looking for tourists specifically four successes let's not kill them like if we tell him we're vampires come let us drink your blood

meet you i do stuff with her on critical role it's a dumb show i'm going to get down on my hands and knees for one of those push-over things push him over push him over like on true blood vampire on vampire fight he's going to remember now i don't think travis knows how to snap someone's neck that's a video game thing how would he know how to snap someone's-- that's hard to do i'm sure you've seen it in movies but it doesn't just happen like that well i mean all of us have killed except for you at this point you killed will friedle i feel like we've taken a plunge here (loud burp) yep sorry nope you got other stuff but not cake the balls the balloons something like that what are they what kind of creature are they are they vampires and what are their names how will we know it's them we don't have ids because we look old we don't have any money we can't buy anything in here well i don't know to fit in i never understood why would anyone go into those clubs if people were

well i could super-fast try to type one on his iphone but that seems like he's going to catch me right i'm not that fast if you distract him i could whiz by him we could both and then we could come out and be like hey let our friends in okay how are you going to distract him travis i got it so i walk back up to the bouncer and i start in the normal roped area and i move to his opposite side so that he has to follow me with his vision the thing about fingers is you don't really need all of them and i'll snap this finger off just break it right there is he distracted i'm going to wait and see if laura gets through before i dash oh well that's why what's going on under the pac-man suit you don't know did i see laura get through well then is he still distracted i'm going to bolt past him

this club whose club is this do you think they have any ace of base records that we could request blood we would like to drink human blood we need human blood to drink and to the confidence that we all have having killed a human being true vampires first kill man it just felt so good you don't have a double wide travis and checking us out we're so cool it's yuri long story short geek & sundry legendary there's armageddon over there monsters roving-- we set it off we don't know if he did it but he was involved and there's been a changing of the guard or disturbance in the order of things the lizard people are very upset who said that that was-- like tor books well i didn't kill any innocent people no bodies around in public places are families assigned to us are you going to kill us we could prove ourselves in a crucible-style-- re-slice open my wrist ugh it personally makes me physically uncomfortable i'm going to take a step forward and say as a vampire as a young junior vampire i feel like i have a lot to offer i have strength maybe not of body but of spirit clearly not mind and i feel like i can make any family proud with my nice-guy attitude and optimism which are traits that vampires really need (laughs) thank you i yield the rest of my time i don't understand this game six okay perception and awareness two successes no fails my family has chosen me it hurts i'm going to try to shove it back through oh wait i turn around to see who did it yeah can i attack her i was trying to find out who yuri was can i attack her do i have to roll for initiative how does this work you want me to roll that two success-- three successes three successes (strained sounds) (strained) he's never killed anyone he doesn't have any guts i got it because i did say something (laughs) wait i'm going to try-- i'm going to scream a primal scream and say i'll show you what a real vampire is and i'll run using my super speed at satine with the stake that's sticking out of my body and just hug her in the heart and try to jam it into her chest three successes no fails can i dodge it but i have an incredibly fast response time my initiative doubles can use dodge skill against firearms so what am i rolling dex dodge two successes i'm going to take more points i'm dead that's it (laughs) i hold his hand (dying voice) on the next episode of all work no play wait the
