loot crate the theme of this month is horror i've been dabbling in the hip-hop world lately so i prepared a little rap it's pretty street guys it's going to be pretty hardcore so buckle up maestro i need a track [hip-hop music] there's more so in conclus-- oh (laughter) sure man that went really well also lootcratecom/criticalrole now goes to a custom critical role page within lootcratecom and you should check it out love you all word to your mama (laughter) which nope i'm not in that one apparently yeah well matt are you in blue robot 13 yeah are you in verdant lightning yeah no they're not real that's your new hampshire accent can i do a perception check to make sure that this being is actually in the room and is not just some sort of phantom 17 oh wait am i proficient no 19 one moment game this out for me friends if this is all bullshit and thordak has sent this little lady here to trick us into traveling with her to draconia where thordak is lying in wait to kill us the second we get there well then if we're making a deal for this little lady to kill on our behalf why do we need to go can we just stay in whitestone and you go kill the white dragon for us you're powerful aren't you why do you need us yeah you can pretend to be vorugal's-- something pet hamster-- for a while until you kill him in his sleep what is that move don't do that an opportunity to prove yourself to us you say it first describe it what room are we in right now how big is the room how many entrances we should probably kill her right now it we knew it was you all along we want you to know what you're up against let's all agree that this is definitely bullshit can you shapeshift into other beasts we needed a beast to bait vorugal with sure well she'll need to know at some point once we get there what are we agreeing on you don't need our votes it's already decided is voting this time important particularly but if i don't vote won't someone else vote for me i don't even know how is it easy to find out i should go online and find out how to register to vote all right let's kill a dragon and feel that burn (laughter) all right i'm in for now the dragon dies (laughter) shouldn't we keep an eye on this one all night i know but she could be sneaking around creeping into rooms-- she could come into my room at night and do things to me that i don't want to be done i'm going to have sex with every beast on every continent whispers do i that's my hat yeah boi to the real war room magically incapable of-- okay but wait before we go down there two things keyleth can you scry today we could check in on vorugal make sure that vorugal is actually there just to make sure vorugal is in town and not here we could look into raishan's room right now and watch how it communicates with its boss she'll go ape-shit and what so we kill her we're better than she is who me i need my thing hold on intelligence straight intelligence 16 18 i will inspire myself which is d12 now right 26 wow that escalated fast do we know anything about how it can be reversed or undone but then right after or shake her is there any way to move whitestone to reinforce whitestone to get something here to protect whitestone (sighs) we don't know what that thing is that has-- what the beast is you said religion it's a cool idea but i don't think we can we need to know the beast that we are summoning she's a dragon nothing for us to do you're right what do you want to do all right grog and i will go talk to keeper yennen about yenk it's okay you're fine we are the worst people for this mission tally-ho keeper yennen yes well we come seeking knowledge that only you have maybe we needed some information about something that is beyond our scope check him all right i'll check him i'm going to slowly touch his arms make sure he's real i'll pat him down 19 i sniff the bread (sniffing) he's clean there's dragons around sorry about that nope yenk yenk and he is a-- what's the type of beast a goristro well it's very important that we know his name-- or her name-- accurately because well for many reasons but we need to know its true name is there any text you can point us to force is their weapon not fire or any magic do they have any resistances acid poison fire are we going to play bad grog good gnome oh you're going to guilt it out of him (voice breaking) grog i don't think i can-- i'm emotional thinking of all the people in whitestone who are going to die i can't keep it together is there any information you might know that can save your people oh good yeah ooh we're shaking down our friend is there anyone else who has knowledge that you can think of that we should speak to thank you for your service to whitestone we've had a weird rough week so sorry if we-- i don't think we can talk our way out of this one you're top five in whitestone for sure we did a good thing in there grog he's going to kill you someday i think we got all there was high-five so wait you want to make poison and not do anything with it in case someone comes over for tea that reminds me on the walk home with grog i turn to him and say oi grog got any of those guns how many why should percy have all the fun what say you and me take a pistol each just as a backup plan an insurance policy you don't want a pistol you'd look so cool you are about the personal touch do you have any ammo holy shit is there any blood on either of them i want the bloody one thank you grog thank you very much i don't know what to do with this so i'll pocket it i've seen percy do that a lot stares right down the barrel and make sure it's working you don't have any guns what happened to your guns we're friends here right grog i don't know what he's doing i would not trust him but then again you don't have a choice he was right he doesn't know (laughter) oh yes title him grand poobah de doink of all of this and that i'm unfamiliar with protocol a grand poobah how do you address them is it a your majesty a your highness your grace hey you guy this is a great day grog percy don't forget you promised me one of those guns maybe you can teach me first and when i've learned you can give me one (belches) hey guys door was open thought i'd come in grog's right outside in the hall it's crazy is that a brain in a jar what my gate scroll yeah well i left that at home today but i think it calls the thing that you call for you give it a name it goes it grabs it it brings it in the gate does stay open for as long as your conjuration which is about a minute yes that is true-- i could drop it yes however this is a tricky spell for me because i am not-- as much as it pains me to say this i am not good enough to cast this spell i'm really good but i'm not quite that good so i can cast it but it carries a risk if luck is not on my side it will not work like it won't work forever i get one shot if i don't do it right it's gone forever yes my penis will fall off i'm not giving this thing to raishan but do we know anyone who is at a slightly higher skill level than me is she an arcane caster do we know where kima and allura are what is she going to be doing to help us anyway we could do that and our plan doesn't necessarily have to be kill vorugal turn and kill raishan right there we can keep playing with her for a little while longer three i have an ioun stone and do what hey where's allura yeah the guard was supposed to get you both yes i don't normally need to ask for help with magic but this gate scroll that i have here is this something that you can do forget i ever showed it to you doesn't exist i know it's really cool but you shouldn't know about it it's bad news no i do need it desperately yes it's very vital to our mission would that make this scroll inactive yes i think i understand how it works but i don't know if i'll be able to do it when the time comes i think what she's referring to is once we pull the thing through it acts of its own volition we can't tell it what to do probably not (sighs) all right we don't we pull it through right in front of-- i could be invisible also i don't know if you'd heard but tiberius fell won't she ask why asum is with us paints us as pretty shady folk i don't know we're putting her in a lot of danger she could help protect the city it could go under siege we can get her out of it really quickly we can tell her that it never happened she'll choose a fight every time if you want i can wipe her memory of the fact that we offered-- i defer to the grand poobah's will i will change my vote to yes i know don't worry i'll wipe their minds too let's bring her yes and what's our plan do we go to sleep and wake up and go how do we get there how are we getting there we're going to burn her spell in the morning to get there shouldn't we go now sleep there with raishan in my house raishan's not getting in the mansion ever two days fine let's go oh boy why what are you doing tomorrow oh you want to go now we could go now and camp there she's not getting in the mansion she can go sit in the fucking snow and go to sleep for all i care oh the whole shebang or just what we said right now just what we just said right now just that great okay yeah good nine minutes and counting i can do crazy things lady kima we in order to kill one dragon are entering into a deal with another if we do this it could help us kill the dragon that killed tiberius lady kima you're looking at a group of idiots who have felled dragons killed beholders negotiated with sphinxes gone to other realms and other planes and somehow managed to get out of it more or less alive or you can let us go into this without you and probably all die oh you are it could be but with you by our side it has a slightly better chance of going correct lil' kim it's for your own protection we can't tell you everything after all we've been through-- we're asking you to trust us blindly in this scenario and i know that it's not ideal but we have saved you before should i wipe her memory travis and might be easier at this point lady kima i don't know what you're talking about we go where the dragon is we're going to release bait when the dragon is done with the bait we go in and kill the dragon maybe a third after that i thought you were gone i thought we were going we're leaving now where taliesin and kynan kynan didn't really hear anything what that we're leaving now (whispering) her it was so turgid are we ready to do this hey before we go lady kima (singing) when the gnome hits your eye like a big pizza pie you've been mind-melded (speaking) i'm going to wipe her mind it's too risky of the whole conversation it's too risky nope it's a ten-minute conversation 21 oh you're going to bust me on that 19 then (laughter) (yelps) (nervous laugh) this is how i die (groaning) you passed the test you're worthy of coming with us on the journey sure yeah i'll poof the mansion i was going to show you to your room-- all right well then you can sleep in the fucking living room great servants don't help her is it prepared no i mean she has to prepare it ahead of time you can do it tomorrow morning or not at all wasn't the leader of the dragonborn a female first of all and wasn't vorugal a male i'm also going out there with them ten oh i'm going to try to load the gun 16 oh thank you 11 okay that's it holstered what's going on are we going to go talk to tooma can we all go as a group tomorrow no how far are we from tooma you could fly we're not going near the dragon we're going to see tooma we could fly in as little birds or something stay low in the ravines out of sight we'll be out of range sure all right i can make us both invisible so we'll be plenty stealthy no but they need their people all ready to attack also they might be able to tell us where we should release the beast we'll be invisible it'll be fine we're the best in the business we walked around here completely without any stealth protection last time we did fine and we didn't even know anything about the culture or the people maybe you should enhance my stealth ability oh thanks i will give us both invisibility level three invisibility yeah the top of the ravine in the ravine right oh oh it's steep horrifying check who us her everyone 16 one hour no should we become visible or wait until we get right up next to tooma and then become visible all right okay yes let's do it i'll drop invisibility yeah so is anyone awake hi hello it's fine yes we're friends of tooma we've come to parlay i have no weapons i play fiddles would you like me to drop it to the floor all right well i'm already being asked to take off my belt we're friends of tooma we have an important mission 22 oh yeah we don't speak this lady tooma sorry to wake you out of your slumber well where we come from it's a totally different time we've come to complete our promise to you the fact that we are here should give you at least some confidence that we are men of our words as a show of good faith could you please instruct your guards to go get our weapons and bring them close to us not for any use we just want them close by we really would like them close to us all right then we'll leave and the dragon will torment your people forever we are not trying to have weapons by our side we want them close at hand i don't trust them with people i don't know here's the plan we'll be quick so you can get back to sleep tomorrow morning we're going to release a beast that will we hope lure the dragon out of its lair we want you and your people at the ready to attack can that be done and where would you recommend we release this beast insight check 16 i get a whisper who will talk about loot crate is there any particular time that the dragon would be hungry for a hunt and once this hunt happens and hopefully weakens the dragon will you be ready to pounce all right how do we get word to you that we're in position okay anything else unless you'd like to talk about anything else tonight not a morning person evening person all right (hyperventilating) i hope this doesn't make us fall one more invisibility for both of us hi random cat who is definitely supposed to be part of this landscape let's go can we ride i can probably i'm little are you ready to rumble i think we've got a really solid plan also there's a really good chance that i won't be able to summon that thing and then we'll have to improvise or so great the thing has a dc a very high dc i don't know can i i didn't bring any of my stuff tonight
