here why the fuck would you do that i promised her that i wasn't going to die and you showed her my dead body you thought that was a good idea no i'd rather she never know yes i do unfortunately i think it's bad that she thinks that i'm an oathbreaker that i am weak that i failed in my promise to her that everything she thought of me when she found me is confirmed now that i can't be trusted and i can't protect her i hope that's true i did i think i heard music i heard pike i heard voices i heard pike saying a poem i heard someone playing music yes she also knows that i fell and that my friends thought it would be funny to put me in a fucking nightgown and spread pudding all over me and bring back my lifeless body and show her how weak her father is that's what she saw i made a promise and i broke it and you proved it to her and i wish you hadn't meddled in my affairs i don't have i don't have many things that i care about and i don't have anything that cares about me what you think you care about me yes i'm sorry you're right you like me because i make jokes and i play songs and i give you a warm place to stay at night and i feed you fucking chicken and i heal you in battle but you don't really care about me come on let's be honest with each other you don't really give a shit about me prove it prove it we traveled into the fucking nine hells to get pike a set of armor we went and battled a city of vampires so percy could feel good about his name we fought goliaths for grog we've traveled across planes of existence so you could fix your fucking daddy issues but you've never done anything for me ever you've never risked anything you don't know me you don't know anything about me what's my mother's name what's her name easy question died in front of me killed by a goblin biggest part of my life what's her name my father is he alive or dead how old am i where's my fucking dog you don't care about me did you it's fine i'm just a little hungover from being dead and i just have been thinking for a while and you know grog has pike vax has keyleth percy has vex but scanlan has no one and i had one chance at one real relationship with my daughter and i feel like you've gone and fucked it up too because you don't really know me and you don't really know what my relationship is with her and what i've promised her or anything really and it's fine when i met you all i was just a funny little man playing songs and that's all i'll ever really be and that's okay because i can take care of myself i don't need your help i don't like that very much at all well then i must be a very good liar marisha and yeah if you really respected me you wouldn't pick me up like some sort of dwarf and pick me up and put me down and take off your fucking armor and treat me like a fucking child i just wish you wouldn't have brought her into this i had one shot with her and now how will i ever show her that i can be trusted how will i ever show her that i can protect her you're right i should talk to her i should i should and i will fine you're right i will i will i'll talk to her listen i don't know what adventure we're going on next but i think you should go without me vex is right i should talk to her i should be here for her i don't know why i wasn't with her in the first place i didn't need to go with you to kill the dragons i should've just been with her in the first place probably just scared to i should just be her father and stay yeah no i will not go whoring with you one more time it was juniper thank you for asking i don't really know he makes things made things i don't know his name is vicou i guess it's just easier to laugh at the world when you don't care about it i know i think that's come up that's fair i haven't been but i also don't-- i don't have anyone i have to take care of myself that's all (quietly) i didn't i did not i died twice in a row i'm being kept alive by some fucked-up weird magic before i met you people i would have never-- the worst i would have gotten in is a bar fight and i would have won 'cause i would have been a liar and a cheater and now i didn't help any of you in the last fight i didn't do anything the fight before that i didn't do anything-- -- i'm useless -- i'm out of my league i'm out of my league listen it was fun it's fun it really has been fun to travel with six legends it's fun it's fun to say that your friends are legendary fighters it's fun well that's just it i'm a really good liar just give me some time it's not fun is it yeah i have to i'm just gonna be a shorthalt for a while and i'm just gonna figure out what that means and it's great being part of a team but you gotta know who you are first so i gotta go figure that out and i gotta go figure out what she is too and when i do i'll come back and find you and if you really need a place to stay i'll advise you to buy some tents 'cause you won't have a mansion anymore i know you'll be fine 'cause you all have each other but for now i just need to have me for a while i love you all i even love percy and his parents frederick and johanna and i'll go with kaylie what's this (choked) all right i

they're all individually going to the room next door (all laugh) everyone's reading highlights me negative two i got a two total but i get advantage against magic that's a 17 i mean that's 19 my wisdom is negative two just in case you there you lot hello wow who are you all look at this magical items from head to toe why i've never seen anything quite like it doty come here will you take this down in my travels through-- doty doty take this down in my travels in anh'karel i have never seen so many magical items in one place but then i saw them walking up to me and i knew i had met some very special people that's it for now hello nice to meet you all the name is taryon darrington (all laugh) my friends just call me tary and i'm a bit of an adventurer i've been traveling around this continent for a while trying to tick off things off of my list and i've had a few scraps and scrapes and i'm looking for more adventure i was travelling with a band of ne'er do wells that i had hired and well let's just say many of them were killed heh so i was looking to employ a ragtag group of people elves whatever you are to accompany me sort of be my side men if you will how much would a band like you cost for a day oh that's nothing would you-- i'm sorry well i tend to employ people on a month-by-month basis and you get a cut of the treasure as we go of course we can work out the particulars but are you in fact guns and-- or not guns swords-for-hire i'm going after many things i have a long list of things i want to tick off of course i am you haven't heard of well you haven't heard of me yet because my book hasn't come out yet doty here is recording my legendary adventures as i travel around the continents yes i haven't settled on a title yet it will either be-- tary's adventures it's sort of lame sort of lame or it could be daring adventures of darrington or it could be tarry on with taryon or something like that i'm working on the title i have a while to finish it that's fantastic doty please write that down i knew you were special when i ran into you all my goodness well  hold on let me check my list that is on the list it was lower down but it's another thing i have to tick off before i'm a real adventurer so i'm up for anything if you are i'm an adventurer that's my biographer doty if i tell him to he also has other skills many things i can grant powers to many people for instance you little elf girl what's your name ooh is that a band of evildoers is that a roving goliath horde my name is taryon darrington i am an adventurer and i have more recently set out on my journey that is true i have not seen so many real battles yet but i have fought many beasts there was one it was a smallish beholder and my men took it out into a field for me and sort of roughed it up for me and then when the time was right for the kill they said come on in and kill it and i came in and used my powers and killed it and i checked it off the list yes it was so thrilling they also perished that was a different group yes but they were well-paid before they went and i'm sure they sent some of the money home some of them i think they do that typically i've got a long list of beasts and animals i'd like to slay-- uh naga i think that's how you say it okay i've already gotten a smaller beholder someday i'd like to see a dragon maybe have a crack at it or two i feel like you're condescending to me i'm not i'm not a dullard here i can do a lot of things my wealth has bought me many different artifacts from my travels and they all do majorly magical things i have a rod no it's whatever i want it to be sword fire it's fucking cool isn't it oh like 400000 gold or something it was a lot of money i don't quite doty keeps the facts and figures doty can you show me that piece of the book that's embarrassing i don't have a current adventure right now fire off still getting used to some of the contraptions what kind of adventure is this again you mentioned you're going to do something very dangerous can you tell me what it is i could limber up sure while they're talking i'm working on my rod battleaxe doty take this down as the group turned around i knew i had them (all laugh) oh i don't carry 50000 gold with me on my person i-- not-- doty go ahead and speak go ahead doty speak oh that's right doty can't speak doty's a machine doty only listens to me if you had some sort of a pet you would understand how about this i'll give you a little present just for you little elf girl and i flip her a silver coin that i have put a spell into i've put-- it's a special coin you should pick it up well that was for the elf girl but all right sure you can use it too when you need it if you just hold that coin up you'll turn invisible hey big man look at this heavy crossbow you can shoot it that was pretty good yes and with that we embarked on our new adventure the adventures of what was it again this is going to be fun fun fun (all laugh) tary darrington i know all of your parents' names because i love you i love you so much i am the most sincere no i'm tary-ing this-- tarying this--
