they're a big part of the show without them we would-- for instance without sponsors taliesin would only be able to dye his hair platinum blond or brown yeah laura's dice budget would go way down instead of throwing away 250 dice a week it would maybe be more like 240 230 i mean liam might have to go back to shaving his beard and selling the beard shavings to those in need i have just a few ideas for ways that you guys could show your love for our sponsors take them out for a candlelit dinner i'm not talking bennigan's i'm talking something high-end shake shack outback maybe even pf chang's how about sending some romantic texts to spice things up keep it classy like hey critical role sponsor i wish you could be with me right now or i had a dream last night and critical role sponsor you were in it and hey compliments always help critical role sponsor do you have a map 'cause i'm getting lost in your eyes or hey critical role sponsor of all the beautiful curves on your body i'm most in love with your smile or even critical role sponsor on a scale of one to ten you're a nine and i'm the one you need or you could just go to their website and buy their products (all

when my father would have-- -- sort of a cagey individual that he needed to interrogate he had an employee named the dog who was a large man who would come and just squeeze them until they talked why

food aman percival am i misreading the scenario here can i please just pour acid on him until he talks to us it seems like he's holding back am i misreading here i am following your lead but-- okay all right sea diarrhea may i see that i will identify it much easier this way i think all scroll of programmed illusion scroll allows an arcane caster to use an action to cast the sixth-level spell
