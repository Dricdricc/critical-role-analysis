captive we have completed our mission and in the melee in that hovel you called a palace back there we lost one of our own and we would like him back now i'll make it very simple because my fellows

oh this bulge down here oh you haven't heard of scanlan shorthalt well gird your loins ladies because he has his eye on you a talented musician master of disguise and dashingly handsome in his own mind scanlan sings songs almost as much as he sings his own praises born a poor gnome scanlan used his endless charm and soaring tenor voice to croon for coin and support his single mother one day he was discovered by a half-orc promoter and joined dr dranzel's spectacular traveling troupe where he learned the ways of the world and honed his skills as a bard extraordinaire a loner much of his life scanlan has never quite come to terms with the violent death of his mother at the hands of a goblin invasion while his years on the road provided many shall we say educational experiences with the opposite sex deep down scanlan yearns for the one thing he's never known the true love of a fellow gnome still scanlan considers himself a lover first performer second and fighter distant third on the battlefield he'll support his allies but rarely draws blood unless it's to protect fellow gnome pike count on scanlan for a hearty laugh a rollicking song and a twinkle in his eye that melts hearts and makes the females swoon i check under my belt because the spell has worn off and i'm back down to my normal one and a half inches which on a gnome is pretty big length and girth it's like a square like a cube but you'll be vulnerable won't you i can make you a modest spot to change oh you know what though before we go any further i remind pike that vax's foot damage needs daily repair doesn't
