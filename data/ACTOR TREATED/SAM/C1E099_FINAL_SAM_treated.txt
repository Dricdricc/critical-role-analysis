because he died if we can't have scanlan at least we've got the shirt announcements continue the young avengers kid hulk kid iron man it's a ring box is it a genuine gold-style ring i taryon darrington would like to call to the rest of the gang and say wait before we fly away hold oh okay thought it was some sort of power move i would like to just sort of shout to my friends oi can we just before we go could we maybe just swoop down one more time just a quick flyby i have an idea i feel like we need just an insurance policy when we go talk to the myriad fellow i was wondering if kiki here could maybe throw a spell down before we leave is that something well here's a question can you make it look like the mouth of the cave isn't there anymore has caved in or is covered in dirt or rocks or something as i said i feel like when we talk to the myriad fellow-- oh wait let me fly over to you (laughter) yes some sort of a thing that would explode when someone comes by but i know it's crawling with characters down there so i don't-- should we wait i don't know i cannot wait we have to kill more of these fuckers no not really i can become invisible and fly down there i can also throw some fireballs (sings) you shake my nerve-- can you fill the whole tunnel with water and drown them too big too big to fill the whole tunnel with water and drown 'em (laughs) your mind pike has an idea oh by the way i can create a holocaust is that what you're doing (laughter) that's pretty awesome (laughs) yeah i think mission accomplished let's go the many the many yes excuse me may we sit and talk thank you we have done our share of the bargain and we're here to cash in our chit as it were might i make a few more requests when last we spoke we spoke in vague terms there was some cash talked about and also a place for my family to make a little bit of money or food there's a farmhouse nearby our main estate it's nothing special a few acres of land i would love to keep that as well so that we can have a source of food for the winters 22 we are most grateful understood i wasn't quite finished yet though what we saw down there in the platinum mines was the 230000 gold that we owe you times ten times 20 what we've just done for you has given you access to as much money as you could ever want and i feel that's valuable my family will require a bit of spending money to get ourselves back on our feet we are accustomed to a lifestyle and we'd like to maintain it for a little while at least i'd say 50000 gold should be about enough to last us for a year or two what if i sweetened the deal we have among us an amazing sorceress who could open that mine up for you with a flick of her wrist save you hours and hours of work possibly back-breaking work that could cost the lives of many of your men (clears throat) so that's a maybe so that's a hard yes (laughter) all right i'll make do and we'll have to adjust our living standards that's all we'll see thank you bidet almost absolutely i guess maybe in the morning they're probably all asleep now yeah maybe not we'll go to my house yes it is i could get a second mortgage oh god i could refinance i hear mortgage rates are really low right now yes berthold my room oh yeah of course i'm going up there all right i'll stay back down here with the pillow fort thing fine but after they go to sleep i go upstairs and go back to my bed oh jesus four just going to the bathroom i'll cuddle with the doty arm i'm sorry i'll talk to the help about this no i could burn us all alive though with one of them only one way to find out how about tea good morning sister these are my friends vox machina grog pike vex vax percy keyleth i travel with a group now i bring news and i know it's early but could we have a little family meeting over breakfast and mama she is not it's nice to be home yes and with your permission i would like to invite my friends to stay for it as well as it does concern them i bring you news and i bring you a proposal and as a businessman i hope you'll listen to both first the news it's good news first i will not be marrying this lydia person there's no need and also i think we all know i would not be happy in such a marriage and we should all be free to pursue whomever we love that's beside the point it's not necessary because i have made a deal with the myriad a deal that will spare us from any danger and clear us from all debt we-- well they really carried out a task for the myriad that has absolved us of the debt that you ran up and we are free and clear yes they don't-- forgive me for speaking on your behalf i don't think that they want to collect on a debt they just did this because we're friends the forgiveness of debt comes with some strings attached we will lose most of our property and assets but we will maintain the homestead here and all of its possessions and artwork and belongings we get to keep we also get the nearby farmhouse and all of the land and we get a new lease on life and a new beginning i think it's an opportunity for our family and that leads me to my proposal father as much as i have respected you for keeping us safe and providing for us you have not given us the one thing a family needs which is love real love you have made sure that we are safe because you care about our blood because it is your blood and you care about the fact that we bear your name but you haven't given us the opportunity to be a real family and i believe we can be if we start out new and fresh together here's my proposal i will come back and live with you in wildmount and i will lead this family to a new chapter our business model will change a bit i propose that we do not engage in real estate anymore but in another venture forgive me but you have sullied our name the darrington name is one of ill repute we are scoundrels and we are land barons and we are awful people and now we are penniless awful people but i feel that we can fix it what i propose is this our home will be vacated by us we are going to move to the farmhouse where we will all live as a family we will tend to the farm and we will raise crops together our home will be turned into the darrington fund for charitable giving where people who are down on their luck can come and live and get back on their feet now such a fund will need donors and you have many contacts in the business world you and possibly sister could run this foundation and spread goodness all over wildmount instead of badness and evil i didn't do that father you did it's gone everything is gone you don't even own your own house anymore that's not going to happen in my year of travel i didn't just dilly-dally around the world having fun i was learning about the world and about life and about family i was learning from these fine people what it means to really be a family and care about each other i learned from grog and vax what it means to be a man and to be a father i learned from pike what it means to be a caring mother i learned from keyleth what a real sister is like one who loves you and cares for you i learned from vex what a best friend is like these are things you never gave us growing up i even learned from percival the type of man i would want to marry one day and we never got that at home and from this day forth i'm going to create a home my home that i own that values and respects the opinions of each family member that cares for one another where we stick up for each other and help each other through hard times and not just rule by decree if you don't want to be a part of this that's fine you can leave my house but i want you to stay i need your counsel and i need your help and we need you as a father i need you and sister to run this foundation for me to repair our name and our reputation it could be great it could be the best thing that's ever happened to us and there's more i have an idea to create something else a team of adventurers based here in wildmount the darrington brigade led by me taryon darrington we will fight for justice and win battles against evildoers and spread the darrington name around the continent i know i'm getting ahead of myself but i feel like if we embarked on this new adventure together it could save our name and repair our relationship as a businessman i'm asking you to consider it because your other options are well they're not great i'm going to use luck i'm going to see if the fates can help me that's a 25 i am too oh yes my place is here i'm coming back to whitestone with you i have to i have to retrieve doty and my personal belongings well i'll come visit i was thinking for my darrington brigade i'll need lots of recruits and maybe i could get some down in whitestone you know fine fighters and young trainees i even have an idea for my first adventuring partner i think if i sold my old armor i could afford that drow for a year and she lives close by i've always known that i was not fit to travel with you all and i know that you all love me but you don't really like me that much oh i can be kind of a dick sometime oh the bakery i'm really bad at baking too yeah i am sure sure that makes sense i'll come down and visit a lot you know once every year around winter's crest well i mean it's a long way and i can't tree stride or whatever you call it listen let's not do this now i'm coming back with you i have to go get my robit all right you're leaving too oh my god are we all breaking up i didn't mean to do this i didn't know this was going to happen i need to go say good-bye to mama that's it then i can go all right she literally has no money to travel all right i'll go find mom mama i'm sorry to spring all of this on you and i must go back to whitestone with my friends to tie up some loose ends but i'll be back soon days maybe a week in the meantime though can you think about something for me the charity papa and sister can run it they have smarter business acumen than i do but the brigade i was wondering if you wanted to do it with me you have a taste for adventure you could help be our manager tend to us when we're injured i don't think that's true yes yes remember in escape from brave mountain remember the kindly old wizard who stayed back and tended to the injured and fed them when they were sick with that mystical plague that they got you could be that old-- yes think about it read the book again and when i come back we'll talk okay do you have a color in mind on it i give her a big hug me too mama this is going to be fun fun fun maybe all right let's go you

foreman of some sort what about this guy i mean wow i mean-- yeah i'm pretty sure i can do better than this guy i mean he's really imposing and strong also guys not to split hairs here but his boss is literally right there listening to us so maybe we shouldn't be talking about recruiting his employee whisper i know but this guy seems like he would lose a spelling bee to grog he's really dumb that's true (as scanlan) stop stop stop stop stop stop not here not here let's go somewhere else now let's go they were all there i thought she just followed me is lionel there though lionel please go back

else ascend to new heights no yes i went traveling a bit i did what gnomes do i went into the forest with kaylie forest gnomes do and we talked and we sang songs and we camped not in the mansion just in a tent we had some good times and bad times together and eventually we found our way to ank'harel and some stuff happened yadda yadda and i'm here now you know is he she's with me yeah no did we leave her back there she is it's complicated but right now she is the meat man she is back in ank'harel taking on the business while i'm off here pretty good we're a good team yeah 'like' is a strong word we're fine she and i we're a team and she's taught me some stuff and i've taught her some stuff and we operate together we went to ank'harel to get a little simple revenge and it turned into something more than that and i didn't mean to but i guess i became one of the three largest crime bosses in ank'harel eight months really we traveled around close to here we were only 20 miles away for most of the first couple months and then it took us time to get there don't worry though i'm not a bad guy i just sell things trinkets furniture art pieces antiquities that sort of thing nothing dangerous all fake rat bastards people who deserve it people with money to burn and people who have done wrong in their lives i take some back i had information and you had to know it it's important we found another one lionel did the ziggurat no no i mean there's the one you found and then there's one here yes will you tell them what you saw can i clarify these are all hired men of mine they're not his buddies i pay them all i mean maybe they're friends now but okay that's fair that's fine i had learned of someone new coming into town and stealing some magical artifacts and leaving some dead bodies and it wasn't my organization and it wasn't any of the other two leading crime organizations i found out through my whispers so it was someone new and i wanted to find out who it was so i sent lionel my best man and his buddies to investigate i mean all the details are good just when you tell a story lots of details yeah yeah paints a picture ziggy stardust ziggurat and a person sorry sorry i don't want to cut you off keep going keep going i assumed that yes and dark hoods executioner-style it's a couple weeks (laughter) it was hard to tell his face is always green so we couldn't really tell no i'm sorry i lied to you i didn't know listen i wanted to tell you this information but i didn't know how to do so i still don't know what's going to happen you all might draw your knives and kill me right now i just wanted to get this information thank you just some ammo for my gun that i have yeah no please don't give it back you would go investigate no you would go investigate and i would go back to my job yes 37 i've thought about you all a lot during this year and i owe you all an apology for leaving you and i don't know what i'll ever do to make it up to you no you didn't there was a night there was a night early on a few weeks after i left you it was just me and kaylie by a campfire and she was asking me about myself and my life and she has this thing i don't know if it's a spell or a special ability but she can always tell when i'm lying she's the only one and i was trying to spin some sort of bullshit to her about my past and she called me on it and said the truth let me hear it and i told her everything i told her about all the lives i had ruined and about the women and about all the other kaylies out there that i know of and the ones that i can only assume exist and everything and she spat at me and she gave me this scar with her knife and she left and i thought that was it i had ruined it but before dawn she came back and she unrolled her bedding and she went to sleep and woke up the next morning and said what's for breakfast dad and i realized that i've been wrong that you don't leave your shit behind and keep going you take it with you and the ones you surround yourself with better get used to the smell and she stayed with me despite all my flaws and when i left you all it was the first time that i had realized that you were all really flawed people really flawed people and i left and i did not come back and i was wrong because family sticks around even if you kind of hate the other person and i didn't i betrayed you and i've lived with that shame for a year well i have a purpose i have a job people depend on me strong people like this guy that's you yeah and smart people and kaylie and i'm a pretty big shot well it's a metaphor i knew i was part of something but i always thought i was i've been a storyteller but i didn't think i was part of the story and for the last year i've been the story and it's felt good but i'm back and i've given you the information and you can tell me what you'd like me to do next i doubt it it's good to see you all i don't really know what to do now i have i really don't know what to do now and that's a new feeling for me i have information we should travel back to ank'harel so i can show you and maybe then you all can decide what to do whether to part ways as friends or enemies but i can help you i know people there and i can get you safe passage fine accommodations the best food even some realistic-looking antiques grog all right should i go now i should give them some time okay lionel thanks for sitting through all this i really appreciate it oh really the good ones or the bad ones i'm sorry i know you've had a bit of a rough life no no no you don't have to we're already weird right now so i'm cool it's eight am where are you guys right now by the way is lionel with them would you like to go with them or stay with me in my sad room i taryon darrington rolled a 14 i'm with you guys i'm taryon darrington i stand up and i say i've seen this before he will attack brutally drink this and i shove a swift step draught in his mouth you can run 80 feet now every

little while i have to find doty i have to find doty and get some stuff and then i've got to be on my way yes well i know you're taken and you know i meant it i get it i get it you're sort of making

quacking at the duck okay thank you the duck knew that that is crazy no no no yes have vox machina been happy yes we will definitely do that absolutely yeah you need to use that skill more often you

in a while and we left on weird terms and everything that's happened between us but i want you to know that i held no ill will towards you and i thank you for agreeing to my request a while ago to look after kaylie if i should fall and i'm glad it didn't come to that but it's an honor to know that you would have even considered it sure sure what well that was a cheap shot i don't pike i don't have anything to say in my defense i was wrong about the whole thing i was not a good friend and i was not a good teammate and i'll have to live with that but i can tell you this i like who i am now and i didn't then so maybe someday we'll meet and you'll get to know the new guy but if it's not meant to happen right now that's okay and i understand and i will go back to what i was doing before no no that's not what i meant i meant i like who i am now that i know my daughter and i know that no matter what i have someone out there who's rooting for me and no matter what happens i've got that and i yeah that's it i don't like what i've been doing the last year in terms of you know i've been breaking the law a bit which i know you don't love but i'm doing things that i want to do for me and my girl and it's been rewarding and it's been fun and that's all that matters at this point i'm comfortable with the bastard that i've been because i know that the man i am now is different so i can't make everybody happy anymore and i think that was my problem before i was trying to make everyone happy and that's not my goal anymore i'm sorry if i hurt you i'm sorry how i treated you when we first met how i ogled you and flirted with you relentlessly that was disrespectful but what i'm most sorry for is that you met me then and not now and that's all i can say okay good night i'll leave and
