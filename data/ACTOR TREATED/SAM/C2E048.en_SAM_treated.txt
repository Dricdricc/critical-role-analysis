we have lots of big things planned but the campaign is taking a week off this week instead i spent most of this week making an infomercial for our good friends at d&d beyond i shot i edited it i added music it's a really cool piece it talks about all the great features of d&d beyond how it streamlines game-play and you should all go subscribe to it right now at dndbeyondcom anyway i made this infomercial i'm going to give it to max right now he's going to pop it up there and play it i think you guys will like it i'm an auteur so don't be too critical whenever it's loaded up max take it

the videos [sensual music] [beep] come on guys let me in the house [beep] [rock music] [beep] [pop music] [beep] yeah they have canceled the contract i don't think she likes carmen sandiego (singing) hmm-bop boop ba doop a mmmbop i don't know i said burglary taint i was caught between two carmen sandiego things smart smart always smart i will also change i want to see what it would be like to be a goblin still except with not green skin let's pick a different color maybe pink something that's like oh that's not a monster yeah that's a little pink pixie thing or something wings the tiniest wings dragonfly wings yes is he mocking orly oh my god the wharfmaster's a dick really one of the cannons is broken i found it that way though so you should probably fix that while we're gone you seem unreasonably excited about that do you need any help what are you going to make something oh yeah that yeah that metal box yeah we could probably ask around for a blacksmith let's go ask around for a blacksmith why don't we split off and some of us can look for a blacksmith and some can look for a bookshop and then we'll reconnoiter somewhere i would love to come along yes i feel like we've walked down this road before at least twice yeah neither you were just let up to your own devices as a small child that's fun did you have many friends growing up oh so you were starved for-- the minotaur that must have been fun it all rhymes (vocal accompaniment) and get a drink a-wicka-record scratch where are we sleeping tonight well i don't know-- well we hustled out of town because we had caused a ruckus not for very much longer mine's going to wear off in a couple of minutes maybe i'll recast it too sure you can contact the others we should have maybe said a place where we would meet later oh shit on the walk towards mom's house is there any little patch of grass or dirt a park that we pass i want to-- maybe while they were in there shopping i want to put my hand in the dirt feel soil know that i'm on solid land i thought i'd dropped a coin in there i was looking for it it's fun (mud squelch) oh god no i thought we were playing (laughter) yeah (deep voice) i hate monsters we'll drop our disguises do they know our names they do that we're giving that one to orly right do you know that tower that gets bigger and smaller the closer you are to it between dicks and buildings what time is it about now let's go fucking break into it right now let's go right now so what we'll be fine there's nothing in there we're just going to steal some stuff she's making a game system bring the paint caleb i promise you if we go scope it out tonight we are going in tonight have you met these people before please no also we might be doing a covert walk-by of this place that could definitely happen that's valid no i don't like to be near when he reads he needs to focus in the interest of time are there any potions that we find around hello hello is she mocking me laura and i think we need some items here why am i the face of the group hi we need some items we're looking for some potions potions i will also need some-- i was looking for some oil some oil all right (increasingly shrill) and do you have any healing potions (shrilly) we've got coin i feel like she's mocking me anything shiny eight how much are they (louder) how much are they (quietly) that fair we'll take them sure thank you anybody else chipping in you can do you have any flammable oils enough for a larger flask something that i could make a long line of oil with if i needed to i'll take it thank you what is your name again sheila sheila plobs-- bobsnopper do you buy things as well ma'am i have some studded leather armor that i don't need any more all right get it out of the haversack here's some old studded armor studded leather says 45 on-- that's new though i'll take it we chose wisely nice to meet you whatever bye-bye i liked her she was nice she was great bobsnopper we could probably kill her the tide peak the tower right fjord don't you have an ability where you can disappear and reappear a few feet somewhere else could you not do that and just be quickly inside but you could just disappear and reappear inside the wall couldn't you i'm just a caveman all right what hick queens jester could get us up there caduceus has a tree caduceus don't you have a magic tree not if we ride it up to the top then leave someone behind to chop it down real quick to be inside profit there's no door we were going to make one what oh jesus you missed a bunch no it's true but we need to figure out how we're going to talk our way into this place tomorrow i tried but the little guy got away before i spoke-- there was a little goblin guy which by the way none of you should trust he will turn around and stab you in the back the second you're not looking because he's a goblin the front door can't you see it right there (dolphin squeaking) oh yes we're going to need some information to give to get in i don't know something that would make a powerful mage want to talk to us we need to know a magical secret-- or talk to him about uk'otoa-- that's true these are all truths not without money caleb will know what to say with magic especially he's an amazing talker he's charming and handsome get a room we're going back i ate just a part of the tail but the rest of is a little chewed on but in paper for dinner caleb what is going to get us in that door is it information about uk'otoa we talked about this over dinner last night-- we definitely did we had a big dinner anyway-- he's just being coy we need a story to get us past the fucking goblin-man who's keeping us from getting in the tower something to share something that his master yussa errenis would find yussa-ful i have an actual reason a powerful mage with access to magical spells and books no maybe we just take a few books it's true and it's impending danger i like that one a lot that's right there is still one uk'otoa gate out there that we don't know where it is maybe this mage knows where it is we all have questions and there's a lot of unknowns out there and if this person could check off just one of the boxes then that would be worth it maybe we make an ally and he can check off more than one box tell us about the dodecahedron we are is it on our side or around the-- first good roll of the night that's true give him some information dangerous information we might not want to shout it in the streets up to you give him some info (quietly) maybe take someone who can get word out you plus one you get a plus one what might we want to show him no is there any evidence do we have any items from the xhorhasian-- the crick that we found do you want fappy fun ball you do want fappy fun ball should we give him fappy fun ball caduceus just bringing this up you know that beau ruins every situation she's in and is horribly abrasive to talk to and sometimes look at you're not taking the dodecahedron in right laura and but one of you should look at it before you go in you should take caleb he's a master of magic (quietly) next yep i think so (crossbow cocking) i drop the fish that i was half-done eating yeah let's go in i'm nott but he learns very fast seems very fair yes probably any day he reads a lot of books no we just assumed how do we prove our loyalty we've been here the whole afternoon we haven't fucked you over once anything to keep an eye out for well they talked about-- yeah we're all in did you already look at it today well we're also sometimes bad people so do you want to leave a pamphlet too so he can find out more information she does this a lot thank you for your time these biscuits are real good mine tastes like fish (laughter) well thanks what new spell do you know i feel his forehead does he have a third eye well that was great we got everything it was exactly what i said we would go in we'd get some magic for you we'd get some knowledge good job beau caduceus good job (monkey noises) well now what what place-- what tower do we break into next what do we get out of here hmm oh is it i hadn't been thinking about that every day but yeah it is wait don't you want to spend more time with your momsies well we could swing by i wouldn't be opposed to that but-- that's fine with me to alfield sure bryce the o-town posters yeah we love her almost as much as you do half as much as you do hyah don't we have horses hyah didn't we have a way to get back in no what city is it matt and we don't have paperwork from him oh okay the gnome kosh starosta kosh kosh starosta kosh kosh what clearbarker aww do we have anything wait is this our invisible cart or did we ditch that the cart with invisible shit on it i'm going to try to refine that oil that i bought into more burn-y oil is that something i can do on a moving cart i mean i have it says alchemist supplies sure sure they were both the same intelligence modifier 16 okay great three more i think it's 25 words has no means to call you back gustav's out of jail right cool we're done there nothing in trostenwald we're going to alfield or are we bypassing alfield are we checking in with bryce what that might actually be safer say hi to everyone for us maybe not from bryce i mean i like bryce bryce is cool we have the handwriting samples happen to have any forgeable paperwork of other cities' lawmasters good because that would be illegal and you're a person of the law it was a trick yep that hyah git along little doggies you meet a dragon what is the main export of nicodranas i'm going to put my hood up the mask on yeah no yeah you mean the clan no they don't live in the city the fellow my friend yeah they're in the city he's in the city somewhere yeah i know where the house is i'll lead them towards-- i'm going to start heavily drinking i don't recognize either 19 do you want me to go sneak up or anything i guess are we curious about that (gasps) holy boly all you've got to do is ask archmage of something cerberus assembly oh my god i'm shaking right now he's making the names so hard now that we can't make fun of them what is he the archmage of vess derogna yep no there's people out there he knows you dummy i'm a little on edge you're not dumb glassy grass stop the cart is anyone around i'll cast disguise self and be some gnomish old lady i'm going to walk over to the burned-down apothecary and start looking around i'm looking for identifying signs of life or-- 15 can i look for buttons aw shit 11 no i was just looking to see-- i knew the man who worked here what's terrible what happened what things do you know what-- were you here do you know what happened to this place yes do i know edith he's okay did the party that came in to attack-- were they taking prisoners or were they killing were you there how did they get away the cricks did they go underground which tunnels where all right thank you i'm sorry for your loss yes hmm yes if you could could you look around this wreckage a bit and see if you find anything interesting i will unlock it not good 15 jester open the door caleb open it is it magical it wasn't mm-hmm does it look like there was a struggle in here or it's been turned by someone looking for something 22 21 that's way worse yours is much better i don't know chemicals there was chemicals here he kept chemicals there's a box you said i'm going to go over and open it or is it locked i will unlock it that's 29 i open it 19 i'll take another drink of booze and look in there hold something maybe does it look like the same metal of the dodecahedron any similar characteristics try it no no i've never seen this before i'll grab it and throw it to caleb as we continue to invoke the beacon with extremely focused energy of different spectrums and sources the effects unleashed are curious and reach far beyond this laboratory the dunamis field-- is that right have we heard that before -- sightlessly encompassed an entire portion of the town with locals complaining of an ill sluggish sensation-- that's the slow --being dragged down others at different experiments rumored of witnessing people and livestock moving at a noticeably faster or slower rate within entire sections of the city in proximity to the laboratory-- based on our previous experiments and extracted techniques from captured kryn operatives-- yeah kryn operatives based on our previous experiments extracted from captured kryn operatives the abilities of dunamis and dunamancy within xhorhas appears to focus around the manipulation of gravity-- --entropy and time yet while the basis of what dunamancy origin glyphs we were able to acquire show it to exist outside of the established schools of magic-- what you got yes this magic by my theory is deeply rooted in ancient history of some arcana we take for granted if these beacons are just the surface what eons-old rituals have been lurking beneath the citadel in ghor dranas ghor dranas they were using the alchemist they were using yeza i'm beginning to believe it goes deeper between the fragments of power we've only begun to unlock within these beacons and the capabilities of the kryn on the battlefield i surmise they have been learning to bend and break the threads of destiny for hundreds of years be this truth i cannot imagine the raven queen looks down upon them favorably either though the thought brings a laugh to my lips do i recognize any of this handwriting no does he we have a vial i don't know he's an excellent alchemist they would probably need someone like that but the xhorhasians weren't doing this someone else was right your people your people were doing experiments and trying to find out and harness the power of-- what it's your people it's the people that you know and trained with well fuck him it's your people that have done this to my people and we have to find them both not right now i have to go see lady edith right now huh no nothing under the chair we took the trap out we took the vial what i need to check on-- i'll take another drink and then look outside to see if anyone's watching we'll go back to the cart how far is edith okay cart or walk cart okay i'll disguise self as a halfling plump face tan skin braids i'll start pounding on the door edith it's me where's my son i'm not let me see him right now (sniffles) hi no they didn't i'll pull out the doll of king bertrand and give it to him i brought you that and other toys how are you are you okay did they hurt you no no no he's alive i know he is did they touch you the mean lady what does she look like who is she oh my gosh it's so wonderful to see you i pick him up and give him a big hug and a kiss oh i'm sorry yes she comes often you go somewhere safe when she comes what about the last time yes very smart you're very smart you've always been a very smart boy you're a good boy good job stay safe when you were running away did you see anything of dad i'm so sorry

out of the city out of the village i mean ah is this-- i don't know are there any strong-- how do i-- to protect them travis i think they got what they came for i think it's safe here now what if the next attack is there so they'll be okay here no i don't know i don't know okay maybe lay low for a little while a few days a few weeks and then-- okay yes she can send you a magical message and you can tell us where you are i don't know if they would make that that's a long journey i don't either i don't know i'm not thinking straight right now okay stay here for now and stay safe we'll come back soon thank you yeah all right oh boy the chair is the key to everything it's the thread that holds it all together oh fuck oh boy
