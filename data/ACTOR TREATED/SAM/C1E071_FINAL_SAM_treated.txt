sweet i prepared a history lesson tonight it's a history of crates ancient greece zeus presents a lovely crate to the first woman on earth a lovely gal named pandora it contained death and evil corrupted the world forevermore egypt 1957 the ark of the covenant-- sort of a crate it carried the ten commandments-- is opened by colonel dietrich and dr rene belloq ghosts fly out and it melts the faces of several nazis while indiana jones hides his face los angeles california 1995 rookie detective david mills played by brad pitt receives a cardboard crate from murder suspect john doe it contains the head of his girlfriend gwyneth paltrow your town present day you receive a small expertly constructed crate that contains geek chic gear and apparel from the walking dead nightmare on elm street friday the 13th texas chainsaw massacre and halloween now which would you rather get the ark of the covenant pandora's box a box with gwyneth paltrow's head in it or a loot crate which you can use code criticalrole to get 10% off your monthly crate guys i think there's only one choice that would be fine i would much rather do these i would do these for money every day (laughter) battle wait we're going to battle why're you waking me up sure an attack but we literally just got back from telling them to be ready to move tomorrow morning so we have to go back and tell them-- and they were pissed they were super pissed that we were there we could go back tooma is not going to be pleased that's true what are the details i don't know be ready to attack tomorrow morning we're going to deliver a giant beast for the dragon to hunt and that her people should be ready to strike that's it you don't get to say roll he's not sleeping on it is he we don't know we haven't seen this thing quick draw a picture of grog and then we'll know no we kept out of sight in the caverns and vorugal we don't think saw us but we also didn't see vorugal either wouldn't see me i don't want to speak for vax but if we're going back tonight you no longer have the ability to fly is that true but you do vexy oh yeah well that would've been helpful last time actually but yes if i were a fly-- i assume any of us can avoid his detection if we stay low and invisible well yes right i can make you invisible she told us to release yenk-- the summoning circle or something like that all right i'm leaving mine in the mansion bring something that you don't mind putting down no leave that at home i can make you invisible you can fly us down through the cavern but you're going to have to be super stealthy okay don't know how that'll work if we're flying but okay doesn't that cover our tracks oh that's the stealth rolls thing okay good wait keyleth will you hold onto my mythcarver sword for me i can trust you oh boy that's a big smile okay don't kill anyone with it i feel nothing sometimes i have to hold it with my left hand so it feels different yes i will use yet another 3rd-level invisibility spell to make us both invisible yeah so we made a right here and left here and right at the big rock vex is the girl one vax is the boy isn't minxie big and spottable that's so hot polymorph just lasts wait no so he has to stay within range it's got to be something that can go as fast as we're going if he were a black crow or something he could fly back on its own a moth can't travel a mile with one yellow eye and one black eye all right let's go do i also get to give her any assistance like we went this way go that way dice jail already we should do the same thing we did last time i know you weren't here we turned visible asked to guards to go-- it's going to be really shitty when we get in there because she's going to hate us i will drop invisibility are the guards around oh we'll stay invisible until we get to the guards where did we meet the guards last time that's where we want to meet them again yep same routine we'll leave our weapons here this is my friend vex we'd like to see tooma again i know it's very upsetting that we have to make these night calls like this but it's very important yes we offer profound apologies for waking you from your slumber again at the spot where you told us question before we go typically when you've done this in the past you inform vorugal and he heads on over right away does he need to see evidence of a hunt how does it work do you typically inform him skork and is there some sort of hunt horn or anything that signals the beginning of this or does it just happen i don't want to mess this up if vorugal were to see anyone near this summoning circle would he be suspicious or would he be okay with it okay good to know there's like a 50/50 chance we'll come back again tonight no 60/40 we're out of here sorry oh yeah invisibility yet again i'm out of 3rd-level spells yes i've made us invisible again with advantage oh snap 12 22-- 24 she's a night person she's okay first do we have any spells to do that you have another tree stride in you didn't we get here today we saw her literally today is that a new set of dice you stopped on the way here to buy dice oh great pike's good at quiet oh jesus wait what oh my god the dragon's going to fucking kill us right now yeah matt why did you roll two natural ones the door is shimmery and shiny close the door the dragon yes everyone sleep now the mansion will last 24 hours so it'll be dark again by the time it wears off so we can stay in here as long as we need to but do we have things we need to accomplish today but with percival's engineering skills he could maybe find a good little spot of granite for you to dig into or something i'm keeping all options on the table they don't have to be giant caverns it's just a little nook a little foxhole okay how do we do that in broad daylight it's called invisible reconnaissance i will say this i love the sound of this spell but wouldn't travelling mist be really undetectable could we mist around there's a snowstorm out there we're just going to be one with the clouds my worry about animals is don't we also have the intellect of the animals that we become so we keep our own intellect a flock of hawks they don't go together but a flock of pigeons do or a flock of geese tell me this can you not do that if you throw it and don't want to travel where it is go right in my neck oh you get to choose maybe don't ever do that again please it takes a while but yes two questions are we all going and question two when we get there and find a suitable location for carving caves are you going to do this right now or are we just scouting we're going to do this right now well we can't communicate when we're in mist form so you just have to go do if you feel it yeah what do we look like are we a yellow cloud a white cloud it is it really is but we discussed before we left that we would mainly stick to the lowlands and the ravine to get there yeah shouldn't laura lead do i get to add jack of all-- i'm not okay 18 ooh wow matt it's arendelle can vorugal see this spot oh i'm great at those six while she's doing that i'm going to fly through pike a few times i'll see him doing that and join him question percy there's this annoying wind (laughter) here's a question rather than scouting here digging a hole and going back to our mansion should we just have a new mansion here kima i could technically drop that mansion and she'd be on her ass (laughs) well someone could go back and get her we don't have to do this right now but when we're done here maybe we want to camp here so we have a place to hide inside a mansion and we don't even really need to make tunnels do we yeah that's true we want to spread out i know it's so annoying i'm going to scan the sky and there's these rocks here we know there's some rocks we knows that there's tons of ice we saw him on the way over we know exactly where he is what sorts of things can you ask nature no that's good to know does this make noise will it vibrate the ground we saw a storm coming has it hit yet we can wait until the storm comes it'll be super windy and loud can you do something to ice melt it that's silent yeah but we could carve out ice tunnels we can hide behind rocks can you make new rocks that are hollow i guess it'll still make noise how important are these tunnels because if we want while you're doing this i can go distract the dragon sure why not taliesin and to distract the dragon so you can dig we have the stones what about the stones stones someone can mist back with the stone then mist back to us and give her the stone ooh if pike is going back as mist-- no offense pike-- can you find the mansion okay gladly did you guys de-mist-ify hey clever elves can you scout around make sure we're not being watched we're not being watched you sure those hawks are hawks terrible 11 ooh my girl okay kima sorry to interrupt lunch-- disgusting we need to move that will disappear when we leave here do you need me to help as well i produce one half of the stones that we brought and i say-- oh wait does she know how to do this i guess you just think right you just think you have to think i know that's hard but you're going to have to hold this rock and want it to be reunited with its pair i'm sorry about that and then you'll be bamfed back to where we're going all right here take this stone all right so we'll just step out of the mansion i won't drop it yet because there's no need and we're going to mist back but after she's bamfed all right so think happy thoughts click your heels together she's okay can you do a one-handed push-up can i see can i try a one-handed push-up seven (laughter) i'm carrying a lot of stuff without my gear i could probably do it yeah magic weighs on you all right let's go scanning the skies for any sight of a flapping white dragon she can manipulate ice why a hundred feet up can we just do 20 feet up yeah why a hundred feet why not 20 feet why not 30 feet why hey guys did you see the dragon leave should we be concerned at all that he's going to meet up with raishan and fuck us we hired somebody taliesin and when was this we did why on earth would we do that we're super strong oh shit sorry oh oh larkin oh yes i totally remember you larkin will you be joining us here at the battle or providing support from afar what kind of support long-distance attacks or healing and larkin the reason we hired you now that i remember was for your extreme knowledge of dragons and their behaviors tell me this should we be concerned when this one leaves his lair about hobbling its lair or somehow preventing it from returning well we know that it'll be coming here for a fight is there a way to prevent it from getting back to its lair mercenary ravenites who you know why we have pike that's our other ally she's here now i'll make the mansion behind a rock outcropping kima i need your help to make sure i'm not spotted while i do this ritual well someone has to be on the outside watching to find out what's happening someone who can be invisible someone who can be a hawk or ravenite tomorrow we're talking about yes absolutely well someone would have to be next to the doorway pop their head in and say oi it's on but we also have these bubbles of watching around don't we or i can just drop the mansion and at the very least kima can be waiting inside the mansion as can our lesser stealthy friend pike at least keep them in there all right it's something there is no mansion yet i haven't done it yet all right i will cast the mansion behind a rock it's yenk (laughter) kima if it would help i can erase your memory of this whole thing-- i'll let it alone for now behind the bigger rock where percy's stationed right now larkin can take care of-- hey it took me five minutes ashley figured it out before us who's going to do it immune to fear advantage on wisdom saves immune to poison increased 14 points okay and if she starts killing us what do we do hide in the mansion regroup let's go fight oh sleep what am i making us all ravenites or does that not even matter anymore okay i guess if i'm going to be out in the open i probably should sure you mean wearing white clothes i guess i'll make us all white ravenites normal ravenites with lighter-colored clothing that can maybe blend in but also we can't dance very well and we clap on the two and the four so yes i'll make us all ravenites i can do eight people so that's everyone including kima i'm going out oh wait before i leave doesn't someone have to buff me up for this spell yeah what time is it is it dawn eight okay how will we know when it's time for me to release we have to wait for tooma to go report i assume vax do you want to go look no fuck larkin to see when tooma's coming i don't want to release this thing before tooma is there reporting to vorugal but when no when is vorugal coming we can't sit out here all day waiting the ravenites have to tell him to come here first no she's telling him now today we told her to wait who me oops percy died does anyone want to be invisible for an hour some of us will be do you want to wait in the house grog and pike too okay i'm going to cast it and probably go into the house i can make a couple of you invisible keyleth do you want to make anybody invisible you can't do that you know what i can't do it anyway i think gate is a concentration spell even if i'm reading it off a scroll it is a concentration spell okay then i can't make anyone invisible can you become an animal ever i will inspire myself yes i will say to myself all right scanlan i know that your palms are sweaty your knees are weak arms heavy there's cologne on your tunic grog's spaghetti but just remember you're good enough you're smart enough and doggone it people like you i'm still going to hang out by the rocks and i can go at least 60 feet in front of me but i'll do 50 feet in the center basically yeah sure and his name is yenk i'm not going to read it until i hear wings flapping it takes six seconds to do right oh boy that's an eight okay i'm casting okay so i roll with advantage (gasps) not great okay and what am i adding plus two plus my charisma 20 facing away from me no i close it instantly i'm going to tiptoe backwards into the mansion that's a seven 21 (cheering) i sing at it i sing at it i will sing (singing) yenk you will be our friend travel through the portal and back again your heart is true you're a fiend and a confidant boom boom boom (speaking) all right so i will dominate monster with the hand cone 21 i say you will stay here and you will kill a white dragon and i will tiptoe back into the mansion it's huge we're in a lobby eating chicken yeah that means he's still dominated okay okay would i feel that no i'm on another plane of existence yes yenk yes i'm going to cast invisibility on myself and poke my head out the door yeah that'll work fucking eight battle is still going on i'll check again in 12 seconds and expose yourself are you on the ground are you going to go up his ass into his stomach in the dragon it's not even a dungeons and dragons book they're all people sam and
