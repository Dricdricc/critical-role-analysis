what it's vaxmas i'm not looking oh wow that's really nice i thought it was going to be vulgar wow that's so sweet thank you kit buss me and two ladies what could be better right i don't know how to put this up but thank you that's so sweet aw i won't kill you tonight and john lennon hey travis you didn't know this can they vote many times are we there no we're not even there oh shit it's already started was just saying that trinket died already can i request that the rest of us do the sounds of the ricocheting bullets in case he misses don't hit jarett he could still hit jarett he's our best guy oh initiative i don't think it's anything i think it's just him tinkering he got 15 i got three does he have armor wait trinket missed (ricochet sound) (laughter) (ricochet sound) have we rested by the way so we're down a bunch of spells some of us used spells fly and stuff oh where am i where does percy do his tinkering because i can't see what's going on down there okay so i know there's shit going on down there but i can't really see what so i would probably just dimension door into the tinkering room because that's where i assume percy is and then i see what's going on and nobody's there do i have line-of-sight on anybody okay well then i can move also can't i i'll move towards him oh then i see a crazy thing in front of me shit so i probably take a couple steps back (laughter) desmond jarett and desmond from the tinkering room i yell out is it safe can i come out now oh okay i'll stay how did you get two you've had the worst couple of days i gently fall asleep under percy's workbench where i've been hiding this whole time natural 20 the fuck is that sound six he's fallen for that stuff before and this is why you kept up our accusations against us in front of him wait are you saying that the briarwoods corrupted him during the dinner while we were all sitting there aren't you deaf is that why you're talking so loud (laughs) unless they're caught in which case you've got two of our members against the entire palace guard i didn't even want to face the little invisible thing downstairs he hates our fucking guts seeker asum in your opinion is it safer to try and heal him or to try and clear our name through the traditional legal means no no the other option is to clear our names and not worry about clearing his mind but during our trial we will have a direct line of sight to him we might be able to get through to him that's true he doesn't trust allura she wasn't even allowed in the room to talk to us there's definitely suspicion there right runaways no we go to the briarwoods-- whitestone or by killing the briarwoods thus ending the charm percival-- percival what do you think we should do go seek revenge on your family and get some blood on our hands briarwood blood or do the sneaky thing and try to-- diplomatic immunity he's not even going where we would be going we would be going to whitestone right that's where the briarwoods are it's a strategy boner i'm not that small no are you asking me no but i can shit on things yes it could last him 20 minutes yes get him to the docks maybe onto tiberius i could've shat on him and had the same effect we've always sought out the path of the most glory and i think that that is the briarwoods going into a giant vampire-lich-ridden castle and killing two evil bastards amid their army of protectors is the coolest thing we could ever do you think we can get into sovereign uriel without anyone detecting magic on us he's got clerics all round him-- we can get there but something tells me we're still going to be fighting a big fight in a palace i'd rather fight that big fight in the briarwoods' but in the briarwoods' we can kill every motherfucker in that place you killed an old lady she did have an old lady smell (singing) here comes the sun-- tell him that he bought you i go to gilmore's are we near gilmore's i want to know if such a thing exists and if so how much a potion or a scroll that could invoke either hallow or spirit guardians spirit guardians is four hallow is five 4th-level spirit guardians would make some beings around us it scares evil things away it's like a pike-y thing can i cast that if i have a scroll how much did you say i'll buy one of those okay yes i will i would also like to find a smithy of some sort and make me a little metal choker of chainmail (laughs) sure i'll get eight of them or seven of them how much are they chainmail chokers and a small one for my dick (laughter) a tiny one then i bow and leave 16 errands in the meantime check out those critical role keychains available on geek and sundry (laughter) oh jeez it's worth it it's a good investment the thing that i had that i still want that one feet you know if you hold two next to each other there looks like there's a million of them if you're doing a square it's three feet by three feet i've got fog can he get back to the keep and we've all left four days ago (laughter) dear tiberius we left 95000 gold (whispered) how much do they cost i'll just put it on my back i'll just hang it i will put it where i put all gentle things i give everyone the chainmail i take that fancy box i bought a couple times ago and i take the blue crystal that we found in our very first adventure and i put it in and i seal it tight shit i had one more thing i wanted to do oh yes i drink my shit-scrying potion shit in a jar and leave it in the kitchen and tell the help don't touch it have we given them a raise five of them make 100 a month two of them make 50 a month that won't do anything they would have known when they got to our keep he's awesome skirmisher's stealth (air horn noises) i walk into tiberius' room while he's having this conversation with himself and i say what are you doing in here oh okay all right i'm going to go get some garlic from the kitchen and then let's go onward do we know where we're going do we know where we're going carriage let's go how much do they cost all right yes we go to tiberius's laboratory (dryly) oh i'm very impressed you drew that just now let's set out i trust percy whatever you say so the bridge is out how far is it across we've got to get the horses across they're not coming oh well i just dimension door across then no one the horses i say a prayer of thanks to the horses who will surely die of starvation the plan is walk until we get there nine orion 18 four don't worry i can make us all look like cows again come on do it grog come on you can't beat a girl i'll take first watch i go invisible to see if i can hear their conversation perception or stealth 20 let's get going 27 one no should we run will it move with us your shell you can't do that
