the most magical day of their lives and liam is gone i wanted to pay special tribute to our little ashley who's leaving us for a while i feel like she should get some love too on her way out the door i composed a song for you in the style of your favorite band boyz ii men (singing) how do i say goodbye shit to our sweet innocent harbinger of death fallen angel on nbc you play a geek but you're a real one here with us every week if we get to visit xhorhas i hope blindspot will let you play but until then i hope patterson dies every day that's hard to do in a mustache this is what i did the first time through the campaign so that's what i gotta do this time this is what i wore this time in the first campaign i did not decide this was put upon me by the fates yeah i can't un-make it oh the monkey’s here right okay good oh what okay will one of them be a baby you're pretty good though you said late morning midday so we could at least go check out this prison and do some scouting before nightfall yeah oh the teenagers yeah you just had a baby i understand rissa knows the town though she might be able to help us scout out this prison why don't we have fjord and jester go tell their employers which one are you are you jester oh yes well let's find out if we need it yet i guess we're all going all right lowerdook fuck those guys they'll be fine how would they find the kids hmm we did oh yes you have that spell don't you to fitz and ashton to fitz you have like eight words left go back to work that's true a lot of that was hyphenated and the stuff they're making is catapults or guns cool what's that place called again is it heavily protected it just rolls and cuts it's inside of it i would assume right what did your father call this robit the gearkeeper would anyone believe that not by the city hmm well the main concern is getting in the prison i don't know if walking up to the front door and saying hi we're here to take care of your spinny death problem is going to work do we need outfits or something what like orkin man outfits or do we need to look like we're official but they don't like her father heist-type maintenance workers uniforms i just want to wear a onesie ooh that sounds like something that's way too smart for laura to say i love a pie why you playing five characters at the same time we'd like a hospitable meat pie oh we have money again don't we when the whistles blew matthew did we see any guards do a shift change at the prison seven oh okay oh yes we've brought gift we could steal the crossbow we don't have to do the mission at all i could just saying is that a cymbal crashing she's clever no she's a wily one he's eating that extra meat pie gnome just wait it out you are fucking crazy cleff or maybe yasha could hit it with her sword question can it climb cleff when you were building this thing you were building it off-site i assume right no i mean off the prison site not-- so you don't know any extra secret entrances or exits to the prison itself that's enough to smear a lens i could put a meat pie on the end of one of my bolts and shoot it at it or just tar or something maybe on the walk we can see if we can find a tar restaurant in a bucket it has to be a little hot hey you could heat up a bucket of tar as we walk into a prison that wouldn't be suspicious at all this is the worst night ever no i’m committed i've got two spares if i need it marisha ashley and let's go do you need a drink to soothe your nerves but it would really help in a smothering way we're just going to walk up to the guards and say we're here to dismantle the robit right all right let's do it who's going to be doing the talking yeah yeah no i think fjord would agree with that tar first where do we go for tar the iron lot i'll look for that 18 and we're behind a gate and there's workers everywhere this is at the assembly yard ah why would you-- no we could just walk in and pretend to be a worker and just grab a bucket we could just sneak in the gate what's his range how far is it matt ten minutes oh okay i'll walk around and see if there's a way through the gate that's hidden ten okay let's see if schmidt can-- juggle something wait you're going to jump the fence no this is a distraction you're not supposed to jump in the-- oh god when schmidt comes close enough yes it could go now but we can't go fast they'll see a moving bucket okay i'll cast mage hand are people looking right now okay i'm just going to wait until they finish their conversation as he starts walking i'll nod to caleb and try to do the lift over the fence sleight of hand 22 yeah we have a bucket of tar part one of our plan is complete look at that teamwork yeah everybody contributed a little except for jester and fjord everyone was really good let's put the tar bucket in the haversack of holding if that's possible if it will fit i don't know then we're carrying a bucket of tar is that weird all right we'll just carry it yeah persuasive beau how many doors are there we're doing this now if i'm going to be throwing tar at this thing maybe i should have it i could all right so the guards will take us down she can't she's out of spells didn't we use a bunch those are high-level spells okay does it say how many spells she has left oh it reset but she definitely had used some in case this all goes tits-up do we want to try to talk to these guards and maybe figure out what cell the schusters are in i'm not talking to them but someone with more charisma than me oh charming caleb i mean is that worth doing now no but i mean if the warden doesn't give us what we want okay but we're in the prison all right okay yeah sure i'm going to look at the-- --the dodecahedron while we're at it lift oh sure okay i'll use mage hand to hold it up yeah i'll hold it with my mage hand ah oh but we were about to fight that's not good sure i'll sneak over to the door and try to unlock it or see if it's locked i'll pick a lock that's is a 14 four i don't know what's in it i can't see anything through it can i what's in that room what an amazing mini that's rough if the thing comes out here we're all dead so we should probably figure out a way to stop it all right but i can't open it does the door have holes that's not a door it's just a cage that's pretty good let's move quickly though if we went inside that room though-- the creature would probably give up and go back into hiding until we came out i would assume sure that's scary and dangerous it's a terrible idea but go for it does jester have her spiritual weapon out okay maybe we should get it ready wait what we can make some right now quietly all right well plan b do you want me to scout ahead to the area that you've seen or the cat yes how about the cat goes to the area where molly has seen which liam for you is the bottom left of the picture i sent you no this is the one that-- the first explored room that molly has seen a little bit of liam sorry i was looking at my spellbook and not paying attention to you lot what were you hoping me to do i'm going to re-cast mage hand and pick up the bucket of tar towards the narrower hallway yeah just on the edge of it do i hear any movement or anything the room oh god save 21 whoa who are you seven caleb and jester are six molly and nott are both seven this is it this is it kick it in the ball clang yeah fjord plus three from the gearkeeper i probably have my crossbow out i’ll hit it with my crossbow yeah 18 do i get a point of damage yeah eat it i need a new crossbow is what i need it can do that cleff you madman oh rough 12 because i hit it with my thing do i no longer have a reaction oh shit is its lens out so go for the lens bonus action i will use the mage hand to deliver the tar right on that lens there is no bonus to that well that’s-- how do you feel about that well it fell so we’ll never know what it was 17 our plan worked perfectly how far am i from the thing do you think i’m in melee range can i use my action to disengage okay i will disengage and run straight to the place i just came from sure ooh nice why can't we hear you simple sacred flame (imitating taliesin) we're going to do guiding bolt that door actually opens and closes matt up the butt does it have a butt matt does it poop everyone poops ooh that's exactly how he talks oh no not my sweet boy (cat yowl) my mustache is falling off so i better hold it on with another mustache get up under them plates oh no so far we've learned today that fjord sounds like this (goofy chuckling) useless i'm going to scoot around and fire a crossbow at it that's a 15 plus seven to hit is it within melee and stuff well that wasn't good at all that's eight i'll use my fury of the small that's another five points terrible i can't really do anything you know what i'll take out my last burning bolt that should be magical load it up and fire that but that doesn't hit i just wasted it it's 14 damn it what are you talking about i'm going to duck back a little bit can he use the rest of his movement to work on his jester accent (jester voice) technically now i don't know can you get in there is the guts exposed it's pronounced-- sam marisha and yeah where oh no caleb you're in that cone oh no he's dead already (singing) open the door on your mystery date caleb you have to make a dex save how you're pinned to a wall marisha do one for fjord how about you cay cay-cay low okay how's she do that thing you do beau sure i mean i don't have much i'll walk up there poke around the corner shoot a crossbow bolt do my thing that's a big hit 25 ten halved i guess these attacks are so weak i don't know what else to do i don't have anything else to do yeah i guess i'll shoot another one why not that hits 23 that's another six points halved take those shots mollymauk is it the snitch where did you get that ecks versus sever does she have a cure wounds i'm going to run back and see what was back over there can i open the thing 13 caleb i need you to come open this door yasha i need you to come kick in this door you're bigger you're bigger in spirit and heart i believe in you oh wait i'm going to use this matt i'm going to try to bend fate and try to repick the lock i know it's a lot (laughter) anything near the bodies this i'm good at one (laughter) old prison poop should we retrieve the magic core or anything as proof of what we did here wherever it stays well let's take this stuff back up to the warden (knocking) we're done let us out guards on our way out do i see my bolt anywhere 12 it only triggers if it hits it was an incredible device you could have told us the eye had a protective windshield wiper device poppin drokrusher it's all right let's have a meat pie (laughter) they're at your house the butcher place don't worry we'll take you there they're being kept safe by a tiny bird with a dagger sometimes the people that help you are the least expected yes yes we'll come back and check on kiri be a good girl kiri i guess everyone knows at this point so it's okay now thank you for listening to us that felt really good guys it's nice being good people we can do more things in this city yes that's right i guess we should go visit cleff who says it's mine it could be any of ours i mean mine's a little busted though so it would be nice i can fix that probably okay worth a shot well we just came to say goodbye we're probably rolling out of town soon and you know i mean if you had an extra crossbow lying around a beta testing sort of a thing mm-hmm mm-hmm sure okay yes ugh i love it it's great thank you thank you cleff i'm sure he's going to invent many new excellent devices i think they're on the road to recovery yes she's not going anywhere what are you crazy caleb she's fine come on you're crazy it's fine is that where we're going next are we making our way out of town on the way out of town-- you said when we came into town there were some guards with pistols with guns do we see any on the way out 14 i'm going to try to steal it with either mage hand or my own hand whatever's-- mage hand what am i doing sleight of hand oh 19 then so not sleight of hand this is a dexterity check oh well then it's 22 okay great it's loaded with a bullet though right okay cool great that's all i care about you go i got a nine oh god whoa she’s a bad motherfucker was she taken and fjord and jester all in the same cart we heard it with our passive perception oh i forgot to tell you that i never went to sleep and i was watching the whole time well yeah blood yeah we’ll get a black light (laughter) mm-hmm thank you matt for making this game work with half of a crew i’m sure they’re sound asleep right now just getting a good night’s sleep (laughter) the first night is rough
