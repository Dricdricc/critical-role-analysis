bamf-in-pike card from lillith and zahra lillith is a true friend zahra as well vex and vax within allura and the party make an alliance and keyleth aids her in performing a scrying ritual on the palace the vision reveals that the family of uriel-- his wife two daughters and son-- are all under the influence of some demonic force and have addled the mind of their father using him as a mouthpiece for their plot the party decides to pay a visit to the clasp using vax and pike's knowledge of an entrance and end up in a confrontation with spireling modeth within his chambers the battle ends with modeth's head on the floor and four strange glowing crystals he had been keeping now stolen by the party they attempt to leave but are met by a host of clasp members and another dangerous-looking spireling through scanlan's deft lies and coercion the party is allowed to leave unharmed before their deeds are discovered they return to allura's tower only to find the front door ajar and the interior tossed by some previous scuffle as they reach the top of the tower they investigate finding signs of a struggle with a demonic entity and allura's escape seemingly successful unfortunately a magical defense of the tower is triggered and it begins to cave and crumble around them through some ingenuity-- and the discovery of a magic carpet-- the party manages to escape being crushed within allura's ivory monolith now compacted into a single magical pearl our heroes then locate and enter the home of general krieg finding a brainwashed servant and a hidden passage that leads to a teleportation circle using the device they are transported to a distant cavern high in a range of frost-covered mountains and an incredible hoard of gold jewels and fine trinkets across the room are four obsidian orbs placed within the rock as one is touched a giant eye appears from within the black crystal and a voice erupts calling for a brimscythe and noticing the unfamiliar folk mentions intruders i know your face now he is a fool and so are you insect the orbs all crack simultaneously becoming inert grog dives right in rage-looting the gold but the arrival of the party seems to call the attention of general krieg who appears at the teleportation circle he angrily denounces the party and reveals his true form that of a frightening blue dragon sure i can polymorph trinket
