yes d&d beyond is our awesome sponsor it's a great online mobile access thing that you can manage all sorts of stuff i'm losing my voice tonight because-- yeah i know so that i can preserve my voice for the rest of the night laura can you read the copy and i'll lip sync it thank you laura oh god as you know d&d beyond is the official digital tool set for critical role it's got a ton of features but one of the coolest is that it keeps track of stuff like hit points inspiration and all sorts of modifiers to your dice rolls which is amazing especially if you're the kind of person that's more focused on which dice you're rolling with oh keep going what no that's not what it says (laughter) i don't know what happens when no problem with our setup we're fighting already nope i rolled her dice it was a one i'm never rolling it again is that german five i have five one plus four you guys are out in the open the horses have better initiative than all of us cool map it's still alive nott is going to hard charge out of the tent not at the beast but across the courtyard yes as fast as she can go saying shit shit shit can she make it to that box she can't as she's running she's going to fire her crossbow at the dude 11 plus six 17 okay so that is seven points of damage and sneak attack damage another two points oh and why not i'll use fury of the small add another two points yes and then bonus action can i just hide behind that thing apparently travis is using magic man down seeing one of us die scares the shit out of me no dead forever (laughter) i start charging out at the beast i get about halfway i fire my crossbow (wailing scream) fire the crossbow that's a natural 20 (cheering) i'm low to the ground so probably in the back of the calf or something before it falls i'm going to turn and run into the tent i don't even know if i hit (screaming) it's a cantrip it's designed for this moment oh no she's not proficient use my dice that i gave you yes that's what i'm hoping for is there any young girl in the tent with me natural 20 that means i have to go the smell of sulfur i mean brimstone do i figure that it's probably the residual from the big toad guy or is there a substance in the room that is causing it a religion check one (laughter) i'm going to try and get out of the tent through the side like underneath the side and towards the horse yeah back there looking for caleb no not yet is he okay did he live did everyone live oh yes i do hi yeah so he can't be far okay there's horses around here let's steal them might i point out real quick up to this point we are fugitives who haven't committed a crime but starting now we will be fugitives who have committed crimes are we sure we want to do this all right let's go but i have to find caleb first should i shoot them the white one toya's gone right sorry that we thought that you did it briefly saddle up where are we going we're going with them then wait what how did we never know that how many suns are there just change the license plate no back in time (laughter) it's really shallow shouldn't we weigh them down with something we could write a little note and put it in one of their pockets that says something like i've discovered that caleb and nott are innocent and should be cleared of all charges or something like that sure how do you spell jester okay we were going to go along the north way right the toad went due north like straight into the water could be if we're chasing the toad it seems like we need to find a boat and go out into the water steal that boat well no we are just going to find the toad you said this we're camping and waiting and resting or swim you can hit dice it do any of us know what's beyond like what's on the other side of this lake is it a mountain do you just need ten gold pieces we're going to go shopping at three in the morning six to hit a horse what was that i don't even know what that was thank you i already rolled once 11 one day down two days down with d&d beyond it does the work for you there is there are two rest buttons liam they're down towards the bottom short rest or long rest gross were they dead go down for breakfast i'm always with you yes you saw that sorry would i know that it's made of platinum just from glancing at it and feeling it not great just an intelligence check eight i don't want to get rid of it that is a tough decision but this is the only one i have i only have one flask oh but it's so pretty how about this for a counteroffer how much are the books here i like this better (laughter) stop i come with him your accent is confusing sure you don't want to-- sure you don't want stay here and shop around some more okay okay but i could've perused some of the aisles and it's a long-- okay i've always had it you never asked for any i collect things among them are pieces of gold i have more ooh you made my cheeks all green he gets like this when he's studying he gets very focused it's best not to disturb him should we go look for the toad ooh he has it written down on a thing so fjord you're very acquainted with seamen then having been on the water for so long are there clusters of seamen around you at all times and i saunter away i mosy away (laughter) they have a vulnerability to poppyseed muffins jerking off (laughter) roll for spanking but they still said we couldn't leave does molly always smell of patchouli what else do you need i jumped on to the octopus and it served as some sort of a landing pad it killed the octopus but i lived i've tried i was very hungry buy some what incense i've been to one of these places it's called natural remedies herbs and medicinal things it's up the street a bit maybe or i could sneak in and grab it for you that sounds fun do sparrows see in the dark they're daytime birds we should do this quickly before the light goes away right no he can't see you but i will tell him later when he asks we're all sitting around in this room watching him watch tv essentially while this is going on can i whip out my little chemistry kit and start putting together some chemical stuff acid i'll start it then get in an hour of work we talking just one braid french braid one (laughter) sorry i didn't mean to i was-- it didn't go through the entire floor i don't think we'll move the nightstand over a little to cover it up no one will see i pour some water on it oh no i'm sorry i'm sorry caleb thank you we'll mop it up with some towels and whatnot while it's still iron no the coin was magic it was a magic pot that we sold you that is your power word sorry sorry would you like back the two copper pieces you gave me for the pot when we were investigating we were-- bad cop i was the bad cop you're not leaving here without telling us the truth i'm crazy i'll bite her too yeah it was crazy she confessed to being a little girl do they cut themselves like you we meted out the truth we cracked the case wide open toya unless and here's my new theory the big frog man can leech the life force from people what if toya is a fully-grown adult woman but he's been slowly leeching so much life from her that she's a small husk she's a tiny full-grown person oh she's just a dwarf oh okay that makes more sense actually when you say it that way it seemed like she was shrunken down from magic one of his tentacles not just tentacles dwarf tentacles let's go i think we know all we need to know that tracks that fully tracks let's go gesundheit on the way out can i grab some booze from the bar to fill up my platinum flask or to fill it up a little great i'll mark it down as am i i'll keep lookout oh yes here it is come on charis we're fine we went out the front door we're going out the front door does she have disadvantage on all checks for the next two days that's how i would rule it i'm real i'm with you i said that i would be on lookout duty so i'm just peering-- wait they went to the alley to go we'll go with right we're just going out in the open to the water i'm guiding him along nope yes caleb where are we headed boink you monster (laughter) i'm drinking tons of whiskey because i'm super scared to be on the water

three not three 15 still 15 use your d&d next to look at the information about that spell wait did you have two minis made for yourself ah wow crush that windpipe okay seeing where caleb has run-- if i move will that imp next to me get an attack okay well then i will turn to the imp next to me and i will slash at it with my shortsword two two plus six eight all right i will bonus action disengage
