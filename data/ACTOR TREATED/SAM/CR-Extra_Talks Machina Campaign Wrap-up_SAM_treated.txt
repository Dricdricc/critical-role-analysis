hi brian starts throwing up he charmed us with his handsome good looks you never forget your first (laughter) i wanted to stay the shits scotians daryl and hannah scotian yeah the scar also didn't you fall in love with some dude on the boat oh i didn't know that get to the good stuff forget the boat stuff brian get to the love stuff she's picking your nose good reality show you made it up yep way lower because some of us-- good vomiting hi guys i was late because he did crazy shit with it all the time and weren't you marking things off the gun at that point that's weird scanlan is not very perceptive not very wise so it took a long time to realize that something was wrong with it i think matt was there a roll associated did i ever insight it or something i did it was pretty apparent i sat next to taliesin for most of the campaign so i feel like i saw him more but i guess i didn't i did not think that he would be upset with me at all i thought i was doing him a big favor getting rid of the bad thing and he'd be like aw thanks scanlan no he hated that i just thought it was a good gun i did not know it had any of those things associated with it it's going to be so exciting nerve-wracking the first session is going to just be us-- yeah like why is travis talking like that (laughter) or just a sign that you live in new york for most of the year say that again i wasn't listening as is frequent with this show not try to get with her (laughter) i don't know probably would have run away from that information that's scary information and not seeing her in the flesh if he had just heard you got a daughter out there she's looking for you he'd probably be like let's go to another town i feel like that was part of the problem i knew all of that (laughter) we would have been like did we say something grog did you say something vax oh wait maybe grog pike can i ask you a question who was the guy you were in love with we are she's ignoring me another smaller box he was so squirrely and weird oh matt yessir what was in the letter that scanlan gave to pike i'll just read it to you let's see mm-hmm okay i figured this would come up (laughter) jesus this is good (laughter) but now as the sun sets on my life--i guess i was dying oh that's right okay good but now as the sun sets on my life i have discovered something new i have a daughter whose heart beats my blood and whose life is my own and she unlike her father can be good and right and one day worthy of your love which is why on my deathbed i leave her to you don't you see this whole time i thought i was chasing a lover but instead i have been chasing a mother for my child you pike trickfoot are the savior to kaylie that i could never be your wisdom and honor and goodness can give her the chance at redemption that i never had pike take my daughter as your own show her the light of sarenrae guide her to be a kind-hearted gnome teach her to be everything her father was not that way in death my-- oh man i'm going to cry (laughter) i haven't read that since i wrote it that's really good (laughter) no 70 yeah almost every session well there were some off-screen i assume this is so exciting for me it was the act of dying that pushed him over the edge he was not present for the revivify ritual so he does not know what happened in it not really he heard distant voices yeah sorry travis no it was the dying there was a long buildup to him leaving he had discovered his daughter it brought it front and center that he was a shithead for most of his life the gang didn't really listen to him that much he was doing stuff with drugs or trying to anyway then he had this terrible streak didn't he die twice in a row or get knocked out a bunch of times he didn't even have that any more he didn't have his mojo pike had said no it was a whole big bunch of stuff that was not going well for young shorthalt then to get knocked down again he can't even help his people in battle what use is he he's nothing he should have walked away and then they made fun of him when he woke up oh my god terrible oh yeah yeah but in the moment it seemed particularly bad she could've probably stopped me she's probably the only one who could've stopped me you helped you changed the trajectory of what i was going to do i was just going to go off and then little vexy said why don't you go spend some time with your daughter and i was like oh that's a good idea yeah we all know that when rich people get rich they stop they're like i'm good and they just are good people from then on no idea i assumed it would be a two or three episode dalliance and that everyone would grow tired of taryon and he would die probably he was pretty weak then i'd have to figure out a way to get scanlan back but turns out taryon was so dashingly charming that everyone fell in love with him instantly there was no finite plan for how to bring scanlan back right he went to go do his thing we discussed his goals so when he went back to ank'harel he went for revenge matt explained to me that he didn't just get revenge right away he had to lie in wait for those two guys who wronged him to come back into town eventually plot and figure out a way to destroy them in some way so he took their counterfeiter away from them and ruined their business shamed them created this meat man character to shame them and intimidate them in front of all the underworld and chased them out of town forever we had to roll for all this stuff too i had been sitting there waiting for them for months and months i guess i'll just stay it was a fun year furniture art pieces antiques fine art pieces did you boink the nymph were there any witnesses doesn't it warm your heart to know that tary knew and could give her the support she needed she was always in whitestone right i got out of there fast well i spent some time in the-- yeah so no never heard pike but scanlan did do a fair amount of praying to sarenrae while he was on his aramente yeah he was doing awesome stuff he was making money sure that was part of it he shot the gun once yeah i had 15 bullets he never had cause to shoot the gun the first time you think you want to marry someone you should definitely marry them i'm a loner doty there's still a chance guys to take him back she doesn't want her 75 gold he can't spell bigby's hand oh that's a spell that's right i am the healer of the group you can't even get that hunter's mark right that is the full name of the spell as i said in the previous segment it took some time to get his revenge those guys who wronged him did not live there they were traveling assholes he had to sit and wait as he sat and waited he got used to living there and got a little taste for the power the crime power taste of furniture it tastes like pleather brian when you write things ladies like it the food corn or she me too it was great awful also you're ugly in real life the question is-- i mean he can't reconcile i think he feels like it was a big opportunity lost and that he ultimately failed but probably as he gets to be in his older age and surrounded by people he loves that he realizes that it's okay to fail you don't have to succeed in everything to make a difference in people's' lives who you care about he'll just try to be a hero for his wife and his kid and that's it he still might use wish every once in a while to see if maybe he can get a message to or from old vax but i don't know if it ever works probably not also i think part of his maturing process over the whole campaign was learning it's okay not to be the center of attention it's okay not to be the best at everything it's okay to just do what you do if you do it for the right reasons for next time i come everyday because you feed me even taryon fell in love with that guy everybody loves percy and he's like the worst trying to kill trinket for the first time i always figured scanlan would tell their stories or whatever and he will and he'll try to and everything but i thought about this actually while we were playing for him anyway it was not the epic stories of glory and saving the world he would have liked just impressing his friends and healing them or inspiring them just the friendship that was his favorite moments from the epic journey i almost did it too well i will do the opposite in the next campaign
