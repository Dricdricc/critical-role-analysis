hi guys good to see you it's gilmore i love trinket (laughter) what if everyone dies except scanlan could i have my own show that's just me and you and a triceratops (laughter cheering) my character came about because i didn't know anything about dungeons & dragons and i asked liam what's the dumbest character and he said probably a bard i was like what's the weakest character he said i don't know like a gnome i went to dungeons & dragons name generator and that's how i found the name i totally half-assed it (laughter applause) well we were all going to just play once for his birthday and that was it so i was like eh i'll just be a dumb character and then it turns out i'm the best one (cheering laughter) that's right i can crap on beds that's an extra class feature he's the best he's taking notes then do you choose how many fingers they have (laughter) soon it will be less than three better think quick shines so brightly okay that was a good question someone's getting a t-shirt my arm is spaghetti i'm a young boy what are they audience (hums friends theme) is a healthy relationship no not at all he's so hot it's just pointing over there let's move it up quick dm off (laughter) audience puppet master you sir what's your question audience all women talk like this (valley girl accent) hi oh my god to watch on our own you mean audience well for myself i can barely even make the game that we play (laughter) i mean that was cool good question that's a lot of cursing what is he saying what translate i don't play dungeons and dragons i don't know what he's talking about (laughter) oh okay how would you ever do that yes sir audience a voice role audience i mean i have a terrible nasal voice i would love to have some of travis' sack you've got beer you ma'am audience oh wow (singing) you sir man with the beer audience the beer's really good what you do is you pick your middle name and the street you grew up on and your pet name and that's the name (smug clicking) percival de rolo de momo next question please yeah this is the best panel ever hey also don't write poop into your backstory because people send me poop all the time if portland thinks so who am i to argue with that trinket is just an unstoppable force of power grace-- when he-- when he saves me i will respect him no one three and i've killed at least that many listen trinket is great yeah i would do that i'm just saying that a ferret or even a goldfish i can always do that and i never will (laughter) i was in les miserables as a child i played gavroche you know in broadway (laughter) and they were like there's a barricade were you protesting and i was like i mean i guess so they thought i was the youngest civil rights protester ever i wish that's pretty good oh wow a marauder you sir audience i know (sings) bigby's hand (applause) i mean-- audience collectively we are heroic individually i don't think-- scanlan thinks of himself as a god that doesn't really need to prove anything he's just in it for the lols for the most part but i think collectively we've done some good things we've saved civilization we've rescued people and we've killed old people which is always a good thing for society (laughter) i will tell you this though scanlan is a bit of an existentialist and for a specific reason thinks or has thought up to now that life is sort of pointless two more questions maybe dean is your next npc but he also allows us to go on our little individual journeys when we need to that's the hardest thing to do in improv is to both be in the scene and know when the scene is over that's super hard what we're saying is you should sit down now audience gross this was a fun panel matt you did great moderating i'm drunk
