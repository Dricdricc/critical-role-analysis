i got a shofar i'm still saying we should rename the show crate-ical role for this month i'm just saying guys you could watch us open stuff all night yeah scanlan got some great letters from the fans and he replied with some award-winning advice so check that out tomorrow on geekandsundrycom you also might hear me try to heal you a couple times i wouldn't call that person a fan necessarily i'm sorry i wrote that before we go i have to inspire everyone with this (laughter) and look ashley's like somewhere i can't even see no i made this myself because i wanted you all to know how passionate i was about tonight mm tastes like strawberries and sweat no my pants are just jeans all the way baby yeah i just penciled it in 21 however for the second slash i'm going to use cutting words to reduce the damage i step forward closer to him and i use cutting words and i shout oi kevdak i have a message from the people of westruun and i moon him (laughter) ten right pff one yes it is okay from my crouched butt-out position whilst holding my hand cone of clarity it's shoved up there before i make this attack when i scanned around did i see any of his allies without any weapons or carrying a staff or something like that but they're surprised anyway okay okay well then i will cast hold person at level three on kevdak yes at level three so i get to target one other individual and i would target the beardy guy with the staff wisdom saving throw with disadvantage because of cutting words no he's just paralyzed you can have at him and can i still move and do other things okay wait i still get my move right okay is there any cover are there chimneys is there anything i can duck behind and still maintain sight oh wait no i'd be more than 60 feet away okay then i'll duck back behind some cover and as my bonus i still get a bonus i will inspire grog and i'll say grog now it's your turn to fuck shit up (laughter) yeah that's it round globes of victory i love it okay do your thing do your thing holding your turn loses your bonus action yes lots of rules tonight guys upper-level rules this is like 127 hours except with a gun except she's not attacking him yeah pike a beartrap multiply by two oh my god hey that's good they're coming for you pike you got a reaction or something yeah you're dead do you have a reaction of some sort do you have a reaction oh my god she's going to die love of my life she knows what her reactions are you do have one oh my god you do have inspiration yeah oh c'mon groggy you got to make a save to get outta the way with inspiration they're raging they're raging go back and look at the videotape this board is incredible six more attacks everybody's rolling high tonight except us gloves of missile snaring 20 (yelling) i mean my spell dc's 18 but with the hand cone of clarity okay just making sure okay i while maintaining concentration i can still use the wand to do things yeah so i'll use three charges of the wand of fireballs i'm aiming a fireball right around there oh yes i guess i have to move forward to attack can i get a radius that includes kevdak and these guys over here but not pike and hopefully not grog if my aim is true okay okay three charges is 10d6 34 dc's 15 i wrote it down dc 15 there's flaming spikes on the field i'm going to try to do the pike move and jump down one level oh jesus okay okay 14-- 19 okay and i will with the bonus i will heal grog with a healing word oh 60 feet for healing word i believe right okay well then i will heal pike is that okay okay i'll do that i'll peek over the side and say (singing) never going to fuck you up never going to let you down never going to run around and not heal you (laughter) yeah seven points does another smaller doll hand come out to replace it dullshooter jump down the chimney deliver presents help pike door isn't this exciting we're fighting a horde of goliaths she's doing math give her a second (nerdy voice) oh the weapon's within five feet wow wow is it that thing where you die you still alive there you know what fuck it i'll counterspell that it's not concentration right counterspell so what do i do just a d20 17 it's dispelled oh shoot the benches we're sitting on are covered in so much ass sweat right now who dat who's up there what's going on right there hey wait well that's where i am i don't want him to come

that roll and add two or oh 19 19 yep 17 this has been a long fight guys hit hit yeah 20 six with his beak because he moves does pike get an attack of opportunity pike how you doing kevdak or pike they are i don't care about them i just care about kevdak all right i don't think i'll be able to do a fireball without hitting either kiki or that innocent all right i'll do the same thing then shit yep the wand of fireballs again i have seven charges i've used three i'll use three more yes kevdak is the center square would it hit that innocent okay angle it a little over towards kiki so it doesn't hit the innocent oh would it hit vax that way okay i'll kill the innocent i'll kill the innocent i said it already it's too late okay yes do i just roll 10d8 six six yes 42 ten he made his save (belches) pardon me ah jesus these guys are unkillable hey we killed something guys even though i can't see her-- sorry even though i can't see her i'm so connected to her can i try to heal pike

tea-time does he have an actual name or is that just his name oh great i swoop him down do you want to be on the ground or just above it on the ground but i release him and i make a fist that clenches right next to him just in case anything goes bad we're going to have to get these dice calibrated later oh you got it i point bigby's hand like he was too (laughter) i mean we have a busy day tomorrow
