we're releasing a special 50th episode wallpaper all for you guys to use on your home pcs download it it's our special episode i thought everyone was dressing up you all look like shit where are all the other places they could wear it with a goat it's this content that you've demanded (laughter) posters what's a poster you've already offended an entire continent it's amazing we're in a comic book we did it some pictures have been but not all of it those seem really remarkable liam is there anything any bigger yeah pike are you alive he only healed a couple of us oh shit now it's going to steal his strength don't we have our cold pack of food love me some chicken wow he's a big eater that was a lot that was a whole boar if we're rested are we going to set off again be honest he's exhausted what is it (yells) yeah yeah yeah heal heal heal don't-- don't break it his soul could be inside of it i touched the sword it spoke to me it craves strength from other beings don't break it you could try to do greater restoration on the sword to see if that would somehow free the soul from it or-- the sphinx-- yeah we could go to the sphinx learned can i inspire her okay i just hold her hand and i look in her eyes and i just say please pike please please i love him as much as you do please have i already aided by inspiring pike but i can't help again the sword seems to want power and strength i don't know if it will help but maybe if we gave grog some extra strength it might help him to come back so i have a potion of fire giant strength he has no abilities now though so i'm going to pour this potion of fire giant strength into his gullet hope it gives him some sort of strength okay 18 because it's not good strength check he's got 25 strength now he's going to crush my neck (gasps) nothing gave you some ale nope i'm not sure i'll do a perception check to see if it's-- 17 oh my god where's your sword grog yeah exactly yeah yeah he let him have it grog listen when i experienced the sword it was pretty cool and it is a powerful powerful weapon but after seeing what it's just done to you i don't think you can have it man we it was you pike i've touched it before and it was fine i can touch it again it sounded evil and also awesomely powerful i didn't know what it was and i wasn't alone in this i had asked pike to weigh in and she was thinking about it doing more research vax i assume you have secrets you haven't told us the weird part is it's not in his crotch area and that's only for a minute does dm does suggestion last forever or just for a little amount of time you can banish something forever what else lives there we could throw it in the sphere vecna would get it right something tells me you won't be wielding it i'm going to inspire her again i'm going to sing a very romantic ballad (sings) oh my little pretty one my little pretty one pike the gnome-a oh you make my nipples hum my nipples hum oh you make my nipples hum pike the gnome-a (laughter) i know you also have inspiration if you need it wait it's not at night it's the middle of the day shouldn't we start walking marisha and i just think we should make headway if we're going to be traveling all day grog do you even have any weapons anymore i could lend you my whip if you'd like she already has plate armor well i think you just cured grog saved his life and got rid of a soul-eating sword so you're pretty strong you killed the sword and saved grog's life so i think you're pretty strong you guys can sleep wherever you want i'll be sleeping in my bed yeah we do have it oh do we know are we aware that we went under that effect i mean we just feel different or how do-- you can do multiples wait are we in the mansion or are we-- chicken and eggs everyone nope just eggs what's a waffle sounds great i spent some of the morning just with a little piece of parchment paper and a pen just writing out something we walk is that what we do what is this walking thing it's terrible i mean will that burn something let's just walk then someone just failed it pike 11 did your brother make it back safely don't go too hard on him he was being held up by a rope and tortured by a bunch of monsters do we need to check in with drez no we know what he wants we have his hunk of quall heal her to westruun and what is our mission how do we do that you know your people might not be the brightest but they're not going to send everybody out to meet these orcs i could make you look like an orc or something no no no just to rough up the guy that we send back in to tell them about the orcs yeah yeah make a show of it a bit i love a good stage show i will grant you cock lightning if he could unattune to one we can put him in the hat of disguise and so the object of this would be to stall to enthrall to captivate them as long as you can keep talking to them not engage in fights for as long as possible while we-- yeah but is kevdak going to engage in a fight with a magical grog that's not a fair fight is it and when they discover and they surely will that you are not magical and that your friends are aiding you will that bring you great shame i don't know about wanting to look cool it just comes naturally so you do intend to engage in a fight because otherwise i would say i can go in just sort of looking like you and draw their attention and then bamf outta there or run away and draw them with me it gets them to follow me it still doesn't solve one question i love you but can you beat kevdak without magic and friends that means good come on pikey 20 16 can we go to that place can we sneak there can vax sneak there what was the man's name who we killed no no no the goliath vax can you go get horace's head also i assume they tortured him before they killed him can you talk to the dead not really not really why don't we just burn the whole field they won't know if there's a body in there or not we could let's do it i think we can all ask can he describe the one who did it hi sorry the ones who did you in other than large and pale were there any distinguishing marks or names thrown about this was who go ahead we can wait another day how many more questions no we get five what would you like us to tell your daughter well listen if you want a fight we could still use one of their heads we could find one of those patrolmen walking around grab him take his head taliesin and grog just before tomorrow and stuff kevdak his son is-- zanror sure sure standard spelling what about anyone else i need to know about who you were familiar with or had a relationship with all right so we're still resting right so i'm going to knock on pike's door (knocking sound) (whispers) i can still get in hello did you get your robe and everything and your slippers the monogram and the scented candles great great if you need anything there's two bells next to your bed there's one to call servants and there's one for me the purple one is mine great listen there's been a lot of death recently and well just i might die and stuff so ah just don't read this until i do that's all i hope so too that's all have a good night bye you know what i love her anyway (laughter) it's all dick pics (laughter) move on move in oh for them to move on want to go in want me to guard the door she's going to go take a shit no she doesn't you want me to go in draw out as many as i can but wait no first we have to prepare a trap don't we isn't there a trap to be prepared you need to be inside the city gates as well while i'm in you can build the trench go in and what hmm that would be harder yeah that would be harder to do to pull off you're big you're pretty big if someone else set me on literal fire i could but i wouldn't-- spitballing spitballing i was going to make myself look like you but a dead version of you a zombified grog (grog voice) right so right so i'm ugh i'm so dead no no i just have to warm up ah mimimimi right right rrrr cor all right then i've been dead for about five six years wait can't you just shape earth without affecting the surface of it i mean can't you just shape the underneath of it no one will even see it being moved we have a bear so wait is there a gate to the city (laughs) what the hell's going on there tonight i don't know what grog's dad looks like of course how could i forget (laughter) what was your dad's name that's a terrible name okay but wait i've got to bring them out of a specific gate where there's going to be a trap and if you go in and rescue any other civilians you have to bring them out through a different gate that doesn't have a trap at it okay all right i'm ready to do this except for a few holes in our plan i don't run very fast (laughter) i can't move myself though i couldn't just i would be the dread pirate roberts but if i am polymorphed as a goliath would i gain their-- all their abilities and-- intelligence it can't be a man he's not a beast that guy oh well i don't have that oh i have the hat but it doesn't make me grow does it well backup plan i can go in as dead reginald they killed him they just killed him kevdak's son killed him kevdak's son knows who he is sure he does they just killed him two days ago i can i remember all of them because i barely kill anybody my illusions are small in size i mean i could just go in as hey i'm mr scanlan come chase after me are they going to chase after a triceratops though i can make an image of that i can do that i can make the head move i wouldn't need to be the head i mean i can't make my body look like a head i can make the illusion of a head talking wizard of oz-style it would be within 60 feet of me i think minor illusion i guess i know because he has minor illusion as well i could also do-- these goliaths they don't like wyverns i could be a wyvern it's not a beast apparently a wyvern is a beast huh i cannot be a wyvern yeah how are you going to be the bait yes i can do that too and i can escape you can't i mean i can try might be shit how are you going to hide that's why you're going to send pike with me no i'm just kidding i would never that would make me feel quite nice and we know westruun and i know how
