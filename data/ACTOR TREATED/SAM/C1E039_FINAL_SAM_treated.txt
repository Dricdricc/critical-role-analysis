be able to see him right it works okay so i'm going to do sicken i will inspire vex with a limerick i once knew a bear named trinket and would often tell you he stink-et but you were appalled so you kicked me in the balls and now i don't say it i just think it (laughter) i feel bad for this thing second attack cubes really oh but you know what i have really good dexterity he's only rolling a d2 he's rolling a d2 i'm not within 30 feet oh my god the worms have turned us all into clouds it was so good not all short people look alike that would have been great (laughter) well dispel your own

yours why am i doing yours 28 is what it rolled total oh fuck even if i rolled a ten i couldn't do anything i rolled a three i'm great at those dexterity saving throw yeah yeah yeah sure sure that's a five tell me this dungeon master earlier when i had done my eyebite thing i had my cone up here when he grabbed me was the cone still close to my mouth okay concentration check concentration i've never rolled for concentration oh wait i have advantage on spell concentration well that wasn't good either so one was a five and one was a ten do i add anything to that constitution so 12 okay great i don't want be in here anymore can i look around it's dark it seems cozy seems nicer than outside right now actually i dip my finger in the acid ooo it's not good so i'm going to make him barf me up

could have hit me it's okay don't worry she doesn't even know-- hey nice job pike that halved wait doesn't my worm take it too still alive can i juggle while i'm a mist don't do this don't do this what were you going to say matt this is a reverse ad for fight club five if you want to you can dimension door i keep forgetting that i'm in a nice womb aren't i immune to acid damage because of the feast isn't that the same thing concentration check yeah yeah i'm okay 18 and 19 it's going down so it has poison right it's poisoned me-- oh it has acid can i make an intelligence check to see if i know anything about these creatures is that my action no it's specifically what i'm trying to remember from my encounters in the past is if it has any resistance to poison damage what am i doing intelligence 16 16 but it does use poison oh gotcha okay so it probably does have poison resistance okay well i'm in a tunnel right he disappeared down-- well i don't know anything okay all right i can feel him moving so i don't know where i am anymore so i don't want to dimension door out because i don't know where i'd end up so instead i will cast stinking cloud inside-- no no no no no no cancel belay that order shit because i think he's immune to poison so i'm not going to do that i'm going to-- fuck there's nothing i can do (strained) i'm like this right now i can't do anything i am my left foot yeah i can't reach a wand i don't want to get rid of-- but i don't know where i'd end up so even if i've moved since i saw it last i can still dimension door to where i think-- okay then i will do that i will do that i want to appear where vex was before goo goo all over me ew oh and then i see-- i've seen the other worm before right and i get my bearings and i can see pike i can see trinket so i will shake it off i will inspire keyleth and say (singing) i only want to see you slicing up that purple worm ooh okay that's good hey man whatever necrotic damage best kind even with its disadvantage lot of things going on in matt mercer's head right now killed vax ah me oh hello hello (laughs) i will kill it with fire well let's see can i see vax over there in the worm juice then i'll kill it with fire i will use my wand of fireballs to blast balls at it my balls of fire and i won't hit key will i oh it's that radius forget it i'll just do lightning bolt instead so i take two steps to my right so no one else is in the line and i will lightning it instead 8d6 yeah 31 (whimpers) do i still have any movement i'm going to try to shuffle back into the tunnel there a little bit and for my bonus i'll healing word myself okay what is that d4 great yeah six points awesome so you mean trinket is doing what trinket always-- who you talking to grog sorry these are probably the only ones it's a male and a female yeah they were married they're a married couple they hate each other i'm here what oh you mean i'm going to get the gold i don't have a bag of holding i weigh 14 pounds i can't hold that much gold gold is heavy yes we want fucking gold wait isn't there gold all over the place i'll assist grog grog open the bag (singing) bigby's hand will grab the gold (laughter) who me nature check are your hands dripping with blood right now it could be an unrelated seismic event i smack myself with bigby's hand technically he's not an honorable man but we should be it's their nature we were checking it out to see if it was safe should we report this to the officials and try to quarantine the house destroy it something just destroy the portal destroy the teleportation circle take the gold or the house travis and what does pike think about that don't condescend to pike because we're better than that let's count our money first before we make that decision but i'm mainly concerned what pike feels about taking control of this evil evil house it's got an evil mysterious gem-eye looking at us right now all right if in claiming it we can get someone some sort of religious person in here to clear it for us making sure that it's-- pike would be an option we're leasing with an option to buy take the skull oh shit the whispers if you haven't read the comics check it out on geekandsundrycom and don't forget if someone's whispering in your ear it's probably the sound of your conscience saying go buy a t-shirt guys this is the rest of the show whose evil that voice is usually me kiss him on the mouth (laughter) what put it in the bag of holding laura and yeah that might look a little weird well that's creepy can we take it to someone who do we know not gilmore this is beyond-- if only we had some way to magically transport to whitestone yes we do could you go yes you we could send pike with it wait we're going to sleep with this skull in our house you didn't turn me into a cloud you by yourself all right oh we'll leave the skull with uriel after you've been corrupted by it we'll leave the skull in this house-- wait that part's true who told you that oh in addition to the wish oh it's like a genie oh this is weird we need some help on this no it will hypnotize us and corrupt us we'll go on a quick pub crawl before we all part ways can we do a quick accounting of the gold all right fair enough yes actually while you were gone-- and i cast friends on him while you were gone other guards came by and said we were clear to go in natural 20 we're here to report a security concern of the utmost importance and urgency to you are we among friends here and free to talk in front of everyone we've been alerted to some evil afoot in your kingdom yet again the former krieg's homestead has been vacant for a while and apparently has a portal to an evil realm inside we went to investigate acting on a tip from-- yes our informant told us as much we don't want to give his name it's extremely magically dangerous they should not set foot inside the place at all will you notify us when she returns is there anything else just real quick before we leave i'm sorry i think i had a burrito can i just use a facility inside a restroom or something thank you just wait out of earshot they closed the doors i've been in the throne room before do you have eyes on them all right give me ten minutes i sit down on the wc no i don't instead i polymorph into a fly and i'm going to fly my way to the throne room of the throne room the doors are closed yes is there any gap at all okay i'm going to crawl in there dexterity oh no someone's got a fly swatter ten that one's full the one that i tried to go into it's full and it needs a big cleaning i thought there was another one this way not through there or anything all right carry on then you should send someone up to service it though right away it's a matter of security okay two lefts and a right and i'm out thank you shat all over my plans let's go home i guess the drummer did they say why for a performance all right good to know thanks zed i'd like to very much but i don't know how we can't just barge in there and break someone out of jail we're known people it's customs not sheriff yeah but they could make the problem worse she's quite special to me i think we should-- i think i should go and try to get her out not not in that way (laughter) i'm not interested in her in that way things have changed she's a good person and she deserves much better than the likes of me-- it's a rather large cube but listen all right she's-- she's-- we're related we're related and i don't just mean-- she's a shorthalt like a baby like a baby shorthalt (high-pitched 'hee' sound) listen don't spread the word around i don't want my cred to be ruined but she's my little girl i didn't know this this is new information i'm still just adjusting to it no i didn't no i did not i did not try and sleep with her i think deep down inside some part of me knew which is why i gave her all that gold i think no oh grog please (laughter) i mean i always knew that was a possibility in the trade i deal in all right easy listen drummer-- you can be replaced easily when i played with them we had seven drummers in two years and i killed two of them (laughter) no just stay and shut up yes i don't quite know how to act or behave now and i'm going through a crisis of conscience and identity i'm sorry i'm off my game right now but she's related to me i don't know okay all right i'm not good with this stuff i haven't done this before all right i haven't really had family for much of my life and this is a new thing and it's going to take me some time to adjust and figure out what this means for me all right i've defined most of my life by the people i've slept with and now this a new part of me that i have to figure out i would like to but i'll need some help probably i don't know if we can all go barge in there (laughs) thanks vex trinket i'm okay for right now but maybe you can help best by staying here and looking after the drummer here and making sure i know it's late in the day but i wouldn't mind going right away does anyone want to join me probably just a smaller party don't we have business to attend to here gold to count and-- well to get out of a stockade
