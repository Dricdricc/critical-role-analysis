it's stan lee that's gilbert gottfried spoiler taking five so we found out that there's a ritual happening soon and there's no day or night here so who cares right we have to make our way to the big tower right super fast and invisibly oh we're also vampire creatures we look like miscellaneous vampirey things right what the censer it protects you from ghouley deads so why don't we just walk through the center of town in the middle of the road with the censer and walk into the tower no maybe fly up to the top of the tower teleport somewhere she does or we can be smoky mist but we're making our way to the tower let's be all full though we can be full yeah let's be full oh god someone in a robe 33 what's our ploy if this thing tries to kill us okay wow this thing works what's going on good one you can do that you put the ass in astute oh god in our direction but quick but also moving like zombies can we see outside at all is there a peephole or anything i'm going to go over there oh don't do anything i was going to try to make a little diversion to draw them away from the door i'll do that i'll do my thing i'm going to look through the little sliver and i'm going to cast-- i'm going to cast major image and make a small little human girl in the middle of the street crying bleeding from the arm she looks disoriented and she's walking towards the other building that we spotted very sad and (whimpering) okay she's going to run she's going to book it into that other building to try to get away as fast as she can and she can move super fast since she's not real she's like the fucking flash 120 feet is all i can move her let's get out of here well she died she got her equity card can we leave anything behind like a dead body or something for them to eat he's got a ton of them in there me too we needed above a 40 oh look it up it's a real thing wow too classy for us let's keep going yeah just go through the hole i mean we've got a guy who crushes rocks all the time yeah it's just a hole in the wall you sound different why are you using weird words let's go we didn't heal ourselves let's get through the wall and then we'll heal we're slow hurrying am i rolling too since i'm half-out but i mean am i watching this i'm going to roll okay two for me i'll yell to the rest it's got keyleth i'll cast dominate monster on it i guess well i was probably not fast enough to pull up my horn so 20 i could have just done that this whole time all right please deposit her on the other side over the wall i don't speak gloom only 59 more minutes does he keep rerolling for breaking or is that it all right first things first please go tell your fellow gloomy friends that the hunt is off no more flesh down here and come back it's good to be back okay we'll need a name for him obviously so anybody got any ideas benjamin is great that's way better (laughing) well some of us can right by looking at him how much can he carry or she okay well so no more healing but we could fly right up there and break that thing like an hour or something some of us could get on mr mistoffelees and fly around the tower and see if there's a window that we could bust in or something yeah but we'll be on a thing so maybe we won't be very conspicuous it's just a pulsing orb of doom isn't it one of us needs to see what's up there he's dumb what if comes back and he's like 'i don't know' can't one of us go up there with him to scout it out yeah if someone's invisible can't you all be invisible just me not while i'm concentrating on mr mistoffelees (laughter) we need to get into the tower we don't even know how to do that nope i'll tell mr mistoffelees to do a 90-second loop and come back down and check in on us because he can't fit in the door right fly around 90 seconds and swoop back down maybe he doesn't know 15 minutes no that was once for 15 minutes they're about to invade i mean sure what wait what no that's terrible nothing we've got to hurry did they tell you to gather weapons no he's joining the fight no want to jump on and do a scouting pass we can't risk it wouldn't you hate to miss it by 15 minutes this guy was about to leave his house to go walk over there for the final part of the ritual me and vax but do it with a flair (laughter) i mean yeah we're going to go as fast as we can let's go mr mistoffelees yes we do we'll need to spoon for warmth i gladly accept 21 he's fine natural one i'm under his body (quietly) how does he do that how did you do that what do we do is that the end of the ritual enough to get back to our friends probably should we attack now just the two of us we could between you and me we're the most powerful ones in the group i know but will you at least confirm that yes we are the most powerful all right hold me tight mr mistoffeles back down everybody i want you to explain every roll fly away really it's going to forget halfway there fly away just fly away it seems they've completed at least some part of the ritual should we go straight up the tower yeah all right but we're going to fight an aerial battle against super-magical things maybe yeah so it's not even going to be a tough fight we'll just take down three people and be done right it'll be less than three is that true that's a good idea if you can really do it no we either have to fly up to the top or bring it down to us right it feels like it's a 32 earthquake we need a 62 earthquake when last time we fought delilah were any of us scared of her well if someone's going to stay out of the feast it should be the guy who already has advantage on everything i'm against the feast i think we should just run in also i'm vegan i don't know if i could eat everything at the feast gofibepo why didn't you just name it a poobah platter is that a raise or not wait so are we four i can yes something like it (gasping) that's not going to work you said 50 points of damage i mean just from a metagaming scenario that's not even-- that can't even hurt-- so you get ten 50s so that's 1000 points over a minute that's better than i thought although we don't-- keyleth you said that there's no other undead around here right maybe we shouldn't look like undead then i don't think i can shift it no you can't that's a one-time thing we've got the one from the guy whose head we just crushed me and pike she could be on my shoulders and we could share one cloak oh it absolutely should (laughter) to make it look like our arms can reach the ends of the cloak-- are they sleeved cloaks i'm going to hold a flute and my sword (laughing) all right we go i'm so excited to be here 24 so awkward we've still got to attack it's okay we can still kill everybody let's go let's move let's attack are we within 500 feet to the end is it falling towards us i mean it wasn't bad let's go oh i mean it's landing right do we have an escape plan sure does we have to fly to get up to it i need a ride as well do you want me to be a beholder or a dragon wait and see figured i should do it now it's instantaneous but he could counterspell it unless i do it now no i think i'm going to just go ahead and be a beholder and fly in there myself we'll probably all die matthew mercer may i borrow your monster manual so i know what i am yeah it doesn't say what his initiative is okay all right 11 11 shit i'm gonna lose my fucking 9th-level spell neither have luck i'm a beholder are you sure about that this is true polymorph i am this creature except it's not because i'm about to not be anymore 18 even with advantage oh fuck is pike out he's a god he's a golden god my anti-magic cone is not in effect i assume (laughs) just frozen there i really want to swallow and i can't close-- well you have to choose at the start of each turn-- i haven't had a turn we got this guys how many of us are still able to move hey okay pike's going to solve everything yeah she can get us out of this oh no lair action she explodes (laughter) no forget them fix us forget them they're nothing fix us fix us they're tiny fix us some sort of-- i don't know can you restore restoration 18 i will never be able to break it yeah there's no way that's rough stuff i don't think-- i don't know what's a legendary resistance this doesn't i added wrong wait wait stop everything i added wrong my saving throw was a 23 oh so what did i just get hit with 70 points or something awesome do that a lot plus anything oh boy nope i can't move my eyes or anything or turn on my anti-magic oh my spell i get advantage as a gnome 70 points okay as a wisdom constitution saving throw oh i'm no longer paralyzed no but i'm a different guy hey guys okay do i get advantage because of magic and can i inspire myself all right i will inspire myself 24 just move i can't act right i can move now or just in general what does that mean what does confused mean that's actually good he'll lose the paralysis because he'll be in a coma we'll just wake you back up and you'll be fine it's actually kind of good i'll kill you last what is that thing in the middle of the field oh well that's different he meant metaphorical he meant death perma-death maybe we should leave is this delilah i thought she was confused wait what what's happening with foresight oh because you're paralyzed oh fuck i'm too far to do anything right it has to be within 60 feet can i retroactively counterspell (laughs) i think i have to roll for this no charisma modifier it's just an 11 i can't add anything else laura taliesin and not on a reaction i don't think doesn't feel good what's that mean (nervous laughter) it's cocked it would have been 11 four matt is a gentle god oh hey you know what the problem is with your face i can see it (laughter) ghostly claws you've been banished to another dimension you can punch your way out of it again this is the same round right can i try-- great laura she can't reach you i can bring you to her i don't know you have to touch her if we don't die in those two turns yes i'm going to be a total dick and not do that no we're next to each other well they can go whenever they want oh it's my turn where's percy wait it's still working there's a creature inside of her you're fine you're good it's the last thing that was a long turn you did good okay i grab pikey-poo and dimension door straight to vex's beautiful dead body i will inspire pike i don't know if that helps whatever ritual you're about to do but maybe travis and with inspiration i'm using any movement i have to pick up the dust of my fallen friend if there is any dust pick up whatever i can (fake sneeze) oh no i'm done that's all i can do i don't know if you can do a bonus action she's fine i'm already rolling vax yeah tuck it behind my ear for later yeah but it's going to take another turn no taryon's on the floor weeping holding his necklace liam can be taryon now (laughs) no it's an established character we already have artwork for why let it go to waste he's done prissy boys before i will 6th-level counterspell (cheering) i will sing at him (singing) counterspell baby don't hurt me don't hurt me no more counterspell i can add things to it right you're still inspired d12 on top of that at everything it wasn't my best performance maybe one of them is our friend mr mistoffelees he doesn't know and you have to not be wind oh yeah that sounds bad i used it already oh yeah that hits i think i'm not attuned-- yeah against magic that's better 17 disadvantage on all attack rolls you're alive okay it's something 28 as much as i can carry 30 those boots are gone is this a new round since my last counterspell that's what i say to myself every morning wait did you just cure our wounds you can do it to one person oh no dexterity he's trying to hurt our pikey it never got her to zero i will lightning bolt at level four the armor knight guy he's behind me so i'll do it from my ass (laughter) i'll lift up my leg a little bit squeeze it out it's 8d6 but at level four it's 9d6 i think 35 i'll use my movement to gather whatever bits of vax i can still see and get into posish i will bonus action healing word pikey-poo which is for me-- what is healing word it's 2d4 plus six ten i do but i want to save it do people have to be alive to get out of here yep 7th-level counterspell against him (laughter) let's go sure i will say to him this time-- i've got nothing left i will sing to him (singing) i'm beautiful i'm beautiful it's true you saw my face in a crowded place and you didn't know what to do because i just took a shit on you oh god have i been there wait was that me yes okay can you without a body without a body which you've already done they're hard to use we've got to learn to use them better wow i'm shaking
