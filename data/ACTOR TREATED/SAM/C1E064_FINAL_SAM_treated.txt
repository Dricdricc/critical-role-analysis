(laughter) oh i'm wearing a loot crate t-shirt right now it fits it makes me look strong and handsome sure i did really good wait a second pilot chair what did we do to deserve that would this be magic matt if it's not magic then i have an 11 you gave vex'ahlia a title in your whitestone kingdom she was the duchess of some hut did he write something down the binder that vex carries is much much better wait i think i can help i'm going to cast modify memory on percy i can help you remember percy just look into my eyes look into my eyes (laughter) with the cone i want this to work level seven i can change any memory ah what was it called what was your title called there's nothing on this piece of paper (laughter) jesus christ baroness of what whitestone and grand mistress of the grey hunt oh my god when did we leave how many days has it been i can only modify ten minutes of time so i can't build the whole story up all right all right i don't know i'm going to make him remember that we landed in the feywild together as a group it was a beautiful field filled with naked nymphs and fey creatures that all came to him and gave him a wonderful full-body massage vex saw him and he did not want anyone to know about this moment that he had so in a fit of panic he gave her something anything a title a title to make her keep her confidence the title was lady vex'ahlia the baroness of the third house of whitestone and grand mistress of the gray hut (laughter) she agreed to keep his secret and he had a wonderful time before his memory fades to be honest my memory is foggy as well pike was there i don't know it's a bit foggy but a few days we're in whitestone all right let's go you fought bravely and often you wielded your weapon strongly and proudly and had many definite physical encounters and were never frozen and showed your power and defended us to the best of your ability okay good 17 (laughter) you were great that's true oh that's right a little statue of a dog that might be magical an onyx statue of a dog i've seen it i can reach in there doesn't know what onyx is he's picturing-- so wait it's insta-dog and then what does it do can it fight and what happens if it gets killed what's your intelligence oh my goodness oh it's a talking dog it can see invisibility i like this dog but we need to know the magic word oh we know the word already can you teach us how to say that in elvish vo'el'el'ena vo'el'la'la'la let's get the dog out here why did you taste the wind what happened to you wyvern guard eastward maybe not we'll find another way to alert them send out the dog i don't know nine maybe they can't get through this where are we telling people to go that can hold 30 40 people okay under the castle yeah do you remember the feywild okay just making sure pike stats that was not fun i'm sorry i'm sorry you didn't get to kill anything i'm sorry oh you did you did you killed the one thing okay good lesson learned maybe well actually i don't know i don't know greater restoration kills modify memory and that i did it fuck don't thank us thank shaun gilmore intelligence of six i hope you know that i was only trying to improve your life with a wonderful happy memory and it was mostly true don't go too high we don't know where the thing is no absolutely not (high-pitched) why would you bring attention to us it can't fly for infinity so this was not the group that had set off from emon here here's the map we're up here this is the group that was coming from emon these guys came from somewhere over here where's draconia if this is the united states we're in maine emon is la wait there's other objects that we haven't-- one werewolf has vowed allegiance to us yes your former pals yes there's a candle-maker who might help out i would put him in the strong maybe category as well but when the dragon came here just now they saw nothing correct is there a way that we can spread false rumors that the city of whitestone has been magically moved to another plane or something some way of getting that word to draconia or i don't-- oh you're right the white one is a hunter it's primal hates others you're right so the white one's like predator wait a second you just said no one knew we were here none of them knew we were here they just attacked here and we just got back here because gilmore was scrying on them got it not because we have a leak i'm going to blame shaun sorry (chuckles) they do we know this who was there and lived besides us ooh that was a luck seeker asum oh well i've got some of the great swag that you can get in a loot crate why this shirt came in one last week you go to lootcratecom/criticalrole to see your selection and then if you sign up you get three dollars off the first month which is a really good deal i'm talking to seeker asum he's a big fanboy this booze is okay but grog i could really use the finest wine i've ever had good idea we don't weigh very much it's not in draconia it's in the plane of fire correct where's ank'harel where you grew up gilmore you're marquatian what about the endless maze of the abyss that's another place that we're supposed to go i've got a map it's like the pacific ocean no draconia's across the atlantic ocean in france whisper the blade how do we do that are we guerrillas i'm not going to volunteer myself as a slave to the dragon i'm considering it does the barrier block sound and visuals and is there any way that we can help you make this barrier more permanent and stronger we're going inside it in the room where it happens we'll just have to seeker asum that it happened (laughter) airship airship airship wait to go to where marquet hold on before we decide that marquet is the thing so we know where to find him to kill him we've killed dragons before i like grog's idea is there a way to explore that any further yes seeker asum is great but we're the best in the business i wouldn't leave our plan a to someone not us have you been to draconia if there's any trees left grog is the best thinker we can probably plan a ruse white dragon loves the thrill of the hunt i've seen the green dragon raishan how big i understand i could do that i could do something pretty close to that are you tony robbins (laughter) at dawn raishan is the green here's the problem with goading vorugal the white to find and kill raishan the green no one knows where raishan the green is including vorugal because raishan's the shapeshifter and no one knows where she is including gilmore who's been scrying for a week to try to find her why did he shatter them he was pissed at the other dragons maybe what's the idea we know what pushes their buttons we can throw up some statues and cause some havoc but if they have these orbs that communicate with each other then the white can call thordak and say hey what's up with these statues and thordak can say no it's not me we'll make t-shirts that say team vorugal but we know that thordak is a total asshole-- sorry (laughter) between what and what it's between what and who is this tal'dorei so marquet is japan got it is this world round can we go the other way can't go the other way but we could bamf there right now and what would our mission be wait what about instead of dumping statues we find these orbs we find his lair we find his orbs and we call thordak and we do a voice like yo thordak you're a dickhead i'm going to come kill you or we just smash them they don't know we're here that's true we have to rest you have the best ideas lay it on me tomorrow and we'll look like us except vaguely like lizard people first of all the lizard army is that different from wyverns so they're just scaly creepers i can do that no but i'll see them when we get there we could be lizard people for sure (singing) we could be lizard people he wants to go to marquet to find some cloak that may or may not help us in a week that's it if we go what is our mission we can get 13 people out that's it we had a group of 50 goliaths and they were all killed instantly i would only want to go there if we had a distinct plan to disrupt or trick or steal and i slice the dragon's throat and i say i am victorious smash the orbs but i can get us a safe place to stay for the night no matter where we are can you teleport today or are you done so if we go to draconia tonight if we want to sleep in the mansion we can't because i changed his memory so we would have to sleep out in the open as lizard people that's where they live let's sleep i need a young boy (laughter) i have an unseen servant do you need a servant i make an unseen servant for him command him as you see fit i tip the unseen servant well to marquet or to draconia what's it going to be should we vote which is which he's probably okay jarett our only friend in draconia whitestone continental breakfast two eggs rambling tirade (laughter) all right all in favor of going to marquet to find a vestige that will maybe give us some more power that we need to kill a dragon say aye taliesin and all in favor of going to draconia where we don't really have a great plan but i think we're going to go try to fuck up a dragon's lair and maybe rescue five people and probably die as lizard people say aye laura travis and three to three let's do it wait we're just doing one flip no what what about all the other numbers oh god we could go there and there and back yep in draconia you're talking about tonight go to the black dragon lair then go to draconia then spend a night there in draconia taliesin and but they could track us back here and then they'd know where we are actually can i just throw this out the only thing that would detect us scrying is currently flying over the ocean we can scry right now to the giant's lair to scry you know what you know in draconia do you know what you know in draconia you know tiberius and you know his armor and you know his objects and personal effects that's true but what do you know what is in draconia do you know any of his friends or his family have we met his family what about his little pet that's true we know of lockheed you're going to gamble on tiberius how many times can you scry start with tiberius no response does it okay what about his father well lockheed would be with-- so you're burning your own spell slot thanks vex we should do his dad you just want to kill everybody can you see any trees someone has feather fall right no should you scry one more time for the dad because best-case scenario we're in a weird snowy ravine with no civilization around yeah we'll be far away seems like a good plan but you said-- it's a little jolt it's a little fall it's fine you told us your famous phrase all risk that's what this is all risk that's what this is we are doing all risk i've never known you to be a coward grog we can just leave really quick she's got another teleport yeah we're going to climb up to the tree-- at the worst this is a quick recon mission we jump back in the tree we come back 15 minutes they were far off in the distance you got a fucking broom i'm hopping on the broom pass without a trace 20 is lockheed within range still can we see him six where's lockheed i see her doing this i point to him and i cast message and i say lockheed we're down here come down it's us your friends i have speak with small beasts fuck you (laughter) what is a monster just grab him and put him in the bag of holding he was teaching him sit and play dead and stuff should i make us lizard people can you look around for more trees that aren't so hard to get to in case we need to make a fast getaway all right or is it all water you want me to make us draconians or lizard people i don't think grog can cower be a wussy draconians i will cast seeming on the party and make us all draconians wasn't tiberius a strange one he was a strange one right metallic yeah like gray silver bronze silver and gold then i guess yeah we'll do the olympics which one was tiberius do most of them have a tail we all have tails mine's a little longer than the rest (laughter) no what do draconians wear raw silk and tattered clothes just rags terrible gray things sure we all have a single bruise (laughter) you speak draconic (laughter) you're our leader friend do we continue i would not like to i will join that insight check we had a 50-50 chance this was a great plan i don't know what's going on it's draconian i don't know what's happening what is it going well disadvantage not good really it's one of my better spells all right poof we're back to normal let's kill them all is it tooma just tell us when it's time to kill everybody just remember vex ticking time bomb here we've got to get in get out we've got one day here so we're going to go see tooma or we're going to chop down some fucking trees i could make us all draconian again without tails hi yes grog doesn't but we do grog was right he's always right do you know where its lair is is it far (gasps) oh boy what taliesin you've got to do better than that try something like this you know matt's an asshole but you know who's not the good people at loot crate hey you never told us what he whispered to you before oh boy we definitely have plans ambush sorry we were going to use this opportunity to find our way into its lair and find its weaknesses and plan the frigid doom was that opal what should we disguise ourselves as okay tiny is uncalled for but i understand the faces of your tribe of your clan all right i can do seeming one more time all right we've still got the mansion handicaps me a bit but i will cast seeming again on the party and do the same thing except slightly different colors and slightly less tail (laughter) my tail nub is slightly larger than the rest it's a cube it's a tail cube have we heard of skork tooma have you ever heard of a dragonborn named gern blanston us neither note every tree as we walk by yeah dog 14 that wasn't the golden snitch no it's a crate liam yes a crate full of boxes box crate our best sponsor inside the boxes are tinier boxes no it's a russian nesting doll of boxes and crates box-box and then inside is a box-crate and inside that is tiny-bag-crate liam do you want all those boxes you get $3 off the first box of boxes crate-crate is it up is it down is it through by the way we've been in dragons' lairs before and the lairs themselves do things right but when the dragon's not in them they don't do anything i have an idea can i help 28 okay do we smash it do we use it to make a crank call what do we do with it steal it i could do a vorugal voice and say thordak you're a cock i could say thordak i'm in desperate need of pay i guess you'll have to do that what do we do do we break it so he can't communicate with the outside that way when we kill him he can't call for help what did we say we would to do i have a great idea for how to kill this fucker well i have an idea tooma told us that they bring animals to hunt we could be one of those animals and draw it to a certain spot where we kill it with our army of fucking draconians and our ice thing that we've shaped into some sort of a trap fire trap rock trap just us oh shit i just did i made a plan it's an ambush plan what do you mean the dragons are at war there's only two more dragons at that point we killed three-fifths of them what does that even mean we've already attacked two dragons there's been no war attack what we have to kill them at some point all right so how do we use this orb to do that right now that's why we came here what does that mean i can't do it anymore laura and i used my last magic poo to look at my daughter i need to know where she is i need to know she's okay gilmore can maybe make me some more potion but i haven't wanted to bother him about it because he's busy keeping a shield around whitestone shit i said it in an accent we need to use this opportunity we're never going to be in this dragon's lair again this is it crack the thing set a trap burn it down yes grog you're the best i can pretend to be a beast galdric is the wolf right can we carve in the lair thordak was here or something got to go find us a beast and bring it here we'll be here the whole time tooma i have one more question about gern blanston i raise the hand cone and i cast modify memory on her 21 i'm trying to change the moment that i said whitestone into emon candles have you ever met a candle-maker was he on one of those stakes his home doesn't really exist anymore this is his place for now anyway and then when we free this place we can find a proper tomb for him i turn around and say goodbye old friend we'll come back and we'll fix this because this is poppycock totally dick move oh god what it's a fun romp after the feywild a fun romp $3 discount we're next (laughter)
