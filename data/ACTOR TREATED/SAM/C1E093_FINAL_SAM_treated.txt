30 sets oh the dice are gone oh wow 19 wow we all did pretty well we're all between 15 and 24 we have a backup bear (laughter) it's rather stuffy in here so we should open a window i'll run up to right in front of vex and slap a window on the wall i've run out of doors (laughter) it's a casement window so i have to go-- (squeaking) (laughter) well he can't fit through a window (laughs) it's two feet by four feet i believe i'll just say doty go back up grog i don't have any idea oh semaphore each one of those squares in the room with him are ten feet squares right the big squares are ten yeah (sings) come to my window matt and wait he took damage though because he's immune to magic or something is that what's going on oh it's okay what're these words oh shnikes ursa major was it this thing does he take 21 points of fire damage immunity not just resistance immunity i am so weak you guys want a window somewhere how tall is the room so there's a little window on top okay well it's something isn't it jesus i'm nobody is it just a cage or is there a door on the bear cage that's not going to happen okay our last fight i had hasted myself that was more than a minute ago though right okay well then i'll go into the place oh sorry it's hard to see with my helmet no peripheral vision oh my god no i don't have anything how far can i move hasted you just double your movement okay so my movement's 30 so i can move in there with him okay i'm just going to go (yells) and run into the fire advantage on dexterity saves oh all right no that's nine halved my helm of brilliance i'm just going to say hi it's a little warm in here here cool off and i'll throw acid on him (laughter) i don't know what i'm rolling 14 this is to hit it's magic i don't know how does this work it's a vial of acid i never know if this is a spell attack bonus sort of a thing the dc of the spell is 17 so he resists it completely no problem oh all right i think i get a bonus still maybe i will cast sanctuary on myself okay that was my action ooh okay i will stab him with my lance ooh that's going to hit it's a 25 (high-pitched grunt) (laughter) that's 1d12 thank you very much that's seven no wait i get a plus six ooh and it was a six that's 13 no the fire damage is another plus one but i don't think you'll be adding that (laughs) yeah so 13 i will and as i do that i also say doty-- remember how i said back up grog me back up me (laughter) oh no 16 plus-- what's his dexterity-- zero so 16 (groans) he's unconscious i don't know when the last time we rested was but i have down that he only has 30 hit points left did he take damage at some point oh no is he going to melt he's in the fire right oh god is he making some sort of window that someone else could walk over good i'm glad i used that last little thing (laughter) oh man kill our own guest that's not a seven what would've happened to me you're not just in the closet over there sorting through file cabinets is it big enough to cover his big body always why does he have disadvantage good day to you sir do you know my father oh boy yeah of course doty will save-- nope because i'm hasted that does not hit haha i have ve-- ah yeah that hits halved me but i'm just a man yeah of course that hits i'm okay because marisha reminded me that when i was not here one week she gave me an extra 17 hit points which i still have they're helping me a lot right now matt on the first of those attacks i have sanctuary it's just one wisdom roll i think it's safe to say even in retrospect what happened oh it's my turn oh great you know how sometimes when we're in fights and bad guys can walk around us without incurring damage i'm going to clock around him clockwise yeah right there's pretty good do i see any-- i can't see out of the ring right ew what i'll do that i'll say it's been lovely having this time with you in private but our seven minutes in heaven are up i need you to leave i will do the ring of the ram at full strength and push him out of his own ring if it works that's a one but i'm feeling lucky that's a three can i feel really lucky no that's fine does it fire it just misses i've lost it all there oh jesus i like my face still hasted for my second thing i can only do a melee attack i can't cast anything i can't reach into my satchel or anything yeah i could that's fair i will spend the rest of my turn moving back to where doty was picking up his book putting it in my bag of holding so it doesn't burn up then crawl into a ball and cast sanctuary on myself (laughter) if i don't look he'll go away do you have healing potions oh yeah doesn't matter you killed him sure it does hits yes well crouching technically it has to roll another wisdom save it lasts for a minute it's not per attack actually he succeeds yes (strangled death noises) and at that point do all of their necklaces glow halved no i just like saying that hey that's good yay oh sure yeah can i feel lucky oh that's worse (laughter) oh i had the craziest dream oh did i kill it again in fear i stand up and throw my lance at the fire giant (laughter) that's a 14 are you seeing this are you all seeing this oh good day to you miss i've misjudged you again no for pocket change would you like me to identify the object all right aye i'll take a look at it with magic or just with size well we did that no yeah percy signed it i drank a healing draught and i am getting my lance ready and i'm staying with fucking doty i'm staying i'm going to try to see if i can try to start fixing him okay well then i won't do that he served his purpose i can't do this i can't go in there as we're walking i'm going to whisper to percy are they going to take all our stuff i can't do anything without my stuff everything armor helmets this is the worst i didn't get my phone call oh wait do we have the necklace she's amazing every time every time we're in jail i have no doty who will record my exploits down here why am i here if not to record my adventures no you're an idiot-- i mean no thank you grog i lash out when i'm nervous and i don't have my belongings of course you cut your food before you eat it i take out my rod and make it a dagger and set it on fire yes oh i don't i don't where is it everything's outside shit i need that shit through her bones tova can't you just curse the lock i'm just rubbing my wrists well why don't we be pigeons that can fucking fly let's just walk i think we should just walk but if you want to do this you can since bats can't see maybe we should-- stealthy wait do we go right what 17 i'm batman wait what we go straight we go straight into the wall as bats-- oh wow that might actually miss guys we have one hit point by the way 30 feet it's a 30-foot fly speed ooh serpentine oh boy here we go four we do get an attack yeah and a hit is one point of piercing damage there bat-bear unhittable bats bats we're all bats yup yup maybe it's stage right i'm going to go where she went and further if i can bye percy my necklace is glowing and i'm not a bat does that mean keyleth's dead you just rolled it but we were bats matt that was pretty fine planning how far away am i okay i'll run back then i guess i'll throw acid at one i guess the one who looks the meanest 17 okay give me some sixes and one more boom oh lots (laughter) 25 all right i will cast sanctuary on young keyleth in my life (laughter) that song is not called doo-bop it's called mmmbop three more they know the layout of this prison let me do something i'm going to use my scroll of programmed illusion have any creatures talked to us in common down here with their mouths not with their minds what kind okay did he work in the prison great chain devil so i'm going to make a programmed illusion upon anyone approaching a chain devil will appear over the dead bodies that we just killed and say there were five of them they went that way and point down the hallway that we just came out of go get them now make them pay (cheering) jesus there's another whole fucking map two which one is sanctuary still working on her and me you can reroll ones is sanctuary still on her on what my spell dc 17 matt if i may be-- technically he can choose another target no it just says in sanctuary you can either fail or he can choose another target sorry just saying you have too many dice on there i mean we're done i'll move to keyleth and say tova are you coming with us you have to sort of to another plane of existence but one without chain golems trying to kill you how i'll go next to keyleth i can make you invisible i can make you fly what would help you get out of here sure a minute just one minute (laughter) it lasts an hour oh hey you can get out with that is vex down oh (laughs) oh shitballs i'm
