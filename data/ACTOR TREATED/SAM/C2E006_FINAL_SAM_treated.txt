name was alight you seem so honest is there a roving band of priests that are trying to find you right now are there any others of your family out there on the run doesn't sound that bad yeah they're not going to kill you what about you fjord are you going to vomit any seawater this morning oh watch out it didn't seem like the whole thing was on fire that was very scary one of them almost killed me that's true the 10000-hour rule what did you agree to why are you yelling an hour all right should we go over and talk to him do we recognize this person i'm not technically i'll join we'll just go over and scare the shit out of him were you here when the attack happened did you happen to see where they came from thadeus did they seem to be after anything in particular were they here for property or people or gold or food don't engage them in halfling i say to him i've also been a victim of a horrible attack oh minus ten this is really fascinating what if we find a dead body and bring it back does it start with an a sometimes if you go down through the alphabet a b-- with a y that would have taken forever i can't read your dice at all she has a good eye for value oh boy west virginia while he's counting this out is there anyone else in the store anyone at all do i see any little trinkets or anything little brass things little baby bottles anything oh that one fell may i examine it okay i'm going to look at it smell it look at the fluid do i know anything about this chemical at all aphids oh that's nothing it won't really do much sometimes not a lot speaking of-- and i'll ask him for the components to make acid does he have that stuff okay how much for all this shit (laughter) just one all right that's fine wait no do you sell any healing potions you asked that already oh never mind we're just going to go into the belly of the beast because one of them shot me and killed me with an arrow we could draw them out thank you so much but i don't want to be in that predicament again can we draw them out somehow they are fond of meat here's my idea we stage a barbecue contest finest in the land all the best barbecue will be there and then when they come to sample our wares i run and you kill them because you want to slow cook that stuff to be really good it's true and maybe one extra horse he's very smart are we getting another horse why don't you four go get horses me and the c-man will go get some incense and stuff sorry you're a seaman let's go get some incense i need to buy some tarts i need a tart that's a bag of pastries wow ooh i can't tell what this used to be is that the top or the bottom i have two tarts i'm taking them on a moving cart are there people in the carts abandoned i'm going to start drinking i'm going to take three big swigs (nervous) it's all right it's fine we don't care about the horses let's just save ourselves who cares about the horses that's true should we leave someone back to protect the horses no all right i'll be part of the fjord expedition (laughter and groaning) that wasn't a groan that was like-- ugh what sneeze what why-- oh i see she's lying she's not really strong really i don't know i'm not strong we're going away from each other put your alarm around the cart you do it all the time how long does it take to cast all right let's just go i'm to the left of caleb there on the end let's walk with molly there boom got it 21 they're just hyenas they're not magical undead hyenas yes no just us i'm going to hide i release my bolt at that same one 20 13 i'm going to go pull my bolt out of the thing is it recoverable do we need to drag these bodies the hyenas we'll have a funeral later there's no mine hole i'm going to look in the carts it's a comb-over why don't we just take this one it's got sticks does it have a frame of any sort oh it's a blanket oh okay we can take that wait before we go in-- no jesus no no please there were hyenas out here right posted as guards if one of the hyenas had gone (hyena howl) would something have come out of this hole to come get us then why don't we make that sound and wait for something to come out and kill it you want to go into that dark scary cave it is a dark scary cave no i'm drinking again i don't have to roll it just happens great i'll go in if you need me to it's a night sparrow he should have said (drunkenly) i'm just going to go in there and get the gnolls great can sparrows hear i could bring the sparrow you could at least hear what's going on like a walkie talkie okay i'll take the sparrow jam it in there oh you got to hold his hand no he's going to go into that other place i'm going to go in great check disadvantage great check what is this dex save 24 i'm okay it was just wood is it a bigger space in here any signs of life anything eight okay real quick i'll just poke through one of the bags oh well then okay eight i will freeze and slowly turn to the sound i'm going to say help me help me now please come in save me save my life i am going to draw and fire at one the first one who spotted me okay 18 eight ten 11 points of damage because i'm going to use fury of the small definitely hits any of us no jesus that's the other character i'll go for the super hurt one who's right in front of me right what's wrong that's what i'm doing laura discovered this last week i'm going to go to the super hurt one and be like (scream) grab it and i'll do shocking grasp yep that's a 19 okay i don't know how to do this hold on is this a ten no that's a ten this is an eight seven am i in range-- where's the other gnoll is it right on me okay i will bonus action disengage and run all the way around to the other side of the room i don't know they're very clever i was sneaking all the way down and they still discovered me i don't know how that happened after they discovered me i was about to go through them do you want to help wooden shafts i'm helping no no a knowledge test you mean an intelligence check a water jug and an ale not jug it was a barrel apparently i'm looking it over yeah careful with that i think maybe none of us should hold that maybe fjord he seems sort of responsible no don't make it a mustache (laughter) i think if you put it near fire it could go explode who wants to hold it who is not jester oh great throw a sharp object it's fine i'll go down the tunnel and scope it out for us oh i don't know i can look for them too i don't know what a trap looks like big piece of rope probably should have seen it all right i will make a mental note look for big pieces of rope don't tell me what i can and can't drink (laughter) you want me to go ahead again oh boy i'll go down one just a little ways and then i'll come back i will stealth i'm going to stealth and search for traps oh good okay 20-something the first roll 13 yes with disadvantage matt laura and that affects-- yeah that's all of the checks so zero oh wait no no i did the math wrong it's ten i'm drunk guys left i love you no thanks okay i'll go back and report what i've heard or what i've learned it just keeps going and starts snaking and there's no traps though why all right here i go (laughter) okay and looking for traps stealth with-- okay 25 24 something it's a lot investigation is 13 yeah 13 it's just burlap over a pit in the ground it just keeps curving and curving oh a downward spiral okay i'll go back and report what i saw all right so one path goes wiggedy woo and the other path goes zibbidy zow no traps oh yes there was a trap to be fair there was one trap i thought you meant any sprung traps there was a trap i sussed it out don't worry i'll take care of it 40 feet down the ziggedy zow and like 25 feet down the zibbidy zoo you're so smart reverse psychology oh reverse reverse psychology right path i would have been bringing them down right five 22 looks like this is the wrong path everyone we should probably go back to the other sorry no including the armored one or no oh sorry what does that do ooh nine what we're just going to go there's no plan he says coyly would you like to see the layout of the room seven six oh yasha's with us right (laughing) yeah they've got like four hit points you can take out two of them in one go if you were you know grog we're up on top up there is there any way to even the playing field a bit any strategy fjord and caleb come on maybe we could use that to escape later the other way this is it this is the other way it's nothing that's nothing no i'm guessing five gnolls we've got these guys d&d maybe it's the whiskey talking but i think we've got these guys how far is it on the map from where we're standing to the farthest gnoll we can definitely do a distraction to get some of them to turn away from us at least we get a round in okay are you going to try your thing or should i try my thing first i don't know i can try something i can do a similar thing have them see something behind them but you can do the same thing yours are already cast right okay i could try to get one of them to fight with one of the other ones of them laura and i'm going to sneak up down the steps to that little crook in there little further back yeah is that all right do i have to roll or anything oh shit okay with disadvantage oh so 26 that puts me within 30 feet of those guys right and what are they doing eating hearts are they carrying anything on their bodies on their person anything canteens or weapons or equipment or anything the gnolls are any of them holding anything that they put down for a second or they got it firmly in their claws are you going to do your thing i don't know you tell me what are those words i whisper a couple words and use mage hand to pick up the little piece of shoulder blade he dropped and throw it in the face of the other guy they don't care thought they would kill each other i don't know that was it we're level three that's all i got i'm going to turn around and whisper to caleb are you going to do the thing but i'm using message so no one can hear us are you going to do the thing if not i can do my thing damn oh i get a turn as well because i did the mage hand thing mildly sure i'll send an arrow down into the one that jester attacked that's 23 nine this is a sneak attack 14 crouch back and hide advantage but disadvantage so 16 does he see me hi natural 20 do i have to roll with disadvantage is this dex or intelligence two so six i did but i got a disadvantage on stealth six okay i'll lean out from behind mollymauk's buttocks and rest the hand crossbow on his left cheek and fire-- --on the gnoll that's engaged with fjord firing eight it's that bulbous buttam i still hidden no that exposes me do i have to hide again how do rogues work oh i was revealed okay so i have to hide again sure got it okay i'll run up the stairs then and hide back near where caleb is other side and then hide well i've cocked terrible nine plus eight is 17 oh wow i'm so stealthy seeing the gnoll's expression i know it well it's one of fear and about to run away (laughter) okay 19 okay i'm going to put the hand crossbow up and run as fast as i can straight at it using my bonus action to dash i'm going to say to it hey you if you spend all day in a well well that's a day well-spent i'll cast hideous laughter on it (laughter) don't you worry fjord kill him get closer yuck the end of its turn it makes a save at the end of its turn i can't believe this thing is still alive it's still prone right so i walk up to it and then point-blank shoot-- not point-blank but far enough away that-- all right i'll stand back ten feet oh well shit then i will draw a sword and i will-- thank god okay 18 okay 13 i think since it's on the ground i would like to pin it into the ground if i can by finding the thinnest thing on it and jamming my shortsword into the ground yes he was like beyoncé he was one hot knowles (laughter and groaning) i check for traps checking for traps this is an intelligence check for now i rolled an 11 it's good it's totally good i will pick it what am i rolling okay proficiency and dex but disadvantage okay 21 is it a healing potion i hand it to caleb you need this more than all of us you're the squishiest what do i do with these i don't all right fine i'll take them i collect medicine packs now i'll keep the herbs i'm fine more than i think i have on my entire body i think i just have four on each hand yeah i'm good we're fine i mean is this the plan we were supposed to free living people but we got some arms we could bring those back are there any identifiable body parts did we do that yeah fjord are we going to be fjord explorers or fjord escapes like some sort of a circle-jerky sort of a thing all right am i drunk or am i not drunk all right wait for three more minutes and then go i charge ahead whose baby where are they why were they crying we'll find out next week oh we are do we know who it is
