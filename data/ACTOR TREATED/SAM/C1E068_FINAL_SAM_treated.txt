crate theme might be just spitballing here number one screws and nails it's just a box of screws and nails you got your wood screws you got your metal screws your two-inchers your one-inchers pretty cheap to produce yeah and useful number two storks the theme is storks the movie storks that's out this week it includes a handwritten letter from andy samberg trying to beg you to go to see the movie (laughter) yeah it is out now storks animated film and number three-- this is what the theme for loot crate could be announced on monday it could be 50 shades of grey they give you a ball gag some can [no audio] and your own personalized safe word mine is harder baby harder which is very confusing (laughter) i'm going to do that right now guys so far storks is just eking out 50 shades of grey and
