scrying things but wait anyone from like when we were with the 'fugees the refugee camp didn't some of them go to daxio wait rothfuss this is the part of the show where we look through our notes mine

no keyleth can scry on you once you're there and see the tree (sings yakety sax) are we taking kima do we want to take kima one we have done one one i don't remember why or who did it hey if we walk up to the fort what's our cover story we're dragon fighters bringing the fight to their town we are looking to fight here well whatever it is i don't think we should tell them that we're dragon fighters bringing the fight to their fort ooh okay (air horn) all their horns were broken in the war okay okay yeah let's go this is going great we haven't even done anything wrong yet do we just pass by those things pretty good so you have 225 here currently and how is morale everyone have enough supplies and ready to defend the fort if needed are we telling them this laura and (quietly) we can help a little with that right well but can't keyleth make some farmland right here in the fort little small garden sort of a thing not just the cinder king we would also bring allies to support you and to buffer your forces and hopefully with enough planning time to get you and your men back on their feet well fed and ready for a fight mikael's navy to kill us we are the bait and we are also the dragon killer so he will come here to kill us or to at least investigate our whereabouts we hope and when he arrives we'll wait in ambush i mean technically we started the day with this many that's for sure it will take us a few days if not weeks to summon all of our allies here and we'll need to get your forces ready as well is this something that you can fully support would you rather fight bravely against a dragon than die a slow starvation death okay we have one pitcher of water whenever we need it so you can't grow anything right now for at least a day i could create a soup kitchen people could come in and take a bowl and leave yeah i mean i could create a soup kitchen basically sure yeah we can have a bread line going in and out general when's the next feeding time for your next shift of men what the mansion sure i think so right oh shit shit balls i can't-- sorry i had an alarm to take off my shirt i have to wear four shirts tonight because of reasons (laughter) yeah

elle oh i'm sorry through magical means we are all not to brag we are all super powerful we're like a band of traveling superheroes one of the things that i can do is make a room or a home a magical home where everyone can go in and get a quick meal and then go back out to work again so with your permission and a location i can create this magical dwelling is there a spot where you would like your men to-- most women are what are you guys going to do oi twinsies maybe you should fly up and if thordak's going to attack from the air see where the spot is that he would attack like a spot of weakness from above name on the list what's your name name listen man do you want some food or not what's your name i've got a big list here there's no girl with you do you have a plus one you're in

weirdly oh 18 i did oh no not my d12 sure why not i'll do that all right 22 then well wait don't we need to send word to other places as well how do we do that isn't there a big horn you blow or something you could find them probably we can scry and find out where they are and then send someone as mist-form you or something and go catch up with them quick list people quick list who do we need to contact slayer's take ravenites syngorn that's a big one that's a biggie right there the wolf pack the herd j'mon sa ord sort of -ish is there anyone else who's pledged their allegiance to us any other band of traveling idiots 2000 where is he an instant message app how many people per day how many times could you do that per day who's next on the list the ravenites the herd what about the herd well we can describe them kraghammer what about that town that we saved from dissolution the air ashari do we need to talk to any of them you could do that the ravenites you don't know any ravenites do you vanessa from the slayer's take do you know her allura any underdark-y type people do they like us let's start with syngorn and then see how it works all right let's just get the father is that vital should we care about that all right sure yeah why not second message bring-- what was his name indala put kima on there too or zahra shaun wait that's certain death quick everyone hide when she's doing this so when she comes back we'll all be-- you don't know anyone else on our list do you the slayer's take you don't know just one more message but wait what about the clasp or something the clasp do they like us or hate us all right then we're good for now we just keep buffeting up this place do we have to plan an ambush how does this work all right you and me some plate armor one day what's one day well when we get there we'll find out if it's taking too long we'll pop back these messages are going to take a while to deliver all right one night they've all eaten today we're fine no wait didn't we send her on a mission she was going to bring us back some dude and we're not even there to not where we are right now the last time we talked to raishan she said all right i'll be back in a day and then we got out of there yeah no we haven't spent the night yet all right i'll go talk to raishan and then we're going to the fire plane just pop on down for a bit to the basement no fucking way let's pop on down plus now we have a lot of money we can buy our way through the fire plane we can get in touch with her when she goes back to the place that shall not be named but all of that is going to take days and we can't do that until the armies have arrived here in fort daxio which could take another few days i don't know where syngorn lands when it comes back to this plane i assume it's not next door they're going to take days to get here yeah and if he's searching for us what better place to be than on a different plane all in favor of the fire plane say aye sam and that was only two wow that's pretty rough all in favor of staying say cooter two to one feed more soldiers plane shift no how long to get there i can turn a couple of us into some things you two can fly right we can go right there be right in the center of the city land right in main street next to the reebok store yeah but good news we're still alive she could probably figure that out on her own she would probably figure that out let's just pop in pop out guys what could go wrong let's do that sure right i can do my magic wherever i have no idea i've never been to the fire plane no i used it yesterday this was a worthwhile trip already let's just go man my choice was an obvious one it's @cat_cosplay for the cat version of scanlan or as i call him cat scan and for those
