alleyway that i didn't even see before but it's just tight enough to fit through oh that's a big fail i didn't see the overhang (laughter) succeed does nothing right i'm still running full speed just give us the number nice the muscle always gets the fez we're rolling a d8 for this three that is a bowler i'll go with green the colorful one oh boy look at that i'm like the riddler marisha and you have multiple fezzes just in case no it's a yarmulke what you know something we don't that's our brains want us to come with you how do we know that you're not going to keep the good stuff yourself and give us the dregs i'd feel more comfortable if one of us went with you definitely the brains of the operation trenchcoat of invisibility a melon baller you're not in there you're outside he's the brains you're going to break into the castle waiting smell it okay okay server bears it's a little piece of heaven hey let's not talk politics let's just do the job no what could go wrong do you need

i'm going to need some bamboo pretty soon i'm going to ask the bartender if i can have an ice bucket filled halfway with honey and then stuffed full of bamboo stirring sticks i'm going to go crazy on the bamboo and hang back on the honey may i take a point of bear if i want to i will stick with what my current-- so slick on the way out from the setup i'm going to do a scan around are there any servers pushing any carts of any sort like with plates or anything on them i would like to try to steal the unattended drink cart what oh because i'm a driver i'll take the lower and that's a success do i move one point over then okay cool that could not have gone better we got a little information we got a little mobilization you don't need all those riches and luxury you just need the bare necessities we're going to go get these smugglers i can fit one of you maybe what we all have four legs we can walk much faster than this these small wheels do not do well on this dirt path this is very inefficient in bear or in human everybody stop oh wait i'm pushing i'll stop who's talking the polar bears hey calm down listen look at me i'm half you what is your cause about yeah pound it out what is this cause of yours that you're trying to convert people to do you know it's true every time i've heard talk about polar bears everyone insults their dicks and it's not right i mean looking at your dick right now it seems just below average but just below a game what kind of game is this like a roleplaying game or a-- sorry that's insensitive of us yeah if you let our friends go by we'll play the game with you so what's our angle here guys what is happening right now yeah what if a dick just falls it's true yeah that dick is moving oh sorry i got flustered there i got the jitters one second polar what happens if we lose this game what are the stakes here again there are literally no stakes to this hey care to make this interesting if we win this game-- no liam las vegas please maybe you could give us safe passage up to the interior of fort lox well could you at least give us some means of travel that's slightly more advanced than this cart full of champagne glasses if we win oh watch your hat come on trinket that seems like a bad idea i don't know about that one i could have sworn that was the point of the game this is not a good a good move liam las vegas i haven't had enough bamboo i don't know if i can do it i got it i'm sorry easy easy hey polar now that we've known each other a couple minutes be honest you ever had sex before no right i mean come on nobody who spends as much time gaming-- what happened brian and just keep those blocks erect and you'll be okay oh the stakes could not be lower oh boy it's getting down to it man this game really stinks like it smells bad smells like balls all right i guess i get-- there's no-- i got nothing i hit in a dick i did graze the dick i still don't understand this game how would that even stay how is that going to stay i don't understand you can't hit that dick it's been an honor it really gripped me and pulled me it tugged me right into the game i'm going to go to sleep what's this game called we're

wedding gift in honor of you and your daughter and her mystery husband yeah thank you bear-y much and bear-well we got a cart we've got some supplies hey brains waffle i've been thinking about this code he said it was between salmon and bamboo if you rearrange the letters in those words you get either no m√°s boom moon samba or las mambo all right i'll limber up do we have any way of lighting them are there any candles around all right then let's go do this caper it's amazing starting to get the jitters again i'm steering the ship i'll roll to see if i can find something what am i rolling for criminal or bear that's a fail do i lose a bear point oh a point goes into bear i'm just getting the jitters again i need a little bamboo yeah i brought a little bit in his throat at least three in his throat you've been working out oh i just had the jitters i'm going to run at the thing and try to bite its face off that's a success i'm going to eat through the bamboo and try to chomp his face to death i'm going to try and spit out the meat and keep the bamboo it's like bloody bamboo my stomach's churning we vegans are crazy i search his body for any items that's a fail so i lose criminal you got a code liam and is it a puzzle or is it just the code tell me was the code las mambo wait don't the bear acuda read backwards though on the page okay (laughter) that's amazing code breaking he's a code breaker he's a windtalker i think i could fashion something out of these yeah but it's a narrow corridor so it's not going to be a cart i'm going to make us a really long motorcycle kind of like tandem bike with five wheels like a tron bike sort of with extra wheels we got to get in first oh quincy de bolo yeah all right let me see if i can make this contraption okay with your help i might need you to bed a couple of iron rods around axles and stuff this isn't an inherent bear skill oh good there's a little blood residue i don't like it yes flintstones style oh boy that's pretty good okay we'll call it good tidings yeah i'm going to ride in the front so i can steer i think it's a christmas thing i don't really know we'll all get on there's enough seats for all of us except you las vegas i'm sorry you'll have to ride on somebody's shoulders okay we all have to pedal with our feet all right there's one more thing the only way this thing works is if we all go like this (motorcycle imitation) at the same time or else it won't go ready deep breath on a count of three one two three (motorcycle imitations) i'm going to remember back to when we had just played that board game when i had just said to the gentleman your dick is just below average when he looked down is when i swiped one of the pieces of the board game one of the ice chunks i've been concealing it this whole time (slowly) it's okay i'm going to throw a board game piece at the other guy yeah i got a point back for the flashback okay that's still a fail matt taliesin and oh man is he wearing ninja clothes we're going to need one more thing from you take off your clothes give me those i start ripping them to shreds the sweet brothers are stone cold that was the zoo are you okay trinket you're shaking a little bit you look a little crazy right now mount up everybody i've invented something put these wads of fabric in your mouth they're mufflers we still got to make the sound but now it will be quiet (muffled speaking) (muffled) we're riding out (braking sound effect) (spitting and coughing) very uncomfortable is that a cow thing what is that how do we break open this door put a muffler on it oh it worked i got a little bit do you like bamboo it's kind of like-- i got no more bamboo left though how yes how do you make the beavers happy oh that's what everyone wants just a nice guy we're looking for something loud and shiny right i'm going to open a crate or two i'm going to sit on a crate see if i can open it with my panda weight that's a success oh go from bear to criminal ugh i got something here guys you're the brains look at this thing that's a hookah pipe hey listen he's got the right to bear arms it's okay he can do it we should keep those together probably right there's something about you and that pistol should we abandon crate should we keep going i can give it one more shot if we want i'll sit on one more success written in bear it says salmon salmon bamboo bamboo salmon salmon bamboo it's going to take me a while to decipher it's written in sema-bear it says something about-- it seems to be a thing that we can use to magically summon someone to help us so only if we get in dire straits this makes far more sense okay it's just a really more powerful one of these (laughter) yeah it was salmon salmon salmon salmon bamboo salmon bamboo he's getting up there in criminal i've got the motorcycle parked just outside so we can make a quick getaway a bear-ricade oh yeah i was bear-n ready nope go vegan it's going down bongo

asking us to do just leave there's a map guys we need to be using this time to come up with more puns there's smokey there's yogi come on guys wait a second you're gonna have to shoot balls in his mouth oh you're going to block it (laughter) you shot marisha how many does he have to get in oh wait those are hits wait i got one more bullet should i try it it says it has the power of ten bullets but it will destroy the gun do i have to get it in the mouth or just hit it oh i flashback to when i was a child in szechuan china my father said to me run peddy run the hunters have come i heard in the distance firing sounds because the chinese invented guns long before anyone else did i heard gunfire and i ran and ran and that's the last time i saw my family and that was the last time i ever
