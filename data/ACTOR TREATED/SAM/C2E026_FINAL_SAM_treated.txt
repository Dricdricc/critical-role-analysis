she does that sometimes i'm sure it's nothing that's playing-- that's playing with fire their personal belongings and stuff his spats and spurs oh wow i'll take a swig to calm my morning nerves and start searching around to see if there's any notes or any signs of anything around okay that's terrible that's an eight whoa oh my god we're not even going to know they're gone (laughter) we got a two a two a one what was your first roll okay so six is our top roll so far can we follow those grooves can we see which direction those wagon tracks went in survival nine that narrows it down it's not east or west guys god damn it who was on watch it was fjord and yasha right so they would have been awake but what about jester she was asleep right maybe they weren't targeting anyone specific just coming to grab folks and those were the ones that were awake or closest to the road or-- well they took the three ugliest ones i mean they left us wait i'm going to examine the tracks for blood mmm that's an 11 anything weird about the blood is it green blood purple blood blue blood that means that they weren't bleeding when they were dragged which means that either they were killed by vampires and all their blood was sucked out of them first or they were still alive seeing that i will draw my new crossbow turn it on i imagine it's battery-powered (powering-up noise) (laughter) sure ooh what whoa how this is terrible here so much better than us oh she's challenging us what's going on up there should i kill something (shouts) i think she means shadycreek run just one i'm going to walk up next to molly should i kill her you can come up now caleb (smug giggling) why oh your flask runs out (smug giggling) sorry he's very weak (laughter) don't worry it's a cat usually ooh i like you already here do you have a cup or something i could pour into all right i'm going to take out my flask and pour a good healthy half quantity you have to drink it fast it will disappear soon yes what i am the greatest detective of all times i poured one drink and i solved the case (laughter) how do you know who are they did you lose someone (weak growl) oh i should take off the mask it's more scary that way (growl) (stuttering) jeff it's nott herr bush why don't you come back to our camp no aren't we in the road oh did we come back oh okay cool who are they why are they operating this far from the run also what kind of slavers-- these are powerful people that they just kidnapped okay okay you don't know us i gave you a little bourbon i'm a lady i gave you some booze the least you could do is afford us the benefit of the doubt beau is terrible with relationships and social interactions do you know any of their names the shepherds who are they 20 gold is expensive wait so if you could rescue your friends or friend or whatever-- are you sure so it's revenge then i just imagined some crazy shit (laughter) you're confident that you can lead us to these shepherds how many of them are there hey we're five don't put yourself down like that i'm sure you can hold your own you know when we were in zadash we heard the town crier talking about kidnappings in nogvurot that's close to shadycreek run could that be the same people do you think iron chef here let me pour you some more booze does that help this is all connected it's like a conspiracy and we're in the middle of it in large part the subject was confused as to what a detective is i'm not writing i don't have a quill it's something that me and one of our lost friends talked about a lot sorry we'll kill these folks or try to anyway what if one gets away we're going to hunt them down over our lifetime i don't know what if they go far away are we indebted to you forever now or can we put a 30 day cap on this nothing you sure sound like our new leader oh yeah no i mean he's got the intelligence are you just walking do you have any means of transportation we do oh we have a map of some sort should we lay it out on the table and see if-- weights thank you but we'd have to ditch some gear or do we have enough horses to carry everything including shields can we carry all of our friends' stuff on a horse we have six horses i think it's not it's not special to her in any way the big things we're leaving all right no we should leave them why don't we kill it and take some meat all right let's just leave it i mean the horses are all named after-- poop so we can probably-- i believe we're going to take wc loo john crapper and toilet but we're going to leave loaf (laughter) we're going to drop a quick loaf then go it's always better to drop a loaf before you go sure skidmark is one of us steering the journey and can another one of us be looking for clues or things along the way are you cold swimming in it why are you hiding your face do you want to look at the thing the orb okay you're good we have to look at the orb at some point too or hexagon dexa-- matt and thank you but we won't encounter as

i've got the booze would that work wait we have three-- yeah okay i noticed back there that you were using your hands and weapon stuff and things you're not a healer or anything you don't have any potions of healing or anything that could maybe heal someone if anyone needing healing would-- no one now but in the future-- it's a frequent occurrence for us do any of us have any potions she had a greater healing potion however i don't know if she had that on her or kept it in the sack i think we have her notebook in the locker no i felt around in there did the light just change in here the light is moving just stare back i have a couple of empty vials but they're small i've worked with chemicals before i could try to put this acid in the vials and stopper them sure would three vials of acid be useful to us sure all right i'll try to make a little needle prick in the bladder and try to pour them into these vials that i got from the gentleman okay that's 16 i have three from the gentleman okay great would you like one you did this i don't know how i would put it on there why don't you take one molly do you want some acid do you want to drop some acid caleb do you want-- how about i'll give you two and i'll keep one since i already have one that i made all right here you go are we friends again what time is it sorry oh well we can make some more headway on the road and then go at full dark we could camp at full dark jesus help action oh wait no what huh oh (laughter) okay wait which chat okay cool you've said that you said that right (hooting) one two three what the fuck was that matt there was an owl that just hooted on the soundtrack we were all spooning where is caleb gone no okay i didn't know if he was a phantom or something of course it's a baby maybe you should not go first i'm going to not follow but go off to the side and try to go around the other way 16 i'll slowly emerge from the shadows guys d&d beyond is a wonderful platform in which you can organize your statistics and your equipment and they've just recently done a revamp of their layout liam how do you like it and it's customizable nice yes stop (whispering) bastard ah i forgot you were with us well these people have suffered the same fate that our frie-- we're mutually-- we're going after the same people that have affected them some people are just good related to you the subject seems to be exhibiting signs of distress or at least annoyance it's breakfast i'll take one yes thank you what does it do do you smoke it see people are just nice sometimes yes we should keep going to find their friends do you know someone named pumat sol how about one of his friends pumat sol or pumat sol or pumat sol i just thought maybe they knew each other i don't know how many of these there are no i don't know every goblin there's lots of goblins i never-- all right all right point taken point taken (laughter) no that was really good not the firbolgs we just met right you were talking about the people who kidnapped our friends i think-- we're still talking about the people who kidnapped our friends sure sure and maybe even complete our mission at a fast pace matthew-- i'm on horseback with caleb right could i be on the back maybe just flipping through jester's sketchbook okay i'm going to look through the whole thing is it all drawings are there any notes or letters or clues to her past common goblin halfling keep it to myself [yelling] keep steering caleb i'm looking at nudie pictures are we getting close to where you think their headquarters are let's do it 13 total i'll take watch with keg 13 chilly sure glad i have all this booze to drink to keep me warm wouldn't you like some well it tastes good though so there's that too i'm not trying to cozy up to you i think we got off on the wrong small feet i have to bare my teeth at everyone look at these things they're huge no i have very thin lips very long teeth some would call them fangs it's not my fault when i smile it looks like i'm trying to bite your throat off (snarls) and i like tongue i was eating some tongue when you saw me no oh god no you're a handsome woman but-- you're a woman right okay good just making sure i don't know i don't want to presume anything all right here you go you know it never runs out no special trick so uh who got took who are you missing no what i thought we were getting to know each other all right did you go to school hmm i would say no did you have a happy home life growing up hmm i'm trying to think of a topic that's less charged do you have a favorite sports team you like (laughter) iron chef i love iron chef never mind i just thought well-- no i just thought if we knew more about your situation it would maybe lead to clues that would help us track down or know the weaknesses of these shepherds who stole or killed your friends if we knew the circumstances around their untimely demise were you one of them did you go to high school-- no you didn't go to school-- hmm everyone else is snoring all right i'm doing what any good detective does which is just lay the groundwork for the case-- jester jester's one of the folks that got stolen together we were a dynamic duo of mystery solving we could solve any mystery find any criminal mastermind no matter how nefarious we had all the tools all the insights all the instincts it was amazing we were a well oiled machine and then she was taken and now it's just me i resent that all right well i'll try to help you get revenge on your vague past (laughter) sure sure how about you tell me one fact about you and i'll tell you one about me here you go (pouring noise) i'm a pretty good dancer i didn't know i didn't know i thought we were going to start small and then build you gave me the heaviest shit first though of course well this has been fun it's got five wheels caleb should i go check them out oh okay are they suspicious all right we can go what caleb look at this picture of you in jester's book it's really funny oh no they're moving right we don't even know who they are yet though we love our guests we love them i definitely deduced that from our conversation it's not surprising to me in the least i lied too i'm an average dancer (laughter) want some more booze we told you that we said that multiple times yeah how can you go owl it out yeah he usually narrates as he sees sometimes you do why not there's five of us and-- we have an owl at night maybe after they've camped or a fortress or something should we just continue to follow them for now or attack right now in the broad daylight oh we know where they're going we know where they are why don't we ride ahead of them-- yes thank you i'd better get drunk then on the same road we're not even going to go around you're gross marisha why don't you look at that dodec wow mine's 19 12 maybe this one's aroused who knows what's going to happen (laughter) oh interesting well we would want them to get going in the morning right but not immediately get ambushed like settle into a little bit of a pace for an hour or two yeah somewhere around there a couple miles yeah that's the key oh it's dark now right ooh we need to plan the ambush we don't have a cart to block the road with what do we have you could stand in the middle of the road and distract them what if we did like a-- --like a red dawn thing (laughing) we dug a hole and then we got in the hole-- --and they came over us and we popped out of the hole and we grabbed onto the cart and we rode under it and then we like chopped a hole in the bottom of the cart it would be really cool oh (pause) no let's figure out what we do have though we have four vials of acid oh we could just kill all the horses we could just ambush the last one do you have anything we could use --we guys you're part of the team now too druid what's our primary goal just to stop them and prevent them from fleeing yes so we have to stop the path right we have to block them from escape how do we do that do we fell a tree can we fell a tree we could fell the tree right on them as they come by kill all the horses first so they can't get away ooh that's pretty good i could also mage hand and start unlocking cages okay how do you propose if we're trying to split them up you could just slow the last carriage further down the road and they'd drift apart a bit i don't know i see do we have any other weapons or any other special things i have a gun (laughter) no you're not going to take the gun no you're not i'll take acrobatics it's only 11 i don't know sure sure first of all i'm not good at finding traps but i've found a few and the ones i've found have been rope based i could do a tripwire for the horses okay so we fell a tree in front of the road they stop to move it i'm in there unlocking things they've already stopped though sure sure keg goes in to distract caleb kills the horses yes of course (laughing) this is a great plan the winning part especially amazing (laughter) are you aroused ah help i'm under a tree also you hate me i'm going to dig a hole just in case this red dawn thing sure on the tops of the hills and then one for me right in the middle of the road under the earth yes absolutely let's do it crafting party but you can't know the map because we just came up with this ambush plan tonight there's no way that you would have foreseen something like this happening can he float day i wasn't we have a green room oh the makeup room are we going to do a studio tour at some point you know one of the things about the makeup room is it has those hair salon sinks where you can get a haircut in it or get your hair washed in the sink can i get my hair washed in one of those can we move some of those bushes up up on top of the hill can we snap some twigs and make the bushes bigger yeah fluff the bushes a little bit yeah let's do that oh my god we're minecrafting about there and we're going to do that over here a little bit this thing can't move right holy shit it's like rocky iv --in the middle or should we-- i'm aroused sam riegel is should we put it here to narrow the passage okay is this thing hollow at all that's where i'll hide tomorrow caleb any other terraforming we want to do over here are we-- we added some bush up here and up here-- to hide in so then one person can hide here one person can maybe hide here we moved this over and it's got a little nook in it so nott can stay in there but we have this tree here do we want to knock over that tree and block the path how tall is this tree matt so it only-- how about this if i may this log that we've set on this side what if we set it on this side over here-- --and then we weaken the tree in case we need to tip it over-- --and block the other half so now we can weaken this tree maybe with some chops and then-- --it can block the other half sure to controlled-- interesting do we want to do any digging any mudding anything else is this our ambush me i'm going to be in the log someone's going to be up here in bush one someone's going to be in bush two someone will be behind the tree caleb where are you going to be wait i thought caleb was the bush man (laughter) just dry run it here dry run it okay the cart's coming it gets slowed oh what the fuck's going on then slow it but it doesn't stop it just slows so right here it slows they're like what the fuck's going on they're already past us then we'll stop them yeah or we do this we slow them or whatever and then-- then they get here oh crack or maybe we stop them first crash stop everything stops then we hit them with slow oh fuck so should we let one cart go first and then on the first cart so the first thing that happens is the trunk the tree the second thing that happens is slow the third thing that happens is i pop out of the tree trunk-- which cart are they going to be on which should i start with the small one or a big one did i give you a scroll of invisibility could you use it on me or would that ruin your books an hour meters i'm not going to attack i'm just going to jump on a cart in the fracas and try to find a cage or two on people on magic users can you that's my voice ashly up there in bush land are you going to be able to do anything but that would get you on the cart with the bad guys you can't just rain down terror from above i'm ranged we'll huddle together who's lucky pierre who's in the middle they're already here i look in before we go i'm going to whisper to caleb caleb if anything goes shitty i'm going to throw my flask of oil on the first cart light it on fire clarota oh shit i'm so scared hold me ashly come on keg (chanting) keg keg keg how did you have that (laughter) 18 ah is that cocked i can't tell if that's cocked i need a ruling from-- oh it fell 21 hey don't leave we might be ending now we're starting this i don't know how i'm going to get on this fucking cart how am i going to get on this cart i'm not invisible all right i'll run past lorenzo as i run i will dump all my oil on him yep that's my action bonus action disengage and jump into the cart and start doing this yeah oh shit they're invisible cages the part of me that hit the cage is now invisible also that's all i've got i'm sure i pushed as far as i could come on this is what you live for you've got ball bearings it's a perfect plan it's now or never ki questions wow slow is the best not a sorcerer you got it wrong the cover of bush yeah we had him all bushed he'll resist it yes come on motherfucker wow we stumped him the only good plan that we've ever made is without travis and laura here let's make that clear are you doing a throwback right now oh no he can cast i thought you said he was a fighter your information is the worst rogues are the worst oh oh that wasn't damage i thought that was damage okay oh you ditched that's fine yeah there's 12 players which one do the horses get an attack of opportunity we're still alive all right keg kill them all in one turn from 45 feet away he is covered in oil which makes him kind of sexy away jesus ugh you're the worst and it will do it over all of the-- oh no what the fuck is that he's a dragon-man what is this jesus what the fuck is that you know what i'll use my luck terrible 11 i'll halve that oh no he's winning all right i think i have to use an action to unlock this cage to pick the lock fuck you five plus i don't know what is it usually seven 12 i'm going to move around the cages or between them so that i turn completely invisible nope that's a three can i use my bonus action to-- jesus what can i do for my bonus action i can't hide can i hide i got nothing else to do on a bonus action so yeah i will try to hide i'll go on the side of the cart and-- i'll hide off the side of the cart oh that's wonderful it's 29 of at least lorenzo may i ask a weird question matt the guy that i was trying to break out of the cage is he alive would i have seen that before i tried to unlock the cage okay cool down like dead yes land on the horse's back you got this guys you got this big rolls is it your big dice it's cocked oh god is he still going to attack you oh no do you get a reaction do you have anything oh god oh god catch it i'm invisible what do i do lorenzo hasn't been hit yet has he ashly and once but he's not going to go down i will first try to use a bonus action to use item and pour acid on one of the locks see if that opens it well shit then i won't do that i will-- shit what do i do i can't kill anything here i'm going to try the lock i'm going to try the lock there's nothing else i can do it's a natural one yes so movement and bonus i will run towards caleb but not directly at the barbarian let's see movement is 30 how far could i have gotten with just movement yeah ah okay yeah so that's fine get out of there run run (whispering) oh it's a slave they get a slave yeah use your teleport spell wow ash good job ashly welcome to the game no it wasn't all your fault just mostly oh boy i've got another vial of acid
