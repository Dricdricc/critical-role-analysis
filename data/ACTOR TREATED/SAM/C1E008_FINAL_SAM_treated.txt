and we found her is anyone following us can we do a quick check around and just see perception check starting it off with a 19 we should get out of here he could be in another dimension says who i have a spell that can go to another dimension (chuckles) by the way this is the best conversation we've ever had with tiberius (all laugh) if grog is close we still need to get out of the way of these 30 people so let's go hide if we do not move will this 30 duergar mass hit us at some point oh jesus (laughs) we took too much time ten distract them get them away from us can't win with this guy 14 that's including the ten 24 hours but you have to be concentrating the whole time and you can't you can't go to sleep no we're all in let's just make a decision right now to leave grog and continue on let's just forget about him he was a good friend we'll have a toast to him laura and we'll sing about songs of his memory within a few days we'll forget he ever existed all right fine i was so worried about you you don't have to do the accent anymore are you stuck like this wait but what about kima can you unstone kima now or and clarota was really helpful to us you can (all cheer) i know but we all have to rest eight hours but we have to rest i'm at two you're not stealth anymore you got a busted foot you're at disadvantage on everything can we at least heal you up before you go how does it work she is still close but once we walk out of here we will be at the same level we're going to rest grog will be fine is she doing a standard healing here is my song of rest going to help at all okay so i'm going to sing while you heal if that's all right okay ready (singing) wherever you go whatever damage they've done we will be right here waiting to heal you no matter what hit points you take or how your foot breaks we will be right here-- sam and feet pun until then he's a gimp before we go to sleep i go over to kima and i say to her lady kima i think we're all going to take a rest and you as well correct we can trust you while we're all asleep not to do anything to any of our companions correct does she seem to be telling the truth a what what check insight okay 18 okay (laughs) oh my god what if they start fucking (all laugh) (clears throat) that would be the kingslayer me (laughing) oh okay we're all a bit cranky maybe we should just turn in sleep tight pike i'll cuddle you for warmth if that would help that's fine that's what i meant you know what we better let that foot heal we better let it heal did you get up do we get all our spells back and stuff i can do things again the way we came in the city was through the side path right so we're already-- but if we keep going we'll get to the-- okay your hunter's mark is gone so let's go let's just hurry unless it melted plus ten 19 have any of us eaten they've put him on some sort of stretcher thing this was some sort of burial ground what do you want to fly let's just go what are we going to do turn around grog's that way she'd have to do it 20 times trinket's a boy with a name like trinket why don't we go across he can come back and get trinket with your heavy armor oh pike maybe because you've been killing unarmed people but you know what we'll do some good deeds when we're done i wouldn't say that all right let's go on our stone airplane clarota can float what about you i'll grab on as well why not kick him off we're on you have we passed it yet no we're floating above it we've got advantage we're fine one of us has guns by the bones trinket is a cat 12 you're giving us opposite notes well you're not on it you can make a dance floor next to them she's wolverine okay do i have a clean line of sight on her or are we too far away all right so i think i'm in range i'm just going to blind the bitch so i cast blindness on her isn't it a girl yeah well i'm so demeaning to it i call it a girl ashley and because it is a chauvinist i know that i'm looking i'm drunk how far am i i can't even tell i can't see the board i can't do it i can hold my turn i've never done this before okay i will wait for that then and i love women biblically god clarota what 16 he didn't ask to be dropped there panels squares that was an excellent move by a strong independent woman who doesn't need a man to tell her what to do or to validate her in any way now that i'm within range may i go i'm going to blind him with blindness in his eyes i am using my hand cone 19 and then i give a little inspiration to pike i look over to her give her a little wink little smile that's all it takes i think so where am i yeah i'm staying on that wall yeah i don't want to go anywhere yeah the whatever it is it's also blind save it for later come closer to me that's a proud choice and i honor and respect it i love women do i get an attack it has a maw is there anywhere i can stay on the dance floor and get a line of sight with the creature and can i throw lightning and not hit tiberius (nervous laugh) okay then then i don't do that instead i will-- i've got nothing to do let's say i will try to-- is she-- it's a he i have no ranged attacks except i can viciously mock it so that's what i'll do i'll say you know what your tentacles make you look kind of fat and the elf thing is played out it's sort of 1990s orlando bloom and the whole bone thing is just really tacky three yes it's the only ranged attack i have (all laugh) oh and as my bonus action i'm going to inspire somebody i don't know who i look over at liam and i do-- sorry vax and i do one of these (all laugh) but you've got inspiration you can roll a d8 pike perhaps you should spare it for your god or offer it in sacrifice to your god you know what women are good at math probably better than men good adding it's still alive can we undo its healing factor (garbled) make a constitution saving throw who has to do this pike clarota i can roll for pike i've got this guys we're connected in a special gnome way that you have no idea how pure this bond is 16 plus whatever (singing) and that's the power of love for trinket is trinket still a cat oh no your shirt is ripped pike you just took 14 it would have been much more if scanlan hadn't been around that's all i'm saying oh snap bear down not trinket death saving throw this is a grizzly situation the end what is it with you and kima she's fighting with us don't dispirit her while we're fighting i don't like her either but i'm not openly hostile to her sure i've got it 24 do we see any ligatures is there sewing or has it been stitched together i'll take out my dagger and dig into his torso take them i take them hey will you lead the way pike with your crazy mace path how far away is it from us let's go kick some ass do we need it is anyone hurt we don't need rest for spells we just need rest for health right your foot wow that was exciting and i feel empowering to a lot of the female-- (all laugh) pike did a lot of important things we're working on it i'll be watching that it's my favorite
