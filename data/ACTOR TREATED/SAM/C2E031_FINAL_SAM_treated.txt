someone comes in we kill everyone in the place so i'm the distraction and the lookout they're in there all right i'll do my best all right i'll disguise myself using disguise self as an elderly gnomish woman and i'll wander into the temple i guess ahem pardon me all patrons i have a request from the holy father himself that we vacate the premises they have to refresh all the holy water-- that's good-- every 30 days and wouldn't you know it today's that day so out of the pool for a few minutes and then when it's all refreshed we'll come and you can come right back in just a break go

weapons of any sort or vestments or jewels is there anything around us like donation jars or anything around us i don't know how churches work guys do they have a ticket-taker 14 if there's one close to me i would like to cast mage hand and grab it i'm sure i will drop my form it's an action to make it appear oh god i think what his holiness is trying to convey is that he will be going on a spiritual journey and there's only room on that train for one dude that was perfect i'm going to watch the door they all went out the front door that would be faster i'm going to hide in one of the pews oh god i'm going to follow from behind stealthily okay i'm going to scream as loud as i can from behind them and scream oh my god he's dead he stopped breathing he's back there didn't you see him oh god that's a nine i'll try that hits there's no save right whew thank goodness i'm wearing my cloak so i get advantage that's a natural 20 jester ah jester by the way i only have advantage on stealth not on saving throws so the first roll that i had rolled was a five which adds up to a 12 so i will take damage oh thank you thank you sir may i have another jesus you're using every spell you have just use your handaxe oh wait i'm going to die trying to help her graffiti a statue in a church god you've cast 19 spells acrobatics 17 full dash yes full dash i don't know where she went i'm going to run another 15 feet does anyone have eyes on me right now oh my god i will full dash and get out of there and turn left i'm going to duck behind something and look to see if jester came out 25 he's out get him not much happened what i did a lot of drinking yep just drinking and thinking yeah a little bit you know it's easier to steal things when you can pay for them with money i did not know that ill-tempered bowling ball (laughter) i'm happy to entertain your desire to go find out more about this ball inside of you but there's other things we might want to do too caleb you have things that you wanted to accomplish to the north right me i'll go where you go caleb i worry about a couple things yasha said she'd come back when she was ready and if we're not here then i don't know how she'll find us we could leave word i suppose yes jester could send her a message if we could send yasha a message that would be better yeah like passing a stone could go through his pee-pee hole too sure we stick together i'm excited we're going to need you to send a message to yasha do you need to know where she is to send that message it might be good to let her know where we're going in case she wants to find us (clicks) the next day (clicks) (robotic voice) you have seven new messages (laughter) that's multiple marisha and before we set out i'm going to pull caleb aside and-- a moment caleb are you sure you want to go down to the coast there's stuff for you to do up north where you were from before of course but we'll have to do it at some point we're all together now all right i won't lie i'm sort of-- now that we're all together again i wouldn't mind swinging by my old stomping grounds either it's on the way well it's on a way north if we wanted to go that way no it's more east it's east it's due east it's definitely not west we're here it's due east but the coast is down here i can wait i don't mind waiting i don't have a specific-- no felderwin we'll be back this way again soon we'll have to come through zadash and we can-- yeah the main road away from the menagerie coast all right you're more powerful now aren't you i saw you got a bunch of paper well you've been doing new spells and things it's pretty-- no it's pretty incredible have you been able to do anything that you've wanted to-- been studying like some special spectacular spells that can-- i think so i think i'm okay ever since molly fell i've just been-- there's a bit of a sense of urgency you know we have things that we need to do and we don't have forever to do them i want to keep you on your path and i want to keep on my path as well what is it you're working on just learning new magic i know but i don't know how you're going to undo it that's not selfish that's important oh well i think i understand a little about that too there's things that i want to change as well things that would be risky to change but sometimes you have to take a big risk if it's that important little ol' me yes yes even if it's risky yes we're going to do it you'll help me no matter what good well then onward to the beach oh i bet you would sunburn easily you should probably coat yourself with a layer of dirt just to make sure you made that oh sorry do we need more for the journey or is that enough no we set them free (singing) d&d beyond (singing) make love to me tonight
