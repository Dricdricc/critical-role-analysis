so i have some questions for the leader of-- oh what i know i'm with this thank you wait let me roll this 14 (sings dramatic music) and he's a test we're not to kill anyone else in the room but liam's did maybe it's because they're projectiles it's like a thousand feet jesus we'll get it later we'll go get it later as he attacks can i use cutting words to reduce the attack i'll try yeah i say to him oi your face is so ugly i'm considering casting blindness on myself so i don't have to look at it (laughter) a ten or an eight hey six i got a natural 20 whoa this is a powerful fighter why so it did not hurt him at all okay before i go because i wasn't in the room did j'mon sa ord say this is a test okay okay i'm out of range so he can't swipe me as i walk away right then i'll stay put let's not risk that so i'll hand cone up otiluke's resilient sphere to trap the beast he's huge i thought you said he was 15 feet (groans dramatically) i have perfectly huge balls they're large or smaller okay so i ditch that and because i saw lightning work i'm going to-- well then i'm going to have to move can i hit him now without hitting keyleth or do i have to move for that i'll just lightning bolt then level three lightning bolt it's a saving throw does my cutting words affect that at all no but because i'm armed with mythcarver when i use it my target gets disadvantage on his next saving throw oh okay so 8d6 then 24 okay i'll use that opportunity to back away and hope it doesn't get me yeah i'll go all the way to the wall yeah but not the glass god who's coming up next i will inspire grog he hasn't happened yet right i will inspire him with a hastily written limerick okay ready kevdak had these terrible knuckles they beat up on grog while he chuckled but while kevin laughed grog sliced him in half and said these are mine now fuckles (laughter) that is all i can do he's got 500 hit points and shoot yourself in the face to ridiculous size i don't know yeah i'm not there you've got inspiration oh great so it felt that did you say 50 i will heal vex'ahlia am i 30 feet away or closer well then i will walk 11 feet closer and i will use healing word to heal her i'll sing to her (singing) up up and away on your beautiful your beautiful broom (laughter) i mean it's a bonus action so i can't go very high with the level can i as my main action can't be level-- what got it well then i'll do this one at level two and i can do anything for my main action okay level two do i roll i roll one two-- that's it seven no i rolled two six i thought it was plus five well whatever oh that's right i got to mark that down i'm going to go back to right where i was and shit shitballs shit shitballs fucking shit i will use (singing) bigby's hand bigby's hand is going to make a huge fist fly forward and smash the window behind him melee spell attack well that's cocked 12 plus what oh 22 4d8 i only have 1d8 13 plus eight 21 no 22 no what is it can i use any action to take off my hat and let my hair flow matthew mercer style you know if we can't kill it we can all kill ourselves out the window sorry vax okay that's wishful thinking do we notice any rocket boosters on its heels covered in blood don't leave me hanging says bigby's hand are there shards of glass on the ground or did they all go outward can i have bigby pick up one and bring it back a tiny piece no you're on your own fuckface i'll take that please to call who is that a name that you go by she lost a lot of blood ahem excuse me your imminence-- imminence eminence as we are strangers in this foreign land we

that what is it you're a high-roller oh yeah wait have you even tasted it yet wow who said that well shit always bid on thordak getting tossed from the casino what is that he's just rolling once to see-- 2d4 it's your rules you could do anything it could be 1d8 why does it have to be 2d4 makes no sense i'm trying to wander away from them as best i can go there i think you roll first-- this is the most important roll-- seven (cheering) this is a streak at this point yeah i've forgotten matt did they say to meet in a specific spot or was it they'll know you from your red shirt okay so then i am going up to i'm walking past some of the higher rollers that i see and as i walk past i'm going (clears throat) i'm the guy i'm the guy (clears throat) it's me (clears throat whispers) i'm the guy and keep walking if they don't-- maybe lead the way i'll join him i will gladly follow (clears throat) so what have you got for me oh yes i enter and sit down again maybe maybe more if it's of a higher quality how do i know it's of a quality i'm accustomed to from my homeland forgive me i'm not from around here i don't know of your reputation could i possibly have a sample to see 20 (yelling) the whole satchel yeah what does it look like oh i'll pull it towards me yeah what is this shit it's not a fine powder it's chunky of course this isn't my first rodeo friend being that i play stringed instruments i have long nails so i'll take my pinky and sort of dip down and get a little on the end of my pinky smell it a bit on my gums a little bit spiced meat am i feeling high at all constitution check i've never checked my constitution -- saving throw well either way it's 16 i'll do a little bit more get it on my tongue (sniffing) just a little bit more to see if it's doing

mom and dad that's their job all right all right i guess i'll take it your reputation and the seeming good quality makes me believe that this is of a fine caliber quality how that's-- ugh stings a little in the eyes that's all for two satchels like this why don't we say 300 fair enough 400 it is for me to pay him sure i'll drop four hundred large four hundred thousand dollars you can call me the meat man (snorting and giggling) and what shall i call you rutur rutur and so i'm clear here this is a drug right oh really i'm not feeling it yet do i need to do more of it is that the thing oh it doesn't all right great thanks bye sorry i've got two big bags of drugs could you give me a backpack or something to put this in i mean i can't walk out of the casino holding this as they go i say

it's not me it's not they're not mine and i throw it across the room don't say anything i've got lots of drugs i don't know what i did maybe it hasn't affected me yet i know i don't know what it's supposed to do i think so yeah just one more one more yeah 13 we'll talk to some locals and figure out how we're really supposed to do it yeah two people thrown out of the club that's a yard glass we need to find out if it's real should we go back and ask those guys who sold this to me are you sure it's not real it looks like nothing hey can you nature check this you're a nature person he's fine yeah i guess i'm upstairs trying to take it anally (laughter) no one lies to the meat man i want to go back to that place and get my revenge are you with me vax vax it feels a little tingly but overall just fine like 50 he lied to me don't spend any money on it maybe it has to activate that way 17 (thickly) huh that's good shit (more inarticulate noises) (inarticulate noise) (sobbing) (thickly) be pleased maybe i can package it into smaller amounts and sell it on the street to recoup some of the money do we have an afternoon to kill yes damn it what did i do i should have insight checked him or i could've dominated there are so many things i could have done to him to find out i flew too close to the sun (laughter) i wander down (sighs) good morning all i hope you slept nicely

me down no they're mine loot crate ladies and gentlemen i'm wearing one of the shirts right now it came in this month's loot box loot crate i think it's called actually not a loot box yeah that alone

the head (laughter) (french accent) mythcarver is how some would say it can you tell me anything more about the blade but these have critical role themes to them no way that's really available i want

to this woman right we do know where she lives i have contacts in the underworld here should we go pay a visit to what's-her-butt what's our play here we need her did we make a mistake here should we have said something else but what information could this person have given us percy can you give him that piece we could sneak in we could just go down the hole see what's there kiki and i could be dragonflies and just buzz on down so our options are go down the hole get caught go find the girl with the cloak-- or all bum rush my friends at the casino and get revenge maybe they know something more about things it was my lucky gold piece that i got it was buried in with the rest i didn't notice it i need a nap that's all i need a nap you know there's also one other we've heard that there's shady people at the-- wait have we been to the debt's respite let's knock on mistress asharru's door maybe we could trade her one we could do some recon on her place i could go up to the front door

the rat do you want me to do a bug be a bug all right i'll be a beautiful dragonfly look for any openings in the windows or vents-- chimneys air intakes right so then i'll just hang out by a window

24 one i will fly around and see if i knock into anything am i in a room that's closed off can i keep going through the house all right i'll see if i can make my way five i doubt dragonflies are even in the monster manual look for dragon perception ooh i go outside immediately i bamf out there's a trapdoor we've got to go down the trapdoor no one's in the house we can just go in snickety-snack let's go in go down the trapdoor see what it is no we don't need them let's just go they'll make noise you me and you we're the stealthy ones yeah you're right we should totally tell the others i've got a bipolar thing going on manic-depressive episode anyway there's a trapdoor we should go down it yeah i did i saw the sign that someone had opened a trapdoor and gone down it wait first i'm going to try to pick the lock four all right i'll just go in there all right i will dimension door inside goddamn it on the inside no more blood toward the trapdoor and then it fades so someone came out of the trapdoor-- an alarm i go over to the trapdoor and inspect it for traps it being a trapdoor it should have a trap 17 can anyone talk to her i'm looking for other exits i was looking for other exits and entrances to the building all around and i rolled a 29 to the street single whitestone female i found a secret exit that someone could have used to come in and kill or exit after or maybe not at all how long has the body been here a week i'll talk to my contacts in the underworld we could at least ask around and see if anyone has-- but she disguises her appearance doesn't she it's a murder mystery now nice job creating an entire casino including brand new games we should really go back to this casino and ask around for ripley maybe maybe just to win favor with the locals
