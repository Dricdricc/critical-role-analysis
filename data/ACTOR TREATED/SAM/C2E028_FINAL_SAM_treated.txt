using d&d beyond for a while now and they just redid their layout took me a while to get used to it for those of you at home using d&d beyond i have a couple of tips pointers for the new layout to remind myself where things are layed out it's like little mnemonics it's a weird thing on the right side of the screen you can remember l e f so right sort of like lef left sort of that's where loot equipment and features are on the left is i a a insight and awareness i'll put that down here then in the middle is a t r which is things you can add to roll atr right up top is m s t which is makes saving throws that's what you add to make saving throws that's sam's little guide to how you can remember the layout of d&d beyond and that's it i watched part of it it was pretty good and i might watch it again so i can actually build those characters i thought you were going to say makes us feel a little uncomfortable there's no merch there's nothing merchy i'm trying to honor the memory of laura so me talking right now is just wasting time cool cool cool they're the worst oh yeah what time is it okay oh god it's midday what do we do wait is is grudge or grunge can i just say grunge is better name do you think we should go talk one chat one up maybe before we go randomly hiring people what do we need to make this attack we can probably get in also we're not attacking right we're just going to go and try to rescue or maybe pick off one or two of them or smoke them out so that the prisoners or whatever have to leave and we can rescue right we're not trying to kill everyone in the motherfucking house right well i just want to get our people out but are we going to hire muscle or magic or what are we trying to get what helps us maybe there's a place to buy some potions wait liam ashly marisha and we could bring in a lot of kindling tip of the spear it's like have you ever seen a debate team they pick one side and the other and then they just go at it for a while they should really start a debate club you said the sleeping quarters are upstairs if we went in the dead of night and i know you have a spell that can lock a door or shut a door or something we have some did you say ten oh wow oh that's a good question i'll reach in and see what she has i need my thing where's the currency in here i need it written down oh there it is liam eats farts that's right it's right here i have a few hundred gold but then they'll have weapons don't say that to her especially we have no way of healing ourselves if we die unless you have healing potions on you how many do we all have she has two do i have to go to church or anything well we did hear about that weird-- someone said that there's some priest or something or cleric yeah so we could go see if they could give us-- or come along so we can make it tonight that would be amazing though i mean healing potions are nice but we need someone who can-- we get killed a lot or nearly you know you have they don't belong to any pact or group that we would need to negotiate with is it worth asking a tasker first what would we even ask just how much it would be to hire you for some muscle oh i thought you meant us because we're right here we can hear you fjord probably not yasha's probably is okay jester has already turned she's flipped she's probably flipped are we walking or horsing for the tonight show we can still find a tasker no check your smell bag see if it passes the smell test (fart noise) oh it's a better name no no no you cannot argue with someone who talks to a smell bag sure butt-cheeks clenched speed walking no we can take the horses it wouldn't speed us up but at least we'd be on horses nila you seem to know about the woods no yes please how far to the sides does it go as far as the eye can see that's sort of cocked i'll take it anyway 11 plus nothing should we hop the fence is there any sign of life i mean other than plant life how do we get over these things could we climb them or would we get cut to shreds you mean the tapestry that seems very derogatory also you're super heavy though aren't you we could try to throw you no you can throw me sure that's amazing he's amazing i'm coming i'm just going to dash over that was 12 plus 19 is there a door how big a place is the door place on the roof or the top of the-- sorry on the roof or top of the structure are there any holes or anything 13 but no windows or anything can i go over to the window and take a peek in stealthily 12 i'll take a big swig of booze and then go over and try why do you have that with you no (shouting) do you know her do you know him (shouting) do you know him what's his name can we tag along do you need any help he's mr clay hello hi oh we have to wait we recently lost one of our friends we aren't here to bury him he's already in the ground we've come to avenge him and we were hoping to find some help in these parts do you work here is this your place do you own this land are you the funeral director it's a graveyard it's a boneyard like a boneyard sort of a place but you can't bring someone back who's already expired they've been kidnapped including a firbolg child who are bad guys we're good guys well we're sort of bad guys too are you a bad guy what do you grow other than dead tea you're stationed here are you allowed to leave no cousins or anything what's been going wrong what's that what's going wrong so your family is trying to fix that this is great so you don't have to check in every night and be here to punch in and punch out you could leave whenever you want a drip-line we came here seeking help in a mission that we're about to go on i think so do you know pumat sol by any chance what all right then no no i just had to ask what wait what would we owe you for this money tea what if the thing he needs from us is our blood or something shouldn't we know that in advance we should find out what he wants from us before we just blindly agree to this what if he wants keg some sort of like concubine thing i don't know what if he's creepy or freaky like that really wow what (warily) okay while we walk deuces it is decided where are we going back to town or straight to the-- we don't even know what he does he's a firbolg yeah but hey mr clay i'm going to shoot beau with my crossbow oh i missed (laughter) 12 sorry i was just going to test if he could really heal you i'll shoot again with my bonus action that's a natural 20 (laughter) not a sneak attack because she was looking oh boy that's ten but it's a crit does that do anything okay so that's 12 plus four is 16 just the tip oh but with this crossbow when i roll a natural 20 it shoots another one immediately do i have to roll for that one that's a 23 to hit eight first of all that was cool and this was cool now do your thing do your thing okay you're welcome is it on the way if it's more or less on the way then yeah we can at least swing by so we'd have to go through the town just to get there into the woods and out of the woods are you talking to us how old are you but there's four seasons or is it three seasons up here i don't know he's between 25 and 100 can i just say again i don't give a shit about ophelia's request or the gentleman's offer i just want to get all of our friends and get out if we can kill them great but if our aim is not to kill them it makes this a much easier mission yes let's swing by the baddies' house and just see what's going on she sniffs a purse every time she wants to make a decision no terrible idea how's the half at the house going to do no let's swing by the house and check it out if there's a raging party we'll just continue on to town if it seems dead maybe we'll do a little recon if the recon goes well maybe we'll do a little insertion the insertion goes well maybe we go steady we're just going to watch we're going to see what it's like at night so if we have to come back tomorrow night we'll know what to expect are there more guards at night we don't know they could have six more dudes who come up there at night we'll just look what and then what they won't leave we'd need to take one of theirs take lorenzo or something they'd have to come after us there would be no reason for them to leave or maybe not no it's good liam and 26 how far burch-icide what we can maybe use this we could make a distraction owl that he will focus on and we could take him out from afar silently we can kill these two i think very easily as long as you don't move can take this guy easily if-- do you fight people from afar how about you nila do you have anything that can shoot from afar well something that's not like hey look we're here we've got lightning something-- okay i mean that's-- we have beau she's quiet i could distract one while you go up and just (crack) i can shoot one with a crossbow okay controlled lightning well listen you can distract him with the actual frumpkin while i shoot it doesn't have to be an illusory frumpkin i can still shoot that's true phil's the worst i can if you guys-- i can shoot i got a shoot-y thing i can shoot them that's loud we could just do message we can send each other a message that's silent caleb's in charge we want to rescue the people who are trapped rescue the people in the basement phil's friend did you could take off your armor get on different sides of the facility with two other people we're splitting up so we can take them both out at the same time this is inside the wall oh jeez there's a second floor but it would be ridiculous to have built that also how are we split up group-wise probably me and caleb split and then-- i'll take the new one oh hey look while we're waiting i've asked the deuce-- are you married did you go to college how old are you really do you have kids well he's a new friend and i talk when i'm nervous you're right nila is really good at this she's great you married what kids do you have we'll get ready over here give us one second ashly and i mean i can just shoot if i miss then backup plan is boost-y to you you can't shoot anything oh you have a javelin i guess that's our plan b then is there anything that either of you can do to hold silence or assist me as i shoot this fellow let's not do that okay it's fine it's on me it's okay i'll just get super drunk message is 120 feet i take out a piece of wire and send a little message caleb provided this plan works after we knock down the folks someone on each party should put on their cloak and resume their guard pattern and keep walking around the wall you can respond-- oh you did she's short maybe firbolg could hunch over and stalk around she says to caleb who tells me who tells him okay oh yes see you've got a plan now we're going to shoot the man and then drunky smoky keg is going to pick up the deuce and he's going to walk around-- we're working on a better one other than shoot him again we have a javelin and that is all we've got sure let's do it no i'm still going to shoot and you're going to be ready with jav you message me a countdown and i'll say it out loud to you three two one go we're shooting at the same time are you just sipping tea you need to stealth too yeah natural 20 but you said advantage so that was a three 24 so far 24 nine come on mr deuce put on this cloak if you don't mind and climb up onto there and patrol around if you don't mind mr clay you can put his cloak on right now ooh nice mr clay yeah give us a minute i am going to rifle through the dude's pockets and go through the guy we just killed's stuff 15 62 why is he so rich but does he have anything else useful like keys okay cool anything else anything else useful no okay great totally useful oh yes let's go oh not you you stay up there let's go but be stealthy wait with advantage that was the worst still not great no oh no sure i'll pick the lock 16 plus stuff it's plus four plus three or something like that is that right yeah plus seven so 23 so far everything's going great-- and we should assume that everything will continue to go great caleb i trust you where do we go back-- okay but wait can we get beau and mr clay down here as well to help well then in that case can you carry keg oh yes you could use that spell that you used earlier recast wait for the duration-- okay so we know better we know you don't have to cast it okay let's go 23 no we already went-- you're not with us what here is a laser pointer liam o'brien was it phil and the other guy trapdoor to the bottom wow that's the whole layout frumpy sure glad we chose a spider up the stairs oh god why why would you do that oh boy what do we do now should we go in did you see a way to downstairs why don't we go try to get down to it yes if the trapdoor is open oh if it's unlocked okay got it all right no just one big swig okay let's go got to pick a lock first or check the door 24 i will try to pick it it was 22 that does not work it was a two plus whatever i said before seven i can't do it ooh push open the door with your massive strength can you get us in wait did you cast a spell oh oh wow okay that was easy all right focus up you care about me inside-- tickle right nothing left liam eats farts i'm ready got it liam and i cast mage hand just in case i will go through and wait for a tickle is there a tickle i will go straight i will try the door i

points fuck that guy i'm going to try to disable the giant larger threat than phil which probably won't work but it's worth a shot i will point at the barbarian and say oi i'm thinking of removing my spine because it's only holding me back i will cast hideous laughter on the giant thing 14 yes i took out the barbarian guys oh she has it cool cool cool tasha's at the end of its turn it can make a wisdom saving throw hold on okay i'm going to get out of there run past the laughing thing as fast as i can oh not that way the other way yeah do i try to get her weapon or do i keep running she's clutching it still you said so it'd be like a strength check i'm just going to keep running another 30 feet yeah well because i'm still trying to get where the spider told me to go huh ah this guy did you see where i went i think you may get advantage because she's prone oh my god still advantage on the attack right 14 oh no but you can still attack one more time right fuck you those dice are
