hi guys oh you didn't throw it to me yet did you hey as i tell you guys-- hey crew by the way crew as i tell you guys about loot crate can you guys get a camera up here i'm going to show some close-up things should have done that ahead of time it's on its way okay loot crate the theme this week is primal brands include x-men overwatch predator you can go to lootcratecom/criticalrole and use the promo code criticalrole for 10% off and that's some severe savings just a few days left to catch this month's theme so check it out they're a great sponsor we love them they do so much for the show we genuinely appreciate them okay that being said-- and this will tie into loot crate i promise-- i was thinking a lot this week about fan art are you on me whatever fan art they're fast so we have amazing fan artists on this show we get hundreds of art pieces every week we're floored by them constantly legitimately amazing artists talented gifted and i was like why should they get all the fun so i was like i'm going to do my own fan art this week because things people know about me i'm a talented performer and all that stuff but i'm also an emerging visual artist and this is a chance to get my art out to the world and so i'm going to present it right now guys this is art so if you have any kind of a reaction that's real-- if you cry if you clap whatever i'll take it i'm going to start with grog it's pretty good magic marker on paper i feel like i got his rage and his ferocity next up she's hard keyleth i did keyleth i should point out that all of these are signed and numbered by the artist you're hard lot of things going on i didn't know how to draw bodies so i just went with grass truth be told i was drinking so things get a little worse as we go so this is percy it's a lot of white i don't know how to paint with white or use white he's a white guy with white hair i've got to work on this one next up a guy who's near and dear to me here's taryon darrington little art tip here guys don't use blue pencil on blue paper because it tends not to show up that's a free artist-to-artist tip for you guys there is a drawing there it's just blue pencil on blue paper and then i was like the people are going to want scanlan right so this one took the most time i will say this took about an hour mostly because i had to go to cvs to get more magic markers so that was about 55 minutes of the time and then the rest was hardcore art and i feel like i really captured him he's got a flute he's got poop okay i'm going to do the twins next probably go a little wider because these will be side-by-side all right so you can really get the artistry okay here they are some may argue that i photocopied vax and put pink ribbons in her hair to be vex some could argue that and they would be correct but you can also tell them apart because he's got a knife and she's got a little bow and arrow i ran out of a lot of things and i was drinking pretty heavily at this point so i was probably fully drunk at this point and then last but not least i mean all together i'd say probably an hour and a half it took me to do all these including the cvs run and last but not least i'm most proud of pike trickfoot ladies and gentlemen now again you could say that i printed out her imdb page and colored it in and you'd be right but it is also art and i will stick by that now here's how this all ties into loot crate guys i'm giving all of this art away tonight i'm doing a contest an unsanctioned contest that i'm running myself so tonight tweet me pictures of your loot crate stuff

like a brave warrior you can make disguises that i would love to see no i want to pursue you making a mask for doty well i mean there's no disguising the fact that he's eight feet tall and squeaks when he walks (all laugh) i mean are we going to do full body paint for this making him look like he is in a suit of armor seems like a thing he's already metal he's strong i want doty with a fake nose that's all i want let's spend some time or i can give you money all right me too by the way liam if you don't have this ability i want to see this even more we're making a mask we could just use

right i'll take you under my wing so to speak doty join us hello hi greetings good day good afternoon don't mind them they're my friends hahahaha uh we are wandering merchants trying to find some textiles to buy to resell in other lands that's all don't mind my traveling companions they're my protectors i travel as a merchant with a lot of coin so i found these two at a leper colony and nursed them back to health it was also a gym a muscle-man place so they're really buff but they're also lepers and that explains their matted hair what deception ooh i better use luck ooh no that's worse (all laugh) well it don't matter okay ten yeah it is their cross to bear that's why this one doesn't even talk and this one is a leper of few words thank you might i inquire from you fine gentleman where we might find some medicine or healing potions these lepers are set to relapse that way all right i'll head that way then good day to you keep warm never i think i have a talent for it though i just felt the words coming out and i went with it it was thrilling it was exciting and they were going with it they were eating it up i had them right where i wanted them i could've told them fucking anything it was great right wow i mean two's the higher of the two right oh you don't know (all laugh) now remember if anyone asks you just go (moans in pain) i'm a leper or something like that that's good oh i hadn't looked (whispers) i think they're following us what do we do what do i do i've never been followed by guards before are there people around i was warned about you and money i won't listen to that but i will try to act casual i will just take off my gigantic diamond-encrusted helmet let my hair down (loudly) ah what a day am i right (softly) that's what casual people do they don't care what people think okay (loudly) ah just want to take a load off and just rest here for a while not going anywhere just sitting here and acting real boring right guide me you've been doing this longer all right i've read about situations like this right we just need to create a diversion while the guards are diverted we run away fast as we can right yes (all laugh) illegal i don't think so no well we are traveling around with an arcane being i don't know if that's illegal you mean potions and magical items all right but how do we shake the uards-gay well that came out weird didn't think that through (all laugh) what they do in the comfort of their own home is their own-- he can stay here and keep watch but if they ask him anything he will be-- is that all right do you think all right doty doty act cool that means book down don't say a word and if the guards get close let us know with some sort of sound thank you remember you're a leper so seem unhealthy good all right let's go inside extremely just outside the door there he's a man oh for myself do you have any spell scrolls or any sort of one-use items that i could use in a fight or a tangle with some bad chaps things that could deceive things that could use force against-- oh all right just around me or around an area i have 13 of those right here do you have anything else it's really good i've got that yeah i have a light already (all laugh) all right give me that one scroll the fire scroll i could sell it and get something else how much is that i could read it to you if that's what you're asking (gulps) watch how it's done i'm going to put an amount of gold on the table i'd like you to consider it and if it's to your liking take it and if not just shake your head and i'll put 200 gold on the table i'll put 200 more i'll put 2000 more and another 2000 17 plus seven 24 check and mate scroll of fire shield excellent i don't know what that is do i know how much these things tend to cost ooh this is not a save 20 and it's six three and one is that right i can heal myself just fine but i don't know about your friends-- do they have healing abilities a bit better but they use potions i've seen them use potions do you think they would appreciate these what was that -- welcome-me-to-the-gang gift do you gift-wrap here sir -- of course for an additional charge what if we took the whole lot of those for 6000 gold all oh wait (all laugh) yes this man is insulting your intelligence and you should be very angry right now i would object to this this is coming out of my purse and i insist that you negotiate with me and not-- (gulps) how about this i can trade you something worth far more than the extra 3000 gold this gentleman promised you it's a rare egg magical in nature it can save a life in any situation and if you eat it when you are nearly dead you will go back into battle with the strength and bravery of ten men and you will not rest until your foes are dead is this deception or persuasion 22 gentle ah-ah-ah the gift-wrapping (all laugh) i know but we're partners as you just said and i felt that you would approve of me doing so what was that oh shit oh shit sword oh shit wait we're killing them even the shop owner oh shit all right partners right i'll do whatever you say he doesn't know this happened let's get rid of them get rid of them they have jaws-- the blood their jaws are terrible i can't i don't have extra masks we can put them somewhere else oh my god what even i can tell that those are two-- why would they be in here drinking they're guards on duty i can't vomit what do i roll 16 (dry heaving) natural 20 one second one second i think that that is true absolutely all right thank you for your-- good day to you let's go doty come please as soon as we step outside i barf all over the floor (all laugh) i'm sorry it just comes naturally i can't force it no maybe a little (barfs) (laugh) (laughs) are they talking to you right now just tell them to-- tell them-- can we ask them where they are ask them where they are tell them where we are right now and ask them where they are tell them-- no there's two bars in vasselheim (incredulous sound) (all laugh) did you get it (tearfully) doty killed two guards he just killed them they're dead (tearfully) they're dead (tearfully) he killed two guards (tearfully) we didn't tell him to he just did i actually think it did actually this is evidence doty ugh no no oh because they might recognize him as the murderer no what we need to do is put another disguise on top of this one (all laugh) he won't answer any of you greg knows did you kill them with those punches of fury oh boy we're not sure doty did this outside without us being-- he won't answer you doty did anyone witness your crime i told him to protect us he's my protector he does what needs to be done to protect me well to be fair greg killed the people doty merely roughed them up i have quite a gift for you for all of you i think you'll find something for everyone in there i know where they are but the situation was fluid and it was fast-moving and we acted on our best instincts and our best judgment and mistakes were made when you're an adventurer-- when you're an adventurer you have to learn to live with a certain amount of bloodshed around you and i think what greg has told me today--what he has taught me was to toughen me up and i appreciate him for that and i appreciate the lesson and i appreciate you all for sending me out with him knowing full well that that would happen i still haven't-- i-- okay it was a potion seller it was a medicinal herbalist or something-- it seems to be-- that is not-- and do what what they did to you well you were revived from death it was in quotations i think i need a drink what and then what doty did his job he protected us who were going to arrest us because we were arcanists walking loose in the-- i was led to believe it was and i'm a stranger in this land and they were trailing us and your cohort over there the big guy himself told me that they were a danger to us and doty did his job listen you can't blame doty for the mistakes that i may have made i take full responsibility for this and i throw myself at your feet for mercy i know i'm new to this team and i hoped that this gift would be a peacemaking gesture by the way you should divide all these potions up as you see fit and i'm sorry if i made mistakes today but we're all alive we have what we need and we're still on an adventure right let's all sing our fight song shall we doty show me what we wrote (sings) 'seven intrepid warriors we were strong before and 'stronger with me drinking wine and heroes' feasts saving maidens defeating beasts we 'fight fight fight with strength and girth i slew a marid and proved my worth vix and vox 'kiko and greg and percival with the head like an egg i defeated a kraken too and i saved the 'ashari single-handedly in the ocean blue we fight fight fight with strength and girth i 'won your hearts and i proved my worth' now you all have fight songs too don't you did we take off the mask should we take off the mask for everyone or each pf i can take care of this if you'd like (laughs) i don't know if that evens out but all right i like the way you think science bro cool are we falling amazing it must have been terrible taryon darrington you will darkness (whispers) you're incredible to vox tempesta (all laugh) you have to give a speech every time improv-ed it
