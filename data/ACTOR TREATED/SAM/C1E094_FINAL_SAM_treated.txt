got it think we're already out sync-minute [music] well we can't be sure she could die tonight laura and i'm just saying i'm just saying that would be really bad by the way did you say don pardo i do i did not sign any sort of waiver i signed no waiver oh cool i don't know who that is yeah yes i'm fine yes i'm fine you know we-- adventurers lose people in battle all the time right and we have a-- it's nothing right it's totally normal this happens all the time right no no thank you i'm not-- i don't know i-- (sighs) he's-- i don't feel it would be right to celebrate right now no no i haven't all right i'll take a sip to doty my best friend my only friend it won't be the same i know it sounds silly but i created him and he's just mechanical but i feel like he understood me better than anyone else but i could tell by his eyes that he sort of got it he understood maybe i was just projecting i don't know i suppose i could build another it just won't feel the same i-- (sighs) you're right yes you're right you're right yes with some resources and some time and a little help maybe i can build a new doty yes i did didn't i hell was not but a revenge plot was and this was a revenge so i think we can tick that off (sighs) well i've been giving that a lot of thought actually in fact if you will humor me can i read you all something if we're honoring doty i'd love to read to you the last thing that he wrote well transcribed before we went into the hells as sort of a memorial to him this was the last page before doty take this down he always writes everything as i taryon darrington embark on a mission into the very depths of hell i do so with no fear or hesitation though this undertaking is fraught with peril i have a secret weapon that no inferno monster or hellhound can defeat i am flanked by the ferocious band of mercenaries known as vox machina in the days since meeting this ragtag company our relationship has blossomed at first i was viewed as a suspicious outsider then as a gallant and trusted colleague and now having proven my mettle accepted as a lifelong brother and full-fledged teammate no matter what we face in the abyss my comrades would risk their lives for me kill for me and i'm 100% sure each would gladly give his or her life to save mine loyalty like that you can't put a price on it but if i had to i'd say their friendship is worth about 210000 gold which even to me is a relatively large amount of money their faith emboldens me (laughter) but it's more than that i've started to wonder if i have so easily won the confidence of these battled-hardened titans perhaps i am even more venerable more impressive than i ever knew perhaps after this mission i should return home newly confident to confront my father once and for all maybe the time has come to complete my journey here and show my family that i am indeed worthy to carry the darrington name but first revenge soon we will venture to where nightmares are born and it's going to be fun fun fun that's all for now doty as always correct my grammatical errors before you rest and go fetch my sleep mask and nightshirt and then we went to hell he was a special special robot and-- -- he was there for me in all of my darkest times and lightest times and now that he's not there anymore i just-- i should feel very lonely but i don't because i am surrounded by people who truly respect me for who i am and i know that in that last night before we went to the hells i wrote that i was ready finally to go back and confront my father but now in the absence of doty i've decided to put that aside and stay with you all yes i feel my place is here with you my rightful place i won't have access to as much money but everything else about me will stay the same and i know that you are all happy that i've made this decision to stay with you as a now-poor adventurer so maybe this is worth celebrating i don't know should we go have a drink in a pub or something i don't like seeing lights at night it wakes me out of my dream state so-- just my eyes and nose just the top of the nose i don't think we should venture up there right now we have adventuring to do don't we things to help rebuild and-- yes sure i mean i haven't tinkered for money before do you get what two three thousand gold per little-- per year is there anything that pays much much more than that but you know what i'm ready to set aside money for now and just live my life and be my own man because if i do when i do eventually go home i don't want to seem like i'm trying to prove something to him i just want to be my own man right and have him accept me for that like you all have a man whore my hair who will brush my hair at night yes i will will you help me as always wise words keyleth nothing to speak of are you talking about intercourse i could try that out sure yeah that's a great idea yes i do not understand what you are saying rogue or ranger all right all right yes let's go no it's fine i could probably figure out how much i currently have it's just doty used to keep track of that for me do i have to roll against it this is worse this is three what are we rolling oh five i have 34000 gold pieces oh just at that last moment i just didn't want to tell her how money i have-- -- but before i'm genuinely sad about doty yes good day i just lost my best friend does it get better thank you kind stranger she seems neat hello pike hello hello oh that seems like a justification sure yeah yeah it's rough it's rough but these fellows have told me that they're going to take my mind off it with some flirting tonight yes yes i don't know i-- i assume you're going to introduce me to someone anyone you point out to me i'm pretty sure i can woo sure someone attractive-- -- someone who can have an intellectual conversation-- tall strong fair-skinned that's about it oh heavens no i mean you're perfectly attractive to some people i'm sure but you're just not my type i suppose all of those things i should be so lucky to have a mate as capable as keyleth don't worry i can hold my own i'll be fine all right okay i'm feeling confident remember i'm a darrington i can walk into any establishment and find a young lass who has heard of me and take her home for the night can we do that is that something you can do you and her all right great no no no let's follow this thread how about spend the evening with spend the evening with well no no no it could be talking it could be-- of that young lady all right i like this no no no i like this all right but let's make this interesting yes i like this i like this if she prefers me-- -- if she prefers me i'll have that magical cup of yours your magical cup that makes liquids yeah and if she prefers you over me-- -- you can have my rod why would you want to hide your beautiful head this is-- my rod can become anything you understand the helmet is worth more than you'll ever see in your life i don't think that's a fair wager against your cup the jug for the rod jugs and rods all right big boy you swing first (clears throat) yes-- excuse-- excuse-- excuse me-- madam if i may hi my name is taryon taryon darrington it's lovely to meet you i'm ashamed of something and i wanted to tell you about it my friend over there the big one pointed you out to me and said look at that beautiful girl across the room and i'm ashamed that he had that moment of seeing you before i did for knowing that he got to experience that beauty for a moment longer than i why it's almost enough to make me cry i've read many books but your hair could fill a novel with its beauty your eyes are sonnets your nose and mouth epic poems and almost-- almost any feature of you could be enough to live a life on but i'm afraid it's your neck that got me the subtle curve the way it meets your chest just so it's like a wave crashing on a beach at the same time ferocious and peaceful i want to go to that beach i want to swim in that tide i want to dip my toes in that water and experience it for myself i don't think that's a clear win the night is young i've read-- that was a chapter from a book i read i just recited it back to her i assumed it would work because it was a romantic novel that's all don't women like that sort of a thing no no flowery language and stuff to that same one or a different one all right oh there was one more thing i want to say to you i am sorry i-- i was taken before-- i want to be on you i want to be on you so bad 26 (laughter) points you're some kind of a genius how did you do that wow wow that was amazing she just went for the bad boy thing hah women are fascinating oh boy i rolled low what do you mean girls don't like the bad boy keyleth your hair is like angels coming down from the sky-- all right how much money do you have all right all right hi i'm taryon darrington nice to meet you so what do you like to do at night do you have a servant who brushes your hair or do you just brush your own no have you killed-- no a wink i'm sorry we got off on the wrong foot earlier i was taken by your obvious beauty but there's so much more to you than that i'm sure if i could-- tell me about yourself how do you feel about-- what do you do during the day when the pub's not open i'm a writer and a reader what are your hobbies those children are lucky to have a mother as hard-working as you well i'm glad to hear that you have a family because it would be a shame for someone like you to be alone yeah yes i am i don't know what i'm doing and i'm floundering a bit what's your name yes it's lovely to meet you i could end the evening right now having learned a lot from you already shauna she is awesome i like her a lot i feel inv-- i'm speechless well a draw then all right we'll continue then until this is done i defeated a goliath (laughter) talking-- oh yes i haven't picked up a woman in a bar before no no i've never hit on a woman like that before or any for that matter as i told you i led a sheltered life and i've really only had one romantic experience oh god doty was a machine made of metal really really you debonair royal no it did not my father did find out you guys are friends right liam and my father as i told you has threatened to give the entire legacy of his estate to my sister because he doesn't feel that i am ready to take the reins i'm not strong enough and i'm not vicious enough but it's more than that he caught me with a teacher a tutor once he gave me all the best tutors and i learned a lot but there was one who taught me some extra things his name it's embarrassing lawrence larry larry and tary he and i hit it off we would talk about literature and philosophy and all sorts of things until the wee hours and my father walked in on us once and i don't know what happened to him but i'm afraid he's dead or banished or something bad i don't know i never saw him again ten years older than me ashley and this was a few years ago so maybe 20 i wasn't a little boy no no well i'm a dashing adventurer and i'm supposed to attract all of the lasses of the kingdom right they throw themselves at me because of my derring-do and bravery and my hair no but i feel that-- in all the books i've read they never tell of the adventurers who go to bed with older men no it's much grosser in real life and more terrifying and so badly planned (laughter) he's probably dead no he was tall he was fair-skinned he was strong real estate real estate he buys and sells properties mostly buys and holds leases them back to the kingdom who sold it to him for a huge markup and charges taxes on people that use the properties exorbitant taxes and he shakes down people who use his properties it's all very shady and murky but it all involves real estate he's a great man he's made a lot of money and he's respected and feared by many i hate him more than anything because-- i don't know he's my dad rough me up and be poor no thank you like a house of ill repute a brothel me taryon darrington in a house of flesh talking pike are you encouraging me to go to a brothel right now yes i have i lost-- yes please your finest oldest wine i guess

you guys do yeah it was something else i mean there's periods that i don't really remember but she was aggressive when she needed to be and gentle when she needed to be and-- i've read a lot about-- that-- and a lot of things i've read were true i mean the female form is mysterious and strange and-- there are curves and-- smells and-- oh no i-- i have experienced-- the pleasures of the flesh i have now known a woman it was outrageous i didn't really know what i was doing but she guided me sometimes by force but she was also gentle sometimes and i get it now i see the appeal i understand women are soft and tender and (clears throat) they are not for me (laughter) she was so strong and i was so scared and i really think-- (vomiting noises) (laughter) no i see that i see how people would find that-- they're so intricate and soft and i just feel like i think i know what i like now and that was a worthy endeavor and thank you pike for encouraging it and grog for setting me up i know for sure 100% i am not going to do that ever again with anyone like her or anyone similar no my body is a temple and i wouldn't sully it like that when she was finished with me she let me curl into a ball there was a valley between her pecs-- her breasts i guess and there was a nice little resting place right there that i laid my head for the night and she draped her arms over me and they were like big sweaty blankets and i needed to get up to pee in the middle of the night but i couldn't so i just held it it was like being attacked by a bear have you seen the departed (laughter) can
