gilmore and kash and-- and what is this meeting i know that we have to have a conversation with asum yes well we like to talk all right then we'll see what he proposes and take it from there is there a cold place in the treasure room wait this hide is going to be cured or smoked or something whatever you do stretched taliesin what's the old fashioned word for the guy who does the hide stuff a tanner thank you but not like a fake-bake we want a real tanner right was that last sound the sound of seeker asum's bowels okay after he dies letting it all out break down the door you're an archer

jarett good to see you too what're you enjoying there oh i thought it might be something meat-based that you could have popped up a bit with your spice i'll invite you over to my house some time give you a proper chicken dinner wanted to check in on (lowers voice) the task we talked about you know the mission we discussed i don't want to talk about it out in the open but you know there was some illicit-- items of medicine sent a request you're using other people i trust you i don't trust other people (sighs) i don't have time (sighs) i haven't picked it up i'm trying to pick it up damn it it's the most difficult habit to pick up listen can i confide in you man to man one on one here you're a fighter you're a strapping young battle man aren't you i haven't felt myself recently you know we have these fights and some of them are pretty epic and there's monsters involved and i'm usually on my game but lately i'm feeling a little off how do you cope with that don't judge don't judge i don't really do that much anymore that is a very fair point jarett you're not wrong like a fine instrument it can go untuned if you leave a fine violin without playing it for many years it could wither and rot until you need to replace some of the parts in a way the same is true for my member but the problem here jarett is that i'm distracted i'm distracted by things that haven't ever distracted me before i've made a promise to someone to stay alive i've never valued my own life before and when we get into the shit i'm second-guessing things i'm making stupid decisions that i wouldn't have otherwise made yes i don't know how to harness that kind of stress do i have a keepsake i don't think so well she's not around right now to get a keepsake from how did you get so wise jarett these are all good suggestions but i'm a man of instinct and my instincts said i need to supplement my body with some extra liquid courage so if you can please continue to look for me i've heard that it can help people in moments of panic and stress i can handle a lot of things takes one to know one i know that's what worries me i'll think about what you said maybe i'll go have a toss see if that helps too yes you that was clever i will definitely get you back watch your back get me some drugs hi i'm fine one of our employees punched me in the face you don't want to know it wasn't the cooking cook (growls) i will i'll wash my face get to it how are you doing yeah that's good to hear it's been a while since we had one of our depressing chats you seem a little more chipper these days coming around to my perspective are you no not at all really do i know the fella i want to hear details dirty dirty details sweaty details oh yeah i'll see you there game face on locker room talk you look just like allura right now thordak from what i understand is extremely powerful and influential that raishan dragon is a mere pittance in comparison a small exponential ant a pawn if you will on the battlefield how can we retrieve this information without going to emon that sounds crazy is there any way to not do that i'm no master strategist but we do have allies that we can call upon and weapons and men and arms and troops however taking the fight to thordak in emon seems foolhardy at best i suppose this is where the intelligence could come into play is there some other place where we could go and try to take back from thordak to lure him away from emon so if we go into emon we're facing fire giants lizard people and that's before we get to thordak the cinder king does thordak covet any other territory or city or town vasselheim here anywhere that we can lure him to what's another the ravenites would help for a full frontal attack while we bamf into the dragon's lair but even getting to emon aren't we exposing ourselves to detection and attack we're going to march several armies across the entire continent to get there it'll take days we can at least move people to you know where's that town that was established westruun is close-ish right to emon but we can at least assemble there from all the different territories and then meet up form a plan and then march from there yeah but then once we're there what do we do at the very least should we send out some letters alerting our allies that-- it's time to start stocking up and getting ready to move the city is invisible maybe come up with a landing point as well well soon no thank you no not the cube it's a tenuous ally at best maybe we shouldn't discuss it until we're 100% sure about it oh percy no oh god why we're in crazy costumes oh god and raishan's about to leave you can't put just this part on i painted my entire body it might help if gilmore were to make sure everyone is on the up-and-up in this room you can stop poking grog give her one more good poke from her we're going to do recon we're going to send out word to gather our forces-- where let's find out let's pick a place go stab everyone percy one at a time maybe three there's a time difference when she does come back with asum this plan that we started in on-- it's a good one well we have raishan convince thordak that we're amassing forces in kymal or something thordak sends raishan to get us we kill raishan and then thordak comes to check on our dead bodies how can that plan fail raishan grog your beard might go away okay we don't really have a choice we have to work with her to some extent we can make it hard for her and we can be assholes to her and go tell her to get asum for us but other than that we have to work with her because if we don't she can destroy whitestone whenever she feels like it that's fine if she ever gets close enough for us to kill her why would she need to come face to face with us in that plan ever she could say i'm going to go meet them in kymal oh i died if we draw thordak to us at least we control the battlefield she could still be lying in wait to pounce on his body the second we kill him to do what though sure of the clasp how on earth could we-- i don't think the secret to defeating thordak is moving this thing sure there is kiki get a fey creature in here no i think they just die no there's one in the fire plane what are we doing going after this vestige when-- can any of us even use it marisha and the fire plane isn't just like dallas it's a horrible place where we could all die we're risking our hides for something that might benefit one of us maybe little pixie hi little pixie go in that room pixie's not a magical creature i guess has magic maybe isn't a magical being polymorph let's see if it goes to the other world any animals i think that's a fucking terrible idea what are you talking about we can't lure a dragon into a teleportation circle big enough to get a dragon through and then somehow assume that the dragon's going to keep running into the room with no magic and then what are we also going to assume that it's going to jump into the crazy vecna circle and become a ninth level of hell after that we have no idea that's a terrible idea i'm vetoing it what for us to lure raishan-slash-thordak to fort daxio's near emon and so is kymal we should probably go check it out but everyone wants to go to the fire plane get some armor it's going to be fine keyleth after we kill thordak and raishan becomes super-powerful raishan will come here and get the vecna orb and unleash all sorts of hells on the world and then we'll know what it was yeah i mean we can't really do anything about it yeah but what else are we saving them for this is it what else can we do you can't heal the disease we can't control this orb there's nothing else we can do the only thing else that we can do before we go to daxio is to send word to our allies i think we should grab kash send him out a quick list of who we need to contact ravenites feywild wolves laura and that's by flute wait what about our brotherhood of-- what do we belong to not the clasp-- the slayer's take we can get them too right we have money we can hire them we have a hundred thousand gold sure yes this is what we've built towards what did you think we were making allegiances for just to hang out with them we need them to fight and die for us we're going to be there too once we get there and survey the area we can come up with a comfortable plan you can make some caverns for them to hide in we're just getting them in the right county i go behind keyleth and stab three times (laughter) no i would so lose right now somewhere there's a man on an airship going do you see it yet might i point out keyleth that raishan wanted us to go to emon and face thordak and we are already not following that plan how do we get there we don't know of any trees there do we know anyone in daxio can you scry there to find a tree and don't share our carefully crafted plan with anyone the details are so precise and exact you must keep them secret hey how about we go to daxio and then you guys can catch up the airship arrives in a couple of days on the morrow be pleased liam and come on loot crate hashtag critical costumes
