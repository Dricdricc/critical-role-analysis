yeah clever wait what matt two sponsors oh taliesin has it on his ipad right there you know guys i always do a little fun loot crate thing but this week i'm not going to be doing the loot crate announcement this week my new character that i've been workshopping brody slater of malibu california is going to be doing the loot crate ad i've been workshopping this i've been doing some acting coach work with it it's a showcase for loot crate but it's also a showcase for my acting (laughter) i mean we're versatile actors and i just want to showcase that to the people definitely so many announcements it's all debbie gibson i did no i haven't i will tonight i'll go down to spotify or geek and sundry or wherever you get them and-- of course i did i listened to mine (laughter) my best friends who i support by showing up (laughter) have you done it yet more and more and more and more and it's perfect for when we play all the other dungeons & dragons twitch shows in our softball league a lot happened a lot happened in that break that's small picture we're big picture instant for us or a teleportation circle yes but we do have to rally with your pops and also didn't we cut loose 55 soldiers to wander free in the desert from daxio they're just going to form up right but can we scry and figure out where this other army is maybe we'll go there or maybe we should scry on our old keep and go there those seem like two good locations sure but we've told the approaching army nothing about any plan whatsoever and strategize when we get there once we see their forces and what they have to offer all right do you want to go talk to gilmore vaxy-poo a painter to paint our exploits i have a man at a casino that i really need to get revenge on all right but we should bring any potions how we doing on potions did you ever divvy up our last several potions is that true i know an airship oh shit where's our airship to where did we say emon or did we say daxio thank god we're sending it to a dragon instead of a fort on fire all right besides gathering our forces here gathering our potions here and telling gilmore where are we going let's put it to a vote as we always do democratically grog grog where would you like to go to the army waiting just outside of emon or to our old ratty keep with nothing in it okay putting it to a vote three choices ready to your dad to our keep or to vasselheim i don't know why but it's been mentioned we don't have a plan lead us o mighty vex so they're going to create a diversion for us we have to communicate this to them but now they're a little bit overweight and they work in an applebee's yeah so we have a clear plan then where are we going that's all i care about right now yeah but we'll be together and i don't think that i'll die last time i looked in there was some movement or it looked like people had recently been there nope they're off somewhere else sure we've got to get there first and suss it out too we haven't done any recon this army of your father's we have no idea how big it is if they have archers if they have an elite swat team task force-- if we know we have an elite swat team task force we can take them down with us into the sewers also if we do any recon we might know that oh there's a big thing we need to have taken out before we can even get in what if our keep is being surrounded can you scry on a dead thing do we have anything like that at our keep dvr it yeah sure wow fortuitous good scry how's my comic book collection is it still there who little guy i'd like to be the shortest on this trip please oh when we walk near his residence let's walk around i know why you want him to come would you prefer me to go we do have a rapport oh i need to go see jarett (laughter) i just want to see jarett he's our most solid ally and most dependable friend he's been there for us in our time of need i feel like it would be a big pick-me-up to see him (laughter) splitting the party five ways this is where the live studio audience is supposed to applaud (laughter) ladies and gentlemen (cheering and applause) this is just how the patrick rothfuss conversation went i'm going to give a seat just to my cup because we have the space here to do it 18 28 friend jarett just coming to check on my main man j-money it's j right you're right well it's going to be quite a fight can we count on you to come with us perhaps we would be honored to have you with us and as you are still technically our employee there'll be a bonus for you at the end of it oh yes i wasn't aware there was a-- yes two bonuses you deserve all of them the other thing that we had talked about did that ever come to fruition oh oh we're speaking in code okay yes i need a lady so bad and you were going to find me a date so is she a brunette okay i don't know how long to keep the cover going suude wait are you a cop you have to tell me if you're a cop are you a cop okay good all right how much do i owe you for this jarett thank you for this thank you very much and i'm cool and all but do you put it up your butt or snort it or do you burn it somehow or wrap it in something or eat it i'm pretty cool but-- (laughter) off- in a pipe of some sort all right when you get her number call me or whatever so we'll meet her later that went well i got that i did it that's huge true yep do we have the money for that all right bagels and lox who needs fire giant i mean fire resistance the most we do that one seems like a specific task they are all super powerful and are awesome and you'll see them in battle tomorrow they didn't become a robot real quick who needs the fire protection vex you don't need it didn't i give you that oh i gave you cold resistance what did you give me acid resistance what more discussions no we're going to sneak into his lair right the plan as i understated it is we send a vicious army to attack at the gates all over the place drawing out thordak's forces in an epic battle blood sinew and gore everywhere while we slip under the city unbeknownst to thordak in the tunnels with the clasp leading us leading us right to the center of town where we pop up and surprise thordak he didn't know we were coming he thought that there was an army at the gates and we stab him real quick and leave and at some point raishan comes and helps us the clasp does they're an order of rogues and thieves who hate us but they're going to help us we totally trust them because they are scoundrels and liars and we have no other choice (laughs) it's pretty air-tight yes yes he can escape at any moment he can fly just a partial group yes our plan (laughter) we should have him with us always (laughter) we have no leader except we do have a secret weapon we have a dragon who definitely wants something that we don't know about who might or might not be working with us we have a sword that is a dragon-slaying sword liam and yeah i carry it with me always i use it all the time we'll never know i'll be dead long before it works raishan i feel like she's going to meet us there we're not sending them all in i also think there's a swat team that's available to us smile more (laughter) kash why are you drooling and staring off into space (laughter) oh just a little well why don't we finalize this plan tomorrow when we meet with the general who will be-- what commanding half the forces okay let's go why-- why not go talk to him let's go to him when vex wants to spend money i'm in agreement oi pike can you do a heroes feast for us thanks pike no we're doing a heroes' feast do you need it oh we don't need to do grog he's not here and we have advantage on wisdom saving throws zabar's is there an elite swat team task force hey where's our stone golem he's gone let's go talk to the warmaster we are the worst people i could put a slight illusion on it but it'd be pretty easy-- oh yeah well we sent word to them didn't we didn't we send word to everybody do that we also need to contact gilmore (dubious noise) (sigh) feels so much better oh shit (in surfer accent) hey guys don't forget december's theme is revolution featuring items from assassin's creed mr robot firefly and

get to a sewer did they ever show up did the 50 soldiers from fort daxio show up well not asum we know where he is 20 blocks yep absolutely an hour-- we can probably make it i don't know we can make it deep into the city but not all the way to the center can we so we should go now or we could just wait for sundown and then go knowing that they're going to strike at the same time no i mean once we get in there we wait until we pop out until it's getting dark outside what about a storm can you make one what about-- kiki what if you just made some lightning strikes to signal the start of the fight the storm isn't a real storm isn't it air ashari to greyskull keep be pleased remember the plan is chaos small world man small world natural 20 right here as well can i go in the kitchen and just sort of sense magic or do an arcana check or something to see if there's any-- i don't have that my poop is still there it's just inert it's just poop oh is it still there in the jar that i left
