watch you don't know oh ten why is it disadvantage if it makes you feel any better i lost money on jester on the next one probably unless he mops himself down at night wait think about his sheets what a disaster his sheets must be no my hometown is further to the south it's the opposite direction yes but there is no hometown we travel around a lot we have an area of operation but never really called one place home yeah there's tents and some people sleep in bags or huddle together whatever we can find really leaves no it's terrible would you like that no it's not fun at all you find whatever piece of cloth you can and wrap yourself in it and some mud and that's your bed it's terrible that and many other things yes have you ever seen a goblin before yes well have you seen any others have you heard stories of them i mean you can tell me there's no love there everything you've heard about goblins is true they're awful in every way all right so that's true but it doesn't really matter if you're good or bad we will come and steal you if you are a child anyway take it easy we would share with the rest of the clan but of course we would eat children i'm really not goblins are terrible terrible creatures with great honesty i can tell you that i've never eaten a child kind of hard to read listen my clan i can't speak for other clans but the goblins that i was with for quite some time we stole from people we stole food we stole money when we could we stole clothing and provisions but when times were tough we would steal the people too well goblins don't really-- i'm sure i have parents yeah once a child is born and nursed for a bit and then it's communal property as soon as you can work they give you a job and you do the job everyone in the clan i assume is related somehow but-- yeah there was no real family ties caleb as always is right i do not have an urge to kill and eat children i do have cravings for things i assume you other species do not rats cats sometimes bacon i really like bacon just in general meat is pretty good but no a human child is a wonderful thing why would i want to kill or hurt a human child no i'm not bloodthirsty i just get hungry for food sometimes not for flesh i just like meat i would love some (eating noises) no i like children a great deal no not in my belly you're borderline offensive listen everyone this is what happened to me here is my definite backstory --one day-- all right what is it does it look like good smoke or bad smoke when you say it it has such a different color to it they're burning people we call that a barbecue (laughter) we could just walk over there it's a hassle to turn him into a bird yasha's leading the way the cat yeah do it nothing great can we stay the night there for all of us or just you i would like that laura okay we will but you can't see in the dark oh yeah i will aid hmm what what is it which direction point to it oh shit are they all on one do i see anything or a health cure arrow never going to happen anyway caleb this is what happened to me as-- oh no you said goblin-like creatures nice improv you're asleep though oh wait i never said mine 15 sorry wait what'd you have molly okay miss oh that's right from the first shot take it car face i yell to caleb modern literature then i run towards these two goblins over here yep i take out my hand crossbow and i point it from the goblins to caleb and i fire i'm aiming for the book strapped under his armpit that only i know is under his clothes and i rolled a natural 20 travis and he's going to play dead modern literature that was my bonus action for my action i will tell the two goblins-- now i have a bonus action can i use it to talk okay so in goblin i'm going to say to them i'll hold them off you get the loot with the horses it's in goblin 13 wait this is persuasion or deception 13 no don't save him you're blowing it i should have told everyone the names of all the set plays (pigeon cooing) like real or like see-through are they real or are they see-through wolves where are the wolves you're strong you got to close out of that to see the-- (texas drawl) booming blade yeah mollymauk what did you attack full amplify okay i'll hold up the hand crossbow point it in yasha's general vicinity and say i'll finish the job sister i will fire at the ogre oh no only a 13-- oh wait no it went up 14 yeah i think i get all the sneak attack ugh 15 plus fury of the small 19 all right yes i'll say shit i missed let me try again i'll reload and i'll go pop and shoot the goblin right next to me oh no i missed i have movement but if i move away-- no i'll just stick spiritual weap but she's raging by the way matt last round i should have done 20 points of damage not 19 because i'm level five now matt's falling apart how will the writers communicate with him without those we'll see his feminine wrists (laughter) jesus 21 points against who marisha and oh shit do i get a-- oh sure i mean i can't use my crossbow as a melee-- no can i do a hand punch 20 20 strength bonus oh 17 my unarmed strike says plus three to hit for some reason i have no idea why zero he's going down take it as a pet oh i'm going to turn and chase the goblin that ran away from me mm-hmm how far away is he okay well with 30 feet i will take a shot okay okay just one right seven points of damage he had seven from the magic missile plus a one point punch cool i can't see the other one that went towards the horses right all right i'm going to use my bonus action to dash closer to the body to see if i can recognize this goblin some people have sleep apnea oh shit did i look at the goblins over 20 23 do i find anything interesting on the body of toxin can i grab those i've got them all right i'm going to rejoin the group i did not no this is not my clan at all which is not surprising since we operated not in this area no we did not i've heard of goblins hanging out with ogres before and i don't think they're too dissimilar but we didn't i think so it was very rewarding yes i'm only sad that one got away what do you mean do i hate myself no i'm cool i mean she had wings so you want to talk about that instead well i know that i'm a goblin for as long as i've been alive i haven't felt comfortable in my skin for as long as i can remember i just feel like i shouldn't be-- i don't fit in with them it's not just that this feels wrong like i should be in a different body the way they act and the way they are it's just not me they do horrible things to people and they seem fine with it but i don't know i never felt the same as them it's not that i don't like myself or anything i think i'm okay but i just don't like how i feel when i see my hands or my feet they just feel wrong i want to be different not in my clan no but there was someone i think i was telling you before that they give you a job as soon as you're able to do one they tried me on so many different jobs but i was not a soldier i was not a good cook i wasn't good at sewing or building so they stuck me with the torturer i wasn't the torturer i was the torturer's assistant no i saw a lot of things and there was a halfling village not far away they captured someone from the village and they wanted me to kill him but instead i was kind to him and he started talking my fellow gobbies didn't like that but they allowed it because i was getting valuable information about where the halflings kept their food and where they went to harvest and where we could attack them but i became friends with him he was nice well i hope he got away we left together it's not important he was just a nice man i don't know he was a chemist so he taught me about alchemy and liquids and potions and things and he taught me his language when he had taught me everything he could they said to kill him but i didn't want to so i got real drunk and i created a distraction and i hope he got away i shot one of my fellow goblins in the butt he yelled a lot then we ran off in separate directions and i've been running ever since i assume back to his village yes i know but i don't know i can't go to that village i'll be stoned to death i'm a goblin you could maybe go i mean we're going the opposite direction i don't know if we should go back there's too many bad people around there what if i run into the tribe what if someone from the village sees me they hate goblins yeah that was freaky deaky i know yes i'm okay for now just getting away from them has been wonderful and i've met you caleb and you don't seem to care how i look or who i was well let's just call it a hyphen for now and maybe we'll move to an ellipsis or something that's okay i haven't eaten any children i have no desire to eat children but i've seen children being eaten and goblins are awful they're terrible in every way if you're not good they cut you or kill you or throw you away as fast as i could being me i think i was probably stealing some food or something all right it was booze but you know they're not wrong right the people who arrested me are not incorrect if you see a goblin you should kill it on sight yes absolutely not none of them are i have never met another nice one ever and i really tried no it feels like i was in a very average tribe that would be fine for them but like i said this is not me i don't want to be this i'm never going to be cool with this ever too much water are we on what's going on sure let's do that thank you caleb i tasted a baby once just once i didn't know they were handing around a bowl i didn't know what was in it and then later somebody said there was like-- i mean they put a bunch of different meat in there how was i supposed to know that it was like a goulashy thing good night oh no you have a thing did i miss that in the announcements six more battles before we get there
