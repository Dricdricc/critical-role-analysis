should note that doty is coming with us as well it was just ten days first of all i am very powerful but there's some things that i can't do all right ever since you found out i was short you're much snappier and snippier with me maybe i should yeah because i'm known around these parts so that would probably be better i'll put on the hat and become the meat man i have many places get off get off

sorry about that is anyone in the room now matt besides-- all right so we can drop all of the illusions they all know what's going on now even chod i went to get them to tell them about the thing that we found i was going to escort them there do you think you have things handled if we go for a day sorry i didn't know you were throning well when we're in command yeah not true not true no i didn't i came to make sure you were all right and is everything all right have we heard of any other attacks or incidents yeah the ones in the mountain in the cave what about buyers have we had any new interest just remind him to put some imperfections in it he always likes to make things too beautiful we want to sell real things not things that look like they're brand-new if things are really old they have dents and scuffs on them you should trust me because i pay you all right so we'll be gone-- we've rested recently right so we'll be going for a while and just hold down the fort while we're gone also i know it sounds stupid but can you look into getting a few ducks just as pets yeah i know it's just a thank-you yes just ask just ask us and that would be fine too you should always assume she's fucking with you every time if he does we'll just eat the ducks sure okay do any of you need any supplies or anything before we go are we good to travel on foot healing potions i can heal with my words why would i need healing potions no i don't have any of those but it can be arranged if you are short i can have my second here look into it for you crutch will you-- that's gold no you cannot buy any but the crutch here will look into it while we're gone we won't have any until we get back though no we have to just go of course jack off jack off jack off i know i've been rather quiet this journey but i could just provide us with a few more if that would help things-- yeah sorry it's odd for me i will rip off my last remaining potion patch on the robe which has four small healing potions so we have seven regular healing potions the weather is certainly dry yes i certainly have it's good to be back but i'm a little nervous i don't know why really yes new dynamic only because it's under the helm believe me it's a nightmare in there if you look underneath unfortunately yes (laughter) there's nothing to wait for what are we talking about now that's an attunement item we don't need that shit let's go all right on we go (screams) why am i playing the tree oh okay yes they are definitely making fun of you we can't really do that we need to know where the tree is that we're going to be going to i haven't been there have i i have not been to the place we are going i do not know of any tree not too many we're ten exactly that's ten isn't it 290 miles we don't at all

that's-- you're going to just shoot something in there what if they see it fly in keep him honest good old four-luck o'brien i don't even know if you guys want me to come in with you i've taken you this far but if you need me in there i'll come all right let's make a hole and go in and then we can camp the night inside no do not do that i scanlan shorthalt can go get it if you'd like i can go get it if you'd like it's easy i'll be there and back in two seconds you're an expert marksman you know within 100 feet yeah how about this why don't you shoot an arrow right now outside the cave same strength and see how far it goes i have ways you want to come the way i always go dimension door it can't i assume great you can't i'll just go dimension door 400 feet straight in 30 go back will you hold my hand it was very dusty in there soft un-tread earth no i forgot i was looking for the arrow that was our mission are we trying to dispel the magic or are we going in the other way maybe we should just make a decision well if he's going in taryon will go in and identify the thing 17 but i've got identify so it's one-time use so we're good to go in this way if we'd like should we use our flashlights or no doty's going to click his boots of whatever his boots of elven yeah elvenkind scanlan got 29 taryon got 25 and doty got a two but with his boots-- what do his boots do shit okay 17 plus ten yeah do you want to stop and camp i feel like good old chod should be near the tip of the spear since he knows the inside of this place a bit taryon next with doty with him scanlan will be in the rear fine if matt wants to change the rules 100 games in i guess so right now i'm looking at the back of grog's ass but i got a 19 for the door the mansion okay it takes a minute to cast do you want me to that's 100000 dollars yo six figures moving your direction i mean you told me to do this right okay i'm out of the fight then so i'll start casting and singing (sings) when people keep repeating that you need a place to sleep when everybody starts retreating but you need a really cool keep let scanlan open the door let scanlan open the door let scanlan open the door to your house and an idiot shall lead them a gif of cording probably a minute i put some new art pieces in here they're all counterfeit but still good the menu's changed quite a bit kaylie got sick of chicken about two weeks in so she's got me on this vegan thing (sighs) she says it'll make me last longer and feel healthier and stuff well you know live longer she said all that meat was probably bad for me so it's all salads now yeah different kinds of salad that's what she told them to make and that's what they're making now well i don't want to cross her she has me on a diet and i'm trying to stick to it it will be all salad tasteful yeah sure it's there maybe we should all retire to our rooms for a while and come back for dinner oh that's the fancy fellow you've brought with you the new scanlan yeah right hello i'm taryon darrington i've been quite pleased to spend some time with your friends for the last year and it's-- you have wonderful friends you should honor and cherish them they are the best people i've ever met in my life and this is a lovely home you have (sighs) it's nice to meet you too thank you for looking after my friends i guess any friend of vox machina is a friend of mine you can use the downstairs the basement room no i don't have bunkbeds no i don't think i do but there might be some spare cots and stuff downstairs yeah it was destroyed but rebuilt it's lined with iron now in case there's an explosion yeah sure that will be great that will be fine yeah let's go maybe he's born with it well to be fair you hadn't spent a lot of time in my room i need to get every angle don't i sure rummy gin gin rummy pinochle spades hearts okay i'll deal i will win i mean there's a lot to talk about in a year we-- we went on sort of a walkabout me and kaylie went off to the woods did some camping we found some travelers and sang to them and told stories like we do entertained some folks some nights were spent alone some nights in the company of people who wandered by we weren't too far away from whitestone after about a month or two of being hobos i guess she wanted to do something you know anything she was getting bored she's young so i told her i don't really have anywhere to go but i do know of two fuckfaces i have to get revenge on i asked her if she'd be interested in that and she said fuck yeah so she came down with me we got a boat went across the sea and we went back to that casino it was really the only piece of unfinished business from our time together that i had to deal with well when i got my revenge on them i learned a bit about what they were up to they weren't really drug dealers it's embarrassing but the drugs they sold me were not real i know that's hard to believe but i was swindled by them it is true they sold me a bunch of shit but they were in this other game of selling counterfeit stuff so i did the thing that i knew would hurt them most i took away their counterfeiter and now he works for me so i put them out of business and i put me into business and since then i've been doing that for a while and it turns out i'm very good at it we don't try to swindle people who are innocent we started off by taking down-- well not taking down but ripping off a few guys who were corrupt officials in the city and built from there it's not a big operation if i can be honest with you it's just me and kaylie and a few other people thank you it is kind of cool i have this persona and people know who it is and when i go places they're scared of me a little bit that's true i helped a bit i don't know maybe we all did our part we all did our part i don't know what that game is but i know i know listen i did a lot of thinking over the year and i-- yeah i appreciate you all much more now than i did and i realize that you probably appreciated me too but at the time i just didn't know i was so used to being a loner that i didn't know really how to behave in a group that's all so i left really that's not true you don't have to apologize for anything it was me it was me and i don't know if we'll ever have what we had before but i can tell you that fighting alongside you all was the best time of my life and not because of the glory or the fortune or the fame that we got it was just to fight alongside you and to see the looks on your faces when i did something really cool in battle but you've got this new guy and he seems really-- he's very handsome oh really zephra heights you are happy that's so weird but still with the black you're not giving that up i mean some turquoise could pop it up a little bit that's true how's that all going yeah i'm certainly better off than i was when i left you all i don't know that i'm happier just better off most certainly listen thank you for coming up here and stuff i don't really know what to do with the others i'll try i can't reach you too i'm sorry we're not going to play cards are we yeah okay sure yeah you should just go i mean yeah i hadn't intended on it but there's definitely a mirror in there there's lima beans no the closest we have is lima beans if i have them make chicken they'll tell her and i'll get in trouble don't do it listen they make a great cucumber salad they've got an excellent endive a couscous and a tabbouleh yeah it's really not filling at all it's terrible for what i mean if we all rest when we wake up those things are gonna be swarming outside the door right we can do that maybe we should sleep no they have to be invited for a while oh no we're fucked they can make you a fruit smoothie she said vegan no eggs yeah sure yeah that's a thing oh shit wait we're all still eating breakfast oh god the door's open i'm at the door i'll step out into the fray just to watch i saw (laughter) he's so strong i've never seen anyone so strong and powerful before yes six that one's cocked reroll it six (laughter) as he rolls i will inspire him i'm going to sing-- oh well that's fine that's fine okay that's not as good to this 15 five plus ten chod that was amazing you slew those skeletons like they were nothing incredible yes it's good to have someone like you by our side are you drinking it or just pouring it all over you are we all back in the mansion i think i know what's going on grog grog pike can i say something i feel like there's some tension between us and we need to clear the air if we're going to go fight today you guys are really bad today well and i think it's because i haven't made you feel at ease so can i please just take a moment before we go out there and just for once and for all say i'm sorry to you guys for what i did and how i left things i said things that were really cruel and meant to hurt you and that's wrong and i'll probably regret it for the rest of my life but i needed to go and i just didn't know how to express myself and i'm so sorry that i insulted you pike i've said awful things to you for as long as we've known each other and i can't take them back but i can at least try to be a better person and can i confess something to you during the last year i've-- i think i've been praying i mean i just talk at night and nobody hears me but i guess that's praying right and sometimes i talk to sarenrae because that's the only one i know and she seems cool and she seems like someone who could be a good guide and it feels good and i even wrote a little poem about her and about her teachings it's very simple but can i tell you it it's really simple it goes everybody people everybody bleed everybody need something everybody love everybody know how it go i know it's stupid but there's a certain logic to it it makes me feel connected to you guys even though you're not there so i say that to myself every night before i go to sleep yeah and grog i can't apologize to you because words don't work i wasn't going to i was just going to give you a gift because the times we had together were the best times ever you might be a little slow but you're the best friend i ever had and our times together were great not because of our conversations or our witty repartee it was because of the fun we had together and the experiences we had so last night i wrote something for you i know you can't read but-- i just got you a gift because if you won't spend time with me now maybe you'll be able to spend time on your own so i wrote you this maybe someone else can read it for him there's really long words nope nope it's elvish grog i love you i'm sorry that we won't get to hang out because you hate me now but i would never replace you and if you ask me right now-- i will kill him will you go drinking with me some time is that true laura and he sang a truthful check sure i'll roll a truthful check natural 20 i'm so sorry i missed it and i hope someday we'll sing together in a drunken stupor together maybe that will remind you i was an asshole grog i'm sorry i would never never replace you ever you're irreplaceable that's incredible i had some time last night listen we need to go kill some things right now but i just want to say to all of you i'm so sorry the way i left it was awful of me percival i said awful things to you i said awful things to all of you but just know i've done and said worse things to kaylee and she's forgiven me and i've done and said worse things to myself and i've managed to forgive myself and i hope that someday you'll all be able to forgive me and until then i'll just keep trying and that's all i can do and after this fight if you want me to stay and you guys go home that's fine but if not maybe we can start over (whispering) you've seen that you've seen that those are the guys (whispering) we should kill him let's go kill them maybe we should all go wait are we all going did everyone else leave if he's going i'm going natural 20 taryon's still asleep dickbutt hey in the store tonight we've got lots of-- (as tary) 34 35 other side doty one hello yes i'm not decent yet come in come in hello of course i'm doing my daily preparations i had to pluck my eyebrows i had to comb my hair my unmentionables needed to be washed and-- yes i will identify these objects oh oh i'm jacked in oh my god there's so many items what we have here is a scimitar of speed you gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magical weapon in addition you can make one attack with it as a bonus action on each of your turns but maybe this guy can do it we've also found the third eye of awareness a single polished stone of smooth jade is affixed to a grey leather band that loops in the back the wearer gains advantage on initiative (gasps) oh little elf girl no it's a leather band of course vex gets this all the times we've had together the last item is called the iron bands of bilarro this rusty iron sphere measures three inches in diameter and weighs one pound like my dick (laughter) you can use an action to speak the command word and throw the sphere at a huge or smaller creature like my dick that you can see within 60 feet of you as the sphere moves through the air it opens into a tangle of metal bands like my dick make a ranged attack roll with an attack bonus equal to your dex modifier plus your blah blah blah if you hit it the target is restrained until you take a bonus action to speak a command word and release it doing so or missing causes the bands to contract and become a sphere once more so it's like a trap ball trap ball once the band is used it can't be used again until the next dawn like my dick it's just that gnome he's so weird and he rubs off on people like my dick oh i'm doing it again well it seems like you guys are working through a thing and i should really be getting back home anyway i don't know i don't feel quite as needed any more how did he get in here after this is all done i'll say my proper goodbyes but i should be going he's your best guy right you need him he's part of the team he always has been i love you both i'm definitely
