on it and ask what sarenrae would do like us sure if they had enough people and enough wagons but however if we leave all this gold just sitting here won't brigands come and rob it and pilfer it we

marks like wedding rings or-- any particularly small ones (laughter) i'll take a sapphire can i do some sort of arcana check on some of the stuff have we done that already it just finds magical things

that's good bonus points there that's up to grog i don't think so well met well met five pounds of gems good game good game well we just have a few things to divvy up i've learned about the book that we found from the dragon it is filled with knowledge that can increase someone's abilities the abilities that i happen to be very good at would be even better it's not my sex abilities actually technically yes technically yes my sex ability-- charismatic abilities permanently better charisma oh shit is it a never-ending beer jug is it just beer or is it any spirit or what okay now you're going to get a bunch of mayonnaise shipped to our po box (laughter) i also found out that that one of the vials is a potion vial it can temporarily give the drinker a spell of etherealness which is like you temporarily turn into casper the friendly ghost you can pass through walls anyone who drinks it oh it's rubbing i can rub it on your back for you no it's vex tome of leadership and influence i'm torn keyleth you have some charisma issues shall we say well i'm just saying that i am quite self-confident sure of myself some would say charming and this book would make me unstoppably so-- so i don't know we could roshambo for it what does the group think me why don't we think on it it takes six days of reading to take effect yeah you live for many centuries keyleth you can have it nexties (laughter) speaking of old are some of us older than we used to be what if we don't want to be any younger i don't know a girl never tells her age no i'll get young again slightly i do yes (laughter) lao tsu all right i'll give you some tips ooh uh-oh they've already attacked who controls him stereo into westruun sorry for the wait fabulous writer good person charisma what's with all the questions narc (laughter) nope oi what's your name kerr and tell us about yourself if you don't mind ooh i like i'm an adult man percy maybe you guys could collab on a joint project i actually might have a project for you if we have a moment possibly actually this raises an important question what do the people of westruun do at this point do they rebuild do they go underground do they leave and abandon the city nope you are incorrect but where are they going to stay i've been down to the sewers and there's crazy giant creatures down there also the dragons know that the last dragon who came here died i insight check him 19 he just said you fart what was this about loot crate i trust him with my life i pledge my allegiance to you sir what was your name again well we were down there and there was horrible creepy things we could clear out the sewers i like this guy i just feel like he's an honest man he's a good guy he's got a nice twinkle in his eye and i recognize that as a sign of honesty because i have a similar feature yeah the light has to hit it just-- well there's only 200 we could have a huge meeting and put it to a vote is there a way to hide the city with magic we've seen that done before we could spend a few days here and get them started before we go on to our next thing yes i guess if we gave him away but we need him tell him to walk is that your lying voice we'll give you instructions he's a strong man we can send one of the stones with them wait there's three options for these people and they have to decide for us they can stay here and live in the sewers they can go to what's it called kymal where they're still accepting refugees or they can wander off into the desert that's what i'm saying oh where is she is she around wake her up tell her her dad's dead she's druish he stabbed you in the back (laughter) kern meanwhile i'm telling my table a story about how i won a cannonball contest last night it was in a dragon's lair i was amazing (laughter) ew it seems like a waste oh no no no you did it wrong the people who've lost their city you're going to prank them no the central-- where we killed kevdak also i don't know if he remembers but sometime in our revelry last night i asked kerr if he could-- i gave him a sheath just a sheath of a sword-- and i asked him if he could make just a little-- there's some metal components to it-- i was asking him if he could just make a little secret compartment on it like a place that you could hide a little vial or a little powder or a little note or something just in the side of the sheath yes extremely i don't make the best decisions could i have inspired him i will give him a limerick to inspire him with have you heard the legend of shale one eye elderly frail to a black dragon she told you may be ancient but i'm old and somehow lived to tell the tale (cheering) great i understand thank you for your nimble fingers next time i'll ask percy to do it (laughter) also before we go to the meeting i haven't used it in a while but i would like to use my scrying potion to-- not potion the scry that i left at our greyskull keep so long ago to kind of see what's going on at greyskull yeah yep we all know what it was but still standing oh okay or maybe our staff okay no no poo doesn't work that way travis it's a one-way street i left it in a jar in the kitchen and i told the people not to open it i'm still reading my book but yes we're just going to ask them a question we don't think anything we'll support their decision right what do you think we have a lot of other things to do-- let's talk to them i'll be with you two days' travel my girl is there yes i'll be going there anyway kaylie get their attention all right i blow my horn to call the meeting to attention i'm doing sign-language interpretation (laughter) kymal as we speak upwards of 40000 gold are being delivered by your finest men this with our help can help construct a sturdy underground layer that will shelter you if the dragon were to come back it will take days possibly weeks to construct this but if you wanted to stay this would be your best bet however we are not forcing you to do anything if you would like to go with the fellow refugees to kymal or find your fellow citizens scattered about roving in the lowlands that would be fine too we need to come to an agreement today so that we can help you do what you want (whispers) you don't live here old magic (whispers) he's not that bad that's definitely vex yeah and we have 40000 more gold coming that's four days of entities-- what else are we going to spend the money on for hundreds and hundreds of people if i may if i may i'm so sorry i know everyone's talking here a city is not just a collection of houses and streets it is a person of itself and we can't go dividing it right now everyone should stay here everyone should be a unit a cohesive unit and we me keyleth and one of your own pike will definitely travel to kymal to spread the word if you give us a list of your ancestors family members friends we can get word to all of them very quickly 28 i'm going to hang near him in draconian pikey-pants do you want to have gone to kymal or do you want to have stayed and helped i volunteered you to come with me to kymal you can a couple days and back oh yeah you could bamf us there let's go do it that's true i can fly yeah we can get back on our own it's two days nope you're coming great (coughing) third wheel trying to get some action here (laughter) no this is great it's great to have an old dude with us also (grumbles) (laughter) let's go spread the good word about westruun and the great things happening in sewers there yes and that it rhymes at some point in our journey i excuse myself for ten minutes drink my last shit-scrying potion poop out a little loaf (laughter) the scabbard yeah i like it thank you all right so we've spread the good word are people going to travel back do you think i hope we're not sentencing them to death that's true and i will also go to look for dr dra and kaylie at some point 27 oh god is he okay i'll go and ask oi shorthalt hi you too how's he pike has healed feet before while she works on

i go off to complete my mission you know i know i'm not the father that you wanted but i'm the father that you have and i'm sorry i just wanted to tell you that i've been doing a lot of thinking about you and me and where i fit in to the life of a family man most of my adult life i've been longing for a gnome to care for and i met a really good one and she's here and her name is pike and she's beautiful and wonderful and possibly my soulmate but i've learned that she's not my family and never will be you're the gnome that i'm to care for forever and i'm doing something very stupid now with my friends we're going to try to save the world and i didn't know why but now i know and if we die doing it it will be for a good thing and if we don't then well i'll find you and i'll be whatever kind of father you need me to be one who's close and helpful i don't intend to but you know i was just inside a-- all right i promise you i promise you well you do the same all right stay safe i got you a present it's a ring it's a beautiful ring because you're a beautiful girl and i'd like you to keep it no never and you're also strong and you'll need this sword and i give her my singing dawn blade which has a unique little imperfection at the bottom of it and i say this sword has killed a king which makes it almost worthy enough for you i hope that it keeps you safe until i can see you
