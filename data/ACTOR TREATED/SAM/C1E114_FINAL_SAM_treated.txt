myself i mean i'm not going to get anywhere higher in the order hey i think he's looking pretty rough with advantage natural 20 26 ones are an automatic fail twenties are not successes right dc it's a plus what now charisma i mean there's no way we can beat the amount of damage he did 27 the whip falls to the floor what does that mean it sunders the tower but that map was so pretty how did you make that how did you build that thing no saving throw at advantage what why so holy aura's gone that was fun it saved us a bunch of points of damage though how does he make love (laughter) wait can your

myself i'll sing (singing) i give inspiration it's just what i do every time they try to knock me down i just get bold i give inspiration every time i do every time i open up my mouth it comes out gold oh no i'm just giving myself inspiration in general you can't do that oh fuck well in that case forget it i don't do that at all do i see anyone or can i inspire anyone from my distance well then forget it i don't do that shit balls i can't do shit i will dimension door to his chest not inside the chest i would be hanging on the outside yeah bonus action am i within range of any of my friends to inspire them vex how you looking you looking rough okay then i will sing that same song but as a healing word instead 2nd-level okay and what is it 2d4 plus six 11 points oh okay so i've just landed on his chest i look in there and there's no girl in there anymore shit do i see bigby's hand do i have enough movement to get to it would i go out of melee range of this guy would he get an attack of opportunity okay i'll grab that thumb instead (laughter) yeah i'm good oh no this might be the happiest day of my life but still alive who can she affect we're all going to die wait have you gone yet liam have you gone yet did you do anything they're okay they're okay it was the yearly bounce house festival (laughter) that's not good is this a spell scanlan one is going to counterspell this i don't recognize this spell 20 would i know what level to spell-- seven 22 gulp can i hold onto bigby i wish to let him leave while i hold onto bigby and get my attack of opportunity (laughter) am i within melee range to make a mythcarver attack i would like to let the spirit of the sword overtake me this is only a reaction so a single attack then i will use my war caster ability to cast bigby's hand at level six and i will say you leave when burt reynolds says you can motherfucking leave (cheering) right on his fucking head if he's flying up i want him to go boop all right so this is 6th-level 4d8 becomes 6d8 right oh roll to hit shit ooh no it's a two plus 11 is not going to hit no no i've done so much this turn 6th-level gone 7th-level gone ready that's smart and then spend the rest of my turn eating mayonnaise (laughter) guys of all of us i'm the one who's flying right now should not be this way wait what did you do do we have to it's an illusion just let her go we're literally playing three dimensional chess right oh four daggers the book what if it's just lady chatterley's lover or something aw shit so what was your total damage no no i just didn't hit him it's okay i have no more reactions right we're still in the same round that's cocked what's that what was it that was pretty cocked oh you're inspired matt does not like that sure oh shnikes four is that 56 points of damage that's with no save i don't know what my dex is i'm looking ac dexterity of ten so he rolled a 15 did not so he lost some points but he has my hit points what does he have i'm looking i'm looking sorry i got it you go on with your thing okay so he's still alive i have no reaction right it hasn't come back to me yes as wish including me he died as he lived making the world a little bit wetter can the audience even see me right now okay 14 points of damage does not make me lose concentration right okay what was the first hit that we took how many points the golden snitch you just took a drink and you're back it really is bigby's hand is still near him bigby's hand will attack and strike two that's my bonus action can i use my action to strike again i have to do something else that's fine hey question before we go on earlier you said something when ashley did something and you said and when anyone heals in the future it's a plus ten or something what was that so when she heals anyone-- 75 so i can't even hit him with anything really she's a planetar i turn into a giant eagle and i'll fly grog up polymorph on myself i stand up using half my movement yeah i don't know how far they can fly i'm sure it takes time to get under him and stuff oh he's enlarged he's engorged so it was-- so it's 40 next round i can get close no no that's fine i mean bigby's hand couldn't have moved down and gotten grog and gone back up right sure so bigby's hand's gone ooh he wants to hold on (singing) hold on to your love-- up what hole up the butt marvel puzzle quest heal some shit remember scanlan is heading up towards you now as an eagle but we are within range of you you can heal yourself if you're down against what 26 hit points (laughs) right it's what it says how many meteors eagle rolled a ten we're going to need you pike what are the two types of damage i'm dead i had a hundred points as me and one point as an eagle oh god what no no bonus actions you can't pour anything in my mouth i don't know is that right matt because you won't get any bonuses once you hold your action he probably can concentrate on more than one thing no i don't know and attack bonus action shit do i try to counterspell this then can i do cutting words is it a melee attack probably 60 feet that misses great that was fast don't keep us in suspense for too long took three rolls and a bonus pass me that not bottle of alcohol there's a plan percy's building a ladder all he needs is a wood shop and about 25 minutes oh no it's something else we saw you die put on the hurt yeah you're up to 20 you're at 32 matt our young lady over here would like to bonus action something oh double hex he's already hexed all right double hexed and yours is up wait what we're getting farther apart god so many levels oh wand of fireballs can get him right i could hit above him i will stand up who's near me is pike within inspiring range or-- oh wait actually-- i'll use five of my seven fireball charges well it starts at three and that uses one charge so four five six seven is that my spellcasting-- no it's a dc 15 it saves shit and it's 8d6 9d6 10d6 11d6 12d6 but halved okay 14 25 that was good 40 yep and i'll call out i need a lift i will bonus action 2nd-level healing words myself oh terrible okay so i get another ten points that's it i can't counterspell his counterspell but i'm not too far away from her but that's not how it works okay all right pike divvy it up i need more than a hundred how does this work matt does she know all this inherently and vecna's also back to full right she's really nice wait is he freezing the wyverns or the-- she did have a reaction can she use a reaction it can do anything human or monster what baby what just happened three of us oh oh oh i would like to know his wisdom stat please matt that's what we have to beat with our trammels it's a dc ten plus five for each divine trammel yes plus ten wait so the trammel is a dc ten plus five for each trammel fused to the target so he's got a plus ten to save assume that he's going to roll at least a ten so we have to get all three in at least two wait is that the stat i should have asked for i think right and if we get three in him 75% chance and you've got to assume that he's got some feat that can get him a ten whenever he wants right critters we love you thanks for watching the show we barely do 50 hit points a round dang unless he can halve it or something what telekinesis what's he doing what does that do that moves things right what's on there what's that going to do yeah but you just gave damage to vecna right did he maintain his concentration matt what is he going to do with that thing does it smell like taryon does he have hunter's mark or anything oh god so he needed ground damn any sort of advantage nine that's not so bad right guys so what is that total everybody are you going to use it to kill me matt 32 hit points i cannot protect against that i have no counterspell that reaches him right that hits great doesn't have teleport nope that hits 14 i'm at three no it doesn't bro-barians super far from the guy (whispers)
