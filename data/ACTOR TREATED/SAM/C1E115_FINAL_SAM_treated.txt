wishes are grog i'll go along with it if you wish to keep the sword that's fine with me great okay sell me on this he's just flexing his face muscles no he does this when he needs to go poo i've seen him do it i mean it's been a hard day i think we all need a really good bowel movement did you get some boon or boost or something really conflicted here he seems totally normal to me pike do you want me to try to stop him what's going on pike should i do something or no why don't i help him fight it i will cast suggestion on grog using my last level two spell and suggest that he think long and hard about maybe fighting back against this sword one more time he's made his choice oh vax comes back and kills you they're holding it for you arkhan misguided and he's got another hand that he could chop off too one in reserve i was fighting a god i didn't really catch his name away we shall oui oui sam travis and i've got a thing actually i've got to get to are you apologizing for something that's stupid i never said sorry for leaving well i'm sorry sorry i left that's fair she's asking for somebody else i'm pretty sure she wasn't asking for her i would suggest that we-- there's bars here right in vasselheim they drink don't they why don't we go find a tavern somewhere and let these people pick up the pieces and give them their space ashley i just texted you the contract yeah pike i have a porno book that i really think i shouldn't have anymore can i give it to you to take it away-- oh you'll take it okay it's not great sure yeah we need to go have some toasts to vax laura and

check on greyskull keep i don't know we'll go to whitestone and figure it out that's where kaylie is right we assume oh why you've got to go back to your people sure that makes sense pikey-poo where

that what have you got i've seen this before haven't i i think i was with you when you got the guy rich wasn't i i was with him when he did one of them though 15 i'll watch for now probably if we're going to do that we should go back to whitestone first we're traveling now we're drunk that's a young boy love you yeah you called it that works now or forever i want to go see kaylie i guess if she's around are we hanging out together or are we breaking off all right i'm going to go see kaylie hi you with a dagger in your hand's always a little scary not any-- (yelps) okay it frightens me a little you okay good surprisingly yes we won thanks i'm sorry that i had to go do that i had to so what now do you want to go back to ank'harel and keep criming i'm so happy i got to see you again i thought for a second that when we said goodbye it was the last time that's true only good people die yeah no i hear you i don't know if it's for me either it was fun it felt like we were killing time a little bit there's something else that we should do i don't know what maybe your thing won't be my thing that's a good idea yeah that's a great idea we'll train a replacement passive income right it's the dream i should have thought of that that's amazing did you finish school do you want to all right well let's do that then you go to school listen i've made a lot of mistakes in my life and i don't want you to make the same ones i love you and i want to support you in whatever you want to do at this point my time has come and i've done my thing and my thing is done and now i want to help you do whatever it is that you want to do if that means i can be close to you then great but if it doesn't then i'll come visit every once in a while we made quite a bit of money as the meat man and it's a good sum to get started you can have the best education all right education for spite i like that sure whatever you need you won't have to worry about me anymore thank you thank you for coming into my life i'm so happy i made so many mistakes but it turns out that some of them weren't mistakes after all i'll snuggle and fall asleep in the room at some point i'm in my room now you were wearing eyeliner to our fight that makes sense she's letting grog go first yeah yes make it good oh here's the deck negative two to everything the crew's laughing something's bad something's very bad wait pike saw him you get a reaction wait read it again can anything reverse it wait she rolled she rolled something oh that was her 20 from before oh my god travis why would you do that her internet just died does she get a reaction or anything with her 20 she saw she can't yell she can't cast something all right she rolled a 17 to grog he was the dumbest of us all he was the dumb and the dumb the halls of pandemonium god you asshole it's a good side quest for the future someday yep hand them over you may lose your belt for this friend percy lost his arm rescuing you you've learned a lesson that we had to pay for pike can you hear us yeah i texted her the gist of what happened well i may have been fibbing about that part nice any other things that we need to wrap up for the evening no i invoke the third contract bring it in what do you want to do you mean two weeks ago or are we after-- oi pike now that percy's arm has healed i'm fine yeah that bugbear came out of nowhere don't worry about it i'm fine me too thanks for saving us all in that big fight i care for you pike i've always loved you since the moment i met you and i'm so happy that we became friends as well thank you for everything thank you for putting up with me when i was a shit and i hope that i've become more tolerable for you after all that we've been through i was wondering if i could ask you a question i have a proposal for you if you don't mind well now that everything is safe again and back to normal i was wondering if i could take you on a date to a restaurant or something then maybe if it goes well we could go on another date and that's it well then i'll let you do it no you do it i don't want to-- i take it back i don't ask you on a date oh no the internet can you hear me ashley (groaning) that was a yes oh sorry i'm having a text romance with ashley johnson right now no i'm ready i can pull myself away from pike for a second (clears throat) i have one prepared well she's not here so i don't know but i wrote down-- oh god i love this my plan what i wrote down was find kaylie make sure she's okay help pike repair vasselheim or literally whatever she wants to do give all money to kaylie except for my platinum bracelets with sapphires worth 2500 gold that i send anonymously to sybil to make sure she's taken care of long term i would like to use my wish/teleport to check on kaylie every now and then at school or wherever she ends up i don't know but we'll wait until we get to ashley to find out how things are going with our dating otherwise in my free time i would love to use my time to write down the epic stories of vox machina from our meeting to saving the world and everything in between it will be difficult as scanlan is not an author but he will rely on guidance from ioun herself and may even ask sprigg to be a copy-editor of sorts the working title is in the belly of dragons the legend of scanlan shorthalt and vox machina working title and i hope to finish the book by the time i turn 71 oh i'd be 70 when we started i was 69 yeah i mean that's about it i think every once in a while i would maybe try to see if i could see vax or check in on him somehow but i don't know how other than to scry i love it no i had written a letter but yours is much better yeah that's great i didn't know how much matt was going to put i can read the end of the letter no it's fine you did good no you did great much better should we roll for dating (laughter) like second-base well or even better than that absolutely no i think the most free i've ever been is with you sure the weird family dynamic weird roommates giant lower floor tiny upper floor i mean i would have to ask wilhand for his permission well then i would go leave some flowers at the grave oh i will ask grog for permission grog as the father figure in our weird household i would like to ask for your permission to wed your not-daughter pike who is much smarter and older than you i have this little black rock that you gave me that's pretty good i won't hurt her i promise nope i know you could kill me in my sleep would you walk me down the aisle and by walk me down the aisle i mean carry me down the aisle (laughter) all right let's have a group weird hug do i have to convert pike do i have to convert i'm an iounian okay i'm good multi-faith ceremony there you go is he dead damn it 8000 gold
