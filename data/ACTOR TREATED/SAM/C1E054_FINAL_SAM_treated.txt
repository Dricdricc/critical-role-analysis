shut up taliesin jesus (laughter) don't worry you're not an audio professional i'm wearing some of the stuff from the crate right now i think i play a synth and there you go good plug nothing's happening nothing's happening (laughter) taliesin do something we have so many things that we need to do we need supplies we need to parlay with our allies we need lots of chains for that we'll need some bindings of some sort chains hooks spikes is this about kaylie because i'm still worried about her but i don't think that we should discuss her right now we have other things why are you harping on this she's my daughter (laughter) okay yes we could use it in some way well what has he eaten because it could be nasty in there of course i could melt in there i'm a little man and he's got acid on him listen if there's a man invented who can go to where shit is made and make some really good shit that's me so let's pursue this as a plan b is this about kaylie again okay yes you're saying that a sullen loner who is confiding in one of his closest friends while holding him on the shoulders this you never had before i'm glad to be with you six points of damage (laughter) all right so i'm going to go talk to vex an expert in dragons i hope and ask her how dragons work how their bodies work where they're vulnerable where they make the acid where they have lungs where they have stomachs how many stomachs are they like a cow with eight stomachs or something so if i miss end up in that gland that would be not good also vex vex'ahlia thank you your brother tells me that you have some sort of acid-resistant something is that your primary armor how would you feel about me asking you to take it off doing a little unbuckling and giving it to me instead we could swap armor i have a pretty broad chest these are pecs i have cold snap leather armor cold resistant maybe the dragon will throw snowballs at you plus two on top of the armor so it's four can we do that well ladies first shall we make it interesting and play a little poker all right i very slowly and sultrily unbuckle my armor let one strap fall let the other strap fall just do a little shimmy and let it fall to the ground sort of like the crying game just sort of camera pans up a little bit and it's just there's nothing underneath it's just me and the cube and i cry a little (laughter) go with what your body tells you to do how are you going to take off your armor oh really well what does mine look like oh these are like c-cups up here (laughter) oh they went down all right i feel good about this now we'll continue our dragon lesson i suppose well i think we all are you know he breathes acid yeah so we could get hit now i'm more protected than you are i'm very charming we're all planning on doing something and i don't think that my part of the plan is any stupider than yours will be so good luck to you i'll keep your armor safe hopefully we can trade back and if not you can peel it off my dead body pillow fight (laughter) whatever your name is i wrote it down maybe he never told us her name scottish (laughter) i'm trying i'm trying he's not can we um grog i can come with you grog if you need some help excellent description i'm on my way noja were there any hidden compartments or secret safes where you kept the good stuff 16 oh he'll just tell us i assume sir we're about to embark on a deadly adventure to try to clear this town so that you can once again live here safely might we trouble you to borrow these potions if they can be in some way helpful to us do you know what they are oh i could be small oh wait thank you so so much so teeny-tiny no no no this is most helpful do you know anywhere also around here where we might pick up some chains hooks spears javelins all right oh no this is so helpful thank you let me go get those oh oi oi i was just-- i'm enthralled by these potions they're fantastic and i'm enthralled and so happy that we met you again and all that i totally remembered who you were (laughter) should you get-- should we tell him to get out of the city or fight with us we aim to finish the dragon maybe even tomorrow and make westruun free once again would

eagles just screech in pain as they're entirely ruined so his middle name is the hope and his last name is devourer it's hyphenated yeah probably oh jesus is it big in there i can move my arms though okay that's good i'm going to get that rod out and click it yes okay that's good that's positive guys we're getting somewhere is that my movement is that my bonus what is that sure okay well i guess that's my action and i guess as a bonus action i can't really do anything (laughs) i can't inspire anyone because i don't think i can hear-- oh i'm going to use the earring shit fuck i'm going to just start screaming and say can you hear me vax fuck did vax reply did he move the rod supports 8000 pounds of pressure i know from my experience going to the pubs with grog-- i'm fine how's my lungs how's my lungs am i dying here while you're screaming i'm almost out i'm going to see if i can last one more round in here well as i was saying i know from my time drinking with grog that any sort of blow to the stomach will really make you barf pretty easily so i'm going to set off a thunderwave at level six and hope that he spits me up you're done friend sorry yes thunder damage yeah this is totally thought-out 7d8 so it'll be halved okay 25 only 12 points not vomiting does a little come up and he swallows it back down i don't know did that make a little air i can't do much else do i have any movement even in the water i'm in a womb-like state all right then i can't really do much oh shit no i would've had to call it earlier never mind i could have done cutting words after i cast my spell but i didn't so forget it shit i know this is the best place to be we're only going to suffocate and be crushed our earrings should work we don't need to talk yeah he's dead you don't know if it's vex's it could be anybody's text us your move one more (terrified laughter) you want to go keep going it could be a long night oh so we'll just skip next week and come back in two weeks why don't
