concentration circlet the pearl yes i did want the pearl but what (confused laugh) what does it do so does that mean on one round i could cast a spell and also activate the spell that's stored in there i've never run out of spells so it gives me an extra level three slot let me think about it let's think about it and strategize we'll do this tonight the three level spells i don't use as much as these but if that's what you'd like well you did silence me that time you didn't have to he liked it you also abandoned the party in our most dire moments yes so if i abandon you all and come in at the last minute and take the last shot i get all the credit i don't think so i'm so sorry i missed the last part because my awesome hat was blocking it sorry we'll discuss soon i go back into gilmore's and i ask if there's-- if either they or someone else they know can make a specific kind of potion i forgot to ask-- hello gilmore you look particularly perky today i was wondering if i could inquire about a specific kind of scrying potion that i would like made for me it's a specialty item i don't know if any exist oh is that patchouli i smell gilmore when we get excited i-- well never mind that anyway i'm looking for a way a potion that i could maybe drink or use to help me look in on a place that we've been to recently i could maybe leave a mark of some sort and then use that mark to magically scry into that place i have a dark side so i would be drinking this potion and it could affect me in other ways all right and how much would such a potion cost me wow did i give away my ruby last time how much would this get me i don't have any dice (laughs) 23 oh 21 just tell me how much it's worth first do i sense that he's lying where'd it go thank you ooh 11 (laughter) what yeah let's do it i'll give you the ruby for the potion but i would love a hefty amount of a potion not a single use but multiple use that would be lovely thank you gilmore one one wonderful day one glorious day more more bigger ooh why must you dicker hi you're back all right shall we start adventuring then two days oh we're not leaving yet i was mostly spacing out last time i'm going to

that when combined with-- when consumed can allow me to leave a mark of some sort that possibly i could use to have visions of what is in the area the mechanics of which i would not like to get into at this moment any chance to talk to you gilmore leaves me happy beyond compare i am offended and terrified at the assumption that i would sink so low as to spy on my good friend and future wife pike
