concentric circles glowing yes hello hi i look like your brother but i'm shorter yeah for them you can have one of my greater healing potions will that suffice oh i look like a full-size percy oh cool speaking of looking like percy and cassandra vex that is you right vex if you if you look like cassandra you could conceivably get in front of the briarwoods without them knowing that it's an enemy for a moment maybe long enough to fire off one of your-- don't you have some sort of sunbeam arrow or something that would be pretty baller i don't know we could fight them in five minutes don't do anything which is that would never happen i'm more measured than all of you i'm percy (laughter) our meal is still active as well we need the benefits of that plus there is a rebellion going on it's been what an hour two hours they're probably mostly dead by now just to point this out before we go in and kill ourselves we have evidence now we could abandon this whole thing go back and fight our day in court right that was a stupid suggestion keyleth we're all seemed differently it's very strange onward i will be right behind the meat shield i run over and i say pike pike what happened you disappeared before but now you're back are you here to stay what's going on we're so happy to have you here we're all healthy and we have a new member well a new traveling companion this is cassandra with pike with us we can do anything can we hang a sheet over her or something and pike some gas if we're going back out the way we came in well we'll just have trinket run first grog you suffer no poison damage we had our meal no pike the evil of this place is making it hard to maintain her connection i got this that don't look good should we send some light up there i would just try to-- oh yeah that's interesting (laughter) terrible why don't we just walk past it no let's get out of here they wouldn't build a huge bronze trap room within their castle no they've lived here in peace for five years what would they need this for this has some sort of use for their magic this is not a trap room we've been beaten by doors before but goddamn it we're not going to be beaten today i go to the center of the room and i find that little button thing and i'm going to press it i'm in the middle yeah can trinket touch a stone or cassandra cassandra make yourself useful for christ's sake my friend back in gnomolia where i'm from wait hold on as much as i love pike you aren't a real person right now maybe we should swap out pike oh it does work never mind pike i love you grog can you hit it wait but are you going to hurt us we're all going to get hit by what you're doing what you can do that yeah do it it's one on the wall yeah i step into the acid and i start hitting the one in the center with my fucking stupid sword okay big arrow what was that 18 plus something i don't know how to hit things is that a d20 no it says 1d8 plus three okay that's not much 11 11 i have a potion of acid resistance that i drank not the face as my bonus action i turn to percy and i say percy we're surrounded by metal and glass and stone above us is there anything we can do to that stone can't it burn can't you do things with stone keyleth what does that do what side is this on the ceiling okay absolutely is it my turn again 17 to hit ten one down acid melts whitestone the whitestone on the ceiling you're flying i say to everybody when cassandra put her hand on the hidden gem outside the glass it closed the doors right if i put my hands on that while you're putting your hands on the inside gems it might open the doors right yeah but maybe if we do the other ones it would still work is it worth a shot i could no i can take pike of my height oh my size not my height i can take pike wait no there's four of us in here and four gems left or i could go outside the stone door and see if there's any more buttons out there to press pike shall i take you with me the best thing i've ever heard you and me in a room alone together i take pike by the hands and i will dimension door out through the glass to where she put her hand on the hidden gem is that right my leather pants are singed (laughter) pike now's a good time to talk about us don't you think no i'll just put my hand on the gem okay try to put your hands on the other non-destroyed gems do that more put your hands on the gems can they get two gems each and my hand is on-- come on work damn it could trinket do the other one where's trinket no i'm out pike my love is there any way you can get to the other side of this stone wall to see what's over there break my gem all i hear is (muffled noises) i think percy wants us to kiss pike he said the power of love will inspire him what did you say ashley she said 16 get over it and does the stone door behind us open squeeze gem me and pike a goliath (laughs) we're smart three points mine's halved right so it's two should i get out of here and try to start working on the stone pike is there any way you can get through this stone wall to the other side to see what's there oh no we can't hear you the darkness is consuming her who me four it's the evil oh so we can swim through i'm going to do that i'm going to take a snorkel are there any buttons knobs levers did i see vax push that okay so i will push that guess i could have done that before sorry i wanted to wait until they were gone that's what it was i was waiting until they were gone i see stone acid a very handsome gnome-- oh wait that's me and a big button that i just pressed oh hi see you guys you look green none no more buttons or levers out there nothing else all right do that wow is your bangy thing okay is it your sister 27 one is this egyptian pyramid-sized big there's 200 stairs before we go stomping in there should we take a short rest and heal up is anyone besides me and pike damaged at all we don't want to start traipsing up they'll see us coming or we could wait until they get up there and then go i'd gain a few hit points but it's nothing bad i can take a potion thanks sarah palin not really how far away are the four figures from us right now do you want to just hit them hard 600 they're going to be inside though before we get halfway up it's for grain storage (laughter) no stop it me and pike we all look like percy the gnomes we're slow maybe we should split the party further do we see them closing the doors i inspire pike real quick just before the battle i just look at her and i say roses are red violets are blue we're both gnomes and you are so foxy (laughter) stay out of sight but get as close as we can it's a french tickler what's this what's going on nobody 17 i have the highest initiative there's smoke between them all right i hear talking i come around the corner the second i see her delilah i will cast lightning bolt on her i don't know anything actually are they in a line is there a way i could get in a line i wouldn't know anything about her so yeah i blast i don't know was i would i know anything would i know that enough not to cast it all right then undo i will undo and i will instead-- i will try to blind her through my hand cone of clarity it would be 19 oh i'm sorry blindness oh jesus i never use it so i don't know blindness is a constitution saving throw she makes it so i wave at her (laughter) is that my movement can i get the pillar between us and can i see anyone else okay then that's it slow him down that's the first briarwood damage she can't see anything so she's 80 feet away oh god just know ashley that sprinting in like this will take you right in front of the briarwoods oh feigning any bonus moves there pikey nice catch that pike he healed himself hi oh no the strength thing well it can still kill you do it this is it this is everything right here and grog 6d6 it didn't work as soon as she does that-- do i see this i do not see it it's a dead roll a dead roll it's between two that's terrible four okay

i'm sorry i hold my action and my movement and instead i will inspire grog with a little harmonica ditty (harmonica) oh is it his turn now next i hold can you put on the boots as a bonus action it's too long you're inspired i will take my move now and i will (singing) bigby's hand (speaking) and i will raise up the hand somewhere between sylas and lady (cheering) mister is injured right and she is not flickering anymore so i can get a good hit on her as well i will go on her i don't like her so i'll punch her in the face oh okay is this through the cone oh so do i just roll to hit okay
