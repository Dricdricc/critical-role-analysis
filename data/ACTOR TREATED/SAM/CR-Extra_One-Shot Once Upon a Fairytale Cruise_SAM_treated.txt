guests the decor is frilly tables adorned with flowers hors d'oeuvres drinks and life-sized ice sculptures showing naked couples locked in romantic poses an eager crowd huddles around the dance floor cruisers of all ages and backgrounds-- humans elves dwarves even a giant and among them are you all formally clad wearing name-tags and presenting your best posture you suddenly see a hulking ten-foot monster with sunken red eyes and a ferocious toothy muzzle if you saw him anywhere else you would probably run but somehow his pink leisure suit and cheesy smile erases any hint of threat everyone follows him with expectant happy expressions i forgot to hit play on the music-- (music plays) he walks to the center of the dance hall and addresses you all welcome to the storybook love singles'

romance in unexpected places he glances over to beauty a gorgeous young woman in a ballgown who laughs politely and curtsies back rawr am i right the crowd chuckles politely (laughter) i kid i kid we'll be dining and dancing at sea for another day and then arrive on pleasure island where you'll go on romantic excursions culminating in the famous hot coal walk but first we'll start the cruise with a fun 'getting to know you' exercise called 'speed 'dating' we'll pair you up according to those questionnaires we had you fill out and give you 90 seconds to meet and see if there's any chemistry if there isn't no big deal there's plenty more chances but if you do sense a spark let me know and we'll pair you up again so let's get started can you guys all roll a d20 and tell me what

time i think we have a potential match here excellent excellent i'll write that down okay and our next match for the evening will be scarecrow and goldilocks please come out to the table the scarecrow stands six foot six is lanky wobbly and stuffed with straw his eyes are a little crossed goldilocks steps forward a strong young human girl in a pink dress she belches as she steps forward to meet her match all right i will start the clock and please leave your hearts and minds open to new adventures h all right that was excellent everybody listen congratulations on getting to know each other we're going to continue with other couples and they do you guys go back have more drinks sip on your cocktails etc while you're all being matched up in different pairs the rest of the room is going on speed dates of their own sleeping beauty is paired up with jack but he keeps talking about his beanstalk and she dozes off the cute little hunchback of notre dame tries to get a word in edgewise with the very bossy mary mary quite contrary and then little miss muffett hits it off with humpty dumpty it's great at the end of it all the beast returns okay well done everyone i tried speed-dating when i was younger but my dates would always scream and run away before the clock started right beauty so he turns over to beauty she forces a smile and waves okay now go refresh those cocktails we'll have more romantic activities in a few minutes and if anyone sensed a spark of chemistry in that last exercise come over and let me know i'll be by the bar as the beast leaves the guests mill about refill their drinks over at the bar what would you guys like to do who me i'm taken but thank you oh yes so that's a potential match we'll schedule an excursion maybe with the two of you later let me write this here so i won't lose it yes i can't-- we tried to reschedule peter for another cruise but he had a thing apparently so he needed to come on this one and who am i to turn away a customer don't worry we won't pair you up together we'll try to keep you as far apart as we can we're sensitive to exes on this vessel and everyone here is just here to have a fun time including peter if you'd like me to have a word with him i can or a message you'd like me to-- it's fine all right here take a drink ticket on me all right excellent h sure go ahead h the bar all right there is a half-elf bartender behind the bar a nice older gentleman hello may i help you you get standard rail drinks like ale and mead but if you want anything-- cristal that would be a premium beverage that you would have to pay additional for oh you have a drink ticket ordinarily it would be two gold but yes i'll take this he hands you your drink we have a lovely sparkling rose top shelf well he goes and gets a dusty bottle and blows it off pours you another glass all right h there's a little side deck off the banquet hall that you can see the rolling waves and stuff if you would like to go outside or you can stay in the banquet hall so they walk towards the window in the porch yes as they talk the mad hatter is mingling about i imagine yes and actually-- actually a very tipsy big bad wolf is staggering across the room knocks clean into you doesn't say sorry just keeps going he's seven feet tall he's loud his breath reeks of cherry brandy he's walking across the room towards goldilocks yeah just then the big bad wolf interrupts your conversation and says goldie baby what gives i invited you to my birthday party last week it was a kegger no show what's up you too good for the big bad wolf he puts his paw on your shoulder and goes in close sure you have a reaction you're going to cast shield (laughter) no i fail the big bad wolf knocks straight into the shield and doesn't quite understand he's kind of drunk he tries again he just keeps hitting this invisible wall he's like ugh what the fuck come on i'm just trying to talk to you what does that have to do with anything come on baby i could make you howl all night come on all right fine he goes one more time and hits the wall i think that's message but i'll allow it hey he's crazy this guy who knows what spells come out of this guy h it's a type of magical spell h neither do i it's an easier spell to cast he has one called message but he in his craziness has reinterpreted-- so the big bad wolf suddenly feels tension relieving in his upper back and lower neck and also your voice in his ear telling him-- what are you telling him what oh this is fucked up he retreats he's freaked out he leaves in a huff the audience hushes as the beast tries to get your attention again (clears throat) all right everyone all drinked up and ready for the next exercise good h oh we can do this later all right i can see the drinks are flowing tonight henrick go easy on it from now on now it's time for our second big event it's time to learn the official dance of storybook love singles' cruise the electric slide and who better to teach a clumsy oaf how to dance than my own bride here she is the real animal of our relationship beauty take it away beauty rolls her eyes at his stupid joke and strides onto the dance floor okay listen up you scrubs the electric slide is the most alluring and easy to teach of the slides there's only five steps you got to remember i need a volunteer who's it going to be oh you goldie all right get up here okay the first step you do the grapevine to the right one two three four and tap your foot roll an acrobatics check an acrobatics ability check plus so you fail you try to do the move but you go the wrong way you're on the wrong foot you stumble into beauty causing you both to stumble it's okay let's try again all right then you grapevine to the left one two three four roll another acrobatics check okay you stumble into her again it's worse her dress rips a little it's awkward h yeah if you don't mind we're going to move onto another helper if that's all right please go back down there and i'll get somebody else anybody else want to try yes you small man come on over the electric slide is very easy to do children can do it you first grapevine to the right one two three four roll an acrobatics check oh yeah you all watch as the mad hatter seems to already know this dance by heart he goes right he goes left he goes back he goes forward he's got hip movements and swagger he does a little thing with his hair at the end he blows a kiss to the audience h the audience is enthralled they applaud as the class goes on everyone's having a good time learning the dance suddenly and quite without warning-- oh boy the ship which had been gently gliding through the ocean lurches to one side knocking glasses off tables and causing some of the ice sculptures to shatter to the floor is this working yes a crack echoes through the dining deck beauty and beast both seem concerned surprised a moment of silence everything seems calm and then boom another larger explosion rings out from above you rocking the ship violently to one side everyone please roll your d20s for a dexterity save what'd you get h okay so ten for you yes go on noelle hatter and wendy both fall to the floor wendy actually falls into some broken glass and you take one hit point yes on your face it's pretty badass the explosions above grow faster and more intense shouting and footsteps can be heard above deck screams of pain just then a sailor one of the crew face bloody runs down the steps into the banquet hall yelling beast we're under attack the skipper's been badly injured beast says attacked by whom i don't know but they're flying the skull and crossbones pirates in these waters okay everyone stay below deck for your own safety beauty you too beauty protests no i'm coming with you (roars) no stay here says beast no i can't risk your lives you're my paying customers please stay below deck he darts upstairs with the sailor you haven't seen any pirates yet i'm bleeding and cut h oh actually that kind of feels okay roll a medicine check h okay so ten yeah that feels good it blots out some of the blood and he feels weirdly better h thank you strange man i-- h it's soaked in blood are you sure h another shot fires a cannon blasts through the side of the hull into the banquet hall splintering chairs and tables hold on-- yes it hits and kills hansel hansel is dead the cannon takes his head clean off h she's just screaming the princess and the pea is screaming bloody murder she hasn't been hurt or anything she's just overreacting the rest of the ice sculptures all smash to the floor you notice the hunchback of notre dame this kindly old man has fallen to the floor he's writhing in pain he is he's small i'm sorry about the music he's foaming at the mouth convulsing he seems to be having some sort of medical attention shake him okay it does nothing he is still convulsing violently that does not seem to help him at all he's definitely having a heart attack are you proficient in medicine oh what would you like to say to him to-- yeah no that's great the hunchback of notre dame sort of comes to again suddenly hearing the sweet kindly music of peter pan and feeling the warmth of a bosom pressed against his face he starts babbling to you in french he speaks no english but it seems that he is very grateful and now very much alive again (french accent) oh shit oů est l'autobus dans la rue de victor hugo he seems like he's in frail health he can't talk very much he kind of passes out it seems like you should leave him alone for a second h h make a perception check roll a d20 h out of the side of your eye in the melee through the hole in the hull that was caused by the cannon fire you see the edge of a pirate ship through some cannon smoke out there h peering out the hole in the wall you can see a sleek black cutlass is that what they're called a sleek black pirate ship moving around a cutlass is a sword no a schooner i don't know anything about boats i know schooner and that's it sure okay great no it's not but okay a sleek black pirate ship seems to be coming about and you can see movement on the deck it seems like some cannons are being aimed towards you that's it also goldilocks roll a perception check that's enough a bunch of ice sculptures have broken there's lots of water on the floor but mixed with the ice you feel warm seawater on your feet and realize that your ship is taking on water it's an imposing pirate vessel with black sails dark wood sleek and sturdy with rails made of human bone it's got a dozen brass cannons ringing the hull and below decks emblazoned on the bow are the words the jolly roger peter and wendy you both recognize this ship instantly as belonging to captain hook wendy what did you roll for perception okay so wendy through the smoke and the chaos you notice that the pirates running around on the other vessel are much smaller than you expected you recognize them as tootles slightly nibs curly and the twins it is the lost boys and they are preparing to shoot again what would you like to do the hole that the cannon made is about yea big sure would you like to try to squeeze through the hole you hear more screams of pain now coming from above and people running on deck you can hear things rolling above you peter pan dashes in his slight way across the dance hall to the door there's a doorway that the beast disappeared through to go up to the deck you try the door the door is locked okay roll for an attack yeah you used your bonus action to rage now you're raging and you get advantage i believe on strength-based yeah sure you definitely hit the door roll for damage okay the door splinters open and is knocked clean off of its hinges you all see the queen exhibit a ferocious amount of anger towards this door and it explodes into splinters the path is clear you may climb the stairs to the deck h okay roll for an attack that does not hit she tries to elbow you but you having no bones just noodle your way away h sure make an acrobatics check you do a risky business slide right between her legs does he see anything i don't know what she's wearing under there are you wearing bloomers all right so you see what you see all right are you going to head up the stairs yuri okay who else is going (sounds of agreement from all) neither do i this is a crudely drawn map that i drew because i'm a crude drawer okay mad hatter's first h you guys are coming up this hatch in the middle mad hatter will be first who's next peter pan is next we'll say wendy is close behind the queen is still downstairs right letting them all go and then we'll say scarecrow this is goldilocks come out behind and you guys are looking and you've seen already you know it's there this is the pirate vessel coming around for another attack they are getting ready for another cannon shot okay everybody shit shit shit this is the hard part okay roll for initiative everybody roll a d20 add your initiative to it i'll roll for the boys okay okay h okay hold on yup 16 eight yes keep going wendy okay oh my god why do i always do this to myself i have 12 people to keep track of okay here we go so who goes first h yes but you were last to come up the staircase you will get to go this round but because you've never played d&d before i'm going to let someone else go first h all right great then you know what go for it if you want to do it h these squares are all five feet so you are standing about 30 feet from the edge h he's super fast when he moves because he's got these noodle legs h you're going to use your menacing action to try and intimidate h okay shit i don't know how menace works hold on let me look where's your fucking character sheet he's got to roll for it for sure so roll-- wait no it might be-- h oh so it's intimidate versus insight yes you're right so roll your d20 add plus five i think h oh shit he's done he rolled a one so he is scared of you and on his turn he will probably run away from you h i'm going to put this on him so we know that he is now intimidated h that was a good first-ever attack good job h h great so yes tootles is scared out of his mind he's shaking in his boots and he's a little kid too so you just scared the shit out of a little kid by showing him your monstrous moist insides h by the way scarecrow is a monk for those of you who care nibs is going to make an attack he's going to use a sling and try to hit the closest nibs is this one by the way he's trying to hit the closest person to him which is scarecrow he rolled a 13 what's your ac what's your armor class h that hits right okay thank you i don't know nothing he hits you with three points of damage yes so you have a hit point maximum there noelle show him his hit points so subtract three slightly is going to go next he is this one right here he's going to sling at you as well you know what he's just out of range of you so he can't he's going to move closer he's going to move up here and that's the end of his turn he's not going to attack goldilocks you're up you can get right up to the edge of the ship you would not be able to hit any of them with thunderwave it's 15 feet from self it would not do it h do you have anything if you cannot strike or use your action to attack you can also hold your action and say i hold my action until they are in range okay so you're going to attack them when they get closer all right great that ends your turn next up is tootles so he is crying tears are streaming down tootles' face he turns and runs runs in fear trying to get as far away from you as possible he's freaked out they're the lost boys straight from neverland for sure yes these are children they are 11 and 12 years old actually it's going to be peter's turn next so you notice something about the boys something seems different about them they were always rough-and-tumble kids but now they seem deranged filthy dirty wild hair and eyes with ripped clothing no shoes to speak of some of them are missing teeth let me paint a picture for you actually roll a perception check because you just came out on this that's okay you're right next to stuff these are masts this is the place on the ship where you steer (laughter) it's a raised platform there are some lockers over here boxes and crates over here you also seem to notice there are two ballistae that can fire things and there are two cannons over here you are it looks like 35-ish feet from this one and maybe a little less to that one 30 feet maybe that you notice is a gangplank that's what they use to load and unload the ship at port it's a long ladder very long and it unfolds to about 15 feet long yeah you can swing around to here okay that i believe is slightly yes slightly so he hears in his ears magically peter's voice saying to him what gives what's going on and he replies to you because he can do that with message right yeah not massage he replies by saying-- you hear in your ear if we can't have wendy no one can all right anything else you'd like to do for your turn i don't know bonus action or something all right well that's your turn it'll go to twin number two who doesn't have a name he's going to roll very well and do his sling at you goldilocks this is a-- ooh it's a 20 it definitely hits and it hits with five points of damage sorry lady sure you can use shield as a reaction right is it once per-- what's it say mark five points off your health twin number two is going to run down to this cannon and continue to load it that brings us to-- peter went already right so now it's all the fours wendy queen and the hatter who wants to go first let's move this along the ship has now come closer and moved around to here they're preparing to fire yes yes they are now within range thank you fellow dm go ahead and do your attack what was your attack and who would you like to target so you can probably hit both of these fellows it's a 15-foot cube so-- don't feel bad they're children no you can't talk to them because you were holding your action this is all you can do out of goldilocks she opens her mouth and a loud thunderous sound cracks out of her mouth making a blast of thunder that hurts everybody's ears it's piercing and they roll fail one of them succeeds one of them fails thunderwave is what 2d8 is that right so roll 2d8 do that roll it again you're going to add these together okay so that's four points of damage sure you can re-roll one of those so they both take four points of damage and this one is sent ten feet back all right excellent job let me mark off their damage okay next is curly right he's the one who hasn't gone have they all he's this one right shit i can't remember they all look alike he's going to roll and attack you goldilocks because you just attacked one of his friends h i didn't make these god damn minis h he's just rolled a 19 he hits you you do that's plus five to ac right so he does not hit he slings a rock at you it barely misses you and clatters across the deck of the ship you are fine queen of hearts and hatter have to go have you gone yet how did i skip wendy oh okay you took ten feet to get up there so you can get right about there as soon as you say mommy's home the closest one to you nibs smiles and says mommy as you're all on deck now you notice the chaos and carnage around you your vessel is not designed for fighting and has suffered badly two of its three masts are broken the deck is riddled with holes it's on fire in one place i will draw you fire where is it ah where's my pens fuck it this is on fire over here this is fire this mast is gone this mast is damaged most of the crew is injured or dead there's a dead guy over here there's a dead guy over here there's a dead guy right here you don't see-- actually roll a perception check okay anyone else want to take a look h and you got another two awesome okay you guys look around for the beast anywhere in sight you do not see the beast you goldilocks do notice that there's a lifeboat right here but it has been severely damaged in the attack there is no lifeboat right there some of the crew had light weapons they're scattered around the ground there's also these weapon lockers over here that have different things in them okay top of the round sorry sorry you haven't gone yet sorry i keep skipping you go ahead go ahead oh shit that is so cool so you can fly over there i don't think that you can also grab you can get over there and turn into-- you're floating above them probably not that high either but whatever it's done okay that's your action and your movement are you good absolutely sure yeah go ahead and roll what is it 5d8 to find out how many hit points of sleep you cause is that how it works shit guys by the way little legal note here yuri is portraying a character tonight called the hatter he's not portraying a character called anything other than the hatter which would be property of disney he's the crazy hat h yeah because we're all on the ss public domain guys 24 points of hit points you can pick four of those guys to sleep where are you you haven't moved so that's these four so they all fall asleep that's how sleep works there's no save h right that's how that works they're all within 20 feet of each other i think that's how it works i don't care that's how it works great okay that was amazing hatter that was amazing okay you notice that four of the lost boys get all sleepy-eyed and curl up into a little fetal position and go to sleep night-night time okay that brings us to the top of the round right no one is awake to fire their cannons so they do not but the one who is left who's actually up a bit on lookout he's one of the twins he yells to you wendy wendy mama we miss you come back to neverland ever since you and peter broke up we've nobody to take care of us we don't know how to cook bathe brush our teeth we're getting sick curly has the runs you also notice that above the twin on that mast is captain hook's severed head stuck to the top of the mast a gruesome effigy of the madness that has befallen the boys the ship is still moving a bit it's drifting because the guy who was piloting it is now asleep just then you realize that your ship is starting to list severely to one side the waterline has shifted one of the injured sailors calls out oh gods we're sinking what would you like to do we're at the top of the round it's scarecrow's turn yeah h correct you can jump you can use your action not just to attack but you can do things use objects h yes h okay roll a strength check h fuck yeah you knock it and it goes (clatter) it's stretching it's skidding across their deck because their ship is still moving a little bit in relation to yours but there is a temporary bridge there that you can use he's a boy he's a tiny child h okay great that is an action you roll versus insight h 17 he rolls a natural 20 you try to make him go berserk and he looks down at you but through the cannon smoke and the chaos he can't even really get a good glimpse of you so it just fails i don't have another platform but-- oh jesus oh forget it just imagine he's up a bit look at that what on earth yes ma'am okay that's your turn scarecrow next is goldilocks the bridge no okay great so out of nowhere a crossbow appears in goldilocks' hand as you aim you notice that this one also has glasses little parted hair right in the middle let's find out shoot away roll a d20 add your attack bonus great so roll for damage that definitely hits two plus something a crossbow bolt slams into his shoulder he screams out (whimper) but he's still alive he's just pretty badly hurt that was goldilocks it is now the scared one's turn does he get to resist shake off the menace i'm going to say he does and he rolled very well he is no longer frightened of you scarecrow and so he is going to turn around and come back towards you scarecrow yes he is but i don't think he can use his action because he used it to shake off the effect and next is the guy you just shot twin 2 he is going to shoot back down at you goldilocks because you're right there and he rolled a 12 to hit one round we're at the top of the second round so no it doesn't he rolled a 12 did he hit you with your ac of-- so no he throws a rock at you the rock misses you and goes into the water behind you that's the end of their turn peter pan you are up from this edge of the ship you're about 20 feet and from way over there i don't know 50 20 okay so we see in slow motion peter pan it almost looks like flying he takes off into the air does this move looks back at you guys to make sure you're watching does a little bit of a flip and lands three-point landing super cool on the deck of the ship that's either nibs or the first twin okay sure yes you pull out a length of rope hold on one second i'm looking up sleep when does it break so he's still asleep as you tie him up he is now tied up and unable to move great good job peter that's the end of your turn yeah okay wendy or the queen or the hatter who wants to go the boat is still moving yes but ever so slightly the bridge seems to have slowed it down a little bit you're going to hit the mast what's your movement you can get to the mast and you hit it hard yes that hits the mast oh wow that's 24 points of damage to the mast what are you hacking with so the scepter is causing huge chunks of wood to fly out of the mast the whole thing is shaking it does not collapse twin number two up there at the top gets shaken off of the top but manages to grab on with his natural 20 and is holding with his-- he's got a bolt sticking out of this arm and with this arm he's holding on he is still up there he did not fall off sure like a grapple all right so wendy-bird flies over and grabs the child roll for a grapple of course he's got one arm and he's using the other to hold on you know what you roll with advantage instead of him rolling with disadvantage sure that's enough he's like this you're a giant eagle you pick him up you have him in your claws but you're not causing him any damage right the hatter the crazy hatter what would you like to do this guy's on fire h hatter would you like to do anything else you can see one combatant who's out on the deck he's over here and you can also see this guy in the eagle's claws okay yes you can just see go ahead and cast your firebolt that's what you add to your roll spell attack bonus you hit him for sure roll your damage that guy dead a bolt of fire comes out of the mad hatter's body hand out of his boutonniere a bolt of fire streaks across the ship striking the child dead in the heart he looks stunned for a second and then collapses dead or at least severely unconscious right there h sure what reaction h that was the hatter queen of hearts you've gone wendy's gone everyone's gone it's back to the top of the round scarecrow it's your move but all of them are sleeping dead or incapacitated you notice that this ship is starting to move away and the bridge is starting to collapse you probably have a second or two before the bridge falls and you fall into the water scarecrow what would you like to do oh you're already on the ship you're okay h you run over to the gangplank and pull as hard as you can trying to get your friends on board the ship with you roll for strength h you definitely pull it but it gets to about there and then falls into the water goldilocks and the hatter roll dexterity saves is that a cricket in the studio goldilocks holds on easily to the gangplank and watches as the hatter slides by her you needed to hold on for yourself i'll say you can reach out with your foot and hatter you can make one more acrobatics check to see if you can grab onto the foot her slipper has salt water on it your hand slides off and you are now in the water you get one action and you get a bonus action where you can hit someone with your hand because you're a monk h sorry h we are still in initiative because there's a guy it is not his turn it's goldilocks' turn you would have to climb back onto the ship first you can probably get to about there but i don't know what your healing powers are goldilocks you don't have any you can say nice things to him you can use your dash action to get all the way to the kid and now you can talk to him so as you say all this to this young child you see out of the corner of his eyes blood is dripping out of his eyes because he is super dead sure okay that was goldilocks we're up to the twin who is currently grappled he's going to try to ungrapple ooh he rolled a 19 what's your strength wendy i think he breaks your grapple yeah he's free and going to run away as that child runs away he runs right past goldilocks goldilocks as he is crossing in front of you you have an attack of opportunity you can hit him as he goes if you'd like to or grab him okay roll for an attack h as he runs by (panicked breathing) he gets hit in the back of the head falls down also unconscious down but not dead at this point the gangplank has fallen away the ship is still moving away that was goldilocks peter's turn wait did we do peter okay go for it peter there's definitely rope there's the main sheet is dangling down from the mast there's also coils of rope on the floor that you can get okay so peter pan either speaks or sings or plays-- the words are so inspiring that you get an extra d6 dice that you can add on to your next roll-- because you feel so inspired by peter pan's words sure it is now your turn and yes you have an action a movement and a bonus action yes so before peter pan finishes his words of inspiration poof mad hat-- i'm sorry the hatter is standing right next to peter-- looking thankfully gratefully into peter pan's eyes-- h you did cause it so you know that he is suffering you don't have time to get all the-- yeah we're out of initiative now the fight is over-- oh yeah that's right so yes things are calm everyone is either asleep or dead so you can take a couple of turns and walk over there is there a particular spell attached to that lullaby or is it just a nice song you guys can take a short rest short rest would be like 20 or 25 minutes of-- yes molly cure wounds is what 1d8 plus three or something like that yeah he's dead just roll to see if luck shines on you the kid coughs and passes out again a short rest is 25 minutes long sure he's very faintly breathing his pulse is almost at a standstill someone else would have to do something very quickly in order to save him h anyone can act yes we're out of battle okay so you're playing a jaunty ditty or a beautiful ballad okay so it's enya or something so why don't you roll a d6-- and everyone within earshot regains four hit points because of the beauty of the pan flute h the boy comes to he seems to be just okay yes nibs-- wait no was this slightly or nibs slightly was the dead one yeah no this is slightly h he's looking real rough but he is alive blood still covers his face you also notice that he stinks all these sleeping boys have the worst body odor they are unkempt wild eyed the crisis is averted calm settles over the ship-- sure they're all tied to the mast all in a circle just like the peter pan book do you want to wake them up oh yes so a minute has passed they all come to they're all tied up what are we doing what are you doing why did you two break up i know but in neverland time moves differently we never grow up we just want a mama-- one of the kids starts crying we need someone to take care of us and ever since you broke up neverland's turned to shite you have to believe to get there (crying) you killed our friend oh that's right are you saying that there's a chance you might be able to get back together so it was our fault (crying) that's great as you glance back to the old ss public domain you catch the final glimpses of the stern of it as it vanishes beneath the water sunken h debris litters the open ocean but not a single survivor is visible you do spot way in the distance a small lifeboat carrying a large figure furiously paddling away from the wreckage you also notice that the helm of the jolly roger is spinning back and forth pilotless your vessel is drifting aimlessly in the water you have no direction what would you like to do so peter's going to go up to the helm take it and roll a survival check please sure you've stolen-- advantage why not well what did you roll sure man you straighten out the boat that's it you are going straight do an investigation check noelle will you point to investigation on his page h yes you do natural 20 okay great so you look around the room any sign of food or clothing has been picked clean also a lot of the paper has been ruined it seems like they've been using some of the navigational maps to wipe their ass after they go number two so a lot of the paper is gone you do find-- you find one piece of paper that looks really interesting but it's all ripped up to shreds (exclamations) h it's in two pieces oh shit that part's all together thank you it is definitely covered in fecal matter one fell on the floor h sorry also h you find a couple of items in there h you find these two things in the ship peter as you are steering the ship you notice that if you were to turn about 30 degrees to the right you might be able to intercept that lifeboat roll another survival check with advantage so you definitely pilot the craft easily and as you approach the lifeboat you see the large form of the beast furiously paddling away from the action what would you like to do you are going to attack the beast sure sure sure yeah go ahead roll for an attack you definitely hit the ship roll for damage on the boat this is a boat not a ship i know sailing terms belle does not exist beauty exists the public domain character you do not see beauty anywhere okay the front of his lifeboat explodes with magical fire you definitely got his attention he turns to you and says oh oh are you not a pirate oh please save me please save me we were being attacked it takes a couple of minutes but he uses the boat to climb up and get onto the deck with you i guess you found the scarecrow and you're helping him put this puzzle back together i'm just perceiving that i think some of your pieces go to his and his go to yours they must have gotten mixed up my bag don't worry it will be great the beast approaches peter and wendy and goldilocks who are standing on the deck and says oh am i pleased to see you lot let me assure you that you will all be given refunds from the storybook love singles cruise limited liability corporation in the form of credits you can use on future cruises are the pirates alive are we okay are we safe what are you talking about did i kill-- i don't have a pirate ship i don't know i left her at the ship with you i was just-- i didn't know what to do i was frightened my men had all died and i apologize i didn't mean to put you in peril but i had nothing-- is she okay zone of truth go ahead what is that and what does it do okay your spellcasting dc is what okay hold on i'm looking up no that's okay let me find the beast's stats you said 14 was your-- and it's versus charisma saving throw okay what did you say it was as you cast the spell he looks at you oddly his eyes seem to shrink back for a moment and then he looks at you again harder and says what are you trying to do to me it does not work yes charisma saving throw i love how i accidentally got rid of half of our players sorry guys wait what no it does not you cannot add it to a spellcasting ability just an insight check right okay roll a d20 and add your insight to that yeah you got it you can tell that he is not telling you the whole story sure you can ask him a question unfortunately yes it was troubled before the cruise i was looking at this voyage as a way to mend our broken bonds we have been spending a lot of time apart and actually this is the first cruise that she's agreed to come on in a long time i was hoping-- h i suspected as much i thought she was cheating on me but i thought that we could reconcile our differences i had no idea who it was i had no idea it was captain jeremy hook where oh my god he did not attack our vessel oh god the beast vomits over the side of the deck the beast just vomited you can see his skin is ashen he drops to his knees and starts sobbing into his hands all right let me find out how that works okay i will see-- i've got to roll against that you are marking off all your spells right sure you are okay yes so you hear a voice inside your head that is not your own voice it's the beast's voice the beast is saying to himself my god i can't believe after all these years she was cheating on me with him he's such a fucking asshole the way he parades around with his big ship and his little helper man smee what a fucking asshole i should have killed him when i had the chance that's all you hear if you would like to probe deeper you can as an action you just say i want to probe deeper your spell dc is 14 h peter right before he pushed you you had heard the beast say in his interior monologue you had heard him say i know what i must do now and it will be glorious-- and that's all you heard before scarecrow pushed you over well no one's asking you anything just roll a d20 add your charisma save her spell dc is 14 right so that affects you so you have to tell the truth if someone talks to you for the next minute just roll a d20 add your charisma save see if you are telling the truth which (whispering) he always is guys h okay the crisis is averted calm settles over the ship so you found the thing beast is crying what would you guys like to do you're drifting at sea i love it the beast composes himself wipes the tears from his face and says i don't know what to do now but we must get to a port from the looks of this vessel we don't have any provisions we can't possibly go back the way we came the trade winds will-- it'll take days might i suggest that we continue on to pleasure island which is a half day's journey and when we get there my employees will be waiting for us food will be there medical attention-- we could do something with these disgusting children all about all right so as you all sit down to dine in this-- h yes as he's feeding-- the beast is taking a rest in the captain's quarters you guys are all on deck with the boys scarecrow's pulling food out of his chest and feeding it to you and to the boys everyone's taking a nice break and relaxing the sun slowly setting in the horizon you guys have figured out the general direction of where to go using the bits of maps and also beast's knowledge of the seas and being there before he said before he took a nap that it would take ten or 12 hours to get there so as night fades on the ship we're going to take a quick break and we'll be back in a few minutes stay tuned at the break for-- yes okay great stay tuned in the break there's going to be a giveaway so watch that you guys will go outside and have a little beverage or whatever we'll be back in five or ten minutes with more fun on the high seas hurray (cheers and applause) [break]

of these things yeah wyrmwood h what have you been using yeah they know wyrmwood gaming okay as we last left you were on the jolly roger ship sailing into the horizon looking for pleasure island you had just faced a gang of pirate children the lost boys defeated and restrained them you were eating some food out of scarecrow's chest resting as the sun faded into nighttime the stars peeking through the clouds overhead are just enough to keep the ship on its path to pleasure island an hour goes by two a sense of boredom eventually creeps over the ship finally the beast has risen from his nap and addresses you all and says friends please i must apologize for how i behaved earlier it came as a shock to me to find out that my wife was dead and that she was cheating on me with captain hook so i took a hit but i'm okay now i appreciate you all being there for me i'm not a hundo percent yet are you-- h may i ask you all a rather strange question will you humor me i'm having doubts everyone i'm starting to think that love is a lie i could use a little bit of a boost no not like a hand job i have two dicks this is great h oh god h while we sail to pleasure island before we take our rest for the evening could you please help me pass the time and get my mind off of things by proving me wrong by proving that love still does have a chance back on the ss public domain right about now we would all be playing this silly dating quiz game that i invented it would warm my heart if you would let me guide you through it here give me a sense of normalcy the beast definitely responds to the petting and gives you a little bit of a purr and says thank you for understanding i love this i could feel this all night this is really good but what do you say just to pass the time h all right here's the rules i'll ask a question about one of the ladies which the gentlemen-- peter pan i'm including you in that-- can buzz in to answer then i'll switch and ask the ladies a question about the men points

in the back that they can also use how many points did you have okay you both tied so if you'd like to i'll let the lady go first wendy you can pick a mate to ask to join you they do not have to say yes all right the beast escorts you to the galley a candle-lit kitchen with sticky floors that smells of rotten milk in no world would it ever be romantic there are pots hanging from the ceilings grease stains on the walls he leaves you there in peace wait the hatter's with you okay there's a little man standing in the corner watching you beast is also there beast knocks on the door and says all right six minutes left just kidding one minute left try to wrap it up oh do you resist all right the kiss is long the waifish peter pan grabs the tiny weird-looking halfling hatter and plants a long hard kiss on him he does not resist instead he wraps his arms around peter's waist and brings him in closer tongues are slipped it goes on for an uncomfortable 12 seconds and then breaks oh do you resist all right another equally long kiss descends into some light necking and ear-nibbling wendy is taller than the hatter so she has to scoop down to get to him h grapple him okay roll an attack roll a strength save h no you definitely grab him and can do with him as you please yeah because he's just straw there's nothing down there h no no this is not what i wanted this is an exploration of love please please we don't-- queen i admire your romantic instincts but this is not the time or place to-- h i'm uncomfortable there's other people in the room i'm trying to create a safe space here if you guys want to pursue this i'm not going to stop you but please find a stateroom somewhere to do this in private please why don't you retire you guys can take the captain's quarters if you'd like but not right here we're at the bottom of a foot of stairs next to a kitchen and we're all watching you it's kind of gross did you-- oh boy oh god h sorry i didn't know i'm sorry h i was but that did not come anywhere close to renewing h the beast starts crying again all right well thank you for humoring me i guess yeah you're still in the galley actually if you all everyone in the galley can you roll a perception check real quick as you watch them make out you notice behind them there is something up on a shelf that was too high for the lost boys to find it seems like a little vial of potion or something you grab it down wendy as you see the box of stale cereal you also see something tucked behind it a little bit shiny you have this item now yep feel free to use it whenever if you would like to you can try to use it for something sure you get this too okay can you read your item just so we know what it does it's an amy vorpahl sword this sword is just a normal sword but amy vorpahl talks to you that's it okay one hit point gone the night stretches on and everyone starts to feel tired and finds places to curl up for a night's slumber does anyone else want to do anything before you guys go to sleep for the night yeah you can put it on h suspenders of disbelief is a thing that i just made up is it oh god i should know that so you are now wearing colorful rainbow suspenders over your burlap sack clothing no you don't know what it does but he knows what it does and that's all you need to know she is really singularly focused in bed all right you all find-- do you read them a bedtime story they're begging for it they love you thank you so much kind sir papa i'm not sure he sleeps h okay roll a sleight of hand check vorps show her where sleight of hand is okay roll a perception check with advantage so that means you can roll twice and take the better roll because it's your fucking chest h you definitely feel her reaching into your chest cavity can you what bite him fight you can attack him sure okay go ahead and you have a spell dc oh no that's a melee attack because you have to touch him roll a d20 add your spell attack modifier vorpahl help her his ac is lower than that yes you definitely hit roll a damage roll seven okay you are stunned for a second as a bolt of electricity shoots from her hand into your arm and up into your neck you kind of spasm out for a second she grabs your chocolate out of your chest i guess do you have chocolate in there h so you get like some gorp you use your movement to dart away you can chase after her h yes he's a monk these are ki points h no you don't get advantage it's a sneak attack round what does that do molly what does a sneak attack round do does he get advantage on it sure advantage on your first attack h just advantage so you roll twice to see if you hit the first time h so you definitely hit her roll for damage h yes for an unarmed strike d4 plus two i think h sure why not h okay so that's three so that's six h no it's after that i think it's a 1d4 plus two so you've gotten six points of damage so far you can take three more attacks no you have to roll that d20 three more times to see if you hit each time h that's not going to hit wait her ac is 16 you have a plus five to hit or a plus four noelle help unarmed strike h you do hit yes that hits h it's 1130 pm yes correct h yeah roll for damage h yep that's it just four you're at 18 right now according to what you've been telling me h that's going to crit so roll your damage and double it h you just took 22 points of damage are you alive before you attack back where were you guys had you all gone to sleep yet so you hear a scuffle and can go to investigate but it will take you a little bit to get there you're running over to the melee peter and wendy where are you guys you found a hammock and rolling there he's asleep and he's loving it okay go ahead goldilocks and attack back if you care to h what what is that h you almost just did h okay it's goldilocks' turn he just whaled on you with his floppy arms you got hit every which direction you don't know what's going on goldie what are you doing you can summon it-- well you can't summon it now because you just used your bonus action roll for attack roll a perception check with disadvantage because you are asleep for sure you hit you are waking up and walking over h it's your turn h you don't know she's looking a little black and blue h you can hit both of them with that for sure against 15 no 13 okay saving throw help him noelle i put him next to you because you're good at this h magical vines come up from the floor and wrap around your feet you both are like what the fuck and you step out of it you're not entangled but the ground around you is difficult to move on you can't really move forward or backwards too much it's awkward and confusing to you the heat of the fight dies down a little bit because you are distracted what would you like to do now it is your turn as you part everyone very eventually finds their way to a bed or something h you fall asleep gaining all of your hit points back again and all your spells okay the beast does not notice he feels a warm arm on him and feels nice all night you guys have a nice slumber through the night the rocking sea lulls you into a nice calm rest all hit points and spells are regained you're back to normal again and you sleep for about six to seven hours and are jolted awake suddenly as the jolly roger slams into something one of the lost boys let's say for the sake of brevity you guys took turns fuck it you run to the deck to investigate and see that you've actually run aground on a sandy beach clouds have moved in overhead it's an overcast day making everything a little bit difficult to-- not difficult to see but just casting a grey hue on everything you are definitely on an island the beast runs up and says i cannot believe our good fortune we're here this is pleasure island he rolls out a rope ladder and begins climbing down to the beach excitedly it's right up here our singles' party headquarters this is where we are going to do the all-night mixer the limbo party-- oh it would've been so fun-- the fire walk inside there is this amazing hot coal path to prove you're really in love a couple has to walk across the hot coals and kiss in the center it's very romantic come come and he starts dashing up the beach insight oh perception go for it go for it yeah perception yeah this is good okay as far as you can see there's a treeline up at the top of the dunes and nothing much beyond it h okay go ahead and roll yeah he seems genuinely excited to be here and you haven't seen him smile like this since he found out his wife was cheating on him and dead all right so he's darting across the beach what do you guys want to do hatter climbs down the rope ladder and starts moving across the sand woohoo the ship is ours the smart one curly steps forward and says we don't really know what you want us to do but why don't we sit here with the ship until you come back he smiles at you he loves it the beast has now disappeared into the treeline okay hatter's the only one who still sees him disappearing into the forest you're flanking h you go into the treeline it's very dense brush it's jungly it's hard to make your way through you're fast and you cut through the underbrush as fast as you can hatter is still following beast roll a survival check hatter those are not wyrmwood dice those are travis' dice go for it sure survival you got it you expertly track him as you go through the jungle following his every turn you guys all following noelle and yes okay everyone's following you make your way-- you get them off the ship tie them to trees they're very weak from exhaustion they just let it happen everyone besides wendy is following the beast wendy is for sure lost you can use survival to try to track their footprints so you think you found a couple footprints and a broken twig and you're following it the rest of you are following the beast he's saying right up this way keep up up ahead the jungle has grown very dense it's dark in here almost like nightfall because there's no sun overhead you're drawn to the dim red glow of a building it's not lit by torches or anything like that this red glow comes from inside the building and shines faintly through the walls the cracks the windows everything has this red glowing hue to it you're also met with a powerful pungent odor the strong warm scents of candy chocolate vanilla ginger and apple caramel and sugar nougat even custard as you draw closer you see why this building is actually a massive gingerbread house the beast explains we inherited the house from hansel may he rest in peace and gretel's witch she donated it to the company after we found ehr a husband nice guy named gary their wedding was really sweet anyway we'll find help inside my people are in there as you get closer an arrow whizzes by peter pan's head another arrow shoots by the scarecrow's head and impacts in a tree next to the queen the beast calls up ahead oh no hold your fire these are friends he turns to you all and says you know what wait here at the door let me go inside and make sure nothing dangerous happens they weren't expecting us until late today so they're probably on edge we have new security that we've hired let me go in and make sure everything's all right he disappears into a large wooden door slams it behind him what would you like to do insight sure the beast's got fur but weirdly he's sweating sweat is pouring off of his eyebrows and he seems really nervous about something as he's talking you cast detect thoughts i think it's your spell dc which is 14 right he rolled an 18 his pupils dilate but he shakes off the-- oh you're right yes you can definitely sense his surface thoughts his surface thoughts are i've got to go i've got to get inside and talk to jack right away we've rolled against that and resolved the roll you are not able to probe any deeper than that roll another survival check weirdly you come up around the back of this building you're drawn to the nougat and caramel smell you can see your friends around the side of the building you make your way up to them you are rejoined h the gingerbread house is mostly a one-story building it is very large candy adorns the walls there are lollipops beautiful trickling chocolate that has hardened over the side there are two turrets that have little slits for archers to peek through on both sides of the house they seemed to have come from those little slits but you can't see who's in there sure what do you want to look at you don't see any other people around other than them weirdly there's a discarded bag in the forest and you open the bag and find something in it sorry it's weird it's a small piece of fabric yes you do a moment or two goes by the beast still hasn't come back from inside-- yes hatter absolutely you lick the door and find that it is dark chocolate and cherry they are sugar-glass windows there are two or three of them around the side of the building from inside the gingerbread house you hear a female scream and male laughter also someone cursing in italian you're going to smash the window just roll wendy grabs your arm and your strike goes errant and hits the gingerbread and knocks off a chunk of gingerbread it's a piece of fabric what six feet wide the piece of fabric adheres to the side of the gingerbread house and all of a sudden the gingerbread melts away revealing a hole six feet in diameter ten feet it's through the gingerbread which is about six inches of wall there's now a hole into this building that you can look it's dim inside but glowing red would you like to go in peer in what would you like to do this is what you can do with all of your kids' legos you do not go in through the front door instead you're going to come over here there's a hole here and you guys are going in who's going first h who does wendy's going first that's wendy right there who's next who else we're going to say you go over here scarecrow and pete i'm going to say this is peter pan they look like gumdrops you're over here with a bunch of candy h roll a strength check his spider pill gives him spider climb so he's walking up the side of the wall like spider-man would h you're knocking on it it takes some time you're up there working on it i'll put you up there for now you walk in where am i the main hall is dimly lit shadows streaking across the walls making it hard to identify much as you get closer you see the source of the light a large 20-foot long track in the center of the room red with glowing blistering embers it is the hot coal path warmth emanates across the room on the opposite side of the room over here these guys over here are ice sculptures three ice sculptures let's see here who's closest goldilocks make a quick perception check that's fine that'll do it their faces are in agony but they've been positioned together in a way that makes them look like they're locked in romantic poses then you see four more ice sculptures or-- no they're not complete glowing with purple magical energy you see that they are living human beings in various stages of being frozen you recognize the frozen face of robin hood weak and exhausted baba yaga and there's gepetto his lower half frozen solid stepping out from the back room is a large hulking blue creature this is him right here boop with icy eyes and icicles hanging off his hands he is laughing to himself he opens his mouth and projects ice breath onto baba yaga she screams in agony you also see lit by the glowing embers the beast standing casually behind the fiery coal pathway he's holding something it's a face he is roasting the severed head of captain hook over the intense heat of the coals he calmly takes a bite out of it like an apple he's muttering to himself never laughed at my jokes always embarrassed me and now this he looks up at you and sees you because you are in plain sight and says oh hello oops you've caught me hi yes this whole thing has been my doing beauty filed for divorce a while ago leaving me no choice but to send her to the bottom of the sea and now to learn that she was cheating on me with hook it proves me right on behalf of the storybook love cruise line i formally apologize for sinking your ship sorry but you see you paid for a service and i've given you want you all wanted true love unfortunately as we've learned true love is a lie after the ooey gooey part ends all you're left with is pain and misery so i'm just cutting out the middleman singles cruises are for pathetic stupid people who all wind up sad and alone and i refuse to be a part of the lie any longer along with my friend jack frost over there we've started a new business changing you ugly love birds into beautiful statues my wife turned my heart to ice and now i will do the same to every lover i meet go ahead and roll for initiative as he roars at you furiously roll for initiative what you got noelle yes mol and hatter this is beast yes that's jack frost over there that's all you can see right now it's pretty dark shit where's my beast shit where is he here he is beast is going to roar at you guys he is not going to move he's going to hold his attack until someone gets closer top of the round scarecrow and queen of hearts who wants to go first h sure you can get closer to him but you won't be able to attack you get right up do you want to go around the coals right through them you get right up to the coals roll a dexterity save okay good are you resistant to anything you take two points of fire damage as you start to run into the coals you are within range he attacks you with his spear he's going to throw a spear at you he only rolled a seven his spear flies away from him and clatters across the stone ground yes scarecrow it's your turn h his back is to you right now he's not looking out the window h well he won't see you he may hear you as you crash through the window h you won't be able to do anything from outside h you're trying to get in you tried on the last roll and it didn't work h you can use your action to break the glass sure h sure go for it h you rolled a four h take another attack because you get a bonus action as monk right h you're hitting it with your hand yeah h yeah you hit it it's glass yes roll for damage h one pane shatters you're trying to start wiggling your way in and you get about halfway in h okay wait those were your actions h action can be either attack or doing something significant like trying to break a window but you need to get in there so you did good you have your straw points that you can use if you really wanted to h you're staying outside just out of range h jack frost turns around and hears something but doesn't see you great that was your turn second turn is jack frost he does not see scarecrow so instead he's going to move right past peter pan who is this pack of smarties not noticing him he's going to attack with his ice breath against you two shit shit shit frost breath wendy and mad hatter yeah make a dexterity saving throw you both dodge out of most of the frosty blast's range you only take two points of damage and you feel a chill come across you as ice coats your eyebrows and makes you all shivery h that is his action and his movement and that's it for him next is peter pan what would you like to do far like 40 50 feet okay 55 it's a big ass room 48 feet oh because it's your-- as soon as this thing of gumdrops starts moving it jumps across i think disguise self is concentration so you lose concentration and in mid-air turns into a sort of flying peter pan it kind of looks like he's flying he does a cool spin move and he lands right here next to the beast no that was your action and your movement you have a bonus action i don't know what you can do as bonus bonus actions are usually healing things for bards you can inspire someone peter looks over at you with fire burning in his sort of handsome small man eyes he looks so hot and sexy that the queen shudders and swoons and gets an extra d6 to her next roll the next up is the beast he's going to turn to you peter and take his first attack rolled a natural one he bites at you but you're so small and fast that he misses he takes his claw at you rolls a seven and it takes a chuff of hot coals and he misses you that is his turn he's going to move though he's going to move no he's not scared of you fuckers he's not going to move at all he's going to stay there and roar at you (roars) that's his move that's the beast next is goldilocks sure it's a shortsword we'll say hey what was your initiative roll shit i skipped you yes you can that's halloween candy sure go ahead h you're asking for a sword is that's what's going on what does the amy vorpahl sword say all right you've got a longsword and a shortsword now you're dual-wielding i'm gonna have to say that you used your bonus action to catch that sword so you get one attack this round you'll get two next round one attack this round and you're holding two swords so it is a one-handed attack yes you do have some bonus surge-y thing i think so you could have two hits if you want action surge against jack frost roll twice you definitely hit you can use luck to re-roll that right aren't you lucky wait what did you-- oh that's damage okay seven points great thank you yeah i don't know the stats of the vorpahl sword but it's a standard shortsword it's a d8 plus two d6 we'll say d6 great you hit for sure d6 plus two he is definitely injured he snarls and growls at you i skipped the hatter go ahead yuri it's your turn scorching ray what's the range oh nice and you can target two you can target one guy twice if you want i think so you can send two bolts to one guy i think you roll a melee attack it's a ranged attack so roll a d20 and add your-- this thing plus four okay roll two more times the first one misses the beast and starts melting the chocolate wall here that's against the beast jack frost that hits jack frost roll for damage i might have it here somewhere as you fire against jack frost he opens his mouth to blast you with ice but your fire bolt enters his mouth and his head explodes killing him instantly jack frost is dead where would you like to attack next well it's three bolts right the hershey bar melts and this whole side of the wall starts to collapse as well any bonus actions any movements do you want to get closer to anybody okay i don't know how i'm supposed to move let's see here great okay that was hatter we also did-- goldilocks moved already right so we're to wendy darling that you can see great let's do it against your spell dc of it's 13 beast wisdom saving throw he rolled a 13 what does that mean noelle and he beats it thank you amy he shakes off the charm it does not work i'm so sorry sure as your bonus action why not you're looking around roll a perception check okay you definitely see lurking in the shadows back there a large large guy he's a-- the camera can't see but there's a big green guy over there lurking in the chocolate sure go ahead there's four corners of chocolate nobody knows where he is from out of nowhere this crazy character comes in and you hear a (pipe sounds) you get the sense that this guy usually plays pipes to do things to people and he's going to target the queen he's going to cast-- he is a half-elf he's going to cast crown of madness against you you have to roll a save it's a wisdom save right i think it's wisdom okay you feel the urge to hit one of your own friends but in that moment you shake the urge off and you're back focused on the beast it does not work as a bonus action the pied piper plays a jaunty little ditty which makes the beast oh-so-happy and inspired okay that is his turn let me roll for the troll the troll will be in order next so that is the top of the round who is first scarecrow and queen of hearts you guys are up h roll for attack twice an 18 hits yes yes that hits the beast is stunned by this crazy madwoman who just dashed through fiery coals to hit him twice he's super pissed off he snarls at you scarecrow it's your turn h sure you can open the window h okay so it takes ten feet to get down and then we'll say you get to about there h you can throw it 20 feet no problem if you throw at 60 feet you have to roll with disadvantage to hit so you can hit him but you've got to roll with disadvantage we'll say you can just barely hit that guy h so roll twice take the lower of the two h yes h the dart sails up into the air and falls right about here just kind of shy your arms are not made of muscle they are straw they can't throw very hard h you have bonus any bonus-y type of action-y or special move h menace would be an action not a bonus action i believe h hatter you're up oh you could also use an item by the way if you need it i don't know what else you have but you could-- (laughs) you flick your suspenders hatter you're up h great you probably just need to get a little bit closer is it 60 or 30 doesn't matter you get close enough to do it you're fine go ahead versus a wisdom saving throw what's your spellcasting ability it's 13 i think he rolled a seven he does not-- yes he looks at this strange funny little man wearing a funny little hat and he can't help it he's overcome with the giggles he starts laughing and he cannot stop i'm looking up tasha's hideous laughter right now to find out what happens so the range is 30 feet so have to come a little closer for that it's okay you did it you're concentrating on it he's just rolling with laughter slapping his knees and he falls prone and is unable to stand up badoinga okay that was the hatter we're down to-- jack frost is dead peter pan you're going to pour the philter of love down the beast's throat okay what is the-- did i write down the spell dc it just works the beast is confused he's laughing hysterically so his mouth is open there is a thick viscous liquid being poured down his gullet he looks at you with strange eyes he doesn't like the taste he snarls at you and growls and turns around to the queen and smiles with love --and starts purring at you he's not wearing any clothing you can see visibly-- always he's a beast oh wait no he's wearing a pink leisure suit underneath his pink leisure suit you see a little bulge forming on his nethers he is charmed and now he's in love with you okay it is now the beast's turn even though he fucking loves you-- --he's going to try to stop laughing he definitely stops laughing the feeling of love overcomes him and he shakes off the laughter he uses half his movement to stand up he takes his giant claws and takes a big sweeping swing not at you but turning around and sweeping to attack peter pan right there yes he rolls a one he misses he's very confused right now he tries to bite you oh yes he rolls a 20 he definitely bites you vicious teeth sink into you you take okay hold on you take six points of bite damage and he is super pissed off yes he sort of stands in a way that is protecting the queen of hearts with his back to her he says don't worry you'll be safe behind me next up is the troll no it's goldilocks goldilocks is next go ahead goldie so you take your movement as you go you see one of the ice sculptures geppetto is desperately trying to break out of his ice he's trying to talk to you in his thick italian accent which i am going to attempt hey la dolce don't you see he just wants love okay that's all he says as you walk by him i like how you're having a calm casual conversation don't worry about me just soothe the beast with love you can get a little further the heat from the coals is starting to burn your face okay go ahead and roll an attack you definitely hit roll for damage plus something two maybe great awesome that's some damage argh your crossbow bolt buries itself into his thigh he writhes in pain but he still loves you next up is wendy darling let me see what he does this guy's dead oh this guy's huge his saving throw is a two he does not resist it at all so the fire starts to melt the candy piles around him he starts to slowly sink into the candy floor he's considered grappled here by the chocolate (troll noises) you didn't even find out if i was nice or not he seems to have blood all over him it's probably okay ooh so proud okay the pied piper is up the pied piper starts playing a stupid fucking flute (flute dooting) he's going to try to charm you hatter yes his dc is 13 make a wisdom saving throw yep okay you suddenly have this unbreakable desire to do harm to the closest ally near you you turn to the scarecrow fire in your eyes h and the pied piper is going to give a little healing to his friend the beast okay that's the piper's turn troll is going to try to break the grapple he succeeds bursts out of the chocolate rargh that's his action next round scarecrow and the queen of hearts are up right at the top of the round scarecrow you're close to geppetto also geppetto is desperately don't you see he just needs love h no you have no idea what's going on you just saw the mad hatter turn to you and smile okay go for it yes roll and he's going to roll against it h he rolled an 18 he is scared of you very scared he sees a weird straw man with granola dribbling out of his chest do you rip your head apart h he's watching this happen playing his flute and his jaw drops his flute drops he's so confused the eyes of the hatter flash back to life he is fine again all right so he is frightened of you now intimidated by you h really is okay so that's scarecrow queen of hearts he's not resisting he lets it happen he's in this weird hug he gives into it and he's hugging you back with a very loving caring hug you're going in for a kiss okay that's the best kind h let's see here he's shaking there's a lot going on let's say that this is what kind of a check is this a kiss check how about an animal handling check okay he's not resisting so really this is just so you can find his mouth so you kind of climb up on him a little he's ten feet tall so you climb up on him with your rage strength going your bulging biceps you use his fur to pull up and you kiss him on the lips he's confused he withdraws for a second but then you can feel his body relaxing and giving in to it he kisses you back his black tongue sliding into your mouth he's really going at it with you you can smell rotten meat and you can kind of see some of captain hook's hair right here at the corner of his mouth do you kiss him back are you in it no i mean are you resisting or are you in it the kiss continues for an uncomfortable amount of time his tummy's good he's got rippling 12-pack abs and he's flexing for you because he really likes you he's getting more into it you're getting more into it weirdly it looks romantic lit by the coal light the red coal light there is dripping chocolate on the walls behind you there's a piper playing weird dissonant music it's the weirdest romantic-- yes and in the corner half-frozen geppetto is saying yes yes yes the coals and the fire flare with a burst of fire that fills the room with light for a second the beast drops to one knee startled and stunned he says no no yes yes he goes in for another kiss he looks panicky his skin is growing paler his shoulders are slumping he's growing weaker as he kisses you and weaker finally he collapses on the ground the troll confused turns and goes to eat some chocolate whatever magic was controlling him the spell has been broken the pied piper is looking around like oh shit please don't hurt me i'm really weak the beast is writhing in pain on the floor he's alive but in bad shape he's still a beast but he's curled up in a fetal position from the entrance of the room a woman appears a beautiful woman in a dress also holding two swords because that's all i have she says well you did it you found true
