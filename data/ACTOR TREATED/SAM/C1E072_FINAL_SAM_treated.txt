and throw the scale in front of her it's done there's your fucking dragon but we'll need something more than just thanks we have two requests to make of you one this is not the final fight there will be more and unlike this fight we would expect your aid in the next one is that something you can guarantee us we don't know yet but you have many men and they seem like good fighters so we may call upon you in the future hopefully it won't be immediately and might i remind you that you did not help us in this fight we did it all by ourselves you told us that you would have men there to help us and there was nothing we almost died you knew when the fight was one more request before we go once we're long gone you can feel free to inspect this hill where the dragon slept and be very careful in disarming any traps that you might find there i would ask you one favor for us we lost a friend in this fight a dragonborn he's buried near here we'll tell you where we would like a proper tomb for him on this hill where the dragon slept could you build a statue a fine statue a handsome statue of tiberius stormwind and bury him underneath it and on the pedestal could you please write i encourage peace teach your people of him your offspring that he was a brave dragonborn that wanted to unify all of your peoples good luck what are you looking for for what what are we looking for what am i looking for grog what am i looking for booty just dragon booty it would be up where the dragon sleeps not down here all right i will peer down into the ice below us with my 21 perception nothing there grog sorry (whispering) just look right there friend (whispering) right there he's my bff we're outside the perimeter of the gemstones or the the main portion of the lair right i can give us a little bit of fire ooh they can do that i have a fireball i'll send a fireball over there back up a little bit well you'll get burned i'm not going to burn you grog just take ten feet all right i'll send a wand of fireballs down i don't know is that magic actually hot when it goes off we don't want to make too much of a disturbance here let's just take some stuff on the outside just grab whatever's closest and leave i will look for weapons of any sort ooh 30 investigation right did you suck or something okay i will add my bardic inspiration i will sing to her (singing) something in the way i wink inspires you like no other gnome can something makes you stop and think how did he get so handsome how did he get so suave i'm sorry who thank you that was easy like a back braid i can't use this so i'll just leave it do you want it check it for traps 'tis clean you hold it i can't hold it it's too heavy it weighs as much as i do what can we lose from the bag of holding with brexit it's not worth as much any more ten gold pieces per platinum so that's another 120 grand grog vex we don't need to tell the others about this we could go to a warm place the three of us and live out the rest of our days they'll never find us we have the dust of tracelessness we might need her to restart civilization ten dragon scales the end grog is dumping stuff out of our bag of holding by the way excellent note-taking and keeping track of what's been in the bag of holding wouldn't that alert thordak he would instantly know that we're not in our home base he could launch an attack on that place i assume it wouldn't fly very well but all right what are we going to do with a mast we'll stick a google maps pin here we'll always know it's here because when we come visit tiberius' grave we'll also leave some flowers and take a mast with us all right let's go back to the main group and tell them what we've discovered a room sure in the kitchen there's a chilly room the mansion will expire in 12 hours though we could bring it into the kitchen for now a lot of things that we don't know what they are when did you learn celestial got some meat tenderizer on that gold mast underneath the hoard and also much more gold and platinum that we can't possibly carry are we in any danger staying here leaving our special hidey place unprotected no i'm talking about your homeland leaving it unguarded we know that raishan's out there doing something because it's a black stone why don't you detect magic whoever can detect magic i can look at it and see if it looks magical ooh 20 platinum zirconia no do you paint a face on it or anything that's very maternal leather boots could be anything oh sure i'll look at those wow 24 arcana check yeah i have no idea however they look fancy go ahead put one on what could happen we're in a safe place wait what if it's single use only it's a boot it's probably made for multiple uses ac down by the way we have two unused ring of protections that we can trade for things i have one that i haven't used in months i've got a vial with yellow and black swirly stuff in it i'll look at that i have a gold and platinum band with braids the back-blades that's nice i just gave it to back-blades over here i have a platinum bracelet which i assumed was just fancy and pretty here look at that one too percy what does it do read it out loud with your mouth no no no hand it out to somebody oh that one should go in the party inventory grog could take the speed (meowing) anyone need the potion of speed i have a platinum bracelet oh wait the gold platinum band the band was a ring got it yes i do oh it's a thing i'm stuck here oh god it's a ring of invisibility while wearing this ring you can turn invisible as an action anything you are wearing or carrying is invisible with you you remain invisible until the ring is removed until you attack or cast a spell or until you get backblaze i don't need this you can pop out cast a spell and pop back but not a bonus action we can always take it back provisional well if we're ever invited to a masquerad√©-- is that how you say it is it platinum does it go with his hat there's mostly lounges in the mansion it's constantly aerating (swirling) i appreciate fine things and i'm not going to apologize for that a whole lot of nothing i'll go down and watch the show i guess i'll watch the training show fight fight fight wow she can become far-sighted earth elementals (laughter) does this thing protect you at all we have to rest we're all severely injured did you aerate it first if you don't have an aerator you can put it in a mason jar and shake it up a bit well that's just pedestrian really it's not going to work i do doesn't sound right i pull out mythcarver and run down the stairs no it's definitely an intruder one elephant's going to die careful grog it has some protection magic on it it threw me across the room (laughter) it's got percival we must kill this elephant we got to kill this thing i will throw a wand of fireballs at it oh plenty i have only used one of seven oh wait what is the damage it's 8d6 got it 26 you're an elephant though 26 where's your battle map before i'm done i'm going to inspire grog and say grog remember they never forget (laughter) i feel like i'm going to have to write some house rules from now on blue man group my hundreds of-- there's no guys here they're all female servants i don't know how many times i need to say this i am sorry for your loss because it's really excellent once you let it breathe and open up i'll give you a book later i have a few i have a library when they wake up in the morning vax has a bill under his door for three bottles of wine and vex for one bottle and keyleth for a construction bill of 5000 gold pieces it is a scam (laughter) just throwing this out there is there anything to gain by going up to the dragon lair and communicating with thordak is there anything we want to say to him laura and misdirection taunting anything up in the lair but don't go alone you can still get hit with traps i can hover above you or something (whispers) ooh precious gnomish that's it where are you standing if he's up top i would have been up there with him too i'm a crow circling around watching him from above well i'm watching the area (caws) super boring day for us challenge vax to a peeing in the snow contest distance and accuracy it's gone okay performance for peeing in the snow not good 18 it's a fair fight this is a fair fight whoa that's impressive but you know my wang is built for power not accuracy you talking to me we had an elephant fight (laughter) pissing and kissing
