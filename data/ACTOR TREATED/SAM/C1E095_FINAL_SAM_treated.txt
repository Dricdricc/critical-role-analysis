thing on my finger i was later told that that's what happens when you work with your hands (laughter) warby parker rose gold is the best time well taryon had a great year you've heard much of what he's done mainly just building and working and working and building and in his spare time he built and worked on things for himself chief among them doty doty 20 take this down yes see a little bit doty how handsome am i i heard very and doty what do you say when it's windy outside it's airy right that's what i heard oh no boo yeah it is scary he says a lot of things it depends on the context you have to sort of figure out what he's saying but he can say that he can say one word it took a lot of money to do that but it was worth it he's also got a couple of upgrades he's got a waterproof slot for the book inside of him so he can store my book yes the crest of vox machina right on his chest emblazoned there his arm works a little differently his right arm which we might see in some sort of competition at some point and his left arm thanks to percival fredrickstein von mussel de something he's got a little hole right here in his hand that-- it's got some girth but it can fire a shot a bullet shot i've never used it before but it can shoot something yep and i think that's the major improvements to doty other than the speaking and the other stuff let's see what else did i do oh i also bought him-- i bought a lot of stuff i'm almost out of money guys that is not what i would call money no i'm talking about actual money that you can buy things with i bought doty a pair of boots the boots of-- yeah i bought a lot of stuff the boots of elvenkind so he's a little more stealthy when we go around i also tinkered with my armor or did i have it tinkered on yes so i have breastplate armor that has black dragon scales embedded in it right and it gives me a little more protection against acid and it also looks cool a little darker flair and so i could communicate with them i built myself a little earring-- it's a little different from yours it dangles and it's got a nice gem on the end because if you're going to wear it at least look good and also in my spare time at vex's house when she was asleep-- she's a snorer-- sometimes i would be awake and i would examine her broom a bit and decided to make myself one too (gasping) now we have two brooms we can leave
