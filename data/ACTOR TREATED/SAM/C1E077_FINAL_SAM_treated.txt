pre-school's bunny has deceased (sympathetic noises) so it's here because this makes the bunny sort of part of the show and the kids and the parents helped a little they wrote a little something to commemorate the bunny and i'm going to read that for the kids for the kids what can be said about dennis the hopper the bestest bunny the little explorer's classroom ever had the way he always jumped left paw first or nibbled on olivia's yo gabba gabba backpack the way he pooped whenever maddie picked him up we'll miss your floppy ears your soft fur but most of all your inner beauty love the little explorers maddie olivia salinger paris justice woodley appalonia degrass garvey barack sashimi neptune sevigny coachella aaliyah walnut and kevin and now to honor their request to make the

can it hold a gallon no no it doesn't affect the power of the spell it doesn't make it a more powerful spell what body what are we asking this guy what are we asking who would he trust yeah sure or i could make someone who we know talk-- no but i mean i'm saying-- who would he trust i can make that person and i can make that person talk let's build a game show set he'll think he's on a japanese game show (laughter) do we know anything about his family because we could always play bad cop too and threaten his family all right so what are we asking what are his weaknesses has thordak had a visit from greenie raishan we're up to 20 questions now (quietly) persuasion check traverse junction we've heard of that before well we want to know who thordak trusts and we want to know who thordak doesn't-- anything else allies i don't think he's going to talk anymore we should kill him we should not leave them again did anyone escape the fight to go report back to home so does the plan stay the same zenith they said the scouts spotted us wait what no wait what is that true yeah to us that's fine well where else are we gonna meet they don't have to go through they can go around it they're not idiots on the outskirts of emon so we're gonna march all the troops out of here remember that the original plan was for thordak to know where we were and send raishan to kill us all of your goals we need to meet up with raishan we need to find a rally point she was coming back there right should we march these 55 blokes to the south while we go to whitestone i'll stay and march the troops while you guys go back to whitestone i think the 55 will be okay if we send them off into the wilderness no matter what there's not gonna be another attack on daxio in the next 24 hours so we can go back to whitestone we can spend the night here and then go back or go back now and spend a night and then bamf right back before there's any attack to whitestone get info come back tomorrow if we need to the mansion sure unless we spend the night here first before going to whitestone bright and early in the morning we need to rest anyway i'm at nine hit points no i can't yeah we'll be okay for eight hours of sleep and then we can go to whitestone ask around come back if we need to let's go to sleep we have any trees here pumpkin latte i mean not right away they've been slaves why don't we give them a day off why don't we just give them some schooling (gasps) whispers the promo link is lootcratecom/criticalrole promo code criticalrole for ten percent off your first month and remember
