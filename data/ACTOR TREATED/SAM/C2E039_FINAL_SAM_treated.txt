players last time we encountered a group of people we killed them all they hadn't done anything to us i'm just saying okay kill them all i don't know sure sounded like we were being shamed they're not wearing any weapons they're just here for ceremonial reasons that one uses her turn to cry i think they have a lisp i'm just a snake person that hits uncanny dodge so what's that four oh man do some monk shit looking really rough (screams) nott will from prone fire a shot at-- actually will load a burning bolt-- i have one left-- and fire it at snake creature the hooded one okay ooh yeah 22 ooh

that's very thin i assume i don't know i don't know how hiding works but i'm going to hide i know that this thing over here will see me but can i hide right there hiding from the vision of that one does that work can you hide from one person i'm going to crawl over there and hide i'm going to hide 23 but i think because i'm wearing the hood or whatever-- okay still 23 ooh i did my math wrong not that it matters fury of the small is six points of damage so it would have been 34 points of damage i'm so excited to find out when he will turn on us ooh yes no caleb no but you're a wee man yeah but it could prevent-- okay you're a lost cause basically oh you guilted him into healing you a what (whispers) sexy but i'm hiding denied great i'll take that whatever it's called yeah thank you okay so

hate water you're going to what trash chute that was the sacrifice tablet on top travis laura and oh that's why it's all grimy it's blood water ugh does it look like those vacuous eye holes in the snakes are about the same size as those rubies that i had found can i just-- --look for traps can i just look for traps around the fountain without touching the water 11 me sure i can but that seems like more of a medical thing do you have a medical kit i was looking for traps i don't think i found it with an 11 most of them caleb is way worse than her are we plugging up the holes first or are we just watching them he's excellent he can make one thing into another we used to have this trick where we would sell people a magical box that could turn a copper into a silver ooh did we use that one

thing three times he's the invisible friend fjord counterargument (crossbow locking) (laughter) it will deafen the creature it might bring some rocks down from the ceiling no it'll make a big puff of smoke no one will be able to see yasha's crying now (laughter) not in smoke yeah we make a bunch of smoke the thing is like i don't know what's going on i think that's about 15 to 16 votes if my eyes don't deceive me i've never been thinking clearer than right now i see this working big time or carry the keg in with your duplicate and do both but plan b (crossbow locking) (tension releasing) fluffernutter i can shoot at something can we peek in without it seeing us i'm going to take off my explosive bolt and put on a reg you're going to float your dupe across the water and as soon as you say go your dupe casts sure but your dupe floats we're assuming that the snake creature's asleep just float your dupe in and when you say go i'll shoot i'm more than 30 feet away so i think i shoot at disadvantage wait-- oh she attacks with advantage i'm think i shoot at disadvantage because i'm longer than 30 feet away so that's a ten can i bonus action no this is a single sneak attack action cool (arrow whizzing) do i get advantage on the attack if i'm hidden the first one i rolled was a 12 plus eight is 20 oh okay i rolled-- let's see here sorry i rolled a 15 and i will use-- because we short rested i'll also use fury of the small again so that's 21 fluffernutter would have totally obliterated it we wouldn't have even had to fight 18 you're going to run all the way to the snake (dramatic yelling) i'm a monk under the paper ah i'll go in to the left into the left as far as i can yep i think i was just at 30 on the way i'll fire another crossbow bolt ooh not good 16 is it engaged with

(fearful yelp) i will shout out fluffernutter i'm going to go back behind the pillar and hide yeah and i'm hiding 20 oh no caleb i think it's a hallucination fluffernutter you got hit with 30 points of damage too so that's concentration didn't you do something that makes it more vulnerable to its next hit just do-- nott the brave yells to her teammates the colors are so vivid then also everyone back up we're going to fluffernutter this bitch i will (cocking crossbow) and hold my action yeah ah waiting for a keg to be thrown (cocking crossbow) fluffernutter i don't care about avantika you're
