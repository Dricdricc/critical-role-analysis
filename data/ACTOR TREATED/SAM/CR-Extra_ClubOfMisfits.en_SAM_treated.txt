hard work i have never felt worse no what-- fine i will tell people that we're best friends for one month but no one will believe that they know you they know how weird you are and how attractive i am

you belong to the school she's wearing clothes well we are students of schmoschwarts we pay the tuition that affords your fineries in a sense you work for us so we would request kindly that you would tell us what's going on down there i don't know yes something is afoot here we should write a strongly worded letter to the proctors at this fine academy and we should get a partial refund on our tuition and possibly accommodations all right i'll go too we get on 18 are we still pass without a trace on 19 before we walk in i'm going to quickly thank bryan for helping earlier and designate you as my ward absolutely nothing what was that what were you doing that was close why have you taken us here oh like to cook she's going to the kitchens now 24 get away i see something i found it i'll go first i know that's why i'm going first so i can spare you from pissing in your pants this is not flirty banter ward let's go all right i'll go through the doorway claire that's the armor where did you gather it from oh like a big spider oh no oh excellent work smart guy you're just going to jump down into that i'll go carefully as well oh snap close to the screen what where are you going art & arcana it's so hefty because it's filled with luscious-- lucious artwork on full color pages wow liam taliesin and a schmord of the schmings i mean there's no other player right oh no hello what's that seeing that happen claire is also going to cast mage armor on herself probably not there's no one playing here (whispering) oh no you're the pawn oh no oh no we have to play chess i'm the queen i am not at all concerned oh boy take the pawn take care of it don't worry you'll definitely live because pawns always do what if we lose at this can we move our other pieces that aren't us oi you there in front of me pawn why don't you move ahead one space oh god what is this we're playing chess and we're fighting spiders this is the worst is that dice jail over there 13 oh god we're playing chess this could take an hour yeah it can on the first move it can move two squares do the one space then quite the chess move you're not just focusing on the spider are you is it total damage total right no each wow oh no he's still alive this is the most complicated fight i've ever seen i'm up to move as a chess person or to attack as a person person all right i will-- okay wait am i trying to fight the chess pieces or the spiders sure but we also want to win in chess okay i think i'm going to pick up my wand i'm feeling a little cold today so i'm feeling like there should be a bit of a snowstorm and i will cast snilloc's snowball swarm centered here so everything around like this this and this 3d6 cold damage on a failed save of 14 so they each take 12 points of damage as the snowballs hit the spider takes six points of damage uh-huh are they alive should we move in our chess match as well sure oh you've also got-- our other rook could make a shot at the spider will it attack or will it just stop yeah how're you doing ward king me a what it's our turn to move a chess piece as well also we already moved a chess piece this match i mean this round oh into attack mode which is wow bryan that's my ward oh no but allison's a badger all of these jokes would make much more sense to me if i knew what you guys were talking about look at all of those halloween decorations (laughter) oh you can move a chess piece and a-- oh we moved does he have to fight oh so chess moves just work that's a genuine chess move so it automatically works the knight had already been hit by snowballs you're doing great laurs bunder no i mean it doesn't matter whatever i don't know how wizard's chess works aw yeah andy do some jock shit claire oh god i will attack andy you go first give me time to think claire will use acid splash on that spider that's menacing our badger friend ally it's 60 feet 14 dex save oh which does that take no damage no it just saves there's nothing aw poo am i allowed to is it our move in chess well i can't move but i can move one of the other players i guess i could move one space out but that seems like a waste which one let's move-- let's move our bishop dildo baggins over there out one space to get ready for some business it's business time yeah they are almost the exact same design oh schnikes the pawn is going down (intone bad to the bone) oh no you must have some sort of healing-- yeah badger attack do you need to get to travis i mean what's his face blunder why don't you-- oh also you can only move-- oh wait no he's a horsey okay you can start getting over there the casting time is ten minutes oh jesus jesus these spiders not really having anything else to do i'm going to send magic missile-- no that'll use my last 1st-level spell slot i'll use acid splash to attack that same spider sure is this it i'll do magic missile i'll do magic missile against the spider that's menacing our allison friend all three darts oh that's good 12 points of damage yeah wait what happens if i do it at 2nd-level oh that's an extra four points i'll do it at 2nd-level that's 16 points of damage oh wait do we move chess-wise is it our turn i'm going to move bryan up to right there doink it's the word we haven't moved yet this round the spider you smoke of all the scientists that would not be the one i would pick out to listen to and the spiders too i'll move up and around towards this spider is this the last spider i'll move up towards the spider yeah the big one oh that one gets an attack of opportunity though fails i will cast-- oh shit i'll hit something else won't i oh well i'll cast dragon's breath with lightning damage we'll say a 15-foot cone they have to save with a dex 14 oh no but i think i still get half damage ooh good roll 15 points so halved seven points of damage to both spiders and probably the spiritual weapon and probably one of our pawns seven points to the spider who saved what about the other spider yeah 14 okay so that's 15 points of damage to that spider yeah i'm breathing lightning on you wow greased lightning is it looking pretty rough (squealing) (screams) (screams) i don't like this i don't-- spiders are beneath me everything i learned aout my character i learned by looking at the poster i think she's uppity i don't know anything about-- (gasp) with my bonus action i get a little moist oh those aren't real glasses are they i still have whatever my spell was-- dragon's breath up it lasts i'm going to (belches) again right on the thing lightning comes out of my mouth so it has to make a dex 14 save oh well ugh three points of damage i want to angle the blast so that when the spider explodes and splatters it splatters towards our little ally over here and gets all chunky in her hair oh wait there's spiders behind me oh nice man the sorting mat got it right with you i don't know i'm trying to talk-- ah no my fine clothes oh no i have-- i'm okay what are we doing what are we doing i'm sorry that i splattered spider guts all over you that was wrong of me we're not so different you and me nine plus five it's tons yeah you don't have to command me i'll grovel anyway i know i was a bitch to you guys before and it's only because i really just deep down want to fit in also side note i'm a virgin i read that on wikipedia during the break thought i should admit that to you now what about you jock and you honey badger you know i told you we weren't so different a what i will literally come flying up the stairs i cast fly i grab a broom i have a feature where if he's in danger because he's my ward i can switch places with him yeah i think he has to be close to me but i don't really know where we're placed i will switch places with him-- which will put him in the air sure
