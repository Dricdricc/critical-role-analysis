i've never done it either all right taryon's going to die in like five seconds (laughter) probably yeah do i get doty in the fight okay that helps and i'll be leveled up to their level yes yes we are we are confirmed for that are we announcing that oh well yeah on june 1st our next guest jon heder aka napoleon dynamite is going to come play with us and roll some dice yeah just before we move the names that dad had told us about to maybe parlay with in the myriad korshad 230000 but wait wasn't there some other name the little-- a retroactive perception check retrograde you know they always say that retrograde perception is 20/20 anyway i would love to ask bertholt if he knows the location of my sister all right well i mean i guess we can all walk to her room and knock on the door it's a little weird right sure i'll lead them back downstairs to that main room that was all awful and terrible right so i'll lead them down there this was our playroom maybe you should just wait here and i'll go talk to sis i'll be right back hello sister just today father kidnapped me and brought me home well i'm not a kid but still works abducted abducted me and brought me home paid someone to do it yes anyway it's good to see you your room is coming along quite nicely it seems like you're running the show now is that true well i have had many adventures and close calls but i won't bore you with those details it's been an interesting year abroad and i would say i'm glad to be back but for the abduction part and also the fact that i've now learned that we are destitute is that true so it's true he wasn't just trying to guilt me and what would have been your plan had i not arrived today by marrying me to some lady i've never met what is she like and father's businesses are they being run the same way with the same attention to detail listen i'm sorry to pop in like this and challenge your judgment but me marrying this person would solve our problems long-term somehow do we not own anything anymore so what is ours now anything our personal belongings this home and again if i do this what's to say we're not just going to drive up another debt again doesn't seem like father or you have been very good at keeping us in the black so you and he are two peas in a pod yes well i may poke around and see if there's another way i could help but before i do is this fun for you do you like running this business or almost running it do you have any friends i do well i'll leave you to your work and-- love the decorations i'm considering the offer and i'll have an answer for you by tomorrow morning all right i'll consider it with all my intellect a pat the back pat good day all right i'll shimmy out (sighs) all right i'll rejoin my friends downstairs well-- as expected things are about the same between me and maryanne no she's not raging she has her work and her-- no i mean i don't know she's busy i guess they're not guest people they're not dinner party family nope it didn't come up they said how have i been but they don't really give a shit either way if they are not interested in me why should i be interested in them knowing about me i don't know what to do there's this woman she's apparently nice and i could go for it and marry her and then it seems like all my family problems would be okay i don't know i'm sort of curious about talking to the people who are in this contract with my father and seeing if there's any way to wiggle out of it a little bit but i don't know how to solve everything right now i also don't know-- i feel a duty a responsibility to this family because they are my family part of me wants to-- oh god part of me wants to turn around and go back with you to whitestone and forget that the darringtons exist but i don't think i can't do that i am a darrington and i owe it at least to my name to try and fix what i can yes well i'll try not to but it seems like a plan b at this point no it's way cooler than i thought my family ever was i knew my dad did shady business with lots of shady characters but i never knew-- i assumed he paid off people i assumed he had friends in high places and people who you'd have to bribe to turn the other cheek but i never knew that he was in business with them owing our whole existence to these terrible people and i don't know what to make of that definitely not listen i think there's two steps to this there's the short term and the long term we have to solve this short-term need really quickly not this whole 230000-dollar-- i mean -gold debt it's a whitestone term i mean a wildmount oh my god my phone rang i'm confused anyway listen couple drinks before-- no we have a short-term problem that we can maybe go alleviate a bit if we go talk to these folk at the laughing ninny or whatever it's called the grumpy lily and then there's a long-term problem which i'll have to solve on another day there's a long- term problem that my family is awful and needs to be stopped at all costs and that's something that i'll have to deal with tomorrow you're talking about marrying the sister yeah you're royalty you know this little royal girl i mean she lives in another part of the kingdom right matthew mercer oh yes that's true but there's the in-town people we can meet first yes of course you'll come with me because i can't talk to the mob by myself no i'm not talking about killing them my family is pretty bad i've learned but i've also learned from young trickfoot that even a rotten family is worth trying to save and i admire the path that she took with her family and i would like to at least try to push mine in the right direction and try to make our name a little less shitty well that's why that's long term in the short term i just want to get them safe i don't want to die if that's what you're saying dedicating thank you sure i don't believe in them but i believe in the cause right now and we'll see how far that takes us you guys it's a little more nebulous than that grog listen when you see my duty you'll know mama oh yes these are my allies and my friends this is the team known as vox machina they are a fearless band of adventurers and they have taken me in as their own well yes i am a bit yes i've spoken to father and sister and it's good to know they're healthy and it's lovely to see you as well have you been happy at all this last year oh oh my books in my room oh that's lovely i hope you've enjoyed them as much as i did what's your favorite one before the river's dawn yes yes yes no it was but also heartbreaking at the same time yes that's one of my favorites as well i'll fix it if you did it's all right well that's wonderful to hear i'm glad you've been entertaining yourself i know living with papa can be very hard and it's been very hard on you all these years i told you they were like this just wait on the fucking porch no you're right to think this way this year has been eye-opening for me and i know that you care for papa and you are a diligent and faithful wife but i know how hard it must have been to live this life for so many years and i wonder what it would be like if you hadn't been with him what kind of person you would be well things are going to have to change at some point right no thank you thank you for that mum's the word all right i'll be back and maybe we'll have time to talk more books later good evening when you think he's dead but he's not and he comes back i know well you never see the body in the first one so that should have been a tip-off yes all right let's go to the jumping jimmy or whatever it's called she's better i mean she's had a tough time that was the longest conversation i've had with her in many years i think everybody's super stressed out and heartsick about everything that's happening and living under a tyrant of a father is not healthy you should have seen me when i lived here i was not nearly as dashing or as charming as i am now it took me spreading my wings and flying before i found my sense of humor my hair looks better my eyes look better well yes we didn't have any at home i mean life needs aloe to live is something i always say moisturizing products in general life needs moisturizing products to live i know the place should we get anything to drink first or just dive in put two tables together i guess okay who do you think we proposition here the old man that guy really what makes you say that he's just old i thought no is that true oh (laughter) is it in the hundreds oh okay in my earring i say to vex i'm clamming up you do it i'll go toward the front with the twins start it now any change in our bodies or anything we're in that word just gets us in would you say more like blue man group or more like a subway bucket drummer well we brought bottles that's rude isn't it why don't we ask them nicely if they would like to move no what's our play here do we just keep saying the word many as many times as we can and see how far it goes this is it so now we ask for her by name or him by name korshad all right of course i have just enough for a nice drink oh oh okay all right all right i'm slow to catch on sometimes history check i'll have another shiraz oh the other drink oh fuck wait before he goes pardon me i have one more order to make i would like to buy a drink for korshad courtesy of taryon darrington and i'll slip him a gold piece there is a coin between the two fingers yes whatever it is here is another four and keep another one for yourself one sex on the beach (laughter) why isn't he coming over here should we send another drink maybe two this time yes is it time should i go over there all right i'll take my helm and cock it to the side you mean the korshad drink that drink all right pinky out i love it (whispers) it's terrible i'll just laugh way too loud (laughs) and then she said to me that's not armor make some room grog leave taryon darrington of the darrington family well i can make magical items if there's something that you need made or enchanted we have other members of the group that do different things we have a fine tinkerer if you need something made for you vex here is an excellent shot she could put on an archery show or something if that would be something worthwhile to you you know if that will help ease the debt i know my family owes you quite a bit of money and might i inquire as it is my family's debt what is the timetable on that will you be coming to collect anytime soon will they be in any physical danger well i don't know much about you but i assume you would much rather have the cash than have to own property and manage it all right yes i guess sure even that would be a step up but it seems like we would have to do something in order just to earn that much my family would require their main property and all residential rental property would they get to maintain possession of their personal property artwork statues and what is this task yes are you sure you don't have a cloak i could just enchant and then we could call it square all right i suppose we have no choice all right seems like we do i'm not going to ask you all to risk your lives for my shitty family so i will pursue this matter on my own if i have to well i would hire a couple of people to come with me but if you'd like to accompany me i'd be okay with that too well i mean you've taught me a lot so maybe i could do it of course not i am one for two on that count should we vote on it then grog do you want to go kill something big and scary pike are you drunk twinsies oh vax isn't here hey vax you want to go help me save my family by risking our lives in almost certain death i'll take that as a yes keyleth science bro why okay (belches) thanks we have to misty there right because you don't know any trees in the area i don't know what we'd be researching the guy who sent us on the mission doesn't even know what it is oh yeah 21 gods attacking us or it could not oh god i don't want to die before we go was there something you wanted to tell the drow woman should we at least ask her to stay in town for a to-be-determined mission later we can give her a little money to keep around a retainer i can give her a little money i might need her she might be gone we have no idea how she was hired in the first place all right well then let's do that we have no mission at this moment but we may call on you shortly after we return can we find you here or will you be gone where's that sending okay all right well stand by we'll call you thank you for your time and we'll be in touch sorry about your horse let's misty step let's wind walk we're going to be windtalkers and it's connected to the abyssal plane dead talk let's do that they spit
