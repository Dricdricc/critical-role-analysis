teenagers calgary is like the kentucky of canada i don't know so we're still at the carnival are we going with them or not should we stay here this is not our affair right well you sent the kitty didn't you follow behind a bit okay sounds good and he can't communicate to me either so-- yes but you can talk got it okay great sure wait did we just all ditch marisha beast shape (laughter) we never get to make those kill them all in an effort not to go to jail you went to the jail kill them all make all kinds of rolls this is a terrible idea right away spasm shaming use it oh what little sister what hi now why get some booze got some books find a little taste of civilization maybe some better food oh yes very good i know everyone else makes fun of your smell but i don't smell nothing under sort of holding arrest or something we can't leave the city but i was thinking about this the people we met down there and spent the day with they are lunatics but they draw a lot of attention to themselves leaving us free to sort of slink back into the shadows a little bit it might be sort of the perfect camouflage no one's going to be looking for a little goblin girl anymore because they'll be looking at the crazy people the tieflings running around smashing shit well let's give it a day and if things seem a little bit you know skinky-doodie tomorrow we can fritter away in the middle of the day or something but we need to replenish the healing potion you used if we don't have that then what happens the next you get in trouble all right but how on earth are we-- all right we can cool it with the cons for a couple of days but i can't promise that i won't get the itch again all right no i didn't do nothing we just went to a show it was a pretty good show up until you know the dead people part yeah well we'll lay low should we pretend that we're still friends with these people don't worry i'll turn on the charm thank gods oh thank god you're here and safe we missed you somehow we got separated friends i'm lying (laughter) two please hi frumpy nice to see you again we're just a couple of friends strolling around the countryside looking for adventure we have a string of bad luck we tend to get in trouble in places for various reasons some of which is my fault most of which is my fault i have sticky fingers i can't help myself sometimes i'm fascinated by little bobbles and fancy pieces of jewelries and i love trinkets so much i just have to take them and have them with me and put them in my pockets it's gotten us in a few scrapes a couple times caleb he is fantastic very patient with me understands but really it's my fault it's not him he's a smart man a brilliant magician have you seen some of his tricks are phenomenal really i feel bad to because we never stay in one place long enough for him to have a decent shower (laughter) anyway that's the long and short of it well the nice ones i keep i have a little-- i collect a lot of things but in the last place we hunkered down it was all taken from me we were in one of those prisons before-- am i sharing too much i'm sharing too much aren't i we were in a prison they took all of our belongings i lost all of my collections i had a lovely rock collection i had a rare coin collection i had a stick collection yeah it's all gone now i love them i just don't have any right now true but they were like people's canes and things (laughter) you know those rocks that humans wear on their fingers and around their necks and stuff they're really nice rocks oh i don't care about the people who have them i just like pretty things toys anything really okay can you help with that no it's the collecting well would you like a demonstration sure that'll make it really easy are they closed all right out of practice here i'm going to do a shot crack my knuckles he'll be pissed what he what's on your waist oh all right i'll go to her left buttcheek pocket and fish around what pockets do you have i'll do the hip pocket three (laughter) plus eight this is not how it usually works the person is not really expecting it this is embarrassing really i have the one skill and i failed at it yes i know the trick takes a little bit of time doesn't it okay (clears throat) i do know one piece of magic feast your eyes-- fibulous it will turn into a silver piece only i can say it (laughter) no it only works up well no we weren't giving you the silver piece just showing you a bit of magic this pot is actually quite powerful it can do that once a day so if you'd like to purchase it well it only works once a day i think it only does the copper to silver yes it's a mild magic pot but if you'd like to purchase it from us we can sell it to you for five gold at discount for friends three gold and for that we'll teach you your own magic word you can do it once a day forever you have it for the rest of your life but this is free money that you don't have to work for all right one gold it's a
