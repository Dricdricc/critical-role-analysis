is furrydate is a matchmaking website for the furry community if you're looking for a furry friend-- that is not-- that must have been another site that wound up on my browser somehow i will go further back in the history a little bit oh oh boy that's a lot of skin i think this site might be called double d beyond okay it's a lot of pop-ups i'll click on install on all of them to make them go away okay they're gone this is great this one's great it's not what i was looking for but there's this kid david and he just went to the dentist it looks like he's talking real funny but that's not it i'm going to go back a little i'm trying to get back in the history to the website i just got to something apparently i owe the irs some money and i have to go to target to buy a gift card to send it to them i think that's real i might need to go after the show oh and here we go okay d&d beyond is an amazing website that lets you create and store your characters load up digital books and

and rearrange them we've all had a couple of balls in our mouth before did it have an exact location or anything or ten spheres you have no idea what if someone else was searching for these powerful spheres and maybe was lying in wait at this temple knowing that someone would maybe come bring one to it i would if it were underwater because i would not be there to prevent it fuck no look what happened last time there was a crazy ghost lady no she got away we almost died did we yes fjord you have a thing or two to learn from jester about talking to people and engaging them on a personal level she has what i would call the expert touch she gets people she sees into their hearts and souls you are just a bastard man wait button wonka's factory with the boompa-loompas i have no one's seen anyone come in or out of that factory and yet it makes buttons every day how do they do it all right this fucker (laughter) i got incense by the way i got 50 gold worth which was a lot you may
