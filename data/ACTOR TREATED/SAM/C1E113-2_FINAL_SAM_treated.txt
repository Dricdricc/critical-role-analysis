no why are you australian now skak don't you have some sort of a crossbow maybe you should be the one to take him down oh we could cause a diversion wait if we make a noise or something won't he wake up everybody else oh no we're dumb how far away is he crossbow him little pitchy are they up are they behind a wall below us oh we're coming in from the mountain so we can jump down well it doesn't matter seven i will jump on the weak one oh boy check 15 d4 add strength three plus strength is one so four i will take my quarterstaff and-- like churning butter good because that was a two and that's a natural 20 d8 seven plus four 11 14 plus four is 18 well is he dead orc physiology is not my specialty do i see other orcs uruks around me i get one more attack right i will move to that one and hit him right 40 not with advantage that's probably a miss it's a nine it's a wraith it's a grave-walker they can disappear at will thanks skak kill the other there's two asleep a good kill sucking somebody else's thumb that's so gross we'll catch you just come down oh wait i have a blanket let's spread it out and we'll hold it and you can jump down on the blanket what's that all about oh i know what it is we're not to kill him i will grapple him not good nine that's right this one is it's an athletics check 13 i will intimidate natural one i guess we have to kill him pain it's multicultural sure i'll take out my length of chain and sort of start whipping him we're looking for ur-gram you do where's ur-gram soft-skin sure sure those are all good ones man-filth man-beast correct answer where is he if we rest what if they send a patrol up here --the fircs i guess got to use them all back up at full lead us to ur-gram let him up how do we get inside is there a password or something you're big no we're not going to cut your head off we're going to get a lot of money for this mission and we'll give you one half 15 oh i can fix it i'm a medic that's cocked 11 plus medicine 14 he needs to have a costume on for the ruse remember you're bringing us in because we're new recruits you're here to see ur-gram no questions the moment you betray us we will kill you and that's it all of us 17 here as well but do they have grog hide no we should sneak past them are we going to sit here why don't we try to go past them all right i will stealthily see if i can see any caragors move out look around ooh 25 hi we need to distract them somehow does anyone have any meat on them a bell that would distract throw the bell oh because you didn't play an orc in the game so you don't know that these things are really powerful i think we should try to run six that's either a one or a 20 it's a 20 i'll choose dexterity and that's a 21 yes you're so powerful (growling) i will attack relentlessly 23 to hit that is five points of damage i will use my flurry of blows got it so second attack doesn't hit it's 12 so i can't use my flurry of blows okay flurry of blows that's worse and 15 eight plus four is 12 points of damage plus i will choose a condition for it strength saving throw if it fails no it probably is strong it's probably dextrous too i'm going to choose that it can't take reactions until the end of my next turn mozuu is our prisoner still around or did he run away oh perception 21 i could catch him i can i'm going to sprint after him using step of the wind i grab the top of his skull athletics 17 can't run from the forcs that makes sense all right we'll wait here for the others and then we follow this plan you're on our side i trust you implicitly i don't worry about anything i trust you implicitly we are in this together 100% friends oh no i can i will use my medical kit to stabilize him i pull out the arrow no don't do this to me come on fight you can come back i spit into the wound i close it with my hand nine bock bock-bock what's his name borg-borg borg i thought i had lost you i don't know what happened all i can say is i'm sorry and it will never happen again why did you do that he's our ticket in laura and i think you can still trust us all right i have a robe you have a bagpipe i think we're good let's just get on with it nothing or the back door i think we should go through the back door (laughter) hey shrak happens yeah we'll go first right you go through that shrak hole we're stealthing nine bonk say something brick say something we work for ur-gram oh no five let's go through the shrak hole right away fast charging in that's why we have to go through the shrak hole as fast as we can how high is the wall matt i'm going to jump up onto the wall i'm going to use my step of the wind which doubles my jump distance distance does that mean height four-- one my strength modifier is one okay (scoffs) nine to the shrak hole it'll be okay shrak hole split the party he's in shrak right now i'm going to go in the shrak hole i'm going into the shrak hole acrobatics 19 (whispering) he's been chosen nine here that hits but i'll use deflect missiles i reduce that by more than seven points (catches bolt) (bolt whooshes) 16 i rolled a 16 plus i don't know oh my dexterity is plus four eight plus four you've shown yourself to be weak (laughter) i look over at arby trying to get a sense of what-- is she on my side (laughter) (sighs) this is not going to end well our leader barfta told us if we found where they were that would be a reward i'm going to leave (laughter) everyone's turning into bad guys that's right oh i don't know what to do i can't beat that guy he's a wraith i'm going to-- --spend my last ki point and run as fast as i can through the shrak i will use my troll's endurance to reduce that by 11 points i touch the arrow and i say ugh he's right forcs don't run they stick in meat and they stay there forever and i turn around and i run back into the shrak hole (laughing) natural 20 that hits but i will catch that shit i mean catch that shrak and throw it back it doesn't say i need ki oh i see i can catch it i rolled 17 it's 1d10 plus nine so i rolled an eight do i have enough movement to get under the shrak hole i'm going to attack mozuu or is the bright-- i'll attack mozuu i choose mozuu the chosen mozuu 20 to hit eight plus four 12 a second attack 11 plus seven 18 to hit two plus four so that's six more points of damage oh one more hit this is an open-handed hit right no good that's a 13 to hit kill the tark for the glory of the uruk is she dead dead dead i don't think i have another resistance to this this time i mean is it cycled through again it's not good it's like eight i resist 18 points of damage i'm making a nice collection of your arrows yes all right bright lord let's see what you got hi-ya 13 ugh nine bonus action oh 18 plus seven that's 25 oh you've got
