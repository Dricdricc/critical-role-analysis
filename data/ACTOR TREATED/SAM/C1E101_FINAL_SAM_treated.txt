much fun in a long time let's go do it i'll cast seeming on us and make us all gray pointy-eared little nosferatu-vampirey things i suppose did i see the thing that skittered out i've seen other

the party 17 oh you know what seems important i will inspire myself can i do that i haven't done this in so long 18 maybe this city was taken somewhere else or something transported here is there any architecture that i or anyone notices like from a region of where we've been mid-century modern mostly man we should have brought tary do we recognize them i could be bait then you could come ambush them wait we're staying put and they're walking off somewhere else how are we going to see what's going to happen we can ambush them should i put someone out there to confuse them there's three of them right hey look we're killing things well maybe 85 it was kima and allura on a mission they're dead which mouth you're going to use a carrot all right can i have a try you've got one eye right ugh gross ocular muscles i just want to make you feel good man so i'll just sing to you i'll hold up my cone and i'll sing (singing) just the two of us you can't quit me if you tried just the two of us me and your eye so i'll dominate person will you please tell us everything you know when we ask you where are you from did you come through a ziggurat in wildemount and if so where he the flying things well we know what they are now do the flying things have magical powers the smoke-making thing that you were carrying what is it and how does it work the last war on thar amphala what does that mean what does that mean oh that's where we are she really is that's being rude but who lives in the tower is it vecna or mistress delilah the mistress delilah where is she right now entropis is the tower the only tower what protections do you have on the tower you don't go in and what are your people called your group your cult what's your job with the remnants what will the ritual do he's just a farmer guys i don't think he knows all of the intricacies what has delilah promised you what do you gain out of this did you bring something through the portal what was it when does the ritual begin i know we look different now but if you had to pick one of us which is the most handsome i thought so can you escort us to the tower dominate person has got to be wearing off one minute it's probably over well if we just release him into the city without his censer no no if we send him away from us maybe one of those things will find him and we'll have a clearer path yeah if we send him away from us and then we go the other way he's a human distraction
