for this week's d&d beyond spot i wrote a hilarious skit for me and ashley to perform together but she's not here instead i'm going to soldier on without her in the spirit of showmanship hey ashley guess what i'm thinking right now (silence) aasimar i hardly knew her it would be way better if she were here hey i've got one how many tortles does it take to screw in a lightbulb (silence) boy i hope they wrote that one down also any legendary bundle owners who purchased prior to mordenkainen's tome of foes can apply the same code to the new book ashley mordenkainen am i pronouncing that right (silence) and as always the motto of d&d beyond is (silence) ashley's parts filled in the gaps i do what they only printed three one small one medium one large what's his name or just go to sleep it seems like it's too much work also was there anything special about the room just a bed no treats or anything magic a soul asylum that could've been a cool name though that's a conversation they really are rat balloons does that happen does that happen i knew i didn't like the water downstairs i just came to borrow some butter i was making something in my room did they say they had more jobs for us to do where is the meeting do we have a plan for how we're going to-- what if they're taking you downstairs to ritually sacrifice you or something we're all going oh so i'm going in to the belly of the beast sure i'll disguise myself i'll be just like fjord they'll think it's fjord down there that's the first time i've ever done that spell i was very impressed with myself see that's too many options when you can appear to look like anything i need to focus if i get lost in thinking what nose should i have bulbous pointy or patrician nose that could take hours to decide so a patrician nose what kind of eyes what color blue black brown green a patch on one eye what else do i have red hair green eyes big patrician nose cleft chin-- all right i feel like you're describing a specific person i'll think about that one you seem normal all of us sure he didn't mean it like that sometimes he's very honest with people sure yes sure to the fancy place i'm coming with you fjord unless you want to go with your protégé there is it open yes it's nice to see you again mr sol well i'll let fjord finish but i have a request as well don't worry knowledgeable too about all sorts of things ah yes you sold my friend a haversack before and it has these side pouches can you sell me a pouch a little side pouch just a little side pouchy thing drink cozy sort of a thing other haversacks how much were they again oh i'm okay then that's fine i don't need-- i thought that they could be broken up and sold in little sets how much would that endeavor cost me yeah but i'd just get the side pouch i wouldn't get the full thing a lot of buttons that's true i'll think on it can i ask you one more question pumat i don't mean to pry into your personal existence but there seems to be many of you was that caused by magic did you do that is that an accident was that a splicing thing so the cerberus assembly is that powerful with magic oh that's fascinating if someone were to want someone with that sort of magical power you could not provide that but the cerberus assembly could that's amazing are they a secretive group do they have a business card or anything thank you thank you for the information what if we kill all of pumat sol and come back and rob this place you should be tracking it in your d&d beyond currency counter i added my 100 we each got 100 probably you made me laugh

dangers in the world and a lot of dangers for me and especially the closer we get to the north i think they don't like me up there he can protect me no no you can't maybe yes there's a few people that i'm worried about but no one specific where we're going i know that people are always trying to get me and (stammering) i wish-- i need his magic to be there for me when i need safety i need him i need him to live no you're cool for some reason right now so cool will you give me the letter i could change your name on it to his name and then he could use it to get into the school and he could learn more powerful magic and then he could change me he could change this but you're pretty handsome for a half-monster thing (whispering) i think jester likes you yeah what what did you use to be still a monster thing though oh just a less handsome one were you a fat kid do you have any pictures or-- (laughter) did you ever have braces or anything will you promise to keep caleb alive all right
