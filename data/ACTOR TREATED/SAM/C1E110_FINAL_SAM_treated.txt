i was just learning how to dm from matt about a minute ago and i think i know sure my players that i will be controlling-- that's how it works right matt my players will be the talented and charming liam o'brien dagger dagger dagger dagger dagger the charming and cabbage-smelling brian foster friend of the show and charming everything mary elizabeth mcglynn young ashly burch pulling some shit out of her ass i'm sure which is going to be awesome and then a player we have not played with yet he's a lovely voice actor and a talented man eric bauza look him up on imdb he's the voice of everything he has never played dungeons and dragons before merch laura-- oh is there a book update is there a sticker update is there a shirt update i think we've stalled all we can stall right by the way the reason travis and laura are not here is because we all brought our dice and our little character sheets to indianapolis and they left theirs at home so they drove home to go get it i don't actually know i'm laser-focused on my shitty one-shot we're also doing wednesday club me and liam we're going to be talking about my favorite book hellboy are you james lipton in this equation we're essentially doing an episode of allworknoplay right now should we start maybe by the time you're done-- okay we'll start from announcements again he didn't say anything but he did a great impression of you a professional is on time laura so we're going in into the giant i will be lucky pierre right in the middle before the great war thing but only tiny bits maybe it's no fur maybe we should leave trinket i'm just saying that's the furriest one i don't want trinket to die how does this work how much water could a titan hold i know but is there a barrel of water in his chest sure but maybe they're all hypnotized or something to do what but we're in it we're in it oh we're playing pike you two okay maybe dex huh 13 i drank a tiny little potion of healing i healed six what did this mean did this mean we were supposed to follow him and split up let's split up anyway that is a decision sure wow we're already at a battle map well how were we going to have a feast we were in a big board meeting and then we came here 18 great weapon master assassinate uncanny rage okay i will rotate around the guy with the red ring around him so that i'm between him and his friend (singing) i'm living on the edge (laughter) sure oh i'll inspire grog first because i'm about to hit you i will sing (singing) hey now you're a grog-star get your axe up and slay hey now you're a grog-star get your rage on and rage all laura's dice are gold now a d12 can be rolled and then i'll do a 3rd-level thunderwave both it's 15 feet from me yeah it's from me in a 15-foot cube that'll be nice yeah sure oh shit yeah what did the second one roll oh fuck okay that does they both take 4d8 damage and the one who didn't make his save gets pushed away but he's right up against the wall double damage terrible 12 points oh shit if i move away he's going to take a swing at me isn't he but that would be wise no i'll shelter in place yeah i will swing my sword at it with advantage because i just inspired someone and mythcarver has that feature the first one was better 17 plus ten i actually don't know it says it's a plus-three longsword does that mean it's 1d8 plus three so it's 1d8 plus four and then i rolled a one so that's five but it also says somewhere in here deals an additional 1d6 force damage oh yeah one shit on a retreating enemy i get to cast a spell oh shit everybody dies he's going to the phone he's checking his texts i will look for you v s do you get to reroll ones did they make saves so they get pushed as well (whispers) no bonus action why don't we just leave there's no one
