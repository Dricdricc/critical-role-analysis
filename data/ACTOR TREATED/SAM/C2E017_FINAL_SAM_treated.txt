received many emails from fans who loved our d&d beyond ad last week and they told me that i had missed part of the story to recap our sponsor is d&d beyond they are contributing $100 to 826la for every natural one we roll also as part of their massive 826la charity initiative we're past the $10000 tier so d&d beyond has offered up the discount code 826la for 25% off their awesome legendary bundle which includes all the digital materials available on d&d beyond last week to honor that i had dug through the archives and found a commercial that d&d beyond had run in the '80s we did a staged reading of it fans wrote in and said sam you missed part of that story the ad campaign in the '80s was not successful however it launched the career of the young actress who played gail in the commercial she was given her own spin-off sitcom on cbs it only ran four episodes and those episodes have been lost to time but i was able to find the script of a promo for the sitcom starring gail from the d&d beyond commercial from the 80s found it in the archives we're going to do a staged reading of this promo for this sitcom brought to you by d&d beyond i'll be playing announcer reprising their roles will be laura as the mom taliesin as the dad and ashley the johnson as gail here we go picture it you're watching tv it's 830pm primetime and this promo comes on (announcer voice) this fall on cbs it's the hilarious sitcom everyone's stoked about you've got gail that lovable scamp gail gets her foster parents the hendersons into totally gnarly situations but it's not all fun and games you've got gail also tackles serious issues you won't believe the trouble gail gets into every thursday night all-new you've got gail every week right after growing pains and before she's the sheriff presented by d&d beyond (laughter) the character of gail is amazing d-o-y you'll have time get a wireless headphone so you don't wake him or her yeah just play it'll be great (singing) the

cards that is so cool we need something absolutely right now while we're waiting can i just say why did we not think about branding we should have coins cards you should be writing a big nine on a wall wherever we go like everywhere just tagging it just everywhere because we're the mighty nein i know they don't know that when you say it out loud it's much easier that our symbol is the number nine don't you think if you did know then you'd be one of the cool kids that could be a while aw man what a festival yes very that's true four groups are there frightening beasts big beasts magical beasts then why are we doing this we're going to fight dangerous monsters kylre fighting monsters that's what the guy said we're fighting monsters should we go find out what's going on over there i could sneaky-sneak over there and listen i will cast silent image and i'm going to go up to the corner make the image of a three-foot by three-foot box around me i'm going to just (quick footsteps) stealth oh wow 19 can i see through the box oh it's a listening perception four (quick footsteps) still in box form i am going to go back up to them hey guys it's me i'm in a box no it's not a real box i'll stick my hand through it i heard everything there's an attack on ashguard something okay thank you the king said we're going to declare war on xhorhas or something like that i don't remember then there's 1000 dead the skies were black-- i don't know maybe ours at the garrison there was 1000 dead so that's our side wait no we're not on sides we don't like the empire anyway but they wanted to declare war and they're not going to until tomorrow yes we should throw the fight do you have a tramp stamp back there i'm in a box (laughter) 18 wow nine there's just something about him bander rob oh shit it's us this was such a good day whoa did you print that on a laser printer where's the doors to the-- oh they're over there got it i will be behind the pillar over there no this one over-- yes thank you whoa oh 16 here (demonic voice) present oh yeah go closer to the creature that's a good idea i don't like it it's scary oh no or breathe some awful breath of death yes it does she's huge 14 i will shoot my thing at it 21 to hit is yasha-- okay (counting) 19 wait you know what if i'm going to be honest that thing is beyond 30 feet so i would have moved in closer so i don't have to fire at disadvantage then do i have any movement left all right well then i'll dash and i'll go back around towards me behind this corner and hide just duck back there that's it take a swig just run away what could happen (deep voice) i'm sorry you have to talk like this now you added all your shit to that does the enlarge give her advantage on saving throws oh no jessie it will certainly be fixed because d&d beyond is a responsive company and we love them 11 plus eight you have sentinel also i think it's my turn i'm going to stick my hand around and fire my little crossy-bowy not good not good at all ten i will reload and fire again oh god should we count that i don't know matt do i count that or not okay 18 to hit i get sneak attack great 15 i'll take fury of the small why not 19 back behind a wall if you think that would help you're a great player whoa that's a lot remember you're twice as big oh no can we use some medicine wait but the poison will go away eventually right won't it make that check a lot oh wow you need to heal like what like don't run up so close or at least wait a little bit first to gauge the beast don't run into the -- you're going to die oh that's not us i can make a box i can actually make a 15 foot large box we could all fit in it keep our distance we don't know what door they're coming out did we see which door the last two monsters came out of that was the last one no of course not dead center i'm going to cast mage hand nine two for caleb or her butt turkey (groaning) oh jeez wait you're out damn (shouting) pick one and focus fire on that one you raged too much in the games of chance okay i'm going to aim for that flap of skin fire 25 to hit that is 16 points of damage i will run nope i will fire again (reloading) same place 16 to hit six points i'm going to run this way as far as my little-- well so i can still see everybody and the action that's great no you're still strong i do what i always do i fire my crossbow at the beast for a 14 to hit all right-- ooh and it's sneak-- oh 12 points of damage how's everyone-- is everyone alive right now yasha's right next to me-- i mean beau i will do the same thing i will reload and fire again that's a miss ten points ten to attack i'll duck behind the wall and hide like a weakling terrible oh no oh no no toll i've been drinking and hiding oh that's great that's huge wow healer i think laura is the best healer we've ever had (laughter) oh no everyone-- wait wait what if we just stood next to all the doors and held our action until something came out of them what are you talking about yeah but we get a hit in on them the second they came out why is that a terrible idea we would get a surprise round on them yeah so pick four people i'll take one of them let's do it i'm taking a door i love it i'll take a door just pick me a door this one's fine it don't matter (laughter) wait we come in from one of the doors so there's only four yeah there's only four doors i stay where i am and i'm casting mage hand holding my attack i'm staying and i'm holding my attack until something runs out of my door i'm ready to shoot anything that comes out of this door no i'm not i have a crossbow feat i-- i let my crossbow bolt go just out into the-- oh fuck no not at it nope that is a huge thing would have gotten two hits in we're just as far away from the thing yeah but there was two people standing next to that door at one point there was fjord and caleb if you had stuck to the plan you would have gotten two hits and we're all just as far away as we were before ma well you shouldn't have been that far away
