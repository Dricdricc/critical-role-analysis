d&d beyond everybody it's almost thanksgiving time and i thought what better for us to do than to thank our long-time sponsor d&d beyond they've been with us all campaign we hope into the next year so as a token of our appreciation we put together a highlight reel of all my best moments from all the best d&d beyond ads of the year so roll that clip gentlemen and we're going to-- hold on i've just been handed something okay i'm being told that we don't have that clip which is disappointing because we had meetings about this all week i talked to editors about this and this was important to me and to-- okay sorry okay i'm being told that we did not have meetings all week about this and this is a bit that i wrote about an hour ago needless to say i feel like d&d beyond is going to not like this because we've taken them on this rollercoaster of emotions now and they're going to be pretty pissed off they may pull their sponsorship dollars-- okay now i'm being told that no they will not pull their sponsorship dollars because they really just want me to read the ad copy that they provided me two days ago so i'll just read that now and they'll be happy as a reminder from last week dungeon of the mad mage and the magic the gathering d&d crossover guildmaster's guide to ravnica are available now in the d&d beyond marketplace be sure to pick up yours at dndbeyondcom/marketplace okay fine so maybe they're a great company but i feel like they're going to resent me for-- i am being told that no they're not going to resent me at all and in fact they have a promo code named after me the promo code is samisourhero-- not case sensitive-- it can be used right now for 25% off all digital books including those two books i just mentioned earlier so go to the store right now and use it okay forget about d&d beyond all right the fans will be pissed off at me right they will think that i'm an awful human being they'll drag my name on reddit-- i'm being told now that there's nothing written on any of these pieces of paper and this is just a thinly-veiled attempt to get attention to myself because i am very insecure i have these deep-seated problems and-- i'm being told now that i'm actually pretty happy and i don't have any deep-seated depression or anything like that and i'm a pretty good guy wow i really think guys that this bit has been a journey for all of us and i feel like we've all learned something about ourselves and about-- nope i'm being told we have not learned anything and that i'm to wrap it up so back to you matt that sounds awesome that's tomorrow is it all honey plus brian foster or just all honeys awesome ooh i've heard of them oh that's right i have to do a fireside chat okay uh-huh oh maybe i can just wear that that's a good idea water yeah (whispers) shoot her in the back of the head oh i saw it tithe (singing) everyone's fucking avantika oh yes he did have a weird hairline right maybe that's in fashion here maybe we should all go wig shopping just saying mm-hmm the bloated cup yeah we're new pirates are you a pirate i mean i guess we're all pirates right everyone's a pirate here oh are you a captain or do you do something else that's more specialized a sniper name check quick phillip which way's north that's amazing you can spin him here i'm going to spin him around a couple times now which way's north wow right don't fight each other because that's crazy why why would you do this inelegant but perfect crikey i'll take that bet who did you say mario we're awwing yes you did good job jester ooh i'm going to go steal from them oh wait no you can't do that on this island it is the traveler he's going to use that a lot that phrase did he drink a lot into the water do cannon-folk typically go on those trips or do cannon-folk typically stay behind with the ship gunner master oh how can you promise that friend of yours or former friend what purse oh but not like a cute little-- i knew someone like that once they would always go fishing and say that they caught something but they never did yes ooh we'll put our weights down to weigh it down there's a cube (record scratching) remix with the missus oh the lady-- (frustrated noise) bon soir in halfling i will say to beauregard hey don't you think we should go talk to that allison person can i tag along she asks in halfling there's no streets it's all alleys vague directions sure i love a good powder where's the bathroom we just walked across the whole place i haven't seen the bathroom once oh we're just going to take a shit in the alley is it alice or allison maybe that's why she didn't listen to you because you called her the wrong name if she comes out here what are we going to say to her but she's going to ask who we are what do we tell her that we're disgruntled members of her crew but she can turn us in that's terrible we should say that we're-- i'm not good at that okay yeah you're right you're very charismatic we're going to be fine no it seems that way because i'm making a face because i'm halfway through a dump right now i'm ready you're welcome gary gygax okay do you think we should go back in all right i guess we'll go back inside then sure do your business what-- what do you think of our pirate vessel so far of our pirate mission are you having fun nothing we can go back in-- yeah let's go for a walk they can go back to the boat right do you know how deep it is to the bottom there is it deep deep ocean or just medium-ocean all right it's fine let's go explore sort of like a golf club cover the sea breeze at night it's a land-breeze is anyone on the streets okay if we're going to talk about these things let's use some code words don't say her name say a different name yes tiffany the name of the ship tiffany's ship tiffany's ship is the name of tiffany's ship that's all the code we need all right the apricot anything else before we get into this all right so how will we deal with tiffany of course we're walking-and-talking everyone do this she went to bed she's fine she won't know we're talking about her because we're using a new name tiffany so she's not even going to know we love you orlando if i may here's our options i don't but i've been thinking about things i'm lit i'm tight but feeling good our intent is to get off this island without tiffany correct apricot fruit stand apricot tree here's our options i'm just putting them out there i put no weight on any of them we can follow tiffany tomorrow as she goes about her day we can get in touch with this allison person follow her-- i know right (laughter) we could talk to some of tiffany's crew right bouldergut seems dumb sorry franklin delano roosevelt seems dumb (laughter) then there's this sorris fellow i don't know he didn't seem like he's be a font of any knowledge we can sabotage tiffany's ship i don't know what that would do because we need it to get off the island we could frame tiffany for some crime against another pirate we have a signature from tiffany in a letter that she wrote we have-- that is all that we have what you could pop in where to her ship to her captain's quarters on the ship on the tiffany ship that's a lot you can just leave but it's our ship we work on the ship you mean like plant something rifle through her stuff that would be permanent wait if you could get in to her cabin you can disguise self as well right you could change yourself to vera or something or to avantika or vera oh shit shit you could turn yourself into franklin delano roosevelt you could walk off the ship and no one would think the wiser or they might say franklin delano roosevelt why are you on tiffany's ship you'd be like bitch i work here i'm franklin delano roosevelt honda can you keep tiffany busy for you know 15 or 20 minutes 25 if you really had to take a break this is a good plan and we're going to go in there-- oh you're going to go in there do you need some help except beau can't make herself look like anything else fake tiffany i can break into things i can also talk to caleb i can make myself look like something i could be ipess it cannot fail this is the best plan we've ever had we need someone just off the boat in case things go awry i'll message you that we need some help on the inside and there needs to be someone on the outside of honda and tiffany in case he needs some help in there i don't know where were we meant to stay where are the other crew staying on the ship or on land sure you're the runner sure honda are you going to be able to-- i'm just saying there's gonna be a peeping tom in the room with you i think we need frumpkin in there a peeping tomcat no he can fly outside the window and peek in just to see if you're-- what's the source of the thunder is that like-- it looks open getting on is not a problem inside the ship we can just be there no we just are in what do you mean please start over again uh-huh we're going to start the bamf there you won't see us ever i mean i have very high dexterity okay maybe charisma leaving i can already dex my way around but you can't are you dextrous i have feather fall maybe yes i want it give it to me now ooh did anyone touch the dodecahedron yet fjord do you want to do it i guess you're already fucking do you want the dodeca (screaming) fate point you've stolen from a lot of rich people i know it's sort of her defining trait when you laugh right after you said that i think that was very insulting (laughter) no she was laughing we're ready let's do this how does this work well is there a chance it could fail might we die are we synchronizing watches what is this what ah that was amazing we are secret agents we're secret detectives yes oh wait i've already forgotten take out the wire fold it just so okay we're in the ship caleb 120 feet can you hear me reply to this message 120 feet beauregard can you hear me if you can respond to this message we are inside the boat relay that message when you can bye do you want to burn them for light oh okay that's better just close the windows hood up 18 there's probably gap under the doorway a gap under there they'll see a glowing light i would reveal my unmentionables i'll take my cloak and hang it over the curtains so it's double-blocked you're going through papers yeah i'm going to go around the walls and look for hidden safes we get advantage on everything 19 hidden safes in the wall trap-opening thingies i'll check it for traps investigation three 12 well it's still pretty low 12 okay i will pick up the book we've been made turn over the place hold your breath not yet no hold your breath we've got to look around i'm still looking i'm holding my breath and i'm looking you paint i'm looking i look at the book is there anything there common goblin halfling taking the book i'm going to go over to the desk where jester had pointed and start jimmying the lock on the locked thing 15 pull it open (grunt) and just smoke sure taking them all we've got to look more okay get in the-- i'm going to grab a cloak off the thing now there's a permanent hole there modifiers two i'm going to very quietly say wait until you hear a body fall above us (whispering) okay (normal volume) what did i steal can i open one up and see what's in it put the jewel right on his shoulder yeah i tuck it under the blanket like it was with him yeah i'm going to keep the rest for myself we're going to crawl under his bed 23 plus ten still 33 i guess right we can go back up we can keep looking lift me up i think it's probably wafted out by now down the hall peek my head up that's a natural one maybe i should reroll that one i'll do my fate die okay that's slightly better nine (laughter) tap her head down wow i'm going to say down wisdom now 11 it's a condition 19 i don't know i don't know what just happened this is a crazy ship i don't know let's call for help caleb can you hear me we're in big trouble we need help we need a distraction is caleb there yet great going to try it again beauregard we're going to need a distraction to get out of here mild confusion and panic but don't-- what we're going to disguise ourselves hold on i'll call you back you were going to be avantika and i was going to be ipess it doesn't make any sense right now does it i guess she will have seen one hole by now are there any portal windows i'm going to grab that jewel that was on the floor wait wait just paint wood there fuck no no no sure how's her painting going they're going to find a hole two gems one gem i'll break it in two 19 leave that we're going to cast disguise self on each other i'm going to be keg great pirate keg pirate molly up on deck though and see if anyone's around perception or-- what are we 19 (loading bow) no sam and how far up i'm going to cast phantasmal force on that person on that being intelligence 14 describe the crow's nest to me all right i will make the figure think that his crow's nest has caught fire and there are little flames licking around creeping up the sides of it and surrounding it off the back of the boat yeah we're stealthing no we're stealthing we're moving from-- okay 36 the seaward side yes the side away from the docks jump in we're jumping in baby seal style swim away i'll hold your hand as i walk away on the water i'm lying great just away and around i won't ever let go oh god i'm letting go 38 (relieved groaning) i'm probably a bit wet too yeah i'm wet nope i mean just calmly walking away right are there lots more people coming no you look great you look great do i look okay light my cigarette you've got a cloak on disguise self or-- oh the phantasmal force let's get the fuck out of here right we're just going to calmly walk into town i don't know good evening madam dripping wet and dry off are we still soaking wet like a dog i'll shake it off a little bit do you have any spells that can make us dry oh no your weasel's dead again isn't it what's that what does that do are you saying to me that we made a mistake i agree we got a book we got some jewels these are hot ice we got to get rid of these i know don't worry we're going to plant them on allison everything's going to be fine don't worry figured done mage hand allison's pocket we're clean hey you did good in there yeah we're pretty great who are you talking to don't worry there was a little hiccup but we took care of it hey just throwing it out there there seemed to be a couple of loose ends that we need to tie up can you make us an alibi like suggest to someone that we were drinking with them all night in case it's asked oh well then don't do that never mind i assume a lot of people down there the best don't accidentally turn it to fungus sure has i'll do the same good stuff we got a book well i don't have it can any of you read this it was hidden behind a panel like a false panel in the wall oh nice there's these jewels too then we caused another guard to stab someone and another guard to jump to his death but we can turn this problem into a proble-tunity and we can take these jewels that she will definitely know came from her and plant them on someone else to just sort of-- we could plant them on this allison person who she doesn't like already or maybe on one of her own crew and have them killed oh we could plant them on someone that we don't like how about jamedi cosko i don't like that guy we don't want to hold on-- yeah these are hot rocks here we could destroy these gems and smash them up into smaller gems vera why do you think vera isn't that just because you stole her job that seems like a legitimate beef how do you know that she said she's going to kill him well then we should roast her that could be good stuff there's three land masses right there which one's her favorite and i fucked him i don't want to say that we're the best detectives because that's already-- -- established fact but could this be that we just got promoted commissioner i don't know could be we just cracked the case again don't bother him wow best plan ever it's pretty oh but wait it's a hot rock we could put it in the bag of holding or whatever do we know where she's staying which room she's in what the jewels we can just throw them in the ocean we could snoop-- we could wait until we see vera at breakfast tomorrow and just-- right she's staying here except if we bring this to the plank king it's admitting that we broke into the ship and stole it we do we still need proof that this came from her that she wrote this but that's fake yeah that's good i like that she would've shared that right what we could drop it in allison's mailbox and say hey here's all the proof you need to destroy avantika well did you see the way they looked at each other yeah he was asking for a snitch that seems legit that seems legit and honest he was making an honest-- right did you get the honest vibe from plankie ooh who knows what it'll be she's keeping us in suspense then we can take her boat but then we'll face her head on just one-- one other consideration one other consideration just throwing it out there we're all spitballing here right you know that page that you were telling us about that says the three land masses might be the grand archipelago maybe when you're translating that becomes four land masses and a different place we're going to translate one page no it's got to be the whole book i would mend the page that has the thing about where the peach tree is we are so good at this where does that go are we all staying in this room tonight well we've got the silver thread up she can't get in i attack fjord sneak attack damage pretty good (knocking) oh what's caleb up to hide that shit hide that shit hide that shit it's in the haversack it's okay she can't pull the safe unless she knows it's in there hello on the deck of the ship all right aye aye we'll see you there in what a couple hours that's fine want me to throw it on the roof he needs to change we've got ten minutes what about the jewels should we get rid of the jewels we'll do it on the way well yeah they're not in the room do you want to pop out of the room oh that the haversack well what are we doing with the book and stuff do you want me to sleight of hand throw the bag down an alley as we walk sure got to get rid of it we've gotta get rid of it i'm super fast just toss it and then we'll come back for it behind a dumpster look it's a space shuttle where's the book right now yeah we've got to get this book off the fucking boat it's worth its weight in salt flawless plan executed flawlessly (singing) it can only be better
