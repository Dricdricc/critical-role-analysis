that we would look out for each other what do we know there's some sort of twitch performance that we have to get to there's a twitch show there's something upstairs there's weird shit on the walls being written do we know what that is matt's dead marisha's a spore yeah let's go liam we're going to the twitch area this is a reasonably sized d&d table now we have a reasonable amount of people did you guys hear this whole thing about the clue there's a riddle were you there for that or is that me hearing something that marisha heard when i did my one-shot i played the same song for 45 minutes so it's just a two minute-- guys can i quickly admit that i don't know the layout of the building at all i don't know the difference between-- half the people you've talked about i've never heard of okay sure which way do i go okay i'm at the tip of the spear i've got my whip i'm going where are you are you putting it on your face it could protect your eyes oh you got to mark off that willpower is this a portable system how does this work this is a riddle this is a puzzle we've got three clues so far i was born in a box how do i end something is wrong right that was the first thing that we read is it something is the matter or something is wrong travis and and then also your funeral this is a word scramble okay in just a straight-- --straight stanima two successes who gets born in a box was jesus christ born in a box a manger thing that's a good thing no this is progress sure all right i'll try to look for a rat with her only one success and one failure with the red dice i'd say you're dead to me but-- i'm helping her and while we're looking i'm telling her-- i'm was going to say i'm feeling very vulnerable why don't we form an alliance and if anything goes down we kick liam down and we'll run away as fast as we can of course yes but liam's a goner what just happened i found a sword why don't we all look for puzzle clues or should we try to do more to the-- that circle on the ground taliesin how big is it big enough that if it opened we could fit through it we could put some mushrooms on the head what would heads not like wait suns cause ashes-- we just found a sword what if the sword is-- but would silver hurt a head there's an audio booth here really i know where the bathrooms are always you are huge whoa five successes taliesin wow crossfit he needs to be invited in he's a vampire we went to the bathroom not me sam there's another sam that's quite a card game is he wearing your jacket because you're dead sure of course you do oh boy he knows things which is (whispering) the puzzle me sam yeah i think we're in the bathroom right no i don't know-- we didn't find anything in the walls anything to eat yeah let's go search as we go i'm going to tell liam listen i convinced laura that i'm on her side totally yes when she goes down she's going to try to kick you or throw you down or trip you up but i'm going to walk behind her club her in the back of the head and we're going to make off like bandits the bookcase is literally the end of my knowledge of the way out of the building is there more building past the bookcase perception investigation i failed on a red yes one success we recorded one at the convention and then i never edited it man we have it right now it's already done with some other people yeah we'll do that oh god what's going on oh okay why can't-- looks like you're playing it seems like travis should play he's a card guy can we find someone else to play this game why don't we go find somebody else to play this game are there any others where's max all right if i'm not back in 30 seconds i'll run i have a power what's my power celerity your body responds so quickly that the world around you seems to slow down oh wow i go all over the place okay all right so i'm going to run back there burn that blood what do i do what's-- is it thursday again yeah make max do it no we need to do it so we know you want me to do it if i sit down though will i be able to get up again all right i'll draw a card what could possibly go wrong the three of swords more blood i'm at three what happened (gruffly) i don't know what came over me (yelling) it's on wait i get a question i get a question first what but you know why she's doing this it's because we made a pact to stick together she's protecting me can i get off the chair that i'm on or no oh okay i'll stay there so we can ask our questions or whatever oh yes my question can we-- i just killed max it's super stressful sorry what did we find out so far what about the cross what do we need to overcome the cross part of the puzzle are you a vampire the sun's setting that's a good thing though that means we can go outside we'll send some more players down here thanks for your cooperation liam did you see how fast i was just a big t-bone sitting there in a cage always oh he's a vampire he's seen the lost boys i know that's true what's that two failures both red it was so good it was so good it was like a brunello di montalcino wine laura doesn't know how to read there's chattering let's get our weapons out and go face this threat head on why don't we solve the puzzle now liam we need a symbol of faith-- yeah we're about to solve the puzzle wait i ate a man do you want me to do my super speed and go upstairs and see what that scuttling is you're eating them but if we beat the magic they all come back to life right i'll come with you do we recognize them and one red fail i'm coming in too i'm a good person i'm a fan of your boss are you writing something or developing something as laura bites i'm going to take my xlr whip and use it to subdue and put it around the neck of the other one i'm not hungry dex brawl i rolled three successes for my garrotte i'm not trying to kill i'm just trying to subdue is it a dude i lift him up and march him down the stairs for my friends what is it laura (whispering) i won't clean your mouth three successes don't make a sound and i am not going to kill you and i bring him downstairs and throw him at liam have at him i'm going to take the smart girls boy and throw him on the floor in front of us and then run into the twitch room you got no successes on yours i love how he is a full adult male grown-up employee but he's a kid now that was rachel and ed oh my god we're inside of the twitch we're here we're in this room are we live on twitch our crew liam and i never said which way we had gone i'm coming up and i'm going to say big fan-- is he on this set or is he at the control board i'm going to pull out my wyrmwood gaming tray from under the table over there and hand it to him and ask him to sign it you killed our dungeon master so are you saying that once the magic is broken everybody comes back to life again we do need him for the show before you freak out-- i've run a one-shot i know how to dm liam's done a couple liam's pretty good no liam's alive we ate some of them yeah i think that's a compliment weird backhanded compliment you had to pay for this a little well you know you could have asked us to come play hey wait wait you're a dungeon master you could lead the game right we need a silver sharpie i'm going to speed-dash toward laura and liam let's get out of here let's go out the tunnel we're going in two matts dead yes but the three new best dms in the world have survived so
