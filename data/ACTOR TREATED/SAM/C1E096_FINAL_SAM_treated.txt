that's too specific too specific she might have gone to a place that wasn't a tannable place too specific why don't we all make sportsball without travis and just be terrible at talking about sports and he'll be like i can't i can't watch this i gotta go do it i have an announcement we have a fan out there who just got out of surgery his name is kurt shappacher but in d&d is known as bork the most eloquent half-orc and i want to wish him a speedy recovery and i'll kiss his surgical scar if i ever meet him depending on where it is on his body i mean i was not am i to unveil it right now can you help me unveil it people at table one it is a quilt oh my god it's so big it's so mighty it's so many pictures of me this is everything that i've ever wanted to sleep on why are you ripping this thing don't tear it (laughter) it's all posts and artwork of my character-- my former character scanlan shorthalt (laughter) wow we'll find out at the break we'll find out at the break we're not gonna waste too much time here it's so great picture of me picture of me another picture of me i love it (laughter) there's another thing oh it is a little itty-bitty doty and he's got a tiny little book oh he's so cute the little book actually has little pages it's so cute it was a real heisman trophy (laughter) if you get a heisman trophy will you do sportsball the show what about a superbowl ring you heard him critters go on out and-- for a shitty show we'll edit this out later we're taking pike to wilhand i mean pike you want to go see wilhand right oh i'll take that as a yes simultaneously but we'll leave just a moment later what campus tours have you been on (laughter) was it what does jb stand for junior bacon cheeseburger (laughter) that is a great name you know 20 years to a gnome is like five for a human i'm just saying it could be okay is that it what you have there percy that hat birthday hat like a goose-step goose-stepping millennia that last word yeah yeah get to the good shit the dog run taryon darrington in gnome i say it's a pleasure to make your a-taint-ance (laughter) you grew up here and you seem okay that's hard to believe that sounds fun sleeping outside when you have a perfectly good home to sleep in all right i'll have to try it sometime taryon darrington yes it's a pleasure to make your a-cunt-ance a-cunt-ance he's an old man he doesn't lie well it seems to have worked whispers we have nothing to sell oh those shirts there really that's how she talks at home oh boy she also owns a bakery co-owns a bakery with the rest of us and she is one of the finest bakers we have the best bakers make it up as they go we don't even have measuring cups we just kinda pour it all in and shake it up and see what comes out it literally took five minutes to get here i made it off of a recipe that she had cultivated and it's quite-- you'll taste-- i'll just ask him is there any message you wish to send to ogden or the rest of the trickfoots all right okay family history got it all right very good in gnome i say it has been lovely making your acquaint-anus (laughter) i'll keep working on it taryon darrington not a firm handshake at all the old apple-in-the-hand except your heart he's combing my hair 33 34 35 oh le girl how are you well yes unpublished as of yet as we all know budding oh like a short story or something i mean sure they could write something like that i would maybe even read it someday oh i am a wonderful writer but you know my story has intrigue and danger and romance-- seems like a bit of a downer just a book about a curse i mean you know how it's gonna end someone's gonna get cursed what oh oh yes yes of course i would be happy to take down her story yes absolutely if she'll share it with me we could call it an outline and then ogden can fill in the details later the curse only manifests itself in those who bring it upon themselves with greed or that seems odd unless she's doing things that we don't know about well your narrative was crude and the language not at all descriptive but i think we have the building blocks to work with here for something that we could turn into you know like an essay an essay of some sort not a book not a book at all nope i don't think it would be thick enough for that a pamphlet maybe a big pamphlet we'll work on it you've called us together for a reason most times family comes into town you show them a couple sights-- -- yeah they leave this seems like a strange family visit and avarice jb said that you would have to bring this curse on yourself have you been up to-- be straight with us we're all on the same team here are you sure you don't have greed in your heart lust in your heart what if we do this what if we go up to the mountain full moon go through the motions and keyleth you're super-powerful you must have some sort of way of telling if this ogden is telling the truth right the other option is-- and i've been holding onto it 'cause it's valuable-- i do happen to have a potion of mind reading so we could go up there with him and i could just read his mind that is the smartest thing you've ever said one i have one of it i said that about you thank you why you know it's sinful in a sort of vague way google maybe we could google it i think it's having hate in your heart i think what is avarice doesn't say oh it's just greed it's just greed yes yes of course they'll be easily killed they're half our size percy's very smart we should all be there together because stronger in numbers and if pike's lying to us we kill her and if jb's lying to us we kill her no if you're infected with evil we might have to-- i've never used it so it should probably work great about a thousand i can only i think investigate one person-- or gnome-- at a time but then i can move the spell to other people let me-- doty give me my notes on the spell that i took hold on i can shift my attention to other creatures' thoughts or go deeper into the same creature's mind so i can do some surface scans and then if i get a hit i can go deeper of course i still defer to you as my teammates i don't have to be the one who takes this serum i did pay for it but if one of you wanted to do the probing you could buy it off me i suppose that's true it fits he can't see i feel like that's a compliment i was gonna say-- it's four days right well i think we do it while we're up there we've got the musketeers guarding the place it lasts for one minute i mean maybe but i feel like we wait for the big moment and then see what's going on in his head it's more dramatic that way anyway for the book and for our lives way to bury the lede pike she's not wearing a wire she's okay there's no secrets that you have no singular secret that you've kept from the entire group the entire time we've known you there's not some deep secret that you're keeping from us but then we'll be sitting there for two days are we walking or can we get some horses at least i'm worried about the big guy i guess he can just walk let me look at matt's statistics i could do that how fast does this cloud thing move at dawn we leave yes yes for science i have little potpourri bags in almost everything i own yes let's do it nope you were gonna gas us all the way there i'll stay behind as well i bid you adieu (laughter) ugh gross they don't know how to break it do they damn it three days to kill battlemap just call it a map matt don't call it a battlemap oh my god what is this there's color changes happening it's weird the blue light makes it almost-- i can't even see what it is it's okay we'll figure it out matt in preparation for this ritual i would like to cast-- can doty use an item that i cast magic into okay well then i'll cast revivify into one of my coins and give it to vex and say use this on me if i fall oh and also i'll give her my five needle arrows that i made they're just regular arrows that have a +1 to hit so just a little extra accuracy you're worth it i'm just gonna stay where the gnomes are all within 30 feet of me so close to the action within visual 30 feet okay i'm gonna drink the potion of mind reading yes i'm going to scan his surface thoughts what is most on his mind in that moment as an action if it's my turn again i will attempt to probe deeper into the same creature's mind he makes a wisdom saving throw 13 it's not very good more gibberish ugh waste of 1000 bucks i believe that breaks the spell it says if i probe deeper he makes a wisdom saving throw if he succeeds the spell ends and he's aware i was probing the plan failed the plan failed i know sylvan common gnome draconic undercommon another thousand that don't look good that's tall my plan was foolproof three and then got oh jesus what if it's good you don't even know if it's a good guy where's my pen sam and wait no damage it took oh shit maybe it's not there but groggy-poo was i get an attack of opportunity (laughter) oh god all right i whip out my string of beads and i pull off a bead and i will throw it down at the creature's feet just behind it if possible so it and only it is in the cube of ten feet money lots and lots of money so there's just a big spherical ball there with nothing inside of it or does the creature look like it's inside of it holy shit this is an expensive trip (laughter) just between us not forward just in a guarding position he can't do a separate attack can he no oh he can oh jeez i'm not used to having these things then yes i'll just have him take a swing at the thing a bash he can make two attacks this guy's awesome we're friends very i would say all right doty's going to make two attacks then bash and a headbutt what do i do i roll something i roll a natural 20 on bash that is nine points of damage and then going in for the headbutt one oh but still caused damage what is this magic you have to be close to it like you have to hit it with your fists everything is that four hits north of 25 that would have just straight-up killed me with advantage 12 he's literally the worst what just happened trinket just became a ghost do it travis (laughs) draw dick-butts all over it trinket's a ghost (gasps) the gnomes are kill them okay play it out (whispers) they're robbing the bakery right now to whom are jb and ogden together sure sure i'm just gonna break free from ogden and i'm going to whip out another bead and throw it right at him (laughter) it's a dexterity save 15 oh yeah oh yeah okay four one four three oh shit i should probably be adding these that's nine that's 12 i'll say doty carry him to the edge of the cliff the sphere weighs one pound regardless of what is inside of it it's ten by ten i mean encircled-- oh matt is so fucking good he's committed to this bit so you rush over towards him as doty's got him maybe ten feet from the edge and now you can see as he's like oh pike yeah he's still in the ball doty just hold him over the edge what's the play here what's the game what were you trying to get not that diamond there's more to it than that what you can just do that oi what do you want i will identify it ooh that seems useful ooh thank you this will help make up for the 3500 gold i spent on this fight (laughter) matt is so good you played us every time we're so stupid he was rolling every time-- oh he missed again oh wow this guy can't roll real good can he we were so stupid oh my god this guy i-- how am i getting a son-of-a-bitch he's the son-of-a-bitch (laughter)
