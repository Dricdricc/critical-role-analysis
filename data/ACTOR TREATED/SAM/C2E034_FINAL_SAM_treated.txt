green to another we were just told that he might be around and he has some information that we were looking for we are actually trying to deliver him a bit of correspondence oh that will go over great

careful we guarantee (laughter) there's the white-haired lady the thick elf yeah yeah to refresh everyone else's memory because my memory is sound we're looking for a way to get down into the underbelly of the city right oh yeah that's right we got to find out some info use those blue dice those blue dice i touched them all 200 gold cadmus cue heavy metal music i'll run over and give her a big hug on her knees we're here for fjord and also for you no she has to tell us where're you going now you just got here we haven't even said hello this is yasha you can't afford-- she's going to marquet is that where you're going that will be difficult to find she might be under a spell or something a hypnosis spell hit her snap her out of it maybe we've been there the moist guy ooh are you super-goth santa or something or maybe it's the ball thing the dodeca maybe it brings us all together maybe it's special in some way he does this a lot yasha go with it open up and he'll read into your inner thoughts that's his power you probably do but you just don't remember them you can sleep with crystals to have a more vivid experience when you dream tonight when it looks like you're really fast asleep i'll wake you up and ask you what you're thinking about great yet to yasha she's right next to you everyone please yasha has to catch an express bus out of here so we should probably get to ass-kicking yeah the magical messages they should have arrived that doesn't make any sense unless if you were under someone's spell well that's four extra words stay on task widogast (laughter) we have asked everyone in this bar about everyone else in this town except for al gore i don't think that we have no we have not the tower we've asked about sabian we've asked about marquet we've asked about the marius guy we need to ask why we came here all right i take a big swig of booze stand up on the table take off my mask (shouting) everyone in the wayfarer's cove you're surrounded by a band of goblins they're everywhere and they'll come in here unless you tell me the location of algar tell me now and i kick over a chair two kicks there's goblins everywhere they're banging at the windows you might know him as mr dyomin that was of course a scene from the one-act play that you can see later tonight the marquis demesne to talk to-- first question to marius how do you pronounce your last name how marisha and why don't we take a rowboat and i'll just stay above the surface and when you guys are ready tug and i'll pull you up yasha will stay with me i don't understand we're just going to go out into the harbor and start swimming blindly looking for an underwater gate why don't we send someone first or at least ask around before we just start swimming
