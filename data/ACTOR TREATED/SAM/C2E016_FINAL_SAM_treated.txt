quick history lesson i did some research d&d beyond actually even though it's a popular modern website it started in the 80s when d&d started to get popular it didn't catch on because there was no internet but they still had the website they did an ad push for it and i found a script from their earliest ad that they put out it's a little dated it's a 1980s ad for d&d beyond and me and my

like you need extra luck for that can i just say real quick before we adjourn there was something that you were reluctant to do because of your own personal fears and you entrusted jester to inspire you to do something that was possibly uncomfortable for you and it worked out great i think that moving forward if you want to just go for it as long as you have trusted friends with you then that would be a good option to do he's not my son get out just go just leave who was it who killed her (shouting) what does it say (singing) mote of possibility custom items do we need to dress up matt
