a shot let's find out right i'm going to concentrate on simon three and send it back the way we came not hitting anything just to see how far it goes before i lose telekinetic connection with it is it still going how far away is it now okay come back it obeys me because i asserted my dominance that's one way right can they see each other wait what can see the source the names of the people we killed we know their names i could be one of them i have an orb of destruction next to me that would seem like his sure we just killed him right which was the one who was controlling the orb though i won't be alone i'll have simon with me send who down where how far are they from us but you people have to be near me when i do this how is that going to happen taliesin and is there anything to hide behind wait an actor prepares who am i what's my motivation am i odell if so why does odell have the sphere with him sure i'll show her i'll show all of them i like this good backstory wait who's viscon which one is he yeah but he was running away he wasn't the one holding the sphere it was the green robe guy wait we have the actual robe just give me that property of jimmy if found return to-- i thought green so we want the red did we ever hear his name viskorad my name is viskorad i'll just use the same one we know the other one was named odell and he's dead so i can go over to them and say they've killed odell so they need to go get what okay but what is the thing that we found odell is still down there he needs some help i'm going to go talk to vec while they go help ode right i'm going to put on my hat of disguise and become as close to that man's form as i can wait was he a human was he an elf he was human moles and trolls red leather yellow leather wonderful we have the jenga we can do the jenga we kill everyone yes you're going to be in triple digits soon i am going to limp as i go strong choices commit to them a hundred percent i go to the one that had that knight near it right i'll go to the middle one i'm going to keep the ball in front of me to obscure me a little bit not dead in front of me but it's up here just in case hanging my head a little bit i'll go up and say power so much power i've never experienced anything like it before come i need aid okay first one was better ten plus-- what is this taliesin and 28 so far it's going great guys we were tunneling with the orb and we found something an ancient dwarven artifact it bends reality it changed things it changed my voice it changed my whole world for a moment it's still down there odell needs help i have been injured take the orb go down to where we were down that way i will go get help for myself odell needs you to help him contain the power yes what am i going to do with a fucking sphere wait we're supposed to cave in shit goddamn it why didn't you tell me this plan i'm not the best at this game well they can move faster but they won't have the orb with them don't you think the thing that the big thing is guarding is the better path the guy who talked to me is he still here okay which archway did he come from laura and okay i'm going to go up to the middle one and say excuse me big fellow i have to get by 25 i'm going to go in through the archway i'm going to go a few feet in do i see anything it's stairs how far can i get before i'm away from 60 feet well i must have gone with them and then gone forward well you better fucking move forward no i'm at the threshold of the entrance i take a knee (groans) i'm okay i just need a second (whispering) what's going on what's going on with my brain (groans) what's the plan okay you can do this man stand up (whispering) lead him away where i'll start back i go back through and i say no it's too dangerous they need help down there i fall down to one knee again and say ugh damn these legs you must go help them they'll die down there can't you see it's getting worse the pain just charisma 23 wouldn't it seem odd if i started singing to myself how you're 60 feet away from me sure i'll inspire myself why not oh i get to roll something ooh another eight that's robotics law one right they're idiots just go that we're about to go into what about the 60-feet thing who are you going to stealth-kill they're probably getting down to odell at this point we should hurry i'm still at the door and i'll say no get away from me you interlopers evil-doers that's right you infiltrator (screams) i'll run but i'll say no no don't take me with you i need to stay here approaching us or we're approaching it who are you people what do you want with me your first time's always disappointing children why would you want to scry on me if you did you would've seen this a big black sword i'm a little guy look it's bigger than my mug for a joke is it a roll no it's a thing that happens who are you people let me go i'm innocent oh that's true (fake sobbing) that is my backstory but you wouldn't be able to help her find it in a necklace is it the direction that we came from or the direction that we are going but down we don't know if there's even any catacombs or anything down there it could be buried in solid earth and it could be a thousand feet down if only we had some sort of sphere shit but when it catches up to us we'll take it back simon answer your master i can't yeah gate stones they're not gate stones i have one underground she'd have to become a different form she'd become an earth elemental in solid earth and change your form into an earth elemental but you would be a mist how would you tell her anything how are you going to see and if you can find a place to pop back into existence 30 feet away but she knows where it is all right do it no she cannot she won't be able to see her if you're ethereal you're in a different plane why don't you go find it and come back and tell us okay let's go every ten minutes that's useless the locate object only lasts ten minutes 240 feet that gets us 480 total feet possible in two hours halfway and we might not get there i do stealth team is not me right it's you two we're also committing that this is where the mansion is going to live for the night is this a good spot for it no the mansion can't be seen they would have to know that it's there well we can hide it behind a closet or something i always carry a closet with me you have advantage on this 25 what did pike get it is visible so is there a closet in here or some sort of alcove the entrance shimmers faintly and is five feet wide and ten feet tall you and any creature you designate can enter investigation i got a 23 22 harry potter lives there i started reading harry potter yeah i'm on chapter three if we drink wine tonight it will only be in remembrance of you or to get snookered does that burn your spell are you done poor ashley you're abandoning your sister back in the mansion we're all sipping wine and i'm saying i know our friends will come back to us and i know that they won't ever lead anyone here shit (laughs) we need whoopi goldberg molly you in danger girl and here's cucumber salad everyone there's some dill that's my turn  (laughter) how's it going outside he knows where you are did he know where you were and did he know that you came over here so he knows where we are so we have to leave now yep but then we have to leave or be ready to leave at a moment's notice or we should maybe leave right now and then what then we all have to leave earth clear (laughs) everclear best episode ever she's back is she back do you have the sword we have to move the safehouse has been compromised he doesn't know we're in here but he knows where the mansion is and he will come to dispel it so we have to get out of this mansion and either make another mansion somewhere else or go to somewhere else from inside this mansion right now to this exact spot music just got supes loud wait what weapons training he's getting dice a lot of dice a lot of dice vax or vex swords and dicks just wants to kill vecna what else is he into you look like a methhead i want to see one of those before-and-after meth photos of grog (laughter) what is the plan we're in the feywild where there's werewolves and pixies i don't know that i aged but didn't know why he was not our friend he was an asshole wasn't he the guy who sketched us and was creepy fair point i lost my house today all right so go easy it's insured we took a stone wait why are we finding this artagan fellow he can control the land the powers of the land garmelie you don't say it you have to write it down ashley will you draw something and show it to us on the camera i think it's a vag is this thing going to kill you can you read it he came that fast i unzip my pants (laughter) is that something you can control and what would you request i'm pretending to be a mage right now so i'm a crime lord i can get you really good discount furniture he's into autoerotic asphyxiation mere passage of an hour that's good yeah can i ask one question first will you be pleasuring yourself during this oh i respect you so much what is that how do you activate it the place that we're meaning to return to is moving could you send us to a moving place can you send us back we have to send ourselves back garmelie i don't remember being in the feywild at all or meeting him right oh that's right but does that restore memories can i pleasure myself yeah we have no choice pikey do you want to stay too pikey this is weird this is like a weird snuff film sure you'll be fine this will be harrowing for you but you'll be fine we'll bring you back this is a sacrifice i look away no not at all what the fuck is this i'll scoop up everything i'll make a little circle of rocks i don't think that that would be a good time to do this i don't know that are we going to rest here do we have to wait a whole day before he comes back anything else we can accomplish here sylas she said sylas is alive i don't know what i was going to say armor fluffer i need to accomplish something i don't know i have a spell and i can use it before we rest but i don't know what to use it on well i can do a few different things before we sleep we can go out into the woods and find an animal a big animal i could turn it into something like a flying thing that we could give to grog so he could fly fly with that sword like a wyvern sure a big animal i would love to turn trinket into a wyvern (laughter) yes yeah forever did he say yes i knew that i can speak with animals too (laughter) all year (laughter) or-- or i could do other things i could do other things i could make another compatriot for us to have in battle like another scanlan or another pike yes or i could do other things i don't know never done this before it's a crazy spell but if you could fly-- yeah you could bring that sword to his neck it's a real thing magic would not stop it from flying it would be a real thing sure but it couldn't be dispelled with magic no i can turn you into an eagle another scanlan who could easily be destroyed well it'll be a magic thing that could be dispelled that thing couldn't that would be a different spell altogether there's other things too i could cast a spell on one of us that if you died it would activate and it would heal you no but my death ward would last for ten days no i mean i could but it seems like a shitty use-- if there's two of me i can't cast haste i don't know it who does liam laura and oh marisha and can the episode title be dicks and dicks (laughter) what is that
