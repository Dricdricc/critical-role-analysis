hacker for re-roll what's your deal well that makes sense i feel like now would be a good time for me to confess that i don't really like i've never had honey i eat bamboo mostly no no i just haven't had it just don't have it much where i come from that would be good okay did i i ate it on the way here i eat a lot dress as people how's that going to work we all look giant well what do we see boss

half what is this true like now this is a spell i can do wait that's this yeah when i use this stick i become two bears this makes much more sense but i don't have to use it now but have this item okay great i can't bite it in half i'll just hold onto it with my digits that i have it's going to take a while i'm going to eat the second stick boss i know she's within earshot but shouldn't we

(laughter) i've got an idea i make a tree right in the middle of the lobby there you use your fire stick set it on fire the whole place goes up problem solved hey i'm the muscle all right i don't come up with the plans there are no bad ideas right fail half succeeded right i can knock it in does honey burn nothing wrong with being a vegan by the way i get just as much protein from bamboo listen it's not my fault that i don't have to kill an innocent animal to survive like you fuckers do cows don't count sweets oh not like candy do you need a tree tree 27 i'm so sorry we're disrespecting an elderly person he's not a bear he's a prairie dog all right here let me give you a tree stand back stand back everybody boss how has he earned it he hasn't done anything you ready okay stand back everybody i smash the stick down on the ground success what kind of tree sure what color would the bark be lightish-brown fuck it i'm going to start eating it turndown service honey service does the door look like it swings in or out it swings out i'm going to stand in the cavity where the door swings so i'll be hiding behind the door when the door's open just in case i need to deliver some muscle yeah gopher shut up stop peeing on my tree trinket if you get in trouble and need me to swing the door and cause some panda-monium -- trademarked-- what's the signal give me a code word give me a signal dollars okay why would that come up in a conversation all right i'm ready i'm going for it fail take a point to bear or off bear he's got a kid that's right we could put some stuff in front of the door is there any stuff around the room we could wait what did you say boss want me to make a trunk all right i'm going to bum-rush him it doesn't matter i succeeded on the first one (roars) oh gross i'm going to drag it inside and look for a place to stow it i'm going to grab him with my teeth and try to shove him under the stairs we just met this guy an hour ago who will also be portrayed by matthew mercer in the flashback sure it's on a loop how do we get down there or wherever we've got to go i'm sorry it was the one on the left which is the first one that he went to the empty one i'm muscle but i'm not aerodynamic i climb up bamboo i don't-- (screams) ugh i landed on my nuts i've got my stick what do you want me to do i've got it what do we do with this body someone's going to see it there's honey everywhere in this town grog strongjaw i think i can-- excuse me this is clearly a panda bear he's a skinnier version of me he's black and white and i will go talk to him in panda and i will sort this all out he's furry he's got a little fur he's black and white he's my people why does no one value my opinions here i feel like i'm offering good ideas-- i feel like i'm thinking outside the box here and no one's taking me seriously with what with your claws i've got an idea that dowel rod looks like bamboo i'm going to eat it he's got armpit honey to wake him up no you need a nosebleed i hit him in the nose more blood hey you teleported that turd to the floor on the way past i'm going to look and see if grog has anything else on him that we can see or take or use i'll see if i can take them super fail brian and i growl at him (roars) yeah i swing back fail success i speak to him in panda pan pan pan-pan pan pan pan pan pan pan da da da pa-pa-pan pan dan panda panda panda i put his sunglasses back on and pat him on the head oh do they have the same essence as the stick or something similar all right i'll take them and put them on try them on once (giggles) nice i'm going to try them on once what do i see what i put on these human glasses and i can see through walls i was not dry-humping him dry-hump him no humans can't see movement wait humans can't see movement but dwarves can i guess wait a second you're going to take all this honey and give it away what kind of cut are you talking about here 50-50 40-40 30-30 i'm not the brains of the operation (laughter) it's always bear-20 somewhere (snickering) i don't really care about the honey one way or the other honestly i'm fine just eating bamboo but i do feel like we put in the effort this is our heist it's not hers if she wants to get cut in we could give her maybe a thousand percent i don't know numbers but a small amount as a vegan i'm going to protest that we not harm any living creatures that's okay that is not harm but heavens forbid we actually kill a human being on this adventure can you flash us back to that incident why would you kill an innocent person i can't believe you you're heartless they're not watching us anymore i can grow a tree can't you hack this wow who's vax no he said vax i think he wants us to tell vax-- as we walk i'm going to whisper to-- what's his name liam and hey cookie i'm getting a bad feeling about this tova chick think she's going to double-cross us all right what's the signal i need signals steveland cleamer nice and cleaned any honey wait are we sure we want to share this with her what is this do we need these you guys have to share one any guards coming we have unlimited time oh las vegas come on focus come on you damn wolverine get the thing oh yeah it's the fishing rod that's doing it i'm getting so frustrated that i'm going to start freaking out and hitting the doors of course someone's above us i'm going to go for one of the ninjas and attack with my strength panda strength that's a success that's not as he's there i hit him with the tree stick no are you going to pee on the fire this is not going well let's do it i'm going to head for the door and on my way i'm going to grab tova by the hair and pull her back in fail fail dead i'm going to go get trinket and drag no bear left behind i'm going to drag him out lay him down no harm will come today like in the revenant i will aggressively mouth-to-mouth snout-to-snout resuscitation (heavy breathing) trinket if you'd died i would be so upset we'll never forget you i turn to the other dudes and say listen all this trouble for some honey i know a place where bamboo literally grows in forests we can go there and eat as much of it as we want we don't have to break in anywhere there's no surveillance cameras it just grows come with me it'll be fun we can turn over a new leaf tova i'm sorry i tried to kill you i honestly don't know one of the spells that i accidentally got would've turned one of us into secretly two bears hiding in a bear costume and we popped out and became two bears where do they get the battle board from tonight's game with that song
