the waterdeep dragon heist adventure releases on d&d beyond that's 900pm pacific that's in two hours so it'll officially be available for purchase through d&d beyond marketplace don't forget to pick it up in a couple of hours set your alarms we'll probably remind you when 900 comes around but that's not all the number nine is special for other weird reasons this sunday september 9th or 9/9 is the first game of the regular season for travis' favorite team the dallas cowboys they're already ranked top of their conference as much as it pains me to say travis two years ago they won nine straight games last year they won how many regular season games nine yes and this year in training camp the standout defensive player was none other than antwaun woods number 99 to honor this amazing concurrence of the number nine i have done the unthinkable i am wearing a dallas cowboys t-shirt and guys i have to say it feels pretty good it feels pretty outstanding actually it feels a little odd oh god it feels really weird oh god guys i think my heart exploded oh god guys i think i-- (gasping) (gasping) oh guys guys it was the shirt and now i feel better i'm covered in blood it did (laughter) no matt and the point is 900 tonight guys d&d beyond blood i love you travis go dallas mmm that's not good special effects guys she texted me saying is travis going to be upset with me and

critical role there's a quick update to the pablove foundation charity push we hit our first two goals we hit $20000 which means i'll be running a one-shot of crash pandas we hit $50000 which means

the pablove foundation and if we hit that goal sam-- that's me-- will do a special fireside chat complete with robe and fancy wine that $100000 will be able to fully fund the shutterbugs summer
