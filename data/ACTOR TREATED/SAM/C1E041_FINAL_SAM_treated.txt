i got to go get ice phone's ringing sorry you know what i'll send it to voicemail oh didn't we have a tunnel made that goes under the wall to the city by the way hi guys what about the thieves' guild tunnels would anyone go there that bar place with the thing this is the seat of power right but then he could just come and kill us okay how fast is he going to let you go on your own yeah yeah yeah how do we do that we could leave a trail of gold that leads to it goldilocks-style if we go back into the city to try to find council members and we succeed what does that get us a bunch of people who also don't know how to defeat the dragon politically listen jarett is good but i don't want to sacrifice him like that what about trinket oh that's right (stuttering) i am not going to go-- they have mind control powers they have influence they have charisma beyond even mine i'm the size of his toenails something tells me i would end up his gimp all right that's the best plan ever all right i'll do it i'll go and-- that person will surely die (laughter) hang on we're going to go now without resting that's not a real place travis it doesn't exist grog who are you talking to should we go to sleep if only i had taken a dump in the middle of town i could see what's going on right now (laughter) other number (laughter) that could mean he's far away or that he's dead good to know or he's dead take everything it's true where is it we're just going to march into the city the tunnel just goes to the other side of the wall grog good thinking (laughs) nice what is going on ah he's so honorable oh no we should leave him honey badger doesn't care wait wait wait can a red panda climb a rope ladder any better than-- yeah we're right here where's gilmore's again that's up here wow we have to cross the entire city but we could go along the wall all the way along the outside wall take the beltway we add ten 25 wait you see someone where is he going garthok we are vox machina i am the de facto leader my name is scanlan shorthalt garthok are you familiar with tunnels or secret passageways around the city at all are we near any we're near the temple district now but if the entrance to the tunnel was destroyed it's best not to risk it let's keep going are you okay with stealth we're not near the entrance to the tunnel right now they may win they work for a dragon but they're innocent i believe him which one is jason charles miller should we be at all concerned about drawing attention to ourselves no i mean like giant fireballs or anything natural 27 12 pike fell down in some rubble oh what who me but i'm-- oh that hits damn it someone give him a laser pointer okay so the guy next to percy is the dwarf okay i will hand-cone it up and i will cast dominate person on him and i will try to bend him to my will okay good okay i will tell him to walk over to me and start emptying his pockets of anything he's looted straight-up (laughter) no i'll stay there to accept my treasure (laughter) go trinket don't hit pike don't hit pike she's right in the middle what is war god's blessing thank you you're doing a good service dragons can see bolts of lightning all right all right that makes sense what are you going to do what are you going to do what if you miss those are stinky dice this guy's going to be a puddle-- wait does he get two more what oh there's more people all right i guess i'll try to intimidate him to stop and i'll say i'll turn to him and say you there idiot (stutters) you're not going to win you should not fight anymore because you're going to die and that's it that's all i got 22 you know what i'll sing to him to intimidate him would that help sure i will sing (singing) some people call me a gnome cowboy some people call me the gangster of love (singing) some people call me maurice because i'm a hitter i'm a winner i'm a bedroom shitter (laughter) and as my bonus action i tell the dwarf to start collecting all the stuff from all the other people as well gilmore use your dragon perception lady oh you knocking him out can i specifically look for the beaded curtain he emerges from and a barrel of lube they gave it to the dragon him whatever that is no oi dwarf who have you been collecting swag for okay (laughter) he told you this the gates to it are open and the dragon sits there in the open collecting his bounty no that's fine tie him up sherri it's us wait what who he's a friend he fought with us he's not corrupted by the dragon's influence it's really cool his body yes very is there any point to searching for more council members or allies before we go when you saw him did you see anything important yeah did it look like scarring from a previous fight gilmore before we go one more crazy question you're not a dragon are you all right should we teleport or is there tunnels or how do we go oh with garthok or with gilmore you're going to go up there because he told them to last time we took a dragon's gold five of them showed up don't you think the dragon knows everything that's going on right now i'm the spy here it was every time i'm coming too who's three us three then we're all going to the same place can't you tree-shoot us tree-shoot them there which castle the keep 28 garthok's dilemma is a great book (laughter) can you tell us where the entrance is do we know where the entrance is pike you can come with us you can come with us enough treasure to go around all of us 27 this is it traps vex can you scan for dragons please he got it already talking about dragons the dragons came and got it can we see can i see any signs of dragon claws or dragon slobber or anything so people put a bunch of gold there then someone else came and took it it's your fucking people from the clasp isn't it let's follow the tracks they're fresh well we've come this far i'm very easily swayed (laughter) you're right you're right but if vex could somehow convince us-- (laughter) and they're like 100 yards away i just shrug i think he was talking to you (laughter) it's been a great day killing with you i hope our paths cross again perhaps in the catacombs tell them whenever they see scanlan shorthalt to open the door they stealthed so i don't know where they went do i got a nine on perception can i look at the tracks i can't read tracks three do i even know how to get home from here will you tell me how to get back will you tell me how to get back (laughter) garthok garthok told me he was going back to his clasp entrance our paths will cross again he also said that you were kind of weird yeah are we there now
