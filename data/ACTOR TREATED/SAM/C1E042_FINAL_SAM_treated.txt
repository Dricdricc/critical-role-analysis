i want to be the rat oh yeah i want to give a quick shout-out to my charity of choice the pablove foundation i talked to them today their minds were blown by all the gifts that people have sent in and donations in the name of critical role and the critter community they didn't quite understand what the critter community was but i enlightened them and they're so jazzed by you guys and they appreciate not just the donations and gifts but also they said that the critters have been writing long letters and telling great stories and stuff and they're super excited so keep it going to those charities the pablove foundation the pablove foundation oh yeah kill all the dragons and save the day that's a great great idea why are you rolling before the show where are we and gilmore's with us is clarota still here with us (laughter) we bought new silverware maybe it wasn't my troupe maybe it was our new guests the people fleeing for their lives that guy man-crush i wonder in all prudence should we go around to the 'fugees the refugees and do a quick-- -- scan alignment check or something pike might can you do a mass a mass sense alignment is that a thing oh i'm talking about your magic all right is she with us maybe we should just kill one of them to make an example is this insight what are our options here first of all do we know gilmore's status and when we last left things there was one plan to go into the tunnels of the thieves' guild and try to see if there's any more-- and to what end again we're going to see if there's any random diplomats left over for death what did you do was it because you farted that time yes what are our other options we know why the dragons are here right ish huh i've been thinking about that long and hard yes most of what i do is long and hard and my thoughts are still fuck you no way fuck off maybe (laughter) maybe the triceratops could kill all the dragons how's your homeland do we need to find out you can transport there instantly true how do you kill a dragon do we need a dragon can we get a dragon that hates these dragons is that a thing yeah could we find a dragon who could fight for us do we know any metallic dragons so wait the slayer's take what it's safe yes but they're protected not phone calls just a look okay well let's scry it up then who are we calling whitestone vasselheim center of emon you're pretty smart grog oh pike oh thanks pike pikey i reach out and brush the dirt from above her forehead can you scry we do or a walkie-talkie he's saying syngorn is gone oh no he didn't even get a new franchise before it was-- gilmore's building supplies (laughter) what did you see keyleth lay did it look like it was destroyed to nothing or transported somewhere could it have been-- i don't know how your scrying works-- could it have been some sort of a magical block not real an illusion of some sort to where but there's hundreds more inside the city walls thousands you're going to steal a plane what does who are we going to check in with the clasp i really like percy's idea about stealing a plane i'm just throwing that out there we could take all of these refugees with us don't you understand we would be helping humanity not if we hide it with some-- some smokescreen action of some sort all right let's go talk to the clasp we'll ask them what they think about-- we probably can only take a few it should be women and children bundle up we'll give you some wool blankets for the trip no nothing she didn't say anything hey we're going to be doing this every day for several days this is just how schindler did it by the way he debated it for a while and then-- (nervous laughter) wait there's a rope leave them here in case the parents come what are you talking about can i inspire keyleth for this okay i will perform a limerick for her to inspire her i know an airheaded young druid / whose plans are more gassy than fluid / when the battle starts / she turns her pals into farts / they see danger and pass right through it you've got inspiration if you need it well i hope percy comes back soon (whispers) steal an airplane i'm telling the what seven remaining refugees sorry you didn't make it through it doesn't mean that you'll be here forever we'll get you there tomorrow no big don't worry about it that's great did you see your sister what is it i love it

(whispers) spireling shenn nine you said (whispers) i would too no go for it and to the slayer's take-- that's what they're called right yes there could be a formidable force that could come to protect the city or drive out the dragons indeed they are a mighty force i know i'm getting a bit ahead of ourselves but once the dragons are gone and the city's returned to normalcy what is your ultimate goal to hold power or to remain in the underbelly we may very well be the person that comes to power in this city we have to have something to sweeten the pot what are you offering money we can't promise that the dragon could very easily kill us yes we do we know some high-ranking clerics we know the slayer's take we met a bunch of people up there if we come back and learn that you have made a deal with the dragons you'll be the first to die not them all right then let's do this keyleth shake the man's hand you've got nice soft hands would you like me to sing to give you some extra strength for that arm we're going to leave the city abandoned with no one to protect it i look at garthok and say even you don't do it grog i say party on garthok and then we leave well that was a bust or very well that's not a thing shall we go back to our keep 19 good job percy before we go to the keep do you want to swing by the place the place with the airships just to go there and look all right all right all right back to the keep then i guess when we get there can we check in on gilmore and the queen you sure you don't need it all right keep up those rhymes not bad for a first timer (laughter) you know vex i don't want to be alone right now (laughter) how do we get there wait we have to get rid of all the 'fugees yes ooh la la la we're abandoning the keep when we come back our keep will be gone but my room is just the way i want it all right if we're going to leave the keep i'll need a moment in my room you look like you're glowing this morning i've never seen you quite so chipper all right don't you need your tools before we go out there i go to my room i take a dump on my bed-- no it's not a potion just a straight-up poo i hang a note on the gate of the keep i don't
