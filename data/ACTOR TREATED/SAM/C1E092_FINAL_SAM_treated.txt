advertising mechanoid 5000 and i am from the future sent from the planet lootcrateopia to ensure you simple humans choose the correct time path after the water war of 2018 the oilpocalypse of 2019 and the oprah winfrey rebellion of 2020 your world was plunged into a hellscape that lasted 2000 years (sam voice) there's more (robot voice) until the just and tolerant overlords of fortune 500 company loot crate in their altruistic wisdom united the factions and brought peace to all by sending every human a loot crate the gesture worked and all other fortune 500 companies apple kroger the evil warmongers of johnson & johnson-- (laughter) oh what did i miss something wow new character get you're in the shot you're in the shot (laughter) she'll talk her way out of it like she always does

'em go you can fly ooh nice some sound reasoning do we have to go anywhere are we late to any appointments that is amazing whoa whoa what are you right now how do you spell that doty take that down erinyes wow you know in my readings of this place the hells-- of any hell really (laughs)-- they typically are at least in literature reflected as horrible places where lots of bad things happen wherever you go so having a deal presented in front of us that is not horrible is i think a pretty winning deal i mean i feel like we're already ahead of the game if we are not being actively murdered during the course of events i do my own reading thank you well then i guess we're in accord (laughs) of course whip it out might be useful let's have a look i'll cast identify on it 19 asmodeus i was going to say that as well i feel like we're sympatico on this i should probably assist we got two natural ones yeah i think it's a uh a contact lens scry yeah we don't have that oh why don't we keep it handy no pun intended and we'll just flash it if we get in trouble and see if that helps us it's a ring i said handy well are we taking this deal or are we not everything down here is a piece of shit i like it what will you do with it yes all right if i might remind you for 50 minutes now at this point now right so then we're all dead i've already done that we're all tieflings because of me you're-- abnormal but if this gentleman if i may call him a gentleman can escort us to the right cell block or whatever that might be very very handy i don't want to spend any more time in hell than we have to and as much as i usually hate employees revolting against their employer i feel like we've got a bird in the hand so to speak and we should strike while the iron is hot if i can use many many cliches all at once we're about to say yes to the dress and go and follow this plan i think (whispers) i don't want to walk around this place well why didn't you chime in before (laughter) i agree i say we take this deal kill that employer and go to prison oh my god-- well i just want to get the fuck out of here and go back home so i can enjoy some wine what you swing back well doty hasn't voted yet maybe they should arm wrestle for it doty arm wrestle that bear (snorts) give her 35 minutes she needs a bucket of vaseline a feather preferably from a dove and 35-40 minutes (whispers) where's my doty stats-- ten (laughter) i must wage a complaint that was not a regulation arm-wrestling match they did not have elbows down-- it's not my fault that you didn't design your robot-bear to have arm joints i haven't seen any evidence of that please don't i rust in many places i don't (laughter) (whispers) speaking in tongues may i no let's mime it (grunts) coming oh my god it's so long super long just give me page two he already signed no it's so long matt we can-- well you read too much out loud we will read it out loud taliesin take it away second pact (robot voice) the scribe ipkesh agrees to-- (laughs) (normal voice) okay the scribe ipkesh agrees to immediately conjure forth a cadre of devils in service to the recipient-- that's us -- whom shall remain under the command of and dedicated to the protection of the recipient for the duration of one month we get a cadre of devils the cadre shall include four hamantula and a single osyluth should any devils bound within this agreed-upon cadre be slain outside of baator they are absolved of future service to the recipient the recipient our name here agrees to introduction and installation of at least two chosen of dispater who have been selected by the scribe within a place of divine worship of the scribe's choice the recipient must not interfere with this installation upon completion and any interference will be considered a violation of contract third pact (big inhale) the scribe ipkesh agrees to immediately impart the recipient with knowledge of ancient power beyond their grasp enabling the use of divine powers granted under the grace of lord dispater that can instantly restore themselves or allies to a healthy state-- ooh we get health knowledge -- or rend the lifeforce from their opponents he's giving us magic these powers remain within your possession until death the recipient-- that's us -- agrees to immediately lock the claim and ownership of the everlasting soul of the recipient invoking the laws of the pact primeval under the control and dominance of the scribe for all eternity sending the soul of the recipient immediately upon death to the scribe to do with as they see fit we're selling our soul so second pact is we get a bunch of devils and they get to install two in a place of divine worship to be determined third pact is we get all sorts of devil magic in exchange for our souls so we're probably not going to do those pacts-- (laughs) we have to take two devils and put them in a place of holy worship somewhere in the world if we have some time i could summon my father's army of lawyers-- no (laughs) it would take them quite some time to arrive but they've negotiated tougher deals than this i think they originated here but then they moved to where i'm from for the tax laws (whispers) how do we know when it's evening here oh sorry (very loudly) how do we know when it's evening here they need a tourism board (laughter) i don't know we just
