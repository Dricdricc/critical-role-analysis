you know like loot crate and stuff doctor strange use 'criticalrole' for 10% off your loot crate guys code 'criticalrole' keyleth may i speak we're all chained hello hi there hi hi there i'm a bit of a gambler i'm known around the worlds as being one of the luckiest men with a deck of cards you've ever met i've won games in many of the different planes i see that you collect many treasures that you've won in matches as well is that true yes i have i spend my life just playing games it's my livelihood i've won many things over the years in fact all of these great people large and small next to me i won in various card games around the planes that one over there the big one i won him in a game of gin rummy in the feywild this guy i picked up in a game of fish i'm here to collect possibly one of your items if that's all right with you 32 (laughter) places that information is not relevant right now maybe i'll decide after our match certainly there's a large ruby shield back there is that true he wants that but i think his taste sucks so i'm going to go for that brass piece of armor back there sure i'm a little man and it might help me in a fight someday if i ever lose let me cut the cards honestly the game itself is what's of value to me i am just happy to win and keep my winning streak alive what i get out of it is meaningless but if you'd like to enlighten me on that object-- well i was going to offer one of your choosing but you've only offered me one of your items you seem attached to it i want it i'll have it certainly badly enough to risk these scoundrels we do may i ask what game we're playing blackjack are we playing-- strip poker five-card stud (laughter) we've played this before 21 i suck at everything and now and if we fold do we start over oh well then it's just a number i know my hand wait am i rolling the d4 or no (quietly) not good you guys one five two total of eight oh man this is just straight rolls and what will you give me if i win i love myself a lot a lot more than a bunch of rubies and a handle i'll tell you that much if i'm giving myself to slavery forever i want something a hell of a lot better than that i'm a man who's won 500 straight card games in a row you think these slaves are something you should see what i have at home 32 i'll give you myself as a slave if you do not draw your next card and skip straight to the third and that's your number i get all three oh fucking balls fuck balls (laughter) (whispers) pretty bad before i reveal my cards i have one more proposal (whispers) i don't know what it is (laughter) i'll come clean with you we know exactly what that fucking piece of armor is we want it we're not leaving here without it i'm sorry i'm not going to show you my cards because before i do you'll be dead sorry guys i drew a three and a three and a three yes possibly is it a card game what is your offer just curious can we draw the third hand i just want to feel what it feels like to win once my slave speaks the truth i'm really curious about this last hand if you beat me in this last hand i agree yes well that's the deal thank you that would make me feel so much better about myself i'm really just bad at everything i rolled an 11 best seven out of 13 (laughter) i have agreed i'm already your slave so i couldn't really say no so yes i agree to our accord what favor can i grant you sorry we're not supposed to go to the embassy we were told so by our tour guide yes we accept thank you my master we will go do so right away two days you say yes i release you from your slavery what does he look like are you sure you don't want just a game of pinochle instead please call me kenny rogers let's go slaves i'm sorry equals peers let's go have a lovely afternoon gross but okay go ahead 20 if it's a day or two we could go back to daxio and check and come back but then we'd have to get back into the city that's probably a terrible idea no guarantee that we'd be back in so we should stay i agree well we have water in his fucking jug you really want to try to break into this fire giant's house or traps you want to do a smash and grab could be there tomorrow we know what it looks like cabin boy thank you we could take one dude the mansion door i think is only ten feet tall 20 and then what do we do in the mansion something tells me that people fight in this city a lot i could certainly make an appearance of yenk you mean dominate him i can try so he's going to the auction to slave shop seems crazy that a gigantic fucking pit boss whatever he is would be like oh sure i'll step into this creepy door weird stranger yeah for sure everything about me is creepy guys this seems like a plan c to me convincing a giant killing machine to step into a nice house seems like it's a desperate plan of people without anything at all the deal is we just attack him and kill him what's the big deal we were sent on a killing mission here wherever we see him let's talk to sonny here creepy sonny so we can definitely entice them you guys can pose as slaves and show him some amazing feats and say there's more where that came from inside the mansion but if he says no then what's our plan i can make us all look different what would make us passable in the city i can make us all robes and stuff sure sure i can shrink or grow us by a foot change our general appearance and clothing i'm sorry what's going on we're all looking like you i'm selling a group of identical sextuplet slaves and the advantage is just that they look cool check out my slaves they all look alike i could make you all other ways unique i love this idea don't get me wrong but i feel like convincing him that you are able-bodied slaves with magical abilities might be even more of icing on the cake than hey they look alike that's the guards we could also try to convince them that he's broken a law or done something horrible i could make the image of our mark standing out there in the middle of the arches cursing the sultan's name and pissing all over the place and then what are we still sextuplets in this scenario i can make you a foot taller or smaller that is unique okay so far let's recap recap vote and move on so wait i'm going to recap these plans here plan a making us all sextuplets and trying to get him into the mansion plan b we're all sextuplets-- so plan a again sextuplets slaves mansion plan b we're still sextuplets but this time we're somehow framing him for dishonoring the sultan and then attacking him in the middle of the square plan c still sextuplets that doesn't change but now we're just ambushing him in the center of the arches and we've paid off the guards to turn a blind eye we have tons of money i mean we could bribe them with six identical slaves so what's it going to be plan a the mansion that's certainly going to fail plan b the framing job or plan c the bribery slash ambush all right great of course i've got more yeah what would it be a slave auction house a circus side-show thing caligula's living room i can do i mean sure i can do some of these things within reason right once the mansion is built does it stay built it rebuilds every time i mean that sounds so great i'm on board let's try this stupid crazy plan so we're going to go to the arches tomorrow disguised as the slaves of what's-her-butt sure so you're slaves i'm a slave-master what do i look like no i've got to look like a slave-master senny what would i look like an imp with jewelry and such give me a thing i'm in i'll make a mansion for the night we'll all take a rest and then go tomorrow go to the arches the golden arches wait first we've got to cast seeming we're going right all right so yes i'll cast seeming on everyone making them various level heights of vex and vax i guess (laughter) and they're slaves right they're slaves tattered clothing all right simple tattered white robes (laughter) you're clean that's right you're the best of the best you would have the best robes right totally right the best finest simple white absolutely and wait am i making him celestial-ish is that a celestial what does a celestial look like do they glow all the time i don't know where you hide them normally they're in you ew are you wolverine no we're walking there right now yeah great and when i cast seeming i also cast it on myself making myself look like an azer yeah i don't know if i can make flames with seeming all right great a sign are we going to pose and start selling how much can you change the-- what do we need to sell people we just need a slab to put them up on to say look here there's this one for sale yeah of course we're going to have you guys outside how else are we going to convince him that there is more good stuff inside or just a stone slab we don't need much let's not break the bank why do we need a fucking gazebo matthew what does everyone else have around them what are the other kiosks are there any should we sit here and wait for a while can you guys all do like the robert palmer video (laughter) sure sure i'll play a little ditty we'll jam to it poor nightcrawler i am going to go over there and buy these two kids for what all right travis and this isn't our fight do one of you want to go over there and say hi slave to slave yeah sure go on i'll walk over with her so it doesn't seem weird that my slave is wandering around i suppose i guess they have an owner (french accent) hello i am slave master francois australia and i am curious about your two angel boys (laughter) (french accent) what can they do
