the guy whose sword it was but the guy closest to me okay doesn't matter i want the guy who hit me it can move 60 feet i got an 18 plus something i don't know oh plus 11 yeah that's huge is this a sword attack or is this bigby's hand's clenched fist attack that's cool okay i love you and thank you so i roll 4d8 cool oh wait wrong one 4d8 17 plus 12 29 oh sorry thank you then it's 17 plus seven oh i get a bonus i will inspire keyleth i guess not that she needs any help she's so fricking powerful but i will inspire keyleth by singing (singing) your minxie brings all the boys to the yard and they're like it's better than yours damn right it's better than yours you can teach them but you'd have to chorge (speaking) i don't know i'm close to a guy who's going to hit me if i move right then i will move dead center on the board i will cutting words that oh i'm going to quote from some old tv show and say you are a monstrous mechanised misguided moron that's it correct taliesin jaffe oh shit i only rolled a three may i assist by holding the bodies with bigby's hand while you pull the heads hey you're inspired wait what so you want me to heat the platinum and then shove into the guy's face what this is bullshit i'm going to stand there hands on hips that's the only time marisha has ever said those words (laughter) hope your mom's watching i will lag behind grog oh what if we show him one of our little beans maybe you have to show him how good a blacksmith you are to earn the privilege i can certainly try this is arcana it's a 21 who forged here before what god well should we show our god shit did we do that yet it smells of coffee 12 what does that do is it an automatic hit or is it something i can do cutting words on well i will cutting words it for my attack no he's going to hit me no matter what who's in the path it will hit but i will do my cutting words okay a d12 i rolled a nine i will quote dr smith again and i will yell at him you are a tiresome tin-plated tintinnabulation me oh jesus this thing's big and scary yeah of course it is i'm not dumb super intimidating so how far is he from me okay not knowing what to do i will (raspberry) i'm looking at my spells i've got nothing i will blast him with a lightning bolt a level three lightning bolt you know what i'll do level four so 9d6 i suppose 22 so it's 34 points of damage jesus i'm within melee range of him so if i move i will get hit yes okay grog you're okay right what i don't know what to do about you i'm sorry i'll inspire you i guess right because you don't need health (laughs) sorry all right i'll inspire him i suppose sorry grog oh sorry i will pick up my flute and i will sing (singing) you like it when my flute goes baby make your booty glow scanlan know you want to show my song song song song song yeah i'm going to stay where i am you can do that loin-grab he's trying to kill the cricket oh yeah of course oh yeah that's right okay that's terrible so i've already rolled a 13 plus a d4 this is not going to go well is it d4 is another one that's 14 what liam and this is not a check this is a save i've only used two oh cutting words counts then i've used four so far and i have two more to go all right bye guys 14 yeah sure sure but with vibrato i guess yeah probably (laughs) i will i guess save my life and dimension door out of there yes please i have no other options oh i'm next to the edge oh well i'll try that first with my movement i guess right oh boy i wasn't expecting to attack this turn i'll do the lightning again because it seemed to have some damage no you know what we've got to block his sword right shit i will bigby's hand and try to grapple his sword yes i don't know if that's going to work at all i guess this is supposed to be against a creature not against an item it's a 19 19 plus three so that's 22 i will use a bonus action to level two healing word myself i will sing (singing) i'm freaked out by the shape of me i'm burned up and nobody can see so you know what i'll do to thee give some health to my body (vocalizing) (laughter) you have inspiration that was with disadvantage matt and damn am i still holding on to his sword that hits i made a 23 the first one was that poop thing again second one i only rolled a seven so i'm sure this is not going to add up to something good what am i adding to this matt okay i'm still not going to hit 22 this is a check though so i could inspire myself maybe okay then it can max out at 20 oh okay well then i will roll my d4 and see if i can hit it i only rolled a three not a four (groaning) who's up i will cast another lightning bolt at level six this time which is 11d6 okay 11d6 yes okay that's only 42 how far am i from the thing i will not move i was never blind but me hitting it doesn't un-blind someone else does it oh shit okay i'll healing word myself again i guess what is it 2d4 plus six well there seems to be some confusion about that question i have it at 62 but the overlay has me at 44 so i don't know that hits i will reduce that with cutting words d12 six what was the damage i don't think you said you rolled a 20-something to hit but i don't think you said damage i'm unconscious but i have some sort of death ward on me this overlay thing's pretty cool can we have a hologram version of that in front of us all the time that we can see i mean thank you i rolled that poop thing again wait do i get advantage no i don't know i could do one if we really need it what's wrong with grog he can't do it should i bigby the other all right i'll have to do it at level seven 21 oh wait is this an ability check i'm exhausted oh do you want me to inspire you or anything do you all need anything i've got a bead do you want me to inspire you travis and all right i will-- i go up to grog and i tell him grog i'm going to tell you some words of wisdom that i learned from a book once a wise man said the man who hast smelted verily didst also dealt it inspiration time yes i do i will sing to him (singing) pour some platinum on thee and get it on an anvil pour some platinum on thee when you need a trammel you'd have to roll a 12 sure yeah i can inspire one more time shall i inspire him sure yeah i'll inspire him again i will give him every inch of myself one by one by one yeah yes you should sure i can inspire him teeny hammer yes sure i'll give you some i will sing to you i will sing (singing) bang bang percy's ball-peen hammer goes down upon the ground bang bang percy's ball-peen hammer makes a really really big sound (vocalizing) i've used five and i think i get six all right i will inspire you with some bullshit yeah but he's got one more shot at this i will sing one more song to inspire you i'll sing (singing) here's a little song i wrote it's filled with inspiration note for note don't fuck up or i'll kill you (laughter) i saved one level eight spell for such a thing
