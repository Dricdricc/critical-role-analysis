byte and bit and i cried how i wish i had backed up my shit but who should appear in a car that he revved a zingity zangity furry red yev the yev jumped through my window he pounced on my mouse and said you must have wished backblaze to your house but i looked at him cross shouting what do you mean my files are corrupt this is one dead machine he just laughed and said you daft binkle blot backblaze works whether you remember or not your pics of your kids and the food that they eated all stored on the cloud nothing's ever deleted your docs firefox alarm clocks and your socks will all be restored from our miracle box the yev yelled don't worry from midnight to morn we save all your stuff your taxes and porn your music and apps are safe on backblaze and with that the yev tipped his hat

spell dc oh that's something 17 points that's something it's going to be great he's dead shaun gilmore oh kiki you're okay can i cutting words to do anything just the damage not his attack will it reduce the damage for everybody if so i will do that it won't be much but i'll do it yes so as he goes i will yell at him oi what sexual position makes the ugliest children i don't know ask your mama (laughter) guys you can reduce that damage by five so instead of 150 it's 145 94 oh shit he has to look 21 wait i thought you said i didn't save wait wait so i get 94 or 47 oh okay that's not bad and matthew dm do our temporary hit points go away first or last we all did 17 from our feast so you prayed at him good job who that who that is that kima on herself okay he's looking better by committee

frigid doom brimscythe and umbrasyl we killed in his room but do you recall the most fucked-up dragon of all thordak the cinder king had a very shiny gem and if you ever saw it run the fuck away from him and for the move i guess i'll attack him i don't do that very well i'll do bigby's hand (sings) bigby's hand at level seven i guess keep it low just go for the ball shot yeah punch just punch 18 actually yes that is my biggest thing so yes wait a second matt doesn't he get a disadvantage on his save because of my cutting words yeah that's what i meant making sure you guys know how spells work jesus sam 3 why didn't you tell me that you have an inspiration oh shit that doesn't sound good is she lying she's a deceitful one we have the best friends we hear zahra in the distance i'm still alive after failing three do you get an attack grog wow that's a hit that's great that's extra that's just bonus at disadvantage he might have five of those oh shit lair action everyone with knees

cutting words that so i yell at him you're so ugly you scared the shit out of an outhouse make that a 33 does not 21 21 hey that's many points oh god what was that he's straight-up crazy when i was younger i had an imaginary friend too no well he gets full healing oh shit you can do that that's all the attacks what about the dragon sword did you do that not yet there's no way it's not going to happen i mean everybody i'm up for my attack i will punch the fire elemental currently menacing kiki with my fist of fury okay 24 8d8 i need all the d8s four i need one more that's a d12 (laughs) oh man these are all good though i do oh my god okay 16 17 18 19 20 30 41 he's not dead as my bonus action i'll punch him again that was my action as a bonus action i can do something else with bigby no every subsequent action i can do something as a bonus action does that also negate the action so i can't do it as my action so that was my bonus action then so i can do something else then no no no i'll do something else oh by the way i can't use my movement to drink a potion right okay (laughs) can i lean over the wall there and i'll lightning bolt the same guy all right so taliesin and four ones in a row so far so-- (laughter) yeah absolutely oh shit so you only hit grog little house on the prairie with the dragon on it oh god no problem (whispered) big problem matt has been waiting a year for this does that affect the fire elemental too i don't sam five has his theories though oh that's great focus on the dragon focus on the dragon you have resistance to poison clouds remember success half damage hey you caused damage that's great can we say that she walked 30 feet closer to-- you could have cast it on the-- does my hand need to make a save as well he does have it oh no oh god nosam  no taliesin taliesin and the hand the hand rolled a nine oh god oh shit i got him i'm going to not let him die (pouring drink) (contented sigh) roll high roll strong it's got a weak spot weak spot in game or right here you've done your thing everybody's injured around her oh i'll through the earring say grog you want to go for a ride or no okay action i will arc around and lightning bolt the dragon real quick with the hand cone i don't know if that makes any difference no it doesn't it might yeah great so what i still roll damage and he takes half okay that's fine 23 so 12 11 something like that great we're doing great guys nobody's dead yet and as the bonus action-- the hand who is still alive he took 102 points of damage but is still alive yes because he has my hit points so he'll go over and lift up grog by the scruff of his neck and go as high and mighty as he can he can move like 120 feet i think what 120 wait well knowing that i'll just punch the dragon nope i mean you don't know yeah 23 it does hit 6d8 no it's usually 4d8 i think so it's 4d8 so now it's 6d8 oh shit no 8d8 pike happened oh my god ashley is the mvp tonight (laughter) yeah hey i just dealt 47 points of damage that's respectable (approving murmurs) (whispering) laura that will inspire you constructing a pole vault what does that do what you have a thing did you roll your cabal's ruin thing have you taken any damage is this one of the fire giants we've seen we have exactly one ally dragon in this fight right now we do she's great aw he's still crazy what's that other thing that
