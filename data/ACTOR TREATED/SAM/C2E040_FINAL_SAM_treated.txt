oh miss hit miss (singing) balls and ass ass ass and balls who had i shot before can i do something unconventional here matt and undo my last shot so give him back 11 points of damage because i'm holding a keg of gunpowder and there's no way i can reload a crossbow while holding a keg of gunpowder all right all right all right to the one who's on me all up in my grill i'm going to touch them and cast shocking grasp which is a-- melee spell attack so i roll at disadvantage nine plus six 15 okay great i've never done this before let's see here i'm at 5th level so it's 2d8 what's a d8 hey eight points of damage a what does that work oh boy i hate water i'm going to swim away as fast as i can i still have to disengage right i will bonus action disengage and swim around past fjord yeah

are a tiny man check his body for gold snake temple key it says it right here on the equipment list jester has it oh boy man i really don't like this water oh boy all right i will doggy paddle towards the snake-hand man and hit him with another zap okay my turn do i need to first make a constitution save at the end of my turn okay i'll swim up and poke the thing with my shortsword oh boy okay what does this thing do 15 oh i do oh wow okay that's 21 points of damage because it can't see me i'll go up and-- i don't use shortsword a lot so i'll let it float for a second and grab it from behind and then rake it across the back of its neck i'm going to go towards the door as much as i can not great 12 that's my favorite condition is not drowning yet (jester voice) she's going to cast mending (laughter) seven plus-- nine no seven plus two equals nine she rolled a nine next turn you'll be dead this will be no problem right are you upside down right now oh yes i will grab jester's horns and pull and go up as fast as i can bonus action dash sure yeah so it works money shot i cast feather fall on everyone else (cheering) i throw a wet feather (laughter) we're about to hit the top of the temple or all the sides of it no you're unconscious as we're in the air i'm going to take the shield that i stole off my back and slide it under caduceus' butt like a-- (laughter) it doesn't matter you're out natural 20 18 plus like a skydiving team the water's still coming right oh my god the island is sinking it's a turtle's back it's the cajun turtle i feel like i'm behind you because i've got water walking on so i'm like-- 23 and jester rolled a 23 jester's been trying to make her way towards him if possible towards him i don't know if she can get there she rolled a 23 i mean she rolled a 19 plus four she does she's trying to touch you so she can cast cure wounds on you (as jester) i'm going to cast cure wounds on little man (as jester) you're always little to me you're right one point plus four is five is the water going the way we want to go we need caleb up front too to guide us everyone has to have an offer i have one thing but-- we don't have eyes on the yuan-ti do we i would wait until they get closer before i do my thing maybe jester can-- well i don't either but if they do i'd be ready for something well sure so i'll just yell to beau beau repeat after me fluffernutter i'm going to throw the keg of gunpowder behind us wait is it on fire it has to be on fire general strength that was my nickname in high school 15 then if i can i would push it with a little mage hand with a little extra top spin on it so blow it up we'll make a wall of fire but the barrel you said was mostly intact yeah but what about inside barrels are waterproof you keep beer in them i just turn beau around like (shouting) that was amazing how did you do that with a throwing star this thing won't stop ten jester rolled an eight okay conditions we're still doing this we hear a hunting party we see a hunting party and set them off at the same-- sure sure yes let's do it you know jester hasn't done anything yet she still has a thaumaturgy she could do you can cause harmless tremors in the ground but it doesn't say where oh within 30 feet yeah that's no good yeah they don't never mind she uses it to alter the appearance of her eyes for one minute (laughter) i'm going to put up the cloak and just sneak we hear them in a direction that we can identify okay i'll just say stay here and i'm going to put up the hood and i'm going to dodge off in that direction stealthily do i have to roll for stealth i assume okay so that's 22 i'm going to cast mage hand they're holding nets and what else okay jesus i got nothing man i'm just going to try to mage hand and trip the guy in the back with his own net just pull it down a little arcana check okay arcana check is a 20 sure didn't know what else to do but okay okay i guess that's all i'll do i don't know what else to do i-- you know what i'm going to-- fuck it i'm going to cast message and tell caleb go i'm going to go hey fucktards over here and i'm going to just draw their attention i'm going to bolt double dash fast as i can go away not back towards my friends but like-- perpendicular nope drink run drink and run i saw you guys through the woods but they're behind me yeah (whisper) oh my god one point of exhaustion jester succeeded i rolled a 14 damn (panting) (panting) i'm exhausted they're right behind me oh yes start the motor start the motor oh my god you're the one who-- it's your thing magical prime time do we really only have mutterfingers-- --blob boffers and words i want meese's meanutmutter mubs (laughter) i don't even know what that means can i pause you for one second matt did you all fucking take off your costumes no that i saw (laughter) yeah yeah do i sticky butt peel off peel off sorry matt in a graveyard go to our quarters i guess okay that's good (gnawing) what was avantika's she controlled the water she's the one who made the flood oh when we took off i was curled up in the bottom of the well of the rowboat cowering so i didn't see any of that she got something for giving up her-- we also heard a large cracking sound as if a lock had been broken or a wall had been broken are we pirates now is that the thing because i don't like the water at all i don't want to be on a boat anymore if i might fjord i don't know much about how this magic works but if there's three of these things right at least three of these eyes that need to be placed to unlock three temples of whatever and release the crazy thing under the ocean one has been activated one is inside you there's one-- maybe we should try to find that one with that one we could then safely get the one out of you because we would have the third one and we could go break it somewhere and then we'd know that no one could unlock it ever what if we surprise her tie her up then jester can do her zone of truth thing we can find out everything she knows slit her throat and sink her ship what if we just leave her she could go off and do god knows what he can stay with her we can stop it before she does it she's just touching her lips wait take this vial of acid just in case i don't know maybe she'll try something and you just splash it in her face i don't know i don't know sure whatever nope just acid i did no not until he comes back from his rendezvous i don't like it at all it's terrible this was the worst day of my life i mean as far as i can remember this was a really bad day and water had a lot to do with it (laughter) sure oh i don't care about being underwater i just don't like looking at it contested (no audio) just splash acid all over it (laughter) (whispering) yes yes yes oh man i'm getting some twitchwood right now (laughter) the sound of fish slapping against each other (laughter) do we recover our exhaustion i should probably roll for laura what do you think you think she'll appreciate that nice one eight so i reroll a one i feel like i should reroll this again (sighing) it just feels cheap because i rolled a one first
