investigation check excellent assessment tiberius a shorter way of saying the same thing it happens it's natural poo poo cloud well we'll need to form a perimeter and someone will have to stand guard-- oh we gotta interrogate it how close to death's door is she chat room chat room bought us a pizza all right all right this creature is very injured i think we need to heal her just enough-- just enough why don't you make that bargain then-- you can't understand her only she can no is that a thing is that a person what is k'varn (gasps) can i tell if she's lying is it-- insight check oop no (laughs) ugh that was very fast we need to-- let's rest let's set up a perimeter and take turns standing guard i'm going to go to the next cavern over to where we killed those umber hulks take one of the umber hulk heads and put it on a stick right out front of where we're-- of where we're camping as sort of a warning to others what are you casting what are you about to cast oh great well before you do that hold on let's look at it (laughs) can i take a look at it and-- history or-- or arcane arcana no (laughs) ooh nothing it sends out magic missiles basically it shoots out six missiles and then it-- yes as a warning to others yes where was that symbol i'll come with tiberius as well okay not sure if he's still breathing it's a good thing well that must be why lady kima came down here grog's probably farting again all right let's quietly wake them and i will go peer into the darkness and see if i can see them is the rumbling continuous or is it just one little rumble oh okay oh easy like the flower the flower trick something terrible is brewing how is everyone feeling do we need to heal everyone no what about us how are we feeling are we okay are you gonna cast a spell now okay i'd like to give her a little inspirational song okay some like yoga music (sings) you know you got to cure grog i do have my idol of pike yes oh of course i take out the idol of pike that i keep always close to my loins and i hold it tightly and warmly-- -- and caress it a little you know i know grog very well and he might enjoy or be inspired by a kiss of a female i'm just saying just the gentle kiss of a female lips on his might rouse him i've seen it many times vex get in there get in there (all laugh) d20 let's do this man for the chat room (laughs) you're alive i don't even know what that means question or the answer hey how is he doing how is he feeling grog how are you feeling how is he feeling right where it should be how many fingers is this perfect it's true it

fellows traipsing we traipse up what's going on guys as long as they are sucking it out of goblins i'm good with that how long do they last no one's going to take down our intelligence we're too

ones no no if we follow them on the bridge won't they feel it bouncing we can't see the end of it just you you're gonna go on the carpet alone what if something happens i'm coming with you shotgun let's go above them not great 13 way down below we don't want to fall the view up here is beautiful is the range how are-- we'll update you soon they'll probably see us tunnel okay listen leave me behind i'll follow the party with the hostages i'll see where they go don't worry i'll be invisible go back tell our fellows get them across the bridge and we'll meet here in about an hour what i'm super brave and hung come on let's do this (all laugh) i turn invisible and i'm gonna just hang behind the party that's got the hostage dwarves and just kinda see where they go don't have to activate it's passive yeah but i might make-- i might snap twigs ding-a-ling-a-ling got it 16 18 ooh they're slave trolls white eyes okay gah 19 do i speak their language nope then no thank you (laughs) the captives okay (apprehensive sound) whoa i'm wearing my ring of mind-shielding by the way poor son of a bitch worst show ever okay that was one of the captives do i see where the other captives were taken okay i assume bad things are happening in there i don't need to see it right i think i'll just kind of-- is there anything-- no oh no do i what do i speak where does it say shit i play a shawm no i just speak common and gnome okay i think i'll go back to my fellows there's nothing i can see-- that door doesn't lock-- does it lock by any chance open tent there's nothing lying around none of that black armor lying around or anything any extra things -- okay i think i will just make back for my friends then with advantage 21 survival check so plus zero 17 it's like venice whoa i am going to tell you everything that just happened in detail in real time (all laugh) and that's when i came back to see you guys (all laugh) thank you what is that he was tall i mean everyone looks 20 feet tall to me i'm a gnome he was bigger than you by a little he carried himself big he was lanky several no sign of lady kima at all just a bunch of dwarves being held against their will and then one by one being brain sucked by mr lanky man two big trolls and ogres don't forget ogres there's ogres too yes there were two big ogres as well and duergar aplenty-- maybe four dozen or so three dozen wandering yes there's a volcano oh the lava down below do they know the address here that's kinda creepy thanks chat room an illithid and have them all jump over the edge of the cliff the one lengthy creature was levitating well yes but i think what grog is talking about is the bulk of the fighting force getting them to follow us over the bridge and then cutting the bridge that's a good idea do you want the rope no we want to drop the bridge and have them fall to their deaths yes well they would run willy-nilly well remember there's a tunnel on the other side of camp they could run that way as well 20 feet you can get a lot of them on that bridge and then cut it i like that idea it's up to the deck or it's up to you so what if it's a scary thing that scares them away that might not be a thing anymore why do we need to float grog oh wait wait wait are we-- let's also recap which plan we're going with one of us creating a diversion and running away or these mystical magical-- -- weird dragon creatures what if they scare them the other way what if-- also might i remind-- we're luring them and also might i remind you all that they're being mind controlled by this what illithid-- and if the illithid recognizes that your-- -- your things are false then he's not going to send his men-- -- off to chase them however if we were-- hm what to sneak through the village to the tunnel no not all seven of us and a bear are you crazy (all laugh) wait are we doing his bait or are we doing a real bait it's fake it's just a hologram oh snap other terrain or an animal can you make the chasm look like it's solid ground can she do this yes is gonna see through that wait wait might i interject i'm so sorry you guys-- you and you will be hauling ass away from the charging horde-- on our side so when you get all the way to the other side of the bridge then we're gonna chop which side are we gonna chop it on our side or their side okay rope i'm also going to sing a little song-- -- for both of them-- -- to inspire them oh yes i'll sing an inspiration song for both of them (sings) hey baby hey baby hey (sings) dwarves say dwarves say (all laugh) oh i'm sorry these two-- grog and vax oh are you going too i'm sorry tiberius and vax then we're gonna stay on the side that doesn't have all the bad guys on it you got your dice use your dice cut the rope cut the rope leave vax there let's go (all laugh) oh yes that's even better -- fake ground the troll this was a great plan (gasps) oh shit (whispers) you fly oh shit plus eight that was our ticket across the chasm you can see them and they control you material it's the carpet yeah that makes sense okay watch out for that warm air whatever that was it's water i thought there was lava-- so there it's a river-- place to go explore well we could go to the camp and go kick some-- but we have a carpet now the three of us can fly i'm all for going-- there's a tunnel back there-- -- back past that village that they're protecting lava tunnels what are you crazy sorry yes (yells) so here's my thoughts yeah so i don't wanna go down there-- -- there's things pulling trolls yeah let's not go down there where there's things eating trolls why don't we just-- yeah why why do we have to go down there there's nothing that we need down there there's seven of us and one of us is grog deep into the tunnels we can try-- but what is down there but there's no sign of anything intelligent down there other than something that's eating trolls underwater it could be just giant whales down there we have no idea there's no sign of humans at all it's lava and death animals how're you gonna go in the tunnels there's lava if you burn-- tracks in a river it's not that kind of a tunnel there's water flowing in it can't go in there oh so there's a cavern opening can't go in there there's water pouring out of it but what would we find in a tunnel with water pouring out of it it's not like anything lives up there all right all in favor of going to the duergar village and facing the giant fucker or up and over or at least getting past it that direction that's four of us all in favor of going into the lava flows to find something mm mm are you a communist (all laugh) wait you're stealing our flying carpet (all laugh) meanwhile back up top i'm saying they're not gonna find anything they're not gonna find any tunnels (all laugh) (laughs) they're not gonna find anything can he fit on the carpet that is the thing i saw in the village he's a friend help-- ally ally if we find this creature we might be able to free your hive as well 13 you're a people person what's his name can we just call him clarence (all laugh) and as a symbol of our dedication to you i'd love to play you just a little bit of a song that might heal some of those wounds and scrapes that you seem to have all over your body it's a pretty good song hm ooh 17 (all laugh) (sings) when i get that feeling i want clarota healing clarota healing is something that's good for you ooh ooh ooh (sings embellished melisma) a performance check 18 there's many more where that came from yes end scene
