travis you have something-- yes right right there yeah right there there's a little something yup have you ever done an episode about groo the wanderer if you do an episode on groo that's the one i'll watch no no no i'll watch it though yeah yeah i'm not going to go on your show i could bring my comic collection on your show and show it off yeah man yeah i've got some good books man oh yeah we all made alliances we all made alliances laura (laughter) that could come in handy oh that's happening guys you're going to forget i existed first roll of the night one it's me vax (laughter) which are 30 feet tall 20 feet tall i'm feeling lucky that's terrible that's one luck down you need a tie breaker oh sorry nine doty yes i'm on that tower she's on the other tower what is that a rule i'm hiding the glasses are clutch (screaming) he sleeps in war paint why would he sleep in war paint oh man it's like a cicada (laughter) everyone else has gone i have a lot to do number one how much does doty weigh fuck that changes things still anything over 400 bones my strategy so it's okay we're okay plan number two okay i say doty i need you to carry me away from all the bad people remember how we played keep-away as children we're playing that now keep me away from everybody yes i cast sanctuary on doty i think i can do that yeah okay and then for my action i will throw down the bead of force on myself and enclose myself in the bubble i take 5d4 damage uh-huh not for a minute i got ten rounds y'all see ya yes it says no magic can pass within or without the space it doesn't say that i can't do magic in the sphere it just says it can't leave the sphere breathable air not poison air i'll roll six seven eight nine points of damage sure grog's head lot of ones (laughing) it's all threes and fours there's like six cameras in front of us oh sure he's holding me in a ball you'll have to succeed a wisdom saving throw first you can still make the attack you just have to point it at someone else well it'll throw me away i mean that's it dc 17 14 (goofy-style screaming) floating is it like at ren faire i'm in one of those balls still alive he's fine i might be alive for a long time after you're all dead the inside of the ball is all puke smeared everywhere oh i rolled a 16 plus dexterity of zero so 16 sure sure end of round one okay action prep my healing draught just pour it into a bottle and get it ready to rock bonus click my boots of speed movement (rapid vibration sound effect) with my boots of speed on and the feat that i took i've got 80 feet of movement shh it's shooting water everywhere it's spraying it on keyleth but i'm also in water and i don't know if it has any friction or anything hey i moved i can't communicate with him i don't think i don't think sound can escape so he's going to keep doing what i told him to do get to me and keep me away from other people it lasts a minute it doesn't say if he gets hit it ends okay but if he attacks he'll lose it i'm going to tell him to do that get to me and get me away from other people this is a suicide mission for doty guys this is not going to end well for him no it's okay because hers was an area of effect get to me and push me away explosions oh no eight only you can prevent-- there's water right there pretty good this is plus his dex which is nothing 18 we have our first victim no does the fire ignite his cannon hand it's like she was never there this crazy fireball came out lit a bear on fire and went back in the room as my action i tear off my patch of healing potions now i have four healing potions (laughter) don't believe them grog they'll turn on you can i take one of them i will take one yeah oh that's cocked ooh ten points i am whole again great oh yeah i mean sure when trinket pushed me do i have momentum that way okay so i'll turn around and i'll go that way yeah that's it it's like prison you could do some push-ups you don't know or he's dead that's not bad in acid you're having a weird six seconds of your life right now but it looks cool oh hi i'm going to read my scroll of fire shield setting it to a warm shield that will protect me from all cold damage and last for ten minutes oh but when i get out fire shield correct that's what i want because i'm already resistant to fire damage and then i'll roll my ball i'm just going towards that corner no top right and i'll also pull out my rod and i'll say crossbow and i'll load it with a bolt if that was the real percy he likes to hit things 51 that was 76 points of damage he's fine you're all alone oh so he'll just be dead you're good at jumping over bodies of water me yep i'm going to-- crossbow in one hand i'm going to take my broom and stick it between my legs ready to go i don't know matt and then i will continue my movement where am i am i that thing in the corner i'm going to go around the wall so nobody can see me right next to the fireball of death yeah i'll stay there and then i'll try something it's not going to work i don't think it'll work secretly i'm going to take a patch off my robe a window patch and see if i can make a window to climb through the sphere (laughter) no i'm trapped in here trapped for a minute they'll let me out when they're ready i don't think it's going to work i'm going to hover out a little i'm not going to leave yet i'm staying in the safety of the sphere for at least one more round ready to go i'm still in the sphere yeah i realize that does it do anything to him most of your war paint is gone by the way travis oh no is there an entrance to the tower there cat on a hot tin roof the love of your life bathtub buddy maybe not this is the fifth round invisibility and i want to fly out of the sphere and to a vantage point of your choosing so no one knows where i am somewhere between 20 and 40 feet high maybe towards the center-ish of the game field up to you where yes no i don't want to know where i am so you don't know where i am and matt away from the things that blow up was that understood 27 i honestly have no idea no i said you pick me a place i don't want to know hi i lose invisibility if i cast a spell or attack something does drinking something count as casting a spell i will drink a swift-step draught increasing my walking speed now to 60 plus my boots of speed which makes it 120 i'm the fastest motherfucker on the planet no i know just for future rounds would dropping a smoke stick count as an attack it doesn't hurt anyone it just makes some smoke what about dropping a tanglefoot bag okay i just want to know my options here all right cool i think that's it the speed thing and oh can you just tell me without telling me where i am do i know the location of keyleth okay and do i know the location of everybody okay all right just move me around you can still touch the building you're too big for the ceiling did you drink the potion that you found what was it oh cool what just fell all over the floor well you did everything i assume because you know me matt and you're a skilled strategery man that i am somewhere near doty i'll hover near him over him-- but not right over him everybody and just chuck that smoke stick right on him it's only a ten-foot radius that's it i don't know actually i'm in the air somewhere within a 30-foot circle of doty he's not wasting any actions to put himself out oh shit does he see an empty ball sitting there oh the kill everyone spell oh god no we got this we got this i don't exist oh i thought he was immune but he's not doty's done land in the smoke see that doty is history fire prismatic spray at the dragon oh that's not high for me no that's terrible for me oh i'm going to use luck i'm going to use luck one and a two so when i'm frightened i just want to get away right i was not planning on it anyway but it's a spell d8 four they're probably pretty dexterous poison poison for the win i don't want to roll 10d6 so i'm going to use one of those websites then i have to do all the math 34 that's not that bad i'm no longer invisible but i am in a protecty cloud i used some movement to land do i have any movement left then i'd like to go i'd like to go around to the back of this wall back here yeah and then i'll cast sanctuary on myself i'm still in my sphere everyone don't come find me so the hammer keeps coming back and he throws it again oh wow he'll go easy on you a bunch of smoke you're trashed tary versus a dragon this is dragon slayer yeah i'll be fine out of curiosity where and in what condition is percival's dead body great not even when i was in the sky okay then i might need to use it can i poke out this corner is it that's a two again where's the door to the thing it's right there on the front right the door to the tower that's away from the dragon i'll use my movement to go there nope i poke around the side of the smoke and a quick little prismatic spray oh shit four again it's the same should we call it the same matt and i don't like to roll this many things 35 going into the tower i have a bunch of movement left right i'll go into the tower 120 ooh there's floors i'm going to go into the second floor that has those little yeah is there any that can see the dragon or no i'll look get a bead and then just duck back so no one knows where i am and also sanctuary that's me that's exactly me 15 minus one thank you critters for all the cool useful stuff what do we have in the store right now laura what do they say on them i feel like people should go to the store and get stuff now because when the 100th episode runs around some of those items might be dropped from the store and replaced with new stuff i don't know actually i literally don't know so if you want these items you got to get them now that's it five cards it's chaos and you're not even going to be here to deal with it i'm in a house with this stuff it's going to be me we're never going to get that far end of game that's literally what's about to happen oh you're just poor does he have 18 hit points now oh you get a cool thing you get a horse or something the streak continues with grog where's your skin (shrieks) no it bounces off my sanctuary yeah i did never thought it would come to this i hold up a diamond and i point it at your face and i say i will heal you if you swear you will not stab me in the back insight check that's pretty lousy 11 healing draught 9d8 i can't use my action to pour it down his throat i will live to regret this that's pretty good i don't know what our plan of action is so i can't go up because i would be scared do i have to roll for fear again i will move down to the bottom floor i still have some movement right i look up to see if i can see the dragon a wing i'm going to go to the north bunker all right and now i roll my fear 16 15 what do i have to roll to beat this thing jesus i'm never going to do it oh okay yep reckless you could kill the dragon in one move oh shit of course you do so many menu options for the honor of strongjaw he's going to break this plane of existence too and come back the plane of existence you break it why because i haven't taken a single hit yet that hits she's okay fly out fly up halfway up how does a cone work we're dealing with three dimensions here i will aim that way i have many prismatic sprays it's a 60-feet distance 60-foot cone i don't know if the math is going to work if not i have a backup plan d8 again this is a different one this is a five 36 halved 18 yeah i'm flying that negated my sanctuary i'll do one more sanctuary and i'm going to stay up can i fly back down that probably took all my speed yeah i'll hover in place i crack my knuckles come on little man let's rumble i'm flying so i will fly where i saw him hide he's immune to everything right but he's resistant to everything i'll fly over there and i guess i've got to get within 30 feet above him or 30 feet of him i'll chuck acid at him i'll look dexterity saving throw yeah so that's halved it's 9d6 16 wow lousy it was all ones and twos oh i attacked again didn't i shit i will do another sanctuary at level two (singing) i'm like a bird jump and hit or throw and hit i'm doing that pec thing that you always do but i can't do it so it looks like this (laughter) sure yeah that means it breaks my sanctuary yeah does he roll again to attack oh yeah okay sorry i'm going to actually fly away further and pull out another gem from my helmet and cast what modern-day people would call napalm straight into the door a wall of fire straight in the door in the room it's 5d8 fire damage but you're resistant right okay 26 that's it weak okay i'll sanctuary myself again oh yeah that gets through okay still kicking this guy is impossible to kill yeah is pulling a patch an action i'll fly right over the acid pit right over the center and i've got to do one more prismatic spray it's four it's poison right wait a quarter goddamn it this guy 42 halved and quartered so it's 11 wait is that right ten ten oh yeah that's a good idea (laughter) 3rd-level sanctuary is the prismatic spray a spell no but because i used prismatic spray oh i see it's still a low-level spell i'm just using a slot shenanigans that's my dc where are you but i'm over the acid sure nope i live to see another day jesus christ i know that he takes acid damage right okay then i will throw acid at him in the face yeah the acid drop it's a dex save 17 this could be it oh this is it well maybe 29 (screams) he's insane i'm going to go 50 feet anywhere to the top of that tower over there i guess yeah can i get there or as far away from him as i can get i'm going to get lightninged but that's okay i'll take it (giggles) i casually walk down the stairs with my hands all right i can do that (laughing) i can't do that you're so powerful i'll probably miss if i miss then i'm trapped in a room with him but i could miss greatsword that's what i've got greatsword i'll do this crazy around and around thing and try to do that with the greatsword oh and can i set it on fire first what am i rolling what was that 12 plus eight plus two magic that's 22 three oh it's 2d6 four (laughter) what happened (screams) i still have movement i get a disengage didn't we go over this i did a melee weapon attack don't i get a disengage for free yes my mobile feat okay enough to hit sure that hurts it hurts you because i have a shield of fire that burns anybody who attacks me with a melee attack with 2d8 cold damage two nine he gets two rolls i want him to hit the blazing td on my chest and have the might of my name ricochet back with the power of energy the darrington name strikes him down i say doty take this down i win and i kick him over oh wait they are i still had 30 or something it was like a paintball field were all the trunks the same thing the cards were amazing you got hammered to death so soon oh my god it's gone did you go wash your face your sheets tonight are going to be nasty well some of them weren't that good so really only 60
