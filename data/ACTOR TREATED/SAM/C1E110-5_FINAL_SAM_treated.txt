super nervous because i've never done this before but it's going to be fun and if it sucks then who cares right so let's just dive in right i'm going to play music from my ipad i'm now turning to my notes all right i'm about to begin the show here we go black and white as far as the eye can see the black of a cold night sky the white of ice capping every tree and dusting the roads below it is a frigid monochromatic night in jorenn village at the foot of the umber hills-- until a flash of yellow hair hoofbeats a fast-moving horse a young human woman riding at top speed through the windy night she barrels down the street muttering to herself shit shit shit i'm late again then suddenly a thunk the horse whinnies did she just hit something or someone oh no the young woman stops dismounts walks back and sees an awful sight an old woman in a simple grey robe cane in a mangled hand face bloody arm broken she's motionless ashen oh fuck says the girl oh my fuck i think i-- is that a-- i just killed someone oh gods what am i going to do i am so dead the young woman looks around no one to call for a doctor no fire-lit homes to knock on for help wait no lights no prying eyes no witnesses the rider takes a breath kicks a little snow over the body of the old woman checks the streets one more time and then mounts the horse and gets the hell out of there no one the wiser she rides on feeling guilty but also relieved no one saw right right in a few minutes she arrives at her destination shivering with cold she ties her horse to the lion statue across the street just in time for her shift at the second crappiest tavern in town the ass sailor the sign above the door once said the crass sailor but months ago vandals pried off the shitty letters c-r so now it just reads the ass sailor the name seems to have resonated with its low-life patrons and they seem to prefer it the poorly built tavern sits on the foundation of an old chapel and some time in the last hundred years was expanded to two stories a pub on the bottom and rooms above despite its thin walls it has one feature that regulars love on nights like this it is notoriously warm the woman pushes open the door jogs past the ass sailor's source of heat a large hearth blurred with red coals it's a small fireplace but no matter where you sit in the ass sailor you always stay weirdly warm so toasty in fact that there's a massive pile of jackets and scarves and weapons to the left of the door everyone inside has stripped down to the bare minimum of dress with the lack of clothing comes an oversupply of skin skin of all shades and body parts the ruddy belly of a human salesman stuffing himself on rotten mutton the dark blue-tinted shoulder of a tiefling whore enticing a gray bearded older man upstairs the gray forearm of a half-orc merchant drawing a mug of greep from the keg on the bar greep by the way is a homemade house liqueur it's so potent its nickname is kindling because it is also extremely flammable hint hint hint you're late calls the bar manager xavier wiping his hands on his grubby chef's apron i hit some unexpected traffic on the road replies your late-shift bartender valerie as she puts on her apron and ducks behind the bar there are a dozen tables most populated with drunken assholes half-witted con artists and infectious laughter val gets right to work on a night that will prove to be unlike any other at the bar a noble half-elf woman with fiery eyes dark skin and spectacular blonde hair nervously fidgets with her necklace she glances about looking for someone in an elegant blue and white gown and golden jewelry she is definitely out of place among the riffraff this we will learn is gryffin val the bartender approaches hi so what can i get you valerie hi mary hello do you have any scotch i'm over-prepared oh god i've lost the menu oh god everything's gone wrong one minute into the show oh god we have ale we have greep which is the house liqueur we have some whiskey and we have some wine the wine is not very good oh sure that'll be seven copper there you go what brings you around here haven't seen you before well we have two ladies of the night over there one is named zarvah she's the tiefling and she's a crowd pleaser yes the other is kay and she's over there as well i'm no one to judge but whatever sort of thing floats your boat i don't know any young whores if that's what you're asking for sure yes frankfurt he's a dwarven man he comes in here from time to time i think he's on a run i haven't seen him tonight all right i'll let you know if he arrives just then a tall female humanoid with rippling biceps and long whiskers takes the next stool over she's covered with tan and orange fur which is unsurprising because she is tabaxi a cat-woman her feline face is bandaged from recent battles and she snarls with an imposing posture that says don't fuck with me this is clothesline val approaches oh hey clothesline the usual i assume yes val takes out a saucer of warm milk and puts it on the bar oh and here's some spice too she places a box of crimson powder on the bar it is catnip what happened to your face oh that's-- wow that sounds like a lovely evening sure clothesline this is-- what was your name again i don't know i don't really know as they speak over at a small table a young human girl sits alone peering out of her hooded cloak she has almost translucent skin and snowy wisps of white hair fall over her face her cool blue eyes reveal a quiet confidence but she seems guarded and keeping her back to the wall not touching her glass of water this is jayne strolling over to the table with a wobbly gait is a short elven man with gray skin gray hair and a black leather choker he wears a sour expression and projects abject apathy he reeks of booze and appears to be wearing dark red eye makeup this is kingston and it looks like kingston is approaching jayne hell no hi kingston what can i get for you the child you're going to buy this person food with what money all right i'll give you some bread all right fine takes a glass of greep for you and here's two loaves of bread on your tab again all right you see a bunch of rowdy people all about you no one out of the ordinary that you can see so far let's see here what interesting things you know what make a perception check you see lots of festive people eating lots of food and drinking lots of wine that's about it dangerous well most of the people in here are weaponless some do have weapons the tabaxi over there is packing some biceps and some sharp claws there's a couple of guards there's one guard over near the door who's watching people's cloaks and whatever weapons have been checked there's another city guard who's drinking but he's got his sword he's near the wall over there he's got his sword sheathed and he looks like he could do some damage maybe that's about it the prostitutes look really feisty and one of them is having an argument still with this man about payment i made it a double sure whatever you want to do all right roll for an attack great clothesline attack roll a d20 add what is it five okay what's your armor class there kingston that's a hit right liam 13 and 13 that's a hit all right roll for damage 1d4 plus something wow did you roll a four okay so you don't have to roll for anything so clothesline has a special clothesline attack if she rolls a four it's eight points of damage to you sir and you are knocked prone that's a big fucking hit so kingston slams down onto the floor taking a couple of drinks with him he's dazed he's woozy he looks around he didn't even see it coming sure yeah greep all over the floor all over you you now have a flammable alcohol all over you it's probably stinging your eyes you hardly know who hit you or why xavier the manager comes over all right enough of that no fights tonight all right nothing like that tonight please some magical energy comes out of her and magically cleans up the stains off of his shirt everyone in the bar turns to see and goes like this to you when you do it you are no longer flammable sure as the tabaxi glides across the room finding another table let's move you over here i just knocked over a stool so you're alone by the bar now yes and just then the wind whips into the bar again as the door opens valerie the bartender gasps scared it might be the dead old lady but instead it is not two stout male dwarves walk in behind them a young girl with fire-red hair and elven ears they walk in and let's put them here for now one dwarf is sullen with thick muttonchops and a stumpy axe he says i tire of the road we eat here and rest frankfurt this is your job you pay obby the rat is done for the day ashly and the other dwarf is a younger stronger man with a braided beard piercing eyes and a heavy maul in his hand he scans the room and picks a table unlike some of the patrons these two do not check their weapons instead they park them under the table this is frankfurt and his friend obby the rat they pull up a chair for the young fair-skinned ginger girl who joins them her eyes sparkle with innocence and a touch of fear her name we will learn is holly you have been to this place before what is that obby the rat drinks ale yes right away frankfurt that's him certainly tips would be appreciated oh wow thank you very much all of your clothes it is very hot are you sure you want to strip down there are unsavory types in here yes what cargo we are not transporting any cargo tonight i do not know this garello you have spoken of him but i don't know that i would recognize him perhaps ask someone else right away whole or skim this time okay sure yeah why don't you make an intelligence check so you don't personally know garello but you are a woman about town who hears things hears whispers talks with unsavory sorts you have heard there is a man in town not from here named garello who has been poking his nose around the ass sailor waiting for something but you haven't met him yet no just that he's been asking around he's been here before what is wrong with you what which dude do you have a beef with this gentleman do you want me to go kill him okay sure yes message will make a whisper appear in her ear once so gryffin you're sitting at the bar looking around you don't know who just talked to you all of a sudden you hear this voice in your ear that says that dwarf fucked my wife you vaguely have heard the voice before but it's loud in here you have no idea what the fuck just happened sure and the spell fades (laughter) okay as you travel across the room liam opens a book of some sort as you are walking across the room jayne our young girl played by liam o'brien starts eyeing clothesline and trying to get her eye contact she raises an index finger to her eyebrow and winks i think oh yes there is some sort of a wink or a nod exchanged yes okay at which point clothesline looks around her having received some sort of a signal to her left is one human guard where the fuck did you go no where's the tabaxi where is the cat lady (laughing) where is she there's too many people in here oh there she is okay so to her left is one human guard ordering a drink to her right one half-orc merchant behind her has wandered zarvah the whore and she turns who zarvah the whore is a tiefling i don't know how tiefling ageing works so i'm going to say 30 (laughter) the other whore is older much older yeah her name is kay i think yes clothesline looks around human guard half-orc zarvah the whore would you like to do anything clothesline yes gryffin has arrived over at the table yes all right you're fast 30 i think yeah sure let's see here five ten yes sure you're going to have to dodge around some dudes but yeah you can reach gryffin sure would you like to move there all right with cat-like grace she leaps up onto the table back to there back up on the bar back down back on the table all the way over to gryffin right there and no one even hears you move you're so dexterous and awesome what did you roll okay what are you attacking with your claws or-- claws so plus what is it five so it's a 19 right okay that hits okay this is it so the words bar fight ring out everyone turns looks to the source of the action over there at the table and with razor-like claws-- right you did a claw attack digging into the back of your head gryffin you feel intense pain and roll for damage five take five hit points off there gryff you feel these claws dig into the back of your head you feel blood trickling down your neck it sucks what would you like to do gryffin reduce not familiar with that one oh reduce size yes i am familiar with that one okay as you do that i need everyone to roll initiative it is a bar fight oh god okay everyone get your numbers in your head i'm going to roll for about seven other people okay sure uh-huh oh yeah yep uh-huh oh not good not good uh-huh all right give me your numbers anyone from 20 to 25 ooh okay where are you you're down here great who's next anyone from 20 to 25 anyone from 15 to 20 16 okay good yes anyone else 15 to 20 no ten to 15 13 frankfurt what do you got gnarly let me do the order here (singing) there are so many people in this bar why would i do this to myself (speaking) yep this was a bad idea okay nine yep okay good we got 13 people to keep track of great all right here we go wait i got some battle music playing is it playing sure i don't know i don't know what any of this shit is (giggles) okay you cast reduce your spell dc is what okay oh you have to save is it a constitution save do you know i can look concentration so roll 20 add your constitution save modifier a blast of sorcerous energy comes out of gryffin's hands what do you use to cast things your hands and the magical energy passes right through you it's a burst of strange tingling sensation that bursts right past your face but you shake off the effects and nothing happens that's a spell yes so you don't roll on spells i don't believe unless i'm wrong about these things it's not a ranged attack reduce right it's just a spell does it say ranged attack or anything i don't know how to play and i don't know how to dm i would appreciate that we hold all questions to the end of the session not tonight mary no that's your spell save dc right you have a spell save dc it's on page two of your thing for spells like chromatic orb or other things those are ranged attacks that you roll for your attack reduce is just a thing that happens you don't have to target anyone okay so nothing happened but it is your round gryffin that was a surprise attack no it wasn't a surprise attack you fucking attacked first so you still get a bonus action and a move if you would like if you have a spell that you can cast as a bonus action you do have one bonus action spell misty step no but if you really want to i'll let you because i don't care (laughter) firebolt at whom all right this is a ranged spell you roll for your attack i am doing tides of chaos yeah i hear you tides of chaos is a sorcerer feature yeah plus six that's your spell attack bonus 18 this is versus an armor class i believe you did which gives you advantage fuck this tabaxi is tough so you take a deep breath mary gryffin and you say oh i'm going to get you this time and you cast another spell which again-- a tingling sensation passes over your face as the tabaxi shakes it off nothing happened you still have movement if you'd like to make it okay you're going to move over here oh sure oh let's see what's your movement okay yeah then you can make it right there and as you go clothesline gets an attack of opportunity not a clothesline attack because that takes movement but other things you can do you can claw her again roll for an attack no you have to do that before inspire you can't use a reaction what did you say yes no absolutely not clothesline takes a swipe and only just gets a little shock of blonde hair in her claws ooh they're already so feisty against each other i love it and you get away safely next up everyone in the bar turns to see that there is some fighting going on many patrons of the bar who are regulars just sort of say shit and don't really react very much there're some newbies in the bar who are on edge they start moving around there's a hustle and bustle they start going across the bar to get their weapons let's say that this fine young cannibal over here starts moving to get her weapons the weapons are over here near the front door and let's say that this gentleman moves over to the front door to grab his weapon let's see here that takes care of so she's done who's three no one goes third what the fuck there's no three all right so we go straight to four she doesn't do anything she's just moving okay jayne-- no that's not true yes it is jayne you are up it is your turn to act and strike oh snap on the little girl on holly the little girl who hasn't said a thing or done a thing to you yet yes the two dwarves let me find her on a what save what did you say she has to beat she does not beat 14 so what are the effects of this spell on her next move all right how fast can you move yeah you had to get up you had to walk over there let's say you get about this far near the dog and the little girl is right here she hasn't moved yet but on her turn she will to defend themselves if needed absolutely the guard right here has drawn his sword by the door this guy has been guarding the weapons and he holds a longsword and he had it already readied before the fighting even started he's a paid hired hand to guard the door does that do something oh snap okay that ends your turn jayne okay who is next okay valerie the bartender does not like this and she does not like someone coming behind her bar so she is going to move over and attack gryffin let's see what she's got she's not armed currently so she is going to roll a punch attack that's an 18 does that hit okay she's not a martial weapon person i think that's one point of damage she smacks you in the face and says don't come back here this is the bar oh boy it's not going great for you let's see here who is next five that's six seven seven who is seven why did i write two sixes clothesline it is your turn you're right over here you just made a swipe attack on gryffin as she left you're near kingston and you saw jayne get up and walk away after she gave you the signal frankfurt is pretty close to you yeah he's instinctively put his hand on his weapon and his other hand is starting to clutch the girl's arm the girl holly what is your weapon okay so you're going to move over here yeah 15 feet of movement or something and you attack with what sure yeah so you've used ten feet of movement that is a definite hit so the tabaxi runs full sprint ten feet across holding her arm out in a clothesline motion and makes a huge impact with the guy's neck roll for damage five damage okay so the guard is a regular and he looks up at you and says what the hell clothesline would you like to do anything on your bonus action is there anything which guy this orc guy yeah this half-orc guy let's say he's got something what does he have nope nope he doesn't have any weapons i wrote it down that way so that's how it is okay so you do a catlike roar on the table (hisses) the four or five people near you look up at you totally baffled at what the fuck is going on right now one guy who is a regular grabs his drink and sips it he doesn't give a shit okay next up that was clothesline next is kingston's turn kingston what would you like to do oh kingston kingston is over here sorry oh i wrote down 13 for kingston and three for frankfurt but it's the opposite so 13 for frankfurt three for kingston sorry about that all of them okay sorry sorry i get you guys confused because of your stupid names so frankfurt it is your turn there is chaos all around you the girl is sitting there harmlessly she's a little frightened but there's a lot of action lot of movement on his wife okay so seeing his opportunity frankfurt leaves the side of the little girl and runs across the room using your awesome dwarf speed how fast can you move 25 this is you the gold guy by the way eric obby is still protecting her i will say she was sitting in between you two obby is calm so you go over and you attack are you doing a weapon attack so roll a d20 and add your plus something to it 18 i'm sure that hits you right dude wait you rolled an 18 yeah he hits you yeah so roll for damage what does it say hold on your maul is 2d6 plus six this is a big fat weapon two-handed strike comes down right on the top of your head full force this guy is a bruiser so roll 2d6 or 1d6 twice oh my god you're fucking dead dude 14 points of damage kingston still reeling from getting dissed by several ladies tonight didn't really even look and all of a sudden a maul cracks down on his skull sending him to his knees are you okay kingston is not doing great because i don't know what the fuck i'm doing on your knees kingston-- by the way sorry would you like to use any bonus actions mr frankfurt you don't have to you could have used before or you could put it on somebody else also forgive me hunter's mark he has something similar that is a paladin feature i think that doesn't use a spell slot vow of enmity is that a thing i don't know you're satisfied oh shit you can move a little bit i think you have five or ten more feet of movement so keep that in your back pocket frankfurt goes back towards the girl keeping her protected from badness that was frankfurt at this point the old bald man who was arguing with the whore uses this as an opportunity to flee and starts running for the door he's moving this way zarvah the whore sees this happening and starts bolting to catch him this guy over here who was eating mutton before he's got his weapon now and he turns to anyone who's available to him which is the easiest target in the area which is jayne a small girl mutton man has-- he sees you running for the door he thinks this is fun this is his favorite thing is bar room brawls he is going to roll a 14 plus five 19 versus strength no he's trying to grapple you you are grappled by the mutton man he grabs you and says not so fast dear we're going to have some fun tonight you are restrained for right now you cannot move so you are grappled ooh i have a thing you are grappled (cheering) that's the mutton man now we go to kingston kingston before your roll you have dropped to your knees you are feeling like shit you open your eyes roll a perception check 12 okay you see the table in front of you you've fallen facing the table under the table in front of you is a small vial of something underneath it that is going to take some of your movement you could grab it that's fine you grab it i got stuff i got presents let's do this because i'm a kind god (laughing) you recognize one of these you've seen them before it's a potion of healing someone must have dropped it in the scrum so it's there for you if you need it what would you like to do on your action frankfurt is pretty close to you blindness okay what is your spell save dc 14 is blindness a constitution or wisdom save so eric you need to roll a d20 and add your constitution save modifier which liam will point out to you right now constitution save so roll something 20 a prickling in your neck frankfurt as you feel some sort of magical effect starting to take hold but you burp and shake it off like nothing happened kingston you still have a bonus action okay it's a 2d4 plus what yeah well i don't want him to die already all right lucky all right so that takes care of all you guys i think the half-orc who you did not attack sees you on the bar sees that it's going to be fun and is going to try to pull you down off the bar he will roll a 14 plus something i don't know what just a 14 i'm going to say straight 14 no this would be a strength check he's pretty strong so i'm going to add four to that 18 versus strength strength save 20 plus your strength holy shit so the half-orc grabs for your catlike ankles and you see the grab coming and you kick your half-drunk saucer of milk right in his face he's distracted and gets a whiff of air doesn't grab any fur or anything that ends his turn anybody else okay there's one other person who moves and she's picking up a weapon that is the top of the round-- oh no obby the dwarf obby the rat okay obby is going to go across to the girl take a couple steps closer to the girl because that's what he's being paid here for grab her by the arm and hold his action until someone tries to attack the girl holly can move shit i never rolled for initiative for holly okay so she should have gone a while ago fuck let's just say she was so confused she's only going now holly is wearing a simple gray raw silk tunic with a belt around it she is-- let me see where's her fucking stats she is not holding anything at all except for let's say for dramatic effect she has a tiny something in her hand that looks like a charm bracelet or something that a young girl might have like a hair tie with some charms dangling from it or something that's it and she starts to move right that's what happens with this thing right she comes towards you and her movement is fast so she comes right over and stops at your feet looks up at you with puppy dog eyes as if to say who are you and where are we going and that concludes her turn that's the top of the round holy shit i'm running a game of dungeons and dragons (cheering) as the fight continues time freezes our vision dims flashes to another time another place it's blurry at first then coming slowly into focus is a dimly lit room a simple table and chair in the center from this perspective only the person in the chair can be seen there is an off-stage voice that of a gruff man asking questions but we never see him it is by all appearances an interrogation in the chair sits gryffin the gruff voice says uh-huh and why were you there at the bar this girl that you keep talking about right why what could a little fucking girl have that you needed well you're not going anywhere honey are you some sort of royalty or something you talk real funny are you shitting me don't even think about it honey time shifts again same room different time now in the hot seat is kingston looking very confused eyes red hungover woozy dazey so this guy he slept with your wife and that's all the beef there was between you two what were you even doing in this bar but they let you live there what does that mean you sweep up after the night is over so you freaky-looking guy are a male prostitute i don't need the details buddy please spare me time shifts again now clothesline looking surly and pissy is in the hot seat what's with your face fair enough the white-haired girl what's her deal did you know her maybe what put you in jail how you would do anything for her were you helping her this night i just want to get this down you are admitting that you started the fight in the tavern all right thank you for your honesty hey where did you get that name anyway clothesline do you have another alias anything else a lot of 'porns' yeah no that tracks that definitely tracks i don't know how to change music people i don't know sorry about this time shifts again now in the hot seat we see frankfurt the dwarf all right this girl that you claim you were there to deliver who gave her to you where did you find her where did she come from you'll get your courier pigeon listen we're trying to round up obby right now we're aware of where he lives in town what do you mean where's the girl i will be asking the questions here thank you very much fine if you had your courier pigeon who would you send it to while that is extremely impressive it leaves way more questions than answers i don't feel like you're taking this interrogation seriously and what would you get in exchange 100 gold for just taking a girl from point a to point b go ahead i know absolutely nothing about this chained oblivion it's some sort of fucking religious thing oh i don't see anyone from them i've heard rumors that they exist wait why am i answering any questions time shifts again now we have a white-haired girl child in the hot seat all right tell me your story why were you there what's a sweet innocent little sweetheart like you doing in a place like the ass sailor go on i'm listening excuse me yeah your hands are tied behind your back they're movable i don't know what that is do you roll something what was the number okay so as we see a burst of flame right you said flames we see from your eyes they start to glow and burn with a holy light and fire starts to emanate from your eyes straight towards our point of view we hear a gruff man say ugh hey what the fuck are you-- and time shifts again (laughter) there's a keg right there it's right here it's full of greep it's heavy but you can pick it up it's a pony keg there are a bunch of cups over here greep is a pour thing so you either have a big bottle of it or you can use your turn to start filling up cups of it (laughter) there are whiskey bottles all over the place in the back of the bar they're not filled with greep though they've got different other spirits whiskey-- empty bottles sure yeah they've taken the used bottles and put them sort of behind the bar bottles with greep you're going to use your action to do this all right so valerie who still doesn't really love you behind the bar is watching you fill up bottles but she's okay because she got a bunch of gold out of it so she's allowing it with a sneer the man right behind you xavier really doesn't like this but he is a ninny so he's just like (grumbling) oh wow bonus action gold toss that's nice while you're down there getting these bottles why don't you roll a perception check (whispering) i made these and i'm going to use them fuckers 13 yeah sure so you see a small box that has intricate gold leafing around it looks out of place behind there it's small the size of a deck of cards or something oh god you'll never see it okay that's a thing that exists okay next up one two okay this whore-- she wants to help out her hooker friend and catch the old guy who's leaving so she runs over and attacks him yep that hits i'll roll for damage great where's he okay so she lunges at him and hits him in the back of the head and grabs onto his pants which pull them down he's now naked from the waist down and slightly injured and he says i'm being attacked i'm being attacked next remember there is no three because i never assigned that number four okay the ranger has found her shit this is the ranger right here she has found her bow and arrow nocked an arrow and she's going to shoot she needs some range so she's going to shoot at the most prominent target in the room the cat thing on the bar and she rolled a one the arrow whizzes by your head (arrow impact) right into the thing behind you no damage no nothing that's four five next jayne your turn you are currently restrained i think you can do a strength check to try to get out of it an 18 on whom oh yes for sure he was the mutton man right his ac is 12 you hit oh my god i don't know what that is but it sounds horrifying now we're going to have some fun-- what the fuck are you doing okay so with his snarling disgusting yellow teeth he's smiling at you as his whole head from top to bottom disintegrates into ash and falls to the floor in a pile of disgustingness he's dead and gone you are no longer restrained and can move at will okay no longer restrained you're calmly walking out like you own the place no one takes a strike against you because you're not involved in combat with them oh this guy is gone splash one okay that ends your turn let's see (counting) so after frankfurt holly goes okay that's you jayne next is the guard who failed on his attack against you tabaxi the last time so instead he's frustrated by that so he will attack again why not he rolls a natural 20 with his longsword d8 this is not going to be good for you eight so 16 points of damage as you take a sword right in your left shin your leg buckles you fall to one knee and blood starts pouring out of your furry knee and he says i've got you that time that's his turn we go to clothesline it's your turn sure go for it ooh because your knee is buckled you're wobbly your sword strike goes errant and strikes the side of the bar digging into it he looks up at you and laughs again this is an epic battle between a very lowly guard and you oh yeah you do have a bonus action you have i believe an action surge if you wanted to attack again you can just attack again i gave her two because i like her that hits he has ac 13 okay yeah he's dead your sword digs into his neck getting about halfway in he looks surprised and he falls over limp on the ground he's gone and dead end of him jesus frankfurt you are up in contact with her yeah she's behind the bar you can yell at her you're flirting during this fight people are running around half-naked somehow all the sound dims they make eye contact it's beautiful as you talk holly is walking towards the door you can move you can attack you can grab you can do all sorts of things you don't know all you saw was she stood up walked away from the table and started walking towards the door she paused briefly to look up at jayne this white-haired person jayne kept walking to the door and holly's eyes followed followed jayne it looks like she's watching jayne's every move with rapt attention you're right here and i forget your movement but you can at least move to holly 25 you can get to holly if you'd like to okay you jump over this dog you get to holly a courier pigeon flies by you can grab her you can attack someone you can do whatever you would like to do okay so roll a strength check okay what's your strength modifier it's four for you so 14 so she's going to roll she rolls an eight plus zero she is grappled still her eyes seem distant and pupils dilated but she is unable to move any further i got multiple rings holly's not moving you have a bonus action if you want to use it you have bonus actions if you'd like i don't know what spells you've chosen but you do have a few spells that you can use as a bonus action or you can do nothing yell to obby well it hasn't come back to holly yet that's good to know it was your and i walk away that did it it took most of his movement to get over there it's a cramped bar he's dodging dogs and stuff smite i don't know how it works liam how does smite work oh but this is divine smite you're talking about that is after a melee hit we're looking at a bonus action he's used his action to grapple holly he can't attack if you have a bonus action spell or you don't have to do anything you can hold your spells for later whatever you want to do okay good i love your voice the old man who was trying to flee he's going to attack one of the whores he does not hit it is holly's turn she is restrained she doesn't know what the fuck's going on she's still under her spell i guess the spell is fading off now so she shakes it off doesn't know how she got over here now she's being held by a strong dwarf man she doesn't do anything to fight that kingston it's your turn you are still over by the table frankfurt's closer to the door he's this guy in gold right here oh shit wait you're going to hold a guy who's holding a girl this is amazing okay kingston your spell dc is 14 hold person i believe is wisdom so roll a d20 and add your wisdom save modifier it's in a little box that liam will point to you right now spells are not working tonight kingston has been drinking a lot tonight so all of his spells when uttered come out a little bit slurry and they don't seem to have as much power again there's a little prickling in the back of your neck but nothing happens kingston's very frustrated you have a bonus action and movement if you'd like it kingston i think you can move what 30 feet no one's engaging you so you walk over and you get all the way there you don't have to do anything you can inspire you can heal i let mary do it yeah go for it because your spells have been sucking tonight okay before you move while you're still in range of him because i think it's 30 feet-- 60 then by the bar you got to yell loud because you're across this loud bar the sung words from kingston's somewhat-drunk voice enter your ear and affect you in a way that you've never felt before you feel bad about yourself you feel demeaned and you feel unsure of yourself as a dwarf in general you take actual physical damage so roll a d4 and add something no just a d4 this is a damage roll we're doing four plus what does it say on the spell 1d4 plus something so you take four points of damage so you are less powerful than you were before and you can't get the song out of your head and it will affect your next turn you will have to do your next turn at disadvantage which means you will be thrown off so take your little number there and reduce it by some points yep sure okay that is kingston the half-orc is going to run over to kingston and hit him he heard your dulcet tones he doesn't like them it is an unarmed strike he does not hit you he whiffs the sound confuses him and he's too tall for you anyway just goes right over your head clean that's the top of the round what do i do next the heat of the room and the movement of everyone around is really making the place fucking hot so hot in fact that you all get the sense that if you don't remove an article of clothing soon you may become exhausted so there's a brief pause in the action where everyone says oh my god it's fucking hot in here i would need you all to either remove an article of clothing or suffer one point of exhaustion everything well you're a furry you've got nothing on so you're ripping your fur off where's your picture okay you have armor you want to take off your armor you're going to lose ac sure i'm going to give you a negative one to ac so you're down to 18 and we can see your cat lady bits yeah they're nice kingston anything oh shit so you have disadvantage-- no i think exhaustion is disadvantage on all ability checks you're going to take off your shirt so you are now shirtless he rips open his shirt the buttons fly everywhere exposing a really out of shape guy little man boobies love handles yeah really lopsided too it's not good a writer's body gryffin anything you'd like to remove all right so you're sleeveless now this is strange for you because it's an elegant gown you rip off the sleeves and it's frayed and tattered there you feel a little uncomfortable jayne anything else we should know about that we see you look so good frankfurt what you got you're going to take it off you cannot shave some sort of a tunic thing your options are pants or armor we'll say ashly and seeing frankfurt's exposed wang drives kingston into a fit of rage he knows that was the wang that was in his wife and he wants to hit that wang so hard i don't know what's going on obby the rat who has been saving his turn for a while now and forgotten about does not like where this is going and so he strikes out at the first person he can get to what's his movement not very much shoot he can't get to anybody sure he's going to kick the dog no why would he kick a dog he's going to attack someone who's in a fight yeah he's got to get there though he's going to push past the prostitute and defend holly and hit the first person he can which is this woman right here this fighter 15 oh yeah he takes her the old man has tried but i think he failed okay she's gone he knocks her out she's dead all right top of the round oh my god this is so hard okay gryffin what would you like to do there are candles lit near you there are torches on the wall and a couple candles on the bar for light she's right next to you you wouldn't have to throw it far you would just smash it on the bar i would say that you would want to move back a little bit so you don't get splashed or hit it's an area of effect so i'm going to treat this as like a very modified fireball what's your spell attack bonus it's plus six so roll a d20 add six oh you have advantage no you used that the last time let's see here this would be a dex save do a dex save catty so you still get burned but you take half damage let's see it's a modified thing so i'm going to roll that's cocked so take five points of fire damage as the fire spreads across the bar let's say that it's green fire because i have a rubber band that guy gets hit too he takes one point of damage kingston you take-- i thought you were here i don't know what the fuck i was thinking okay good the bar's on fire people are running away from it i don't know who i am i don't have a fully fleshed-out character this cat is on fire makes your heart weep and your fur is on fire as well this is bad that was great anything bonus anything other you have to cast a spell for that right no i mean you have to cast something to roll on the table spells don't just come out of you you have to try to cast a spell right i don't know how your fucking wild sorcery works yes but if you have a bonus action or something you can use oh my god fire is the thing today so you automatically roll on the table so get out your 100-sided die this young lady is a wild sorcerer she-- she starts acting very strangely talking in a different accent her whole personality shifts and magic seems to overtake her body the diceman over there feels a sudden pain inside her belly as part of her magic has disappeared she tried to cast a firebolt spell on you but instead of any fire coming out of her nothing happens instead she feels slightly less magical than she was a moment ago she has lost her highest spell slot the guy the no pants the old man is dead one of the whores just killed him with a crossbow that was kay we go to four this other ranger now sees that the dwarves are on the move she shoots a shot at you frankfurt what's your ac she does not hit you a crossbow bolt whizzes by your body and hits this person behind you hey i wasn't even doing anything let's see here jayne you're up the dwarf no frankfurt is still holding her she is grappled yeah obby is standing in front of her in a defensive position the whip crack knocks a bowl of greep off the table it explodes there is fire on the floor over there right there she's on fire i literally haven't done anything okay an invisible shield comes up around jayne who is still right next to the door unless you want to move okay val the human bartender will pick up her greataxe from behind the bar and she wants you off the bar she's going to swing she's trying to protect her bar ten what's your ac you're fine the fire confuses her she swings wide clothesline you're up on the bartender oh you can climb very well and fast that's all you can also slash with them you mean to get two strikes out of it i would say that upon reaching her you could make a slash attack but you'd have to get to her and then past her to even touch her okay so you jump off the bar you're no longer on fire or in the fire you get right next to her sure that's what you do oh that'll hit oh wait if you rolled a four she is knocked prone sure do you have a reaction is that a thing that you have no unless by your class can cast a reaction spell but i don't think you can so you're okay oh nice roll that d10 after she clotheslines you we see the tabaxi take a deep breath of air and now out of the fire suddenly she feels better than ever before how fast is your movement total so it took you 20 feet to get there you have another ten feet if you'd like to go somewhere else okay go this way excuse me pardon me excuse me no because i think it was a part of her-- i think that's how it works she does not get an attack of opportunity right yeah but this is during the move right you ran by clotheslined her and keep running so i don't think you get an attack of opportunity i'm going to say no because i got to keep it moving there's more shit to do who's next that was jayne clothesline frankfurt you're up what would you like to do frankie yeah you're holding her you can do whatever you want okay gryffin's way across the room sure what's your movement she is not resisting i'll say that you get full halfway there right around where kitty-cat is that's your movement you can still act can still do something or you could have attacked before you moved up to you just talking sure yeah do you have a healing spell of some sort or a potion of some sort lay on hands you can use lay on hands you have a healing pool of 20 hit points you can give in any denomination to anyone so you can give her 20 you can give her one you can give her four you can do whatever you want so from your 20 you now have ten left in your reserve gryffin heals ten if you want to do a bonus action or anything else good that's frankfurt who's left holly's not going to do anything that guy is dead we're going to go to kingston yes shit you guys are turning really mean go for it sleep is not a ranged attack it's a spell save dc of 14 against what save learn your spells i can look it up roll 5d8 first oh there's no save on sleep it just happens 25 okay i don't how this works because you've got more than 25 hit points the lowest hit points he picked frankfurt more than that and so does frankfurt yeah so the dog's asleep tabaxi how many hit points do you have she's okay yeah so she's down she's asleep on fire barmaid's asleep for sure and then there's not enough hit points left for him you make all these randoms fall asleep this guy too four people pass out around frankfurt they are peacefully asleep of course you can that's an inspiration to you hearing his words of compliment inspires you what is your inspiration die we'll look it up i don't remember it's your charisma modifier it's probably a d8 i'm going to say a d8 because i don't know man you get one extra d8 on your next roll okay suddenly without warning without making a sound a new mysterious figure emerges from the back room pushing xavier away he moves quickly and silently across the ass sailor with a speed none of you have ever witnessed it's like the figure runs without moving his body he floats in a beautiful sprint as he passes by you gryffin you suddenly feel even hotter than before for an instant he strikes fear into your heart roll a perception check oh fuck okay i could whisper but that takes too much time you see first as he glides past you he is wearing pants he looks like a normal human man except his eyes are different they seem to glow red it's disconcerting also as you watch him run his gait is weird there's no this movement of his shoulder it's just straight like he's floating like he has no legs and as he whizzes by you past these sleeping people you see the faintest flick of a tail he runs across does not say a word does not make an attack towards you frankfurt does not even regard you but simply removes holly from your grasp roll a strength save d20 plus your strength ability check 23 let me look oh wait didn't you have some sort of disadvantage we're going to put it on this roll again it was a while ago we never did it we're doing it here no i know but we haven't incorporated it did he roll with disadvantage on his last turn 17 where's the guide shit 17 nope that's not it shit too many pages all right i'm going to just make something up i'm going to say that there's a brief tug-of-war he does wrest holly from your grasp but you slow him down considerably and he only gets five more feet away from you he's going this way he's taking holly with him and he's making a beeline this way i don't know you don't know gryffin you saw this weird thing just happen what are you going to do why not sure you rush over to frankfurt sure what are you doing i love how they are having conversations through this whole fight i love it no he's fine nothing happened he is naked from the waist down did you move over to frankfurt you see this dude carrying a girl running across the room roll a d20 and add six that hits go ahead that's very useful the cold blast hits him in the back squarely and even though it's a minor spell you see him react way worse than you thought it would be he cries out with an inhuman shriek (shrieks) and seems to take even more damage than that but he continues on slowly now because his non-feet feel slower all right go on he is where he is that is gryffin's turn next is-- i don't care about them jayne oh sorry there is a ranger who's going to shoot somebody i don't care i'm rolling to see who she fires at and i rolled jayne sorry i rolled randomly it's a plus-five so that's eight plus five 13 okay versus 14 she fails that she goes to draw her bow on you she chooses a new target she chooses clothesline she fires and it's a one she's so discombobulated that she hasn't hit anything today she sucks okay now it's jayne the whip makes a wonderful crack and nothing else happens you did it on the bad guy 17 yeah you see a blue spectral hand reach out towards your face it's super freaky there's fingernails on it and then it suddenly (gasp) faces away it's super weird and it emerges from jayne while she cast the spell it seems that her lips go to the back a little bit then become thinner her eyes narrow and she has this skeleton look for half a second as she casts the spell and then goes back to normal okay that's jayne next is-- oh you've got more clothesline what you got clothesline what you got okay go just do your attack first okay first make a wisdom saving throw yeah so roll your d20 add wisdom save that's not great so you feel the urge to maybe hit somebody else okay go for it roll again for your attack again you are so distracted by what just happened that your sword knocks over a bottle of greep which explodes and this dude's now on fire i don't have a name okay that's clothesline frankfurt you're next so you're going to move towards him all right with the speed of a frankfurt you move towards him and you do something go for it yes please that hits go ahead and roll for damage your maul does 2d6 plus six 18 points of damage oh shit whoa my god the man with the girl is super surprised oh wait even though you hit him with this insanely hard hit-- you connected real hard-- somehow he shrugs it off and turns to you and sneers at you he does take some damage but it doesn't seem like it's as much as you thought it would be okay that was frankfurt kingston you're up while this is all happening obby says obby the rat does not like this and he leaves he has not even looked at anyone else singularly focused on holly has not uttered a word except he did turn around to look at frankfurt when he hit him just because he was pissed glad you've got your priorities right go for it go ahead so your spell dc is 14 i think eric roll a d20 what's blindness constitution or is it wisdom constitution roll a d20 add your constitution saving modifier this tickle on the back of your neck again nothing happens you are blue-balling so hard for your spells i hope you're marking these off you don't get infinite spells any bonus actions anything else any healing you good brian you're moving away from the action great okay kidnapper guy with holly makes his way all the way to this trapdoor-- that's if his movement is 20 which it is not i thought you said it moves in half to ten shit well then you are correct so let's say five ten uses his action to dash five ten then he's fine he makes it there in one clean dash uses his bonus to flip open the trapdoor just for good measure he touches this guy who hasn't done anything wrong and he takes-- he's dead yeah he dies he just touched him the trapdoor is open and he is gone and that's where we'll take our break thank you so much for playing so far guys we'll have more when we come back (cheering and applause) okay so we're going to (voice breaking) give away-- (laughter) yes (sighs) oh god (laughter) are we out come on [break] i'm pretty sure that was on and we're back congratulations to the winner in chat of this fantabulous critical role english wych elm burl hero vault from wyrmwood gaming cholieamenthys is the winner danoba will contact you shortly for your shipping information congratulations and meow yeah cholieamenthys so guys when last we left a mysterious figure who emanated heat had grabbed holly the little girl who frankfurt and obby-- oh we need music-- were transporting tore across the bar and went down into this trapdoor you are all confused looking around there's still fights going on what would you like to do go okay so you're all converging around the trap door kingston are you with them oh shit okay you get to the top of the open trapdoor and look down into darkness sure yeah many of you have darkvision it's okay guys clothesline has no pants both of your genitals are exposed so who's going first who's going second are you going to talk to each other at all you're just going to go are you going to hit each other what's happening anyone want to go in first you can cast light on an ass all right so yes kingston you fall in first sure yep in fact roll an athletics check or acrobatics whatever's higher for you sorry acrobatics is probably higher for you whoa shit you're familiar with this tavern and all of its layout because you live here so you land like a cat in a three-point landing at the foot of this darkened ladder/stairs how long does light last by the way is it concentration or anything if you shove your ass close to them it would probably affect them at some point so you are a lightning bug and your ass is illuminating this whole space down here where did the figures go liam oh there they are let's place you guys around somewhere haphazardly oh god this thing's so far i can't do it there's no marching order it's a room he fell down so he's over here you guys can-- who wants to go next okay is anyone going to follow clothesline's suggestion you're at the bottom and jayne is coming down the steps right behind you as you talk you all make it down there slowly filling the room i could pull it towards me it's going to wreck some microphones over there okay i should tell you before you start walking at the foot of the stairs there's a single lantern casting a dim glow although that doesn't matter because you've got light coming out of your ass on the walls are graffiti seemingly from patrons who've wandered down here one reads for a good time do not call isabelle another reads do you know why they call him obby the rat because his dick is the size of a rodent and the other one says what do you call a pile of tabaxi a meowntain straight on at the bottom of the steps a narrow corridor leading out around a slight bend obscuring the view to the other direction it's a dead wall however there is a space underneath the back of the stairway it is dank and cold light frost covers the floor because you are out of that hot bar now so you would like to continue down this hall okay this curves this way and leads to a door the corridor proceeds around to the left as you proceed through it clothesline has to bend a little to make it through frankfurt feels roomy it ends with a simple wooden door and a rusty knob are you still in the same marching order kingston first or kingston second that's you so nobody is going with you right now jayne you're in front of a door gryffin can you roll an investigation check 18 yes all right there is a false wall here that opens up into another corridor that leads this way let me see how i described it yes okay it empties out into a wider room and i'm going to do this all right so what would you like to do sure roll a perception check ten that's what you needed so there is frost everywhere it's super cold down here because we're underground in a cellar area and it's winter yeah now you're also getting cold gryffin you notice that there's less frost on the floor under the stairs and through this hallway than on the rest of the downstairs area there are no footprints if anything it's just a straight line you also notice something else two things actually would you like the one on the left or the one on the right left read that out loud that saves you're fine just one point of damage it's dead would you like the thing on the right okay do you proceed into this room or do you hang out sure make an investigation check the door is not locked and not trapped you're so freaky it's a rather long room with boxes everywhere seems to be some sort of storage area in the middle is a table with potions and beakers on it a closet over here it is not lit at all let's see what i said about it a single lantern glows near the door casting dark shadows everywhere stacked boxes all around weirdly the smell of cabbage permeates the air in the center of the room a wooden table resembling a crude chemistry lab beakers and vials are arranged a whiff of something strange hits you it stings your nose like gasoline would you like to look around that's so cool so you've got a white whip that's lit up you can investigate that yeah to grapple jayne if you want to walk down the hall you can try okay roll an investigation check sure okay ten is what you needed upon further inspection you use your light to reveal the labels on the jugs someone has been mixing liquor down here after a minute of study you figure out that the house alcohol greep is made right here and the formula is remarkably basic it is four parts standard rice wine one part balsamic vinegar one part simple syrup and one part pure kerosene everyone who has drank it has been drinking kerosene the whole night that's it that's all you find currently okay catwoman what would you like to do how's sanctuary going still on it has not been ten minutes so you'll have to make a wisdom saving throw against 14 so sadly that does not mean that you grapple that means that you have the fortitude to attempt to grapple yeah strength and you're pretty strong wait three your strength is three no it's not really i thought you were stronger than that no you're right 12 okay so you are grappled and restrained you both can't move or anything unless you want to try to drag her somewhere sure yeah what does this spell do that was beautiful and sad all right so you are released jayne from her grapple you are feeling really shitty right now i mean you can certainly make an attempt so many times go ahead and make a constitution saving throw to see if you can make yourself throw up you stick your fingers down your throat to throw up but it doesn't work you gag and dry heave for a while and nothing comes up unfortunately who's going down there you three as you walk in you see that the walls of this part of the tunnel are rough as if they had been clawed out of the rocks it's very cold you can see your breath as you enter it's also pitch black because light is gone those of you with darkvision can faintly see that this tunnel-- i'm going to skip that part in the interest of time that this tunnel continues into darkness for a wide oval anteroom it's a bit oddly shaped to be a storage room it's about 20 feet wide with a 15 foot coved ceiling when he cast light it went out sure if you would like to okay things look nice and bright in here four evenly spaced pillars are holding up the ceiling each with intricate beautiful carvings at the other side of the room is a single large door the door seems to be made of heavy forged iron with carefully inlaid bronze details images of fire and lizard tongues who would like to do anything or walk around or enter what do you want to do sure go ahead so you join the others all right so who is looking around the room doing something sure make an investigation check what are you checking for traps mary and sure what languages do you speak what was your check mary abyssal you're looking at the floor specifically okay brian can you roll an investigation check okay so mary looking on the floor you do not see any tiles or anything it is smooth like poured cement seemingly no traps on the floor glancing about the room though as you step in and sort of use your light to look around-- you rolled an 18 you said you see cobwebs and grime and dust all over the place it's not a very used room but on the ceiling you do notice faint symbols covered in years of cobwebs and grime brian what did you roll okay so you cannot read any writing on these-- you're investigating the pillars you can't read any writing on them but it's okay because there's not really any there are symbols of serpents carved up and down on these pillars way nicer than they need to be and you can see from your excellent investigation skill that the eyes of the serpents have a faint glow of magic in them they are definitely trapped not yet not until you roll you definitely see the symbols on the ceiling they're all over the place many of them they appear to be writing in common they appear to be numbers lots and lots of numbers also glancing about the room you've entered now behind this pillar back here you find something heads or tails here you go all right so that is something you find the ceiling is whatever i said before 25 foot coved ceiling 25 feet high and it's covered with numbers they're all hard to make out because it's dusty okay from the other side of the door you hear a girl scream yes sure he can do whatever he wants you can also hit him over the head if you want the caverns do carry audio why don't you roll a perception check a retroactive perception check to see if you could hear that you heard him say jayne's a mailman but something about jayne has been bugging you a lot me too really if we're going to be honest so is this where you guys are standing where are you that's a door oh so she's back here but she found an object over there so she's definitely there you can tell her to go back or you can tell her to wait there but she's already there come where okay got it so you're calling her back great and frankie great so you take four points of poison damage as this pillar shoots out a bit of poison you're standing near it unfortunately cool you guys kind of get the sense that the longer you stay in here the more shit's going to start happening anyone want to look at the door okay make an investigation check great the door is not trapped however it has a lock on it a padlock a curiously made padlock where is it there are numbers on the padlock and you can definitely sense that the padlock is magically enchanted and here it is who wants to look where okay you're looking at the ceiling tons of numbers 29 seven 65 44 ten nine four-- yes there are they are all in different colors some are red some are green some are yellow some are gold some are orange the lock is a basic gray however the slot where you line up the correct numbers has a faint color on it the first two are orange the second two are green can you make a perception check it's really grimy up there you definitely get a bead on the orange numbers grab your pencil there's many orange numbers they're all across the top of the ceiling they are six one eight seven two one eight two four nine two seven one zero what is this item is it the earring it can tell you something about a person or a creature but not about a room those were the orange numbers make another perception check you can make out many of them you get the sense that if you got closer somehow you could see more the bard i don't know how he's doing okay so fine while kingston is fiddling with his wingle-- 20 you both see the green numbers very clearly through the grime dust and cobwebs are one five four nine eight one four one three two zero now i wait (laughter) sorry guys on the other side of the door you hear a low (snarling) sure make an investigation check 18 that's great yeah it is specifically designed in a way that-- it's a fragile thing i wouldn't try to hit it because it has a trigger mechanism that could fire something if struck it's got a pressure pad on it no numbers on the walls let me do the math on one pillar there's one snake on the next there's three on the next there's two on the next there's six one three two six this one has one this one has three this one has two this one has six four numbers two orange two green no sorry top to bottom she gets to know one fact about you what she has just used is a magical-- what is it called you have to pierce your ear with it little trickle of blood comes down and now she knows one fact about you and she's chosen to know your weaknesses well how about your-- let's see here make a perception check or investigation check whatever's higher upon looking at the numbers up top especially the orange ones you start to realize there's spaces between them it's six 18 seven 21 eight 24 nine 27 ten there are spaces in between come on guys it's basic arithmetic 24 oh they are absolutely as you say that one of the pillars explodes these guys mary and brian you each take five points of poison damage say that all again liam those numbers that you're looking at are orange the first two slots on the lock are orange make a perception check there are also spaces between these numbers one yeah i know right four i can't really write upside down nine eight correct 14 mary and so what's next mary and let's hear it eric what you got mary look at the slot look at the slot on the side that's where the numbers go (laughter) the lock is broken the door is open you are in this doesn't work i love it i'll do it over here it's fine okay who's going in who's going in you're going in where'd you go oh over here okay just you right mary this is what you see the room is similar in size and shape to the anteroom with a coved ceiling held up by four spectacular carved pillars two side pathways go to the right and left of the room i didn't remember that part but whatever on the far side of the room is a circular portal glowing gold and emanating a low hum and even though you are far from the warmth of the tavern this room throbs with heat as if you were walking through a recently used oven at the foot of the portal you see that man jesus i lost him i lost him there he is boom holding a struggling child she screams in pain there are scratch marks above her eye and a steady trickle of blood is pouring down half her face the man sees you enter and says it seems we all want this youngling i'm sorry surface creatures i saw her first she's needed below and you notice that behind him a large glowing portal opens up iris is open ever so slightly it's pulsing it's not open enough for a person to walk in but it's getting close what would you like to do the man dashes to you he gets right there and he attacks he rolled a one he misses but he gets another attack that's a 20 that hits let me roll ooh it's going to be bad roll a dexterity saving throw great as he attacks his human form drops away and you see a salamander standing before you he's a large ferocious lizard creature with a body of red and orange scales hard to see clearly because the intense heat they throw off blurs the air around them his head and neck are more humanoid with smoke seeping out of his eyes and ears he has a streak of black that runs from one eye all the way up and over his scalp he's so hot it's as if he's made of fire he holds a long black iron spear in one claw and a ten-foot-long tail snaps behind him his slimy black tongue darts out testing the air smelling you you have just been dealt 15 points of fire damage i don't know man you know you are you resistant to fire then you only take seven points of fire damage you are not grappled it is your turn mary you're not in the fucking room you guys are letting mary take it go to that table nine oh shit yeah he is poisoned now i really don't know how poison works but i assume he takes poison damage he does not like that very much he also doesn't like the accent he thinks it's uncouth i'm looking for poison bear with me okay poisoned creature has disadvantages on attack rolls and ability checks holy shit that's amazing well it'll be more than an hour so it's fine that's great well he's about to attack you again-- great anyone else doing

initiative okay gryf 17 jayne who else 15 to 20 anyone 15 to 20 ten to 15 who else frank is eight no-- clothesline's eight frank's seven okay salamander gets to go first i don't know how to do this for him all right he's going to use his spear to attack the bard to his right that is a big old 22 yeah sorry friend 15 damage you get pierced by this super sharp spear and it hurts real bad and also when he withdraws it from your body you suffer another two points of fire damage because it's super-heated it's almost molten iron it's so fucking hot 15 plus two and he gets to attack again he's going to go to the cat ooh that's a 19 plus a lot with his tail he whips it around-- that is a ten you are unconscious i don't know how all that works but you're unconscious and on its movement it will leave you get an attack of opportunity on it both of you yes it's going (hisses) all right so make three attacks against this thing kingston you go first are you a lore bard i think you are i think you get to cast a spell on retreat if you want or you can use a fucking sword or whatever okay go ahead that is just a spell right it's not ranged sure what is the save 14 oh he makes the save but he takes half damage so instead of 2d8 it's 1d8 oh shit i didn't roll disadvantage on those attacks great actually roll 2d8 and then take half of that great so it's eight did he make his save he made his save so he's not knocked prone but he does take eight points of damage good job guys that's thunder damage yeah okay great no you get that on retreat mary it's your turn you don't get to cast spells i believe you can only do a melee hit if someone is running away from you all right roll an attack plus whatever nope it's d20 plus-- what is it is this a finesse weapon i don't know how bows work here it says plus three plus three that goes wide and it almost hits the girl whip master what've you got can you cast a spell on retreat he's moving away from you it's not your turn no this is your attack of opportunity less than three ooh nice he does not like that it is now gryffin's turn that was just his turn in retreat okay he's hiding behind a pillar he has half cover you can move to see him all right spell dc right or is it a ranged ranged attack okay so roll a d20 add six yep that hits for sure so now roll 3d8 16 points of damage doubled to 32 is a big hit great just then-- i don't have her fuck it just then an old lady runs in the room she has a hoof print on her face she's bloody she is pissed off her arm is broken she runs in and says where's the bitch that ran me over with a horse great jayne it's your turn (laughter) oh he's looking rough oh yeah salamander is looking rough yeah it hits the pillar in front of him absolutely ricochets off now you have to solve another lock riddle you can move you can do a bonus action okay kingston you're up do something on yourself there's a dead person next to you it's all good but sure yeah go ahead here yeah you can retroactively bonus action sure in an instant you feel the life drain out of you even though you are unconscious you still feel shitty sure but now it's brian's turn and he gets to decide what to do you're using this as a bonus action it is a bonus action you can also use a real spell what are you talking about you said if you could use a cantrip that's a level one spell okay go ahead sure i've got to make a save wisdom save okay i do not make it 2d8 go ahead wait what is this this is vicious mockery okay of psychic damage and he has disadvantage on his next attack which he already had so great okay you also get your bonus action which you can use to heal-- how would you like to talk to her to cure her it's healing word you have to say a word of healing cure wounds okay that is a real spell that takes an action it's okay just do healing word bud 1d4 plus something four maybe great you've got two hit points you're alive kingston just saved you clothesline you are alive it is your turn she's prone great roll an attack that certainly hits roll 1d4 plus four double it 14 it's ten it's ten and you're not knocked prone no do it so clothesline turns around delivers a right-armed clothesline to you it hurts she kisses her bicep uses the other arm left-arm clothesline on you a four that's 22 total points of damage and you are prone the double clothesline no that's total 22 total oh that wouldn't be useful here anyway do that on a save eric it is your turn what do you want to do sure when jayne falls you see very clearly the symbol of the chained oblivion and the tattoos under her skin clearly exposed now that she's lying on the floor white skin revealed she's definitely a servant of the chained oblivion whom you are sworn to kill yes please two-handed strike go for it roll for an attack hold on let me just look at you see if you have any extra things-- okay you know what if you wanted to-- i'm just going to suggest to you that we're late in the night you might have used vow of enmity as a bonus action to give you an advantage on this attack so you could roll again you've shat on the floor it's an angry poop blinded by your hatred of the chained oblivion you can't seem to make contact with your maul and instead you swipe to the left hitting the old lady in the face killing her again that's frank's turn we're onto the salamander who is going to use half his movement to attack gryffin rolls an eight plus seven 15 okay second attack that hits that's a 20-something okay eight plus four 12 oh boy plus seven okay so it's 12 bludgeoning damage and seven fire damage okay so 12 plus two then right 14 roll a dexterity saving throw to see if you're grappled you know what it doesn't matter he's not going to grapple you he's moving the portal is fully open he grabs holly he puts one leg in that's as far as he can get i'm sorry it's one penis in he walks on 100 penises he's like a centipede-- he's like a centipene it is gryffin's turn i don't know what that is what does he do automatically it's the entangle spell i might have written this on your card hold on let me look here it is 20 foot square versus strength 14 save he makes his save you still get a bonus action sure man go for it yep do it he looks back at you and says fuck you you can't catch me and you hit him square in the face roll for damage 1d8 cold five he has ten hit points left but cold damage is doubled how do you want to-- (cheering) fuck you you can't fucking catch me yeah not only does it bisect his tongue it splits his head open all the way back to the back of his neck protruding out the back when it goes behind him your cold spear-- it's a cold spear enters the portal and instantly melts because it's so fucking hot in there his head splits in half and he falls to the side next to a frazzled and crazed holly who is looking at this with open eyes she hasn't said a word okay good as the defeated salamander lies motionless on the floor there's a brief moment of calm you look around the room just moments ago you were strangers but at the ass sailor anything is possible the girl holly finally speaks she steps forward and says thank you kind souls i know not why you have rescued me but my people will be grateful and you will be rewarded handsomely for your goodness i can sense that many of you do not trust each other please don't leave clothesline i'm not done with my speech she casts hold person on you on clothesline i ask you as one caring creature to another to put aside your differences and marvel in what you have accomplished here together as more than strangers as friends i must leave now but you will see me again and as i leave you i suggest you remember these words of advice snitches get stitches if you talk to the police try not to tell them too much for all our sakes and with that she poof disappears and suddenly in the back of the room holding jayne in his arms a gruff man constable and ten armed guards beside him enter the room and say freeze all of you hold it right there you fuckwads we caught your little albino freak trying to run away you five made quite the fucking mess upstairs you know that dead hookers burned up old
