hi mom clarota yes that's wise we follow we do follow yes oh god we're dead i'm coming with it's just a roll not great nine it's a nervous habit i'm sorry (all laugh) it's a gift i have to share with the world i also have low light vision nope not so much don't worry it's a friend we'll bring her back soon keep him busy he likes slow jams oh my god lady kima the one we're trying to find me and pike are like-- it's so great to see you you look fantastic by the way bring it in bring it in give me a hug ooh you smell a little i like it though somehow it works on you yes yes and we found a rogue one and we may team up with him-- or her-- to go back and get revenge and maybe kick some ass in the camp so welcome back great sounds like a fun time so we trot back over to the dead goblin village it's personal girl talk uh let's find out (all laugh) what am i adding to this oh 13 i'm not an insight person yeah the eyes the eyes no the helmet is what separates him from his hive mind it wouldn't help us at all can you bore two like ghost holes in how about clay question clarota strategy number one that assortment of dwarves and some of your friends and ogres over there on the other side of the chasm is that something that we need to face headlong or can we maybe surpass them trying to find k'varn or this temple that you speak of bring him so you won't be accompanying us on any adventure or and the general is in that yes yes so we have to go over we'll get there eventually but first step is this smaller force across the chasm well the general's right across the chasm i don't think he knows about me it's water and magma oh yes down below in the waters our allies - vex and uh somebody (all laugh) found some creatures under the water snatching bodies as they fell keyleth yes i forgot who went pike's beauty distracted me you shouldn't have cleaned her up so nice anyway there were some creatures down below in the waters are those anything that we could use or should we just avoid them do you need a lozenge (all laugh) it's a gnome thing all right so let's review our options shall we we can't charge there's a chasm master switch we could fly in right we can fly in death from above well we can figure out a way enough of us can turn into flying things to get you there or we could disguise ourselves somehow what so hold on-- (static) (music) there's music pike don't toy with our emotions we have we been there and we quickly retreated lake no there's no-- what there's a lake no that's rushing water that's not-- what's the best-case scenario what we come up behind them it's still gonna be a fight we can fly over them that seems like a pretty good attack point there's an ancient death thing down there i don't know man he's volunteering you or some sort of disguise distraction two hours and 17 minutes that sounds like lost or something do it smart let's go bomb them this is not just a lake there is a death monster in there if we go under the water we're dead and we'll be underwater where there's a death monster well then let's come up with a good plan and what clear thoughts they have been we can fly overhead and just lightning the shit out of it you know what-- wait wait if i may when i was there i saw the main general control all of them instantly when he was about to make a sacrifice or feed or whatever he was doing no offense he instantly had all of their command if we could somehow get to him and cut off that connection distract him influence him somehow to command them to all jump in the lake for instance that would get rid of a lot of them all at once i can get you there i can make you unseeable but not invisible i can make you a fly what's he doing touching the hat we don't even have a laboratory i assume that would make us pretty blind as well -- sunglasses (all laugh) before we build sunglasses-- but i thought we established that they don't need visual contact to influence us they just need to be able to be aware-- you may not know the answer to this i don't doubt your knowledge and wisdom but i happen to have a ring with mind shielding will that aid me in any way to burn or i can hang that big brass pot on its head so wait i just have to blind it well i happen to have a blindness spell could it still control the others though so you want me to go in there solo invisible and try to blind this thing i'm in we can all get there we can all get there what is it that's a suicide mission surgical special ops seal team six oh vex you look so tired she's so like that (all laugh) ashley let's do it wait-- (shushes) i'm gonna sing a little song to inspire a couple of my allies here if i can okay forget it just doing my vocal warmups ♫ me me me me me me me me me ♫ ♫ molto bene molto bene molto bene molto bene ♫ is

fire for you fly flea mosquito dragonfly whatever you'd like or i try to blind it with magic might i suggest one other wrinkle remember there are some dwarves being held captive we can make our way to them and release them grog we understand you want to bash some things all right is there anyone else in the party who could help us with stealth or anything okay so we gotta go into the barracks so we gotta get in and then get in how are you going to get grog over there how do we get it over there yes you can fly him right -- that we will try (all laugh) let's set down right in the middle of the
