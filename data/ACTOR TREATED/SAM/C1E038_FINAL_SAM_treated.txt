don't want to fight you if that's what you're insinuating listen i know that i've made mistakes in my life i've admitted as much before and i don't know why i'm this way i must need to do a lot of soul-searching to come up with an answer but there is a woman who i love very dearly and who i would do anything for and i'm trying to be a better person i haven't been to a whorehouse in months that's a big step for me a bit step i know that sounds callous and crude but i've tried to be a better person if you're here to fight me i'm afraid you're going to be terribly disappointed because i will just let you kill me if that's what it takes i didn't know you existed and my heart is breaking a hundred times now for not knowing it every year that you've been alive is a year i could have been a better person and known someone who could have made me a better person and i'm only sorry that i didn't know it if there's anything i can do for you from now on-- if you are truly my blood i will because among my many faults ego is certainly one of them and knowing you're part of me makes me love you even more (laughter) persuasion it won't matter 32 oh shit she's big i slowly unbutton my shirt and show her my chest and say stab me right here if you'd like and i will not resist you've earned it take me a natural one i'm sorry i'm sorry i'm so sorry that you're going through this and
