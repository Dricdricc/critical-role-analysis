the bowl is she in the bowl and we're on the edge of the bowl are we going to go into the bowl take a tumble o mighty ioun we are here to ask you for help for a great danger you might already know this but a great danger has befallen the world there is one who has come from another plane to become a god himself vecna for all we know he may already have achieved godhood but he's well on his path we're gathering the strength right now some among us have already-- the one who's making weird faces has already sworn allegiance to another god (whispering) she knows everything not to question your infinite knowledge and judgment but my stories are more of little bar room tales and silly poems to pass the time i would hardly call them epic histories of civilization i'm really powerful it's my best asset if you have faith in me i will have faith in you and trust you and your knowledge and i will try to complete any task you ask of me there's a tome that contains the incantation of what travis laura marisha and they're spectral i'm going to go try to talk to one of them hello sir do you have language can you speak can you help us find a book it contains an incantation of isolation or about the chained oblivion no chance wait before we start flying around what do we know when was this last used this book 886 years ago or whatever right 812 years ago well it's 812 p-whatever pd right so 812 years ago so we're looking for a very old book that was used by ioun who was it used by so it's some sort of a wizard's or sorcerer's tome is that the language they used before the-- so we need to find one that's not a name of a person are they dead so there's a book that says pelor on it or ioun or dawnfather hey percy are these books arranged in any order chronological name anything oh you didn't see anything when you looked interesting wait so it's like a mirror image the top and bottom what if that line is the demarcation between pre-divergence and post-divergence or something like that i can't i'm going to take a look but i'm going to pull out my ioun stone and clutch it in my hand and close my eyes and pray on it for a second hope that guides me in some way religion check okay well that's terrible i don't have luck i can inspire myself i will inspire myself with a little song (singing) scanlancito he's got tiny feet-oh but he likes to cast spells he does it with his beat-oh when you go to sleep-oh better check your sheet-ohs because after he eats-ohs he likes to take a shit-oh (laughter) that's a 12 so that brings it up to 21 okay whoa on behalf of the mistress ioun i speak in her name and i'll hold up the stone well she tasked me it's not a lie she tasked me with this we seek a book we would love some help and it contains the incantation of isolation maybe about 812 years old-ish maybe 813 i have to sing it oh okay i pull out a sword (sword unsheathing) okay (singing) just take a look it's in a book the scanlan rainbow i can read anything (singing) i sing to you in desperation i'm looking for a tome of isolation we need to find a tome so we can go home and kill a guy named vecna it would really make us nothing rhymes with vecna 29 (yells) what it's a library keep quiet i don't know my history 23 okay i'm just going to keep talking i guess (rapping) the book we're looking for is fraught with insanity it dates back to the time of calamity it's about a guy with oblivion chains you know his name (laughter) okay sprigg i got it (singing) if we don't act soon vecna might just wreck ya (speaking) i got it in there for you oh yeah wait what (whispers) oh my god (singing) the book is eight centuries old or so i'm told it's fraught with mystery it's teeming with history so please listen to me and don't kiss me because i really need this book right now no 22 i will do one more i hope it works i'll recite a poem this little gnomey went to the heavens this little gnomey wants to go home this little gnomey is looking for a book this little gnomey is trusting ioun this little gnomey wants to go wee-wee-wee-wee all the way to this tome (cheering) natural 20 (cheering) oh (singing) can you open it up wait they can pick books i'm going to inspire her (singing) i'm so vain i probably think this song is about me i'm so vain wow it was the inspiration there are dcs up to 30 sure i'll blacklight it i'm going to quickly scan the books to see if any of them look particularly old not much gnome marquesian and common and then what how many minutes are left and how far are we from our friends we could take them all back and see if anyone can read the one that has nothing on the binding can i open that and flip through real quick this is the thing i do not okay sure sure i'll sing to a book matt (singing) read to me of times gone by can it be you're here when a bunch of gods died (speaking) okay that's all i got don't tell anyone i sang to a book let's get back are you sure hold it upside down i'm going to listen to it 13 plus five 18 plus jack of all trades 21 what spell i don't want to hurt it okay i'll place mythcarver on it i don't know what to cast on a book i'll cast friends on it sure not good strength ten write in the book no i've never watched harry potter i must have a quill right i'm a storyteller okay i'll pull out my quill jesus while we're flying this seems like a bad idea this is a bad idea no how about when we land no it absorbed the spell and seemed to like it but nothing happened i have the ioun stone but it doesn't do anything oh that's 17 i'll try to cast a more powerful spell into it without hurting it though that's the thing if i do lightning what if it burns the fucking book i'll do thunderwave on it right yeah i'll dominate monster that's a super high-level spell eight i don't know what language is it it's a notebook it's somebody who was figuring this out as they were writing it yes i have a beautiful mind (laughter) do i see any words that say isolation or incantation or anything i like to read things and really understand it's a cookbook yeah let's go down to her bowl all right so let's go down into the bowl and wait for her to arrive i heard when you yelled it it was the neck ma that i couldn't come up with a way-- i wish you would have been chosen by ioun i casually blow the hair out of my face and walk over to her and say o mighty goddess it was a challenging challenge but i think you'll be pretty happy with the results as i hold up the book i'll cast wrist pocket and make it disappear oh god oh it's gone just kidding and it's back this is what we've found for you i hope it pleases you you know we didn't actually look at the other ten books yes with conviction i firmly believe that this is the correct book can i still see the writing i'll cherish it always is it cool or is it gross travis and chicks will dig okay i gain plus two to my intelligence whoa as a bonus action i can channel the omniscience of ioun for one hour whenever you successfully hit a creature with a spell or attack you can learn one of the creature's stats of your choice from the following list ac senses saving throw bonuses damage resistances damage immunities damage vulnerabilities during this hour you also have advantage on initiative rolls and on saving throws once this ability is used it cannot be used again for a week okay just one the tome as an action i can expend a spell slot of any level higher than three thank you travis the cover and the pages glow of secret text of the rites of prime banishment while legible you can spend an action to invoke the rites of banishment against the target the target must make a wisdom saving throw on a failure the target is banished and sealed and this book is immediately teleported to the endless atheneeum on a success the text becomes blurred until the end of your next turn on a success on a failure of their saving throw right yeah got it then after that turn i can read it again dc ten a wisdom saving throw-- oh that's key info plus five to dc for each divine trammel fused to the target we've got to be matadors and attach a bunch of pegs to the thing before we deliver the killing blow we'll be picadors right they put the darts on the back of the bull to soften it up and (whoosh) killing blow no i think we're done here guys yes so many i don't think what are the odds right different sword me thank you sprigg for everything we've only known you a short time-- no you've taught us much in a short time and i'm sorry that we broke your house but it seems like

kill the assassin guy that we were going to ask who are you whispers you know what guys i didn't know that this was ever a thing we've thrown out so many cool ideas on that text thread i get asked for personal quotes all the time right now i don't think so raven queen or the mansion sure probably us do you want me to disguise you take this hat-- fuck all right i'll cast seeming on you on all of us because i can blue and a foot smaller like blue man group black clothes blue face bald i think he's dead i think he died in there he's undead isn't he he's a zombie (whispering) he can breathe blood

ticking time clock blockbuster errol's video you're still blue and you still look like blue man group so do you want me to go with you so that i can undo that when we get there or do you want to talk to him blue but when you talk to groon do you want to be blue so i'll come with you am i making a mansion for the rest of you all right mansion enjoy yourselves i'll don the hat so i turn into the meat man so that no one can recognize me i think he's a little bigger (meat man voice) the sword of kas yes the thought did occur to me yes but there are big differences well ioun did not talk about a talking sword for one do you think we should go get it to make sure we should have asked for some sort of identifying feature she said do you have any more questions you want to go visit craven edge i held the sword once i have a thing for craven edge as well intelligence check 11 eight plus two plus one is 11 i mean do i get to add my jack of all trades 14 it was a very powerful sword but perhaps

can we come in i am a legitimate businessman for business dealings i shouldn't have said anything (laughter) if you ever need any antique furniture or decor ask for the meat man he get you good deal
