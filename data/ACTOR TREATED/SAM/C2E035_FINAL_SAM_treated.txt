amazing studio which has amazing equipment and after effects and editing suites and cool special effects so we put together a really cool ad for them using all the equipment and if you guys would turn to the monitor and see what we made hi guys as you know we love d&d beyond it's easy to use the interface is super high tech since their sponsorship helps us make this show we thought we'd use all the cutting edge editing software in our fabulous new studio to make d&d beyond a mind-blowing special effects ad (explosions) explosions i assume for instance look at my face looks normal now right but when we add high tech cgi effects oh i look like a beholder roar antimagic cone d&d beyond okay reset now check out this awesome face swapping feature okay right now i look like sam riegel but now
