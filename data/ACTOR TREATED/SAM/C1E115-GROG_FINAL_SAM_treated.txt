in honor of marvel puzzle quest sponsoring this episode we actually had grog write the advertising copy it starts like this i am grog i smash things and people sometimes i use a hammer much like another big man named thor thor is not a goliath but he is strong almost as strong as grog i like thor because his name is easy to say thor is on a quest to a place called marvel puzzle this marvel puzzle quest must be magic because it happens only on telly-phones and inty-nets you have to press buttons to rage that's the dumbest thing i've ever heard inspired by thor's rock he calls it ragnarock the sakaar arena event is going on where you team up with thor in 20-person lightning rounds for prizes grog would not have to team up with anyone to win in any arena because grog is already the champion named philip you can load-down this marvel puzzle quest for free that means no gold vax-- vex fuck you can download it at the apple store i like apples google play i like to play or the amazon app store i like amazons or steam i don't like steam it is angry water and it makes my face hurt also ale the end pike wrote it down my voice acting is good that would be amazing wearing all

character has a different accent than scanlan does well i know but i want to get into it right right then we did a really good job in the fight today so i think that we should all propose a toast to

that's all right can i just do that i normally just do that all right i'm going to go invisible and i'm going to try to swipe the spear before she gets to it okay seven plus-- ten so it's ten this many oh shite i dropped the spear he's so good at this though i feel like we should keep supporting this he's never been good at anything intellectual and now this is it so maybe we should support him and go with it sorry really quickly into my earring i say she's got a baby with her i don't know just thought you might like to know you don't do that that you became part druid just yes and vax yes

float it back in and i present it in front of the barkeep and say bob your cask awaits this would be a good opportunity for you all to get some xp i call it bigby's hand oh i call it bigby's hand because a man named bigby invented it i don't know anything about this bigby i learned it from another bard a long time ago it was a he he was actually a stand-up comedian that was his thing yeah oh

to step forward and call to the beast beast look in my eyes and follow my commands and i will cast dominate monster on the beast he has to roll a wisdom save against 22 i command you beast to attack

switch with me percy oh the de rolo what are you drinking piss what is that oh that's a lot of apple juice i don't think i've drank that much apple juice since i was eight grog what is with your voice what are you talking about my room i'm going in to investigate my room one i'll open the trunk (yelling) a pseudopod attacks me 16 points of damage nor cast a spell unless i have a spell that does not need a vocal thing let me just check let's see here sure carry on-- yes i'm trying to figure out did travis find these things and put them in the room or did he think what can i put in a room i'll go through the monster manual and be like ooh a rug and put that in there what else can i put in a room ooh a plant but i can't talk we're not going to mega-game sure servants come on now 13 should i escape or should i kill it i don't know i will step back and i will lightning bolt it at level five i will lightning bolt it at level five he has to make a dex save i think it's a dex save oh boy it's probably either 15 or it's my spell dc if it's my spell dc i wouldn't have the cone up so it would be 20 well either way he fails so he gets 10d6 of damage how many is that that's nine 39 oh and one more 43 i inspect the vial i chug it what is that four something everyone all the rooms have horrible creatures in them be careful how many do you have that is good to know actually seems like mine's open too i'm going to turn into a dung beetle and fly straight up it's solid i thought it had bars i thought it had bars then i'm back out as a gnome and i guess i'm falling more damage all right shit all right now i will turn into a monkey a gibbon big enough that it has muscles i crawl up to the top and try to push open the latch natural 20 sam and i shit on the latch and keep going that's a circle just like the last one except for one who would have been the star wait are there walls separating us did he ruin your designer pepper mill you looked these up last night you had to look these up i rolled one 20 20 one my last three rolls i did 4d4 plus four is that right for a greater healing potion go home unicorn you already cast speak with animals today bring it that hits oh yeah i'm no longer a monkey yeah that hits scanlan has an ac of 14 great i'm still double digits (muttering) challenge rating am i in its-- all right i'm contractually required to turn into a triceratops yeah this unicorn oh before i did that i healing worded myself for like ten points of health there as a bonus and now i am a triceratops and i will use the rest of my turn to back into the corner yeah that's it thank you i'm looking up all my stats i haven't been a triceratops in over a year one more time just not trying to kill you you got it wrong we are missing a piece that hits hits whoa great a little bit without leaving his attack range and thus not provoking an attack of opportunity i hope i'm going to charge for his leg and hit it with a gore attack so i'm going to move down the line and attack his leg rolling a two plus nine end of turn wait five feet teleport what spell is that why aren't you killing the unicorn please tell me she falls on the horn like free willy (screech) wait you have to roll to hit hits okay back to scanlan meanwhile me and laura still haven't dealt any damage to ours at all put scanlan back on there as a bonus action i will 2nd-level healing word myself need to do that that's seven plus six oh that's 13 points that helped and i will just step back a little not a lot then i will cast reverse gravity and send him skyward (laughter) does it hurt him to hit the top he would actually technically not fall he just stays there he stays there for a minute so that's ten rounds of damage what do they look like any clothing that we recognize i'll come look seven perception i'm going to inspire the bear i'm going to inspire the bear by feeding it meat go on trinket smell real well tonight trinket and i will actually inspire the bear oh no does anyone know cp-bear i don't what's happened to your bear something's wrong with him i think you've done that already today i-- (laughs) (wheezing) i don't know i mean maybe it was something else maybe it was the unicorn it was the unicorn's powerful magic deception check 33 you can beat my deception you can roll against it right what's the dc i rolled a 15 but it's minus two but it's still 13 i don't know what happened with your bear you know i found that meat back there maybe it was poison or something but i wouldn't know from poison i'm a simple pauper seemed hungry climb first i'm going to bonus healing word myself again is this an acrobatics check athletics check i will inspire myself ooh that's four plus three plus four i've essentially undone my heal insight check nine four six nine and-- we did the same thing what you did why are we fighting each other or are we just fighting you ten scanlan what do i do i will bonus action heal myself again consistently healing myself good yeah sure all right that's something are we trying to kill grog all right i will cast bigby's hand at 6th-level and i will punch grog it's 10d6 and it just hits because you're restrained i think it's d6s right it's either 6d8 or 10d6 let me look it up real fast bigby's hand (muttering) clenched fist it's 6d8 i need d8 all right that's it 6d8 that's what i did 24 yes it doesn't automatically crit or anything right and then i will back away slowly maybe speak to him in unicorn language he dies too is grog dead what has the story taught us no it actually taught us that in the end we have to kill grog before the sun rises i cast wish that trish has persistent gonorrhea forever i think i do have to roll something 17 (laughter) wow wait because that was the end of bunions and flagons we're still in character cathew verser all right we'll look out for him i think bard gnomes are not that good i think next time i'm going to be a ranger i have 300 xp ale i call a servant over and i say bring him some chicken you had the perfect amount go to bitly/marvelcrit and make sure that they know that you came from critical role they're not those one-sided scarves that was the worst delivery of that
