time you use it maybe it will have a purpose (laughter) i will message caleb with my little wire and say do you think we should stop you can reply to this message we lost him i think he would have been happy that you got to say goodbye but we should keep going yep that's what this game is about now travis we have to bring ophelia to the gentleman right oh i did the math between all the platinum and gold that we found we should each get 163 gold pieces yes including yasha who i assume took her share you're part of this as well we took a bunch of your gold we took 70 gold we took some of molly's gold 163 gold i just broke it down into gold who cares matt did we find a bank to break change on the way okay do we remember the code to get in what is it you say like i need a drink yeah what is it i am here to help maybe ophelia knows ophelia do you know the secret code it worked that's the tree place right also mr gentleman sir we didn't catch you at a bad time did we it seems that you just stepped out of the shower or something should we come back after you've dried yourself off and made yourself presentable times five i think your math is off what is this a tip that is very honorable mr clay this is money and you can use it to by things like goods or services oh you know like tailoring services yeah so are the four things to make a set of seven ooh secrets hey laura how do you like the new layout of the d&d beyond app i don't think you've used it yet wow oh yes oh boy (pigeon cooing) oh yes thank you it's from a cow could be a goat maybe just have some tea they might have tea do you have tea (forced) ha yeah (forced laughter) it's a good one i've been working on it well we'll just have some whiskey then try it mr clay it's from the earth though they made it from grains they take wheat and barley and stuff and then they mash it up and let sit outside-- they let it decompose a little bit that's how you do it you take some mash it together put it in a barrel let's have a shot oh yes very much the earth is calling you to her we can leave right he's making fun of your name of course what okay have you not thrown up yet you will it's a lot of weight you don't have to drink it-- have you ever had liquor oh well what happened that's it i don't think-- no she's never drunk why not it is very good is there a reason why you won't drink are you afraid wow that's intense they're huge he's very drunk must be drunk the tortle ionos did you notice the gentleman's face when you mentioned that name he looked over at ophelia it was very suspicious no you have to pick up on the subtleties of the human expression to get this stuff jester and i saw it it was definitely suspicious he did very good caleb it's a tell is what it is i think i'll go mention it to the gentleman in passing is he still in the bar let's get out of this place that's an island no i don't think that would do it okay i'm going to stumble over to the gentleman and say i think we're going to head out now but if you need us we'll probably be at the leaky tap or something sure sure we've been summoned by this person named evantica so we're probably going to go find-- okay you don't know where she is in town or he i'm not really sure okay cool cool cool well off we go oh jester don't forget we're going to talk about the captain later yeah i couldn't focus because there was so much dripping going on it's a mask of water it's disgusting no no all right let's get the fuck out of here oh (vocalizing) my whole body starts glowing with the light you set me on fire do we tell you now or later money-wise we each get 964 more gold 964 each
