days i agree but let's say it does do we know what we're doing with regards to draconia when we come back do we have some sort of a plan we're getting a beast that's all we know what constitutes a beast because me and keyleth can make some beasts like a triceratops what is that for me ooh a 19 plus two is it a gargantuan monster and it was bored with that and how are we going to get this creature there on the continent what continent the draconian continent so we have to go back there to search all right this is slightly a better plan than i thought then we should go talk to the slayer's take now so they can get started on this hunt a letter who's the letter carrier and how's he going to get out of this city that's protected by an invisible wall no we're talking about convincing a dragon to go fight this dragon that would clearly kill it wait is there anyone else who can make this message delivery faster or safer no but faster and safer all right strapping boys yeah and they were working on it already weren't they i think it's done it's an incredibly important mission the slayer's take if i recall doesn't do things for free we're going to have to pay for this even though we're members we take a contract on an existing creature that we have to somehow find in draconia how not transcontinentally no we're not talking about sacrificing a dragon we're talking about finding a beast what do we got to offer i have a tome of leadership worth 30000 gold we'll get it back before 100 years are up a 99-year lease that's provided we kill it if we lose they get nothing i'm just saying from their perspective we're offering them literally nothing i see this going on and i stand up on something and i yell to the students-- i jump up on a chair and i yell to the students instructor kashaw has instructed us that this is a drill you are to attack that man right there that large man as a test of your strength and training now 34 (laughter) i try he wasn't going to kill-- were you going to kill them grog oh shit so wait what is in this letter what are we offering them and to clarify for me we're asking them-- but wait travis and asking them to help us
