claudrica piterca dominocos and bob-- would always play checkers but ebenezer was fascinated by the box they came in in fact he was obsessed with boxes did he wear briefs no boxers he traded in his backpack for a backbox he wouldn't eat jelly from jars he scooped it out of a large pine jelly box dick-in-a-box he invented that in 1930 and in 1937 he packed up everything that was special to him-- one shirt one sticker one comic book and one toy-- placed them in a crate and set off for college one day later he was expelled from college because he did not own pants but he had a vision a revolutionary idea before people had boxes and people had cool stuff but he dared to put the cool stuff inside the boxes he named his company lootacrata in america we bastardize it as loot crate but

nights read many books about adventure-- -- exploration magic alchemy-- i mean you know my family runs a very prosperous business and yes i have received some benefits from that but i am a self-starter in my own mind and-- i've gone out on my own to seek my fortune-- -- and record my exploits i purchased it myself with my money that-- -- that i can withdraw once a month (all laugh) but

for allowing me to travel with you and perhaps go on a mission i mean is this mission going to start at some point i'm sorry i not to be a pest but-- i paid for adventure okay i understand understood and happy to be one yeah that makes total sense oh yes doty he does what i tell him to do i would say so doty has been in a battle doty that may be because in battle i am deft fearless no deft with a t i can dodge blows uncannily i can anticipate what my opponent is going to do ahead of time and dodge out of the way yes i think i am no he's a mechanical construct that i made he did not-- doty did not raise me he is a mechanical construct that i built when i learned how he does not cook he could clean i--- no he's cold as ice well i'm 28 now so that would have been 27 he's a year old nope he doesn't talk to me he's the best really fearless strong big and excellent penmanship he's everything i could hope for in a friend silent i mean no i don't think i ever had a penpal i had tutors i had the best teachers i had-- laura and --wonderful no no don't 'aww' they were wonderfully smart and engaging but my best friends were the books i read they're still alive there's no were they are wonderful people my father-- (sighs) my father is a very talented businessman he can be hard at times he has great expectations for everyone he meets my mother is a saint she's perfect in every way she's a wonderful person and yes no they are eagerly awaiting me to arrive back at home and tell them tales of my journeys and adventures he is a businessman  no not at all it's just i'm not sure how well versed you are in financial transactions he is in real estate he buys and sells properties charges rent taxes he owns a lot of things places and makes a lot of money off of these places i will be forthcoming with anything that you ask me i have nothing to hide i come from money this is clear taryon darrington nice to meet you be pleased you're welcome anderson you have his name holy bajoly i didn't know that he had a name i'm sorry there's no kerfuffle on the list-- --but we are going to have an adventure is that right at some point all right so far we've delivered a dead body part to someone and had a brief conversation with a guard is this what you all are about all right are you speaking metaphorically all right i don't know what you're talking about i all right yes oh well maybe i should pay him to take me on an adventure because jesus christ this is about as fucking boring as i can get no really it's on my list it's literally on my list all right all right all right finally getting my money's worth it's taryon doty cool doty take this down as the tree split in front of me-- ahhh oh my oh my gods where are we what's going on  what happened where am i is this a fantasy world what happened ahh wow that was exhilarating it's like my body fell apart and came back together again it was amazing i felt a great force behind me pushing me forward and then all of a sudden i opened my eyes and was in a new place doty take this down today is the greatest day of taryon darrington's life the day that he experienced the wonder of the gods that's enough for now it's amazing yes quaint really tourists must love it here i literally know nothing about this city i paid for adventure all right doty four-eyes shall i trust jumbo here because he seems a bit shady i will roll an insight check what do i add to it oh yeah that i have forgotten how to play dungeons and dragons 18 go on what's going on out here for what doty he's right behind me as he always is what's going to happen that's the best thing you've ever said marisha of course i've played boulder paper shears one two three-- fuck i'm dead i will be dead doty is going to use his reaction to attack vax right because when attacked within five feet of me he gets to react to defend me or to attack 86 to me great great (pained grunt) this is the sound that i make (high pitched goat-like yelps) (all laugh) do i get a shot wait you guys are all doing this to me eight (choking noise) you shouldn't bother it's over (muffled scream) (gasping for breath) (whimpers) (gasps loudly) (high-pitched) what who said that why is the wind blowing hands shaking body quivering blood everywhere (all laugh) i-- i shit well grog gets an attack but i'm going to-- oh i'm going to counter clockwise around doty all the way round yeah yeah all the way round yeah so i'm facing grog and the others in a sort of a cone pattern and i fumble i'm fumbling on the helmet trying to find the right gem to pull out and i pull out a diamond and i pluck it out of the helmet and i go (screams) and i will cast prismatic spray oh on me the helm is 18 wow wow guys do i roll do you roll maybe you should roll oh okay 10d6 what

can't do any of this i'm sorry i'm not a real adventurer that was a story i told you i know it was very convincing but i haven't been on any real adventures ever and-- i know that you thought that i was an adventurer i know that you all look at me and you just see the armor and the handsomeness-- --and the bravado and you think he has it all he has everything that we want but it's a lie it's a ruse i can i be real with you guys (tearfully) my sister's gonna get everything all the money the whole business the compound the villas everything he's giving it to my sister unless i prove myself all right i just came out here to prove myself to my old man and i know that if i do he will respect me finally and he will give me my money and my trust fund and he will give me my villa and i will be the guy who takes over the business and i just-- i thought that i could but i can't and i neeeed to (all laugh) i need to i need to he doesn't like me and he doesn't like the books i read and he doesn't like that i like fantasy novels and he doesn't like anything about me (yelps) i can be like an apprentice or an intern you guys are so powerful and i'm not really no only when i go to sleep at night (all laugh) no i'm brave and strong no i don't drink beer yes really because the stuff we had in ank'harel was really gross i didn't wanna say anything but-- it was really gross it had no terroir no i don't have any wine doty doty no why just pause for now doty is my best friend my only friend because he listens to me and understands me and at night when i play my characters he plays with me i play combat and i pretend to be some of the characters i've read about and he pretends to be the others no i want to be a hero and i just haven't had the chance yet because my father says that i should just be focused on taking over the family business learning financial things and learning how to shake down a customer and i'm so much more than that tell me one do they write books about philanthropists but the stories i've read of adventure and derring-do and bravery-- much cooler jumbo gets it he could have me or any of you killed which is very much okay but how will i survive in battle oh i do i do they look very powerful something about your eyes make me feel ashamed i'm sorry please don't you do all right let's go get drunk then taliesin and i understand i haven't really experienced loss of that type before i mean but i want to understand and i thank you for your honesty with me and for not holding back did i at least cause you some harm in the battle that's good right all right it was really great it was really great thank you thank you all i'm sorry for deceiving you before and i promise to do better and to aid you in whatever way i can please teach me your ways and i will learn what i can for heaven's sake yes i did please no no i no-- all right i hang back just a little bit to collect myself just try to dry my eyes and i say to doty doty just delete most of that last chapter-- -- and take this down the battle a draw taryon decided it was better to lie than tell the truth and embarked on a new adventure pretending to be their humble intern when in actuality they were working for him end of chapter that's exactly what they're planning on doing they just said that they're taking me to hell or something like that was that your girlfriend jumbo was that your girlfriend oh sorry i don't-- i'm just trying to catch up i'll-- my hand my hand please don't kill me he's really a rotten guy (sighs) he does these unfair deals-- nobody knows about them but me and i tried to tell him to play on the up and up but he's just a liar and a cheat oh thank you month month and a half i hired a band of mercenaries to assist me for the first month no they left me (all laugh) truth yes it is taryon gary darrington (all laugh) yes he is she's the fucking worst yes she's so-- she's such a jock she just does push-ups and sit-ups and pull-ups all day and all night and beats on me she's younger than me but she's so much stronger her name is-- i wrote this down (ugly cries) (all laugh) mary-anne darrington my father howard-- -- and my mom maria younger no she's not a married marion (all laugh) she's all focused on the business and taking it over when dad's ready to retire yes yes i learned so much i was left to my own devices for hours on end i traveled the world in literature and i experienced such great adventures tales of history and fiction and-- for most of my life i was just a happy-go-lucky kid in my room reading my books and making up characters that i would fight against and only recently have things gotten pretty bad with dad since i am now of age to take over the business and uh-- well he's getting up in years wants to retire to the southern villa it's less about strength and more about a cutthroat attitude take no prisoners hold back nothing pull no punches to be honest he doesn't take me along with him to many business deals but he has great influence over many places and cities and important people and i don't exactly know the ins and outs of the business-- no i mean we had a grandfather so i-- i mean i think he's not really a bastard i think i don't know what do you mean (all laugh) he has a father i think so they were around a lot he's an asshole howard no you're all literate you can read and write wow i haven't met many of you in my travels that have-- that's amazing really oh perhaps we can compare books later this guy-- this excites me really that piece of equipment you showed to that weirdo earlier today-- the thing with the handle did you make that what does that-- what does that do that is-- sexy it's very sexy wow and did you make this by yourself wow is the propellant part of this piece right here or is it in that big piece right there or is it magical oh wow that's impressive oh you know what i'm sorry one second i forgot i owe you some money don't i the adventure was 50 thousand correct i think i had a good adventure today but i didn't die so minus the prismatic spray that's 6000 gold taken off minus the wear and tear on my armor and equipment that's another 5000 taken off minus the fact that i wasn't the star of the adventure i'll halve the rest of it do you have a tax id or some sort of tax-exempt status i'm just trying to find out how much i actually owe you i am a man of business and i always follow the law so by my calculations 20% federal taxes 95% local and city taxes i put that at about 11000 gold total left still doty write a check of course how is she tax-exempt make it 16 my father will pay that in full go on and reach in there nope is he holding any equipment or weapons okay fire and i set his weapon on fire it's cool though right no no
