we're going to just keep going towards the town like designed by man he doesn't know the-- wait should we-- those are bad guys right we should not go that way we could stealth through it we could invisible through it i have some invisibility not great though what kind are we a mile away a thousand feet away what does that even mean i don't speak your language it would block their view of us maybe perhaps that would keep them in their fortress i put on my climbing gear which i definitely own and it was the same (laughs) what am i doing adding what athletics 11 disadvantage of course it's an honor system 17 they could be dead in there (sings) there are giants in the sky you want me to go in you're going to bird in they're going to see you fly in it doesn't matter they're still gonna

investigating i pull a david caruso and say it looks like these giants had big trouble (all laugh) kill them all don't worry we still have the element of surprise oh wait no we don't there's the city shall we storm it maps don't just don't this is the castle this is the town so knowledgeable percy to the town or to the castle watch from afar what's that going to tell us or both it could be all vampires or it could be a totally normal town how far away are we is it nighttime oh that's scary we're just hiding in the trees we're not going in to investigate how long would it take to get into the town from where we are ew we'll get there at night that's all right though it's early evening vax can i ride you into town well hello lady yeah i guess i could fly whatever you're into baby (laughs) i've become austin powers what about this i'll make us both invisible and you fly us in looking up to an hour ooh and it takes two hours just to get there how long can you be polymorphed for forever concentration okay so you fly us in and i'll invisibility us right as we get to the gates except for trinket who can't climb up you have to roll for trinket if she was a little older tiberius would kill her (all laugh) yes oh shit can i do one of these damn it ooh no problem you want to set me down so i can go talk to people well or at least eavesdrop we don't know if they're all vampires or not i'm just going to walk down there i won't be able to see you so i'm going to leave a little-- i leave a little like a canteen or something right where she's perched just so i know where to find her yeah my stein and then i'm going to walk down and see if i can stealthily eavesdrop on some conversations oh shit am i going to fall athletics 17 it took me 12 minutes to climb 25 feet nice i suck oh shit i have to do this quick he's doing walla (all laugh) wait wasn't that one of the people-- okay i'm going to hustle back to the roof jesus eight (all laugh) no it's nine i want to spend the night here no i will sneak around the corner a little bit wait for an opening and i lose invisibility which will drop it on her as well and i will dimension door back up to the roof grab the canteen oh shit invisibility again sky sentinel what does that mean every time you use it or is at a one-time-- thunder i don't know (imitating clarota) i'm on your head what if we fall out before we slumber we did a little intel a little recon turns out the town is full of humans except for these six vampire giants-- zombie giants however this could be useful everyone in the town the farmers anyway seem to be gathering produce to deliver to the briarwoods we could pose as some sort of farmer troupe with a basket of goodies and maybe get through the front gate we could make ourselves look like some of them one of us has a hat of disguise what oh yes this it's really lovely i don't know maybe it gets sun that's a lovely story and now it's being used as a-- who that why would they make camp in the place where the god of the sun-- are any of us religious with that god or-- i can at least see what she is up to what would that do we're not religious people we can't summon the gods willy-nilly i'm sorry we can do all of those things yes let's go in the middle of the vampire-infested town and do some arbory to try to heal the tree and then we'll just say oh sun god please rain down sun here that's a great plan we could won't they know we're here won't the people see us doing things that's true but we still have to get in i know i know are you sure you don't want me to be a carriage driver and you'll hide in the hay of my carriage and i'll go straight up to the briarwoods i will put on my hat of disguise i will be someone completely different so while he was transparent they saw through him i'm not talking about getting past the briarwoods i'm talking about getting past the guards that guard their castle but then what once the tree is healed we have no one of religious power to summon any god we don't know anything about this god none of us do me i am the antithesis of faith and then what we're going to fight off a million monsters to heal a tree and then we're going to say okay bring out the sun or something does it involve healing the tree we're going to be insurgents i kind of love this make a pipe bomb like a mark like our mark like our mark the resistance i need a beret (all laugh) can i do a quick scry back to the poo jar that i left back in our kitchen just to make sure that our home base is okay so they're fine so i knock that one off and i'll try for pike they wiped my poo away which some could argue is magical in its own right only one way to find out sure sure i could get in shit in their bedroom and leave oh yeah that too pull the pin (all laugh) yes and then we'd have eyes in there i like this a lot give me something to eat i need some fuel sweet potato that's good yes some prunes wait so that we can be townspeople right we're setting up shop percy is known here but they're not on sentry duty we also have the hat his hat of disguise percy knows this town perhaps percy should wear the hat just a few minutes i think yes you had it from the dinner party before we go marching in there finding an abode to live in is not going to be too difficult we'll need food yes we might be there for days and days we also have to go around town and forgive me if i'm going too far with your plan here but aren't we trying to win allies among the people but we'll need to communicate with them how (sighs) all right wait we're just going to walk into the city okay beard check grog i've heard that no one in this town wears a beard i rub dirt all over my face you should try to look less handsome okay we've got pass without a trace so 28 we're all going together what's illusion magic sure all right i will cast seeming on us we'll all look like dirty-- -- dirty ragged peasants can i just say this can we just leave trinket behind-- i don't want to walk in there with a bear i think i can only make us all look the same oh wait no you can give each target a new appearance so i can make everyone look a little different okay he's a milk cow all right donkey he's an ass i make myself look like a weird hunchback sort of not all there we're not gonna live in a cemetery that's super creepy we're trying to shoot for here you speak giant grog oh we're gonna walk by the tree nine wait what is that us they killed people they thought were us or they killed-- or it's a message to us oh shit you mean in town of course they are holy shit body of my guy is he sort of handsome oh it was a child oh god a week that's before we set out they assumed we would come but they don't know that we're here this was a week ago this was before we were even close let's go find a building 30 feet what about 150 maybe underground stuff are you guys going in wait not now not now let's find a place first yes i'm gonna look for a brothel (all laugh) ooh or to drink i can make her invisible if she can talk to the tree i can make her invisible we can burrow under we can-- -- find something closer well there are windows on the first floor right i'm gonna just find some old rags or anything i can find tablecloths and just cover the windows true we use the wine maybe there's a simpler way speak with plants i can go to one of the wells and get some water oh no dead you can do that you can bring dead things back what this i gotta see yeah liam laura and is it going to be loud i'm going to get provisions ready to spoon-feed her not a lot this is great this is awesome wait forever 2d12 what the fuck is a d12 i've never rolled a d12 why don't we do that right before we go see the briarwoods also because that is fucking awesome the tikka masala was tangy we're not starting any fight we're forming an insurgency wow and the tree was happy but not really the what wait maybe the decimal place was wrong
