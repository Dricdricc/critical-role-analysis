don't see it because we're on deck right shark argument yeah what's the layout of the beach is it just a beach is there a half-submerged statue of liberty or anything i got a 16 for my perception what do we do we've got to get-- someone's going in yeah man go in light a fire let's just light a fire and throw it in there yeah let's just toss a torch yeah we've never shied away from a confrontation before indeed if only we had someone who could go under the ground and be one with the earth and pop up in there and look around-- no yeah but she'll be fine oh hello oh okay yeah let's send in one person i'm going to inspire her with a little dolphin dance or something whatever that is i don't know i'm just going to-- maybe they're friendly show the people at home wait is she back thanks ti but

plan something is there a portal or something 16 i don't think we should camp here clarota is this a possible thing that we should maybe shut down could k'varn send his allies through here yeah that's a good idea i put a little cologne on the page yeah but it's always a nice gesture phone a friend or at least is related to the kin from the other side of the veil i speak clarota while this is going on i go near lady kima and i start humming i'm going to cast suggestion on her or try to i'm just going to say (singing) gnome makes you want to check out grog's bod gnome makes you want to check out his bod and sweat him so hard yeah and that's the part i need for shitting on beds so i apologize i apologize i'm sorry i do call it my antic but yes you're right i'm sorry that was disrespectful i apologize i tried man come on i'm your wingman thank you vax i don't think so grog wow we get one of those every two episodes (all laugh) or sweatshirts oh you haven't heard of scanlan shorthalt well gird your loins ladies because he has his eye on you a talented musician master of disguise and dashingly handsome in his own mind scanlan sings songs almost as much as he sings his own praises born a poor gnome scanlan used his endless charm and soaring tenor voice to croon for coin and support his single mother one day he was discovered by a half-orc promoter and joined dr dranzel's spectacular traveling troupe where he learned the ways of the world and honed his skills as a bard extraordinaire a loner much of his life scanlan has never quite come to terms with the violent death of his mother at the hands of a goblin invasion while his years on the road provided many shall we say educational experiences with the opposite sex-- it's going to be tight you know what just buy them and then return them after the show's over (all laugh) we'll take it wait did we sleep may i see this (sniffs) hmm draconiar noir (all laugh) are we in the cavern no we're on the beach right oh thank god let's sleep where do you want to go then let's get out of here why don't we go to the island and see if we can make camp what what's wrong what are you doing oh okay would that help at all she can do it again tomorrow true that's a good impression all right so i'll sing to inspire her scry scry miss keyleth scry put your eyeballs to the k'varn and tell us why all right no that's it yes you get happiness oh shit oh god a beholder what's that big bad scary thing just hold on wait patience yes what does it do so it could burn the metal we could try to just draw him out somehow why don't you wait on that to help us later the world down here but we don't have corruption oh i can mock that took months months well let's take kima's advice and maybe start with a little reconnaissance we'll get closer we'll rest for the night and maybe send in a snooping party wasn't the point of us going to these beaches to try to see if there was any other advantage we could find all right i don't think i can do that i can banish a being but not a beam should we go to one more beach before we all die because it'll be that much closer tomorrow we can do reconnaissance from there we still have to get across this body of water you said there's something swimming down there oh we're going over by boat is that what's happening are the rest of us flying we're flying we did this already okay so we're over the water pus can we go inspect those structures up there i turn invisible let's go scout it out so we make our way up to the structure nope three that was my advantage the first one was a one (all laugh) wait plus two that makes it five oh plus ten that's 15 a recent campsite or one big thing (singing) there are giants in the sky i'm invisible okay didn't make it didn't make it to k'varn didn't make it to the shirts that was the stoner-est thing you've ever said bard yeah that's us we should do loins encouraged and violence girded no what laura and liam did you just buy 20

entschuldige i don't know what that is a thousand dollars yes got ten minutes tops is that what one of the things was it's a lot like life (all laugh) we needed to come up with a name some people didn't think that it was-- so we had to come up with something less provocative i think i'm neutral good i don't remember i don't think it's on my sheet what should i be matt yeah but that was a game thing that wasn't a character thing how does anyone do anything a lot of stuff for matt i do not think i look like tim curry (all laugh) this is my first time playing who's the youngest probably
