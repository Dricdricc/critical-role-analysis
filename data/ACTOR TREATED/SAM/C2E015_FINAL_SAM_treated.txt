discovered that ashley has more dice than laura apparently what is this what is this gigantic box of dice yeah but she doesn't use those these are all active for tonight this is terrible i thought we were supposed to turn the ceiling from up here no no we should use the stairs i don't know it seems like they know they decided without us so smart that's dead things good things and in-between things i did that why don't we try a person to use the rod first before we start wasting spells you're weak shouldn't we use a strong person yasha you're strong why don't you go try and twist the thing what is it evocation wait if we had picked a different magic would a different monster-- everything's a dick joke with you laura seven it can be restrained that thing you're going to sit on the floor oh no because it's her strength you did great way to go yasha yasha yes i feel so conflicted trying to hurt a cube but i will i will bash that cube until it explodes all over the place wait i rolled a natural 20 to attack with my hand crossbow with sneak attack and it's crit so double 24 plus-- 28 oh and i'll use fury of the small to make it 30 fury of the small let me look yes oh shit class

first roll to hit at the same time i don't know you taught me magic what are mine what are my spells here i'll show you on d&d beyond most of mine are illusion and something else okay i can do evocation no but i can do climb or we do it to the rod in the hole i can do shocking grasp as a evocation spell can't we cast it on the staff no you keep it i'll do it wait no we have to do it instantaneously yeah what's the problem with that at the count of zwei shocking grasp (gibberish) we have to be in the room why don't we cast it on the rod so creepy what parts of the symbols are
