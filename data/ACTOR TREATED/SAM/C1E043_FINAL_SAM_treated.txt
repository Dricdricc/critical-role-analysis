it that though her stuff how much do you know about the dragon attacks that have been raging across the world will we know the presence of this champion or will it be a silent one i think we want her to do her stupidest udire it would have been a swell adventure with you maybe next time sir thank you for granting us this aid that we will definitely need in our journey we also are new to this dragon-slaying business and would love your advice and any information you might have especially about some specific items something called the vestiges of divergence or how many there were highbearer these dragons who are running rampant across the world them being chromatic dragons do you think they have pledged their loyalty to the queen well thank you for all your help one more question before we leave you to your-- on our journey we may have to travel long distances quite often is there any means of quick travel to other parts of the continent from vasselheim airships teleportation circles any means that you know how's that horn of orcus going by the way oh sorry sorry no don't do that big scary dragons it's been destroyed only trees she's seen and knows very well followed by the airship that is so cool let's do this paleo what shall be a test does he mean us or she's not here we give him his strength sir (laughing nervously) not my kind of fight oh i got a ten are we talking still is it just us against one person no i can see on the screen 16 hi (laughter) what's going on that hits all i've heard was scanlan' (laughter) did grog moving activate vax didn't you hold your turn or something i'll stand up out of the sand and i will eeeee i will-- (laughter) i will attempt to cast with the horn eyebite on him and i'll sing (singing) my my my eye bitten twice shy (laughter) it's a wisdom save it's 19 this is a good question i don't know what to do should i make him fall asleep i think no because we want this fight to continue that would sort of end it won't it yeah i want him to go to sleep in the sand just curl up in the fetal position that was a quick fight i mean he can't swipe at me if i walk away so i'm gonna get away from him although he can move super fast i'll walk a little bit away and i'll inspire grog in case this fight continues and i will sing-- i will sing (singing) hail to the goliaths hail victory blood on the warpath fight for vax and me (laughter) (whispers) that's the redskins' fight song (yelling) what do we do he will but you get you'll get a few licks in yeah kill him no he's asleep i assume this is a sneak attack since he can't see it he will wake up after this i don't know actually can i change the effect or does it always have to be-- it's true he's still eyebitten all right instead of sleeping this time i would like him to just get sick be sick i want him to be sick now oh he has like diarrhea you didn't sleep well did you no and i will turn to vax this time and inspire him and i will say (singing) kill that monk-y douchebag white boy kill that monk-y douchebag right take out your daggers and kill that monk-y douchebag 'til he dies (laughter) i'll move a little further away it won't really help oh shit i was trying to get away from him just take your 80 points of damage not your 160 points don't hide behind me you've got inspiration still no effect 10d10 you could be inspired god damn it all you have to do is pledge allegiance to the washington football team (laughter) still sick oh so he's done all right well i'm far away from him but grog's right next to him so i probably shouldn't do anything too terrible i'll join in the bludgeon-fest and i will cast (sings) bigby's hand and i will i'll make it come right next to him sort of between him and grog i can't get between him and grog okay to the side to the side would be good and just punch just a couple punches just throwing some punches melee spell attack what do i add spell attack bonus-- okay 27 that was a natural 20 but the disadvantage so the 27 yes oh wait now i roll for damage with bigby's hand i rarely do this 4d8 i'll just roll this one four times it's fine 17 4d8 right decent decent and i will inspire grog again with a little ditty i will say (singing) you're a psycho killer with a bearded face grog grog grog grog grog grog grog grog grog run r-- that's fine i'm a little boy yeah okay i'll use cutting words
