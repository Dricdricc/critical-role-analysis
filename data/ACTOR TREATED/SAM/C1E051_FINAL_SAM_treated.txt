dishonorable combat i can't go to the other side until i have avenged my death i cannot move on to the other side until i've avenged my death (laughing) (growling) the goliath goes sorry then (laughing) as he steps out of the room the guy with the straggled beard who you gather is of a different type of a tribal background than the goliaths just kind of gleans an eye untrustingly yeah strongjaw you say how strong is that jaw of yours and throws an ax towards it it just passes through and clatters behind okay quick say you idiot i am but a projection you idiot (laughing) i am but a projection the real stonejaw is currently outside the main gate waiting for a battle of revenge against zanror send him now i know sorry kaylee the real zanror stands outside this city gate waiting for vengeance against zanror you're doing great you're doing great bring him now or you all shall suffer that last part was improv that was amazing kaylee (laughing) (grunting) there's like a slight pause can i have my axe back i motion to dr dra to throw it back to him he runs over feels for it looks around wow there's like four gates into the city which main gate i don't know do i know what it looks like these shirts not those shirts these shirts how do you wanna do this how do you wanna do this we already hawked those it's 180 feet as a bird we are the best at planning 83 that's pretty good (laughing) and they're prone (laughing) (mimics shooting) uh that's that's with retort i'm not using the big gun 18 19 21 21 hits and then they every time they hit they take damage and they also yeah they don't even have a save oh boy not his strength 13 13 plus (laughing) all right as you say that one of the two individuals has pulled their way out humanoid kind of a grizzled beard their eyes kind of go wide and he just stands still for a second the other one is a goliath who as he approaches you get a familiarity with you remember this individual little younger than you has a pretty pretty heavy scar from the bottom of the chin that goes down to about the sternum named by by the name of suda who just kind of steps forward gives you a look-over and goes strongjaw ha you're a grog stronger that's what you are fool you know not who i am i have not come through flame and death to deal with filth like you he's a bleedin' liar come on you guys have been had and he goes ahead and takes the two hand axes he throws them in the air and kinda catches them he goes (grunts) and rushes in towards you however he's unable to make anything else this turn except movement into face-to-face with grog we'll say for the purposes of this open space grog will be there and this one and where's the pit the pit is about 10 feet behind the guy who's standing actually i should probably put him there right now do you like to draw or sketch or just doodle eagle you need one over there grog your round of retribution is up pike you wanna do anything uh no i'm gonna hold that is the correct answer (laughing) yeah i mean maybe it's 15 feet but he doesn't know numbers so it's strength okay it's strength athletics check contested by his athletics or acrobatics you push him five feet away from you or prone oh the tension and the drama 56 oh jesus as some time has passed you guys have waited it out mm-hmm what are you planning to do (sighs) i mean i have to get these people out of the city i guess so they know the location of the entrance to the sewers correct kaylee had said that she knew yeah all right well then i'm just going to shit do i know that the goliaths were working with orcs at all or was it just goliaths is it-- well no from what you've heard from when when grog was interrogating the first member of the herd that you guys found on your way south through westruun there-- it was a largely goliath herd that had been challenged by and then defeated another clan and then absorbed them and the other clan involved a lot more varying races and specialities there were half-orcs there were some kind of wild elves that were part of the crew and a lot of the brigand humans it was very much kind of like just-- defeated their leader took in the others because their choice was to either die or join she's so good slinks out the door looks back and forth for a moment leans back in coast is clear she nods you see a troop of about it would be 12 half-orc looking barbarians of varying aggressive stances start pouring out of a broken temple and into the street i swoop down a little closer and attack us (laughing) continue to move as fast as possible you move southward past one sequence of alleys to the next street south and kaylee continues to usher up to the edge of the alleyway she looks back and forth nods and you guys walk into the street again as you step into the street a voice goes hey and kaylee stops and whips around and looks in that direction and you can see a group of three individuals led by one goliath and there is one kind of wild-looking elf who has like face-paint strewn across the front of their expression with this long almost dredlocked light brown hair and what looks to be an older human with like streaks of black and grey and this long long beard that's tied off near the stomach bare-chested with like scars across the chest and they all kind of loom up as the goliath steps up pointing out we need you to the west gate and he kind of steps up who's your watcher i step forward and say he was killed by that gnome gnome where'd you see it right in the center of town he was a scary undead gnome and he's roaming about kevdak sent us to search for him make a deception check (groans) 19 19 so ugly center of town aye well then you should probably come with us then see if we can swarm it if i may if i may actually (laughing) kevdak said to follow the gnome and he ran this way i'm sorry we have to follow kevdak's orders not that again (laughing) and then i-- someone fell down a well (laughing) i come out of raven form not on my shoulder not on his well maybe i kind of like slide off sorry sorry what did you see report report okay they are ripping all of the townspeople out of their houses it looks like they have their own counter plan for a situation like this there was also a band of very strange orcs heading this direction they were acting strangely i don't trust it we can either get out ahead of them or try and wait and see if i don't wanna drop from pee and what looks to be a shattered quarter-staff that may have been landed on (groans) beyond that you're gonna have to get sifting through the remains it's not gonna be a fun experience for what little you may gather i'll let it go amateur spider-man (screams) you guys make it a couple of streets before you reach a point where this block does 'cause the main street intersects with another main street that goes southward and the gap is about 30 feet to jump across and you know from experience that you couldn't do that with a regular jump i've got an idea if you give me the broom i'll just hold on and plant me down if we see anything we'll just keep low by the roof (laughing) oi oi but it was a distraction idiots on broomsticks flying around are we all together now oh okay probably down to 20 or 30 well wait there was 30 or 40 to start and we killed nine of them remember he said we were down to like 50 we killed like nine-ish i've got a plan i go to the center of town yeah i create a distraction (laughing) where are we trying to get where is that and why would we be there well that's pike's grandfather so i know but does that provide us with some strategic advantage no but we might be able to see if he's all right they've probably dragged him to the center of town how can we get through this go ahead pike we could go to the center of town and check to see if he's there after we take care of business and then hopefully he's not there i mean he could provide a lot of help well wait the thing might help us who knows it was a red brick two-story home-- are we close to the edge of town about like a five six minute walk a brisk jog i should say it's close but it's not like right outside wait i'm sorry but we need pike with us can't you bless him or something well wait wait wait oh jesus so wait sorry it's just i found this old joke book i thought you might wanna hear this joke and i pull out my (laughing) bull strength scroll oh thank god and i'm gonna read him the bull strength scroll can i affect him with the +5 strength well the bull strength as an ability just gives him advantage on strength which he already has oh i thought it was a +5 to strength no you must've pulled those stats out of the old pathfinder game oh i have had this for a long time well then in that case i'll just i'll sing you a rousing song to put you on your way (clears throat) ♫ the stars at night ♫ are big and bright (clapping) ♫ deep in the beard of strongjaw ♫ (laughing) take your d10 never worry about me you can't do it multiple times scanlan is there some sort of-- too late is there some sort of ritual that we need to do together to make this happen great wait wait wait (laughing) don't you dare die happy didn't we just talk about this what give him the fucking rock the rock that he can bamf out of there with it takes a minute so it's something a minute's a long time oh all right forget it i reach into my bag of holding and i pull out my trusty salt lick rock and i kneel down to pike i say hey hold this for me all right okay yeah just keep it safe i don't like getting blood on it but listen i can't lose you twice in one day okay oh no i'm not going anywhere we're just going to meet some really bad folks and we're gonna set 'em straight okay (laughing) go get 'em okay oh my god thank god you are the shadow that stalks the guilty (laughing) ooh that's our girl 37 all right as you guys are stalking behind there's a moment where you all duck into one of the alleyways and as pike spins into the alley the edge of her shoulder armor being wider than her actual form catches the edge of the building causing this large (clang) sound the sound of bending metal clanging against itself at which point the troop behind grog immediately spins around did you hear that is anyone following us and as you've kind of kept walking forward you feel the point of a blade just kind of gently press into your lower back good lord you're awful jumpy see when i was last with this herd the mates that i ran around with weren't so quick to jump and hide behind their mother's skirts keep your attention focused on me son we've got important dealings to meet with keep walking the blade pulls back as you continue to step forward you hear a little whisper behind you and you kind of glance over and look as the halfling and the female with the kind of hooked rapier both break off and begin heading back towards the alleyway no problem so as you guys step forward you guys now lurking in the alley kind of pull off into the shadow listening you hear very very light footsteps beginning to find their way in your direction can we wait until they come around the corner i'm gonna continue-- i'm gonna continue following grog just-- are we gonna wait and jump them or do you want me to stop them we're all split right you guys are all are you guys divided into different groups can i attack you can now yes i will use the myth carver oh wow oh my god has this happened before no we just got this i don't even know what i think i'm going to need help okay let me help you this is why we're here okay roll an attack okay you got this i don't know how to-- use the die okay i'm gonna hold the sword and i fumble with it hold it up again and then close my eyes and just kinda go like this okay so the attack gives you advantage but the blindness gives you disadvantage so just roll an attack plus eight 12 plus eight double ok roll once and then roll d8 and d6 double that number add your bonus it's just that easy roll a d8 and a d6 that's a six okay so that's nine i double that 18 plus three plus three is 21 i didn't mean to ah this is you pull it out and it's still kind of vibrating a little bit there is no blood on the blade the actual like the sonic vibrations of the weapon managed to shake free any possibility of any of the gore sticking to the weapon oh that's sick kinky can i have everyone make another stealth check 22 30 34 no pass without a trace is gone you used hunter's mark do we run yeah yeah yeah we disappear we disappear we hide okay you guys begin to vanish make one more stealth check to see if you leave any tracks behind or any followable trace she's the worst i hate my armor and i love it in battle there's a set you never quite picked up from gilmore they've moved on keyleth then i try and find them still in my form but misting about okay so (imitates wind) this little burst of wind that comes up to the rooftop and as you get up there you can see a couple roofs over a couple of dots the rest of your companions that are slowing making their way along the road well i recognized a couple earlier oh my god it's beautiful and it's all made out of cake (laughter) i'm holding pike's hand (laughter) this is the part where matt plays dolls wait kevdak just grew yes oh my god well we've been you guys have been following to get to this area we probably went up with vex probably yeah we don't know what we're doing okay vax where are you trinket's going to make some noise initiative that's a risk (laughter) you had inspiration by the way would that have helped at all there are side openings like areas here where you could step out but you get the sense that as people are gathering around they would be plugging elements of this exit to prevent you from closing the gap with my bonus action i yell coward and that's it it worked i've got more dammit i mean who did this illustration again oh yeah i remember (gasps) (quietly) no no grog and i will shout out vox machina fuck shit up (cheering) and we're going to go ahead and end it there this week (loud exclamations) it's 11 o'clock guys oh all right (groaning) it's 11 o'clock let's call it and we had a very long critmas and everything the week before so let's go ahead and we'll call it tonight we'll pick up right at this ridiculous moment next week i think you can take him we'll figure it out you're fine you could go for another six rounds yeah a little yeah grog's done 34 points of damage wow out of like 500 hit points probably there's different paths to a barbarian there's the frenzy path which is all about damage there's the totem path which totem of the bear means your half damage for everything except psychic damage grog quick be psychic (laughter) good luck with that guys but yeah this is where that totem really shines that's true
