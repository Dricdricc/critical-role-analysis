mean is it okay there's no gangrene of age oh pike everyone stand back my lady's going to do something well after his testimony should it prove to be valuable we should solve all of our problems with letters from now on how about after the testimony he hasn't fulfilled his duty has he stabilized is he stable can i inspire her healing all right i'm going to inspire her with a limerick there once was a gnome from emon who sang a scandalous song the ladies would swoon at his rather large tune and say my it's impossibly long (laughter) this guy's gonna get a brand-new hand he's got shaka hand nicely done pike wow oh yes we're looking out for his better interests should we go in to meet our jury well let's look at it first i have some papers what do you mean you don't want to walk up to the palace by what triumvirate council excuse me sovereign uriel perhaps i'm speaking out of turn here and i haven't consulted with my fellows here but you did mention that you've been mind-controlled twice now and as council members this doesn't sit well and-- well what are we to do the security that you have in place clearly hasn't worked is there a role that we can serve to ensure that you will be further protected she's spit-balling here it doesn't have to be that evidence documents for the archives we did collect quite a bit of paperwork and documentation that would fill in any of the gaps in the history of whitestone and-- of course we gathered this from the palace in whitestone did you just say that there's a fort somewhere but any connection to this traitor may-- it may be dangerous for him to be in command up there this whole place could be a risk well we should bring him out just to just 'cause-- otherwise he just sat around for nothing stone before we give desmond his appointment as a royal messenger which i guess he is would the kingdom-- he risked much to keep himself alive and possibly to testify on our behalf-- would the kingdom be willing to give him a quick little reward for his time spent in captivity not great 24 that's more than what we would've done by far don't faint oh oh oh the first whisper of 2016 i'm a fraud is there anything else we need or require do you have any intelligence that he's still within the city walls or could be anywhere all right so we're free you're not don't say that about yourself you're not you're thinking that he's hiding in our keep somewhere wait a second so we're gonna go check out his room to see if we can find clues but also who would know is there anyone that we know who would know-- would gilmore know where this guy has gone because he knows everything about everyone isn't that the same thing take five and i'm going to look for secret compartments in the wall 19 for me i'll do an arcane check grog is an expert on all things i'm very well-travelled and very old his instincts are just right there do i know what kind of magic or what kind of magic wielder would have been able to protect this room or design this protection and did we find anything else any hidden compartments or anything okay bye keyleth i think she has to drop a d with that expression-- he's being interrogated right now yeah yeah let's go do that i do jeffrey is it jeffrey-- he doesn't want to use the sword he doesn't like to use the sword it's a lot to clean there's brains on it he likes to keep it nice and tidy in here this isn't even our palace don't make him use the sword just answer the questions it's totally fine all right it's going to be fine do you want some water pipe to smoke or anything just anything to relax you make you feel better all right i will insight check him that bitch that did not go well uh-oh sorry jeffrey he's not gonna like using that sword but it looks like it's coming the sword is moving a little isn't it oh boy this is gonna be a hard night for me i'm gonna have to talk him down from this he gets so worked up-- jeffrey please you're just gonna make more work for me if you-- if he has to behead you right now please jeffrey jeffrey did your boss get any letters that he stowed away anywhere did he have a safe-keeping place a secret residence somewhere in the city walls-- did he ever regularly travel to anywhere in the walls of the city where specifically the tavern's name this is our sergeant yes yes you have been quite helpful give us the name of that girl so we can send our condolences to her jeffrey is there anything else that might help us in our search for your former employer grog what do you think grog what do you think should we let him live have a good day and

playing) is there a good part come on dr dra everybody give it up for zed on drums 24 i can't be one-upped i use minor illusion to create sort of a mirror image of myself over myself also playing the flute (laughter) with advantage not as good 22 it was a ballad she chose a ballad just play the scene from anchorman 22 and lasers in the background 27 blowing at each other it's a 22 but i'm going to let her win with a wink i end my note ladies and gentlemen kaylie's fine ladies and gentlemen i tip my hat to her and say yes ma'am it seems that tonight you are all right i kick her 100 gold is she

middle what the fuck is wrong with you the ones that say no are trapped how is this hard to understand what are you doing why would you do that do the ones that aren't trapped first what are you doing i won't be burned because you're not gonna mess with the traps just do the ones that aren't trapped all right i'm gonna quickly inspire him i'm gonna read him a limerick i knew a goliath in whitestone who lived in a very very fine home 'til one day a wizard or maybe a large lizard burned it and left him alone you did the top already don't disparage her she's wonderful and beautiful we're not sneaking then 'cause if we did sneak we could-- don't you have fly or something all she'd have to do is fly just off the- all right all right so we're talking our way out of it i've been promoted since then i'm now a supervisor of-- it was a ruse i apologise for it he's a member of the clasp he gained entry the way that you do not the kind of reward he's already offering you we come bearing an offering from sovereign uriel himself in exchange for this man i reach into my bag and i produce-- the very elegantly carved box i had made that contains the magical blue shard that we discovered many many years ago and i open it just for a moment and close it and say this is the shard of kara it is a magical item that can grant the user one wish any wish i did but it's clear that this man knows who we are and why we've come as a last resort we are cleared to offer this to you in exchange for your prisoner or is he-- are you holding him as a prisoner or-- deception or persuasion 32 it is activated by a secret chant that we will only tell you once we are safe and the prisoner-- or keep-- i don't know are you keeping him as a prisoner or-- all right as soon as we get the man you get the chant where is he where is he all right here you can inspect it scan it for magic if you'd like is this deception what is this it's a blue shard that we found in-- long long ago-- it's real crystal and it's real magic because i don't okay i don't know what it is but it's magic hope we don't have to leave that way but she can just dispel it all right i'll take the other door why don't you go in and kill some shit just in case eh 14 you were using your deep voice so you could-- you could get advantage don't you have some sort of intimidate thing superiority i can't see him yet or i can and i saw keyleth cast that spell yeah i run up a little closer to be in visual range yeah and i will do the same fucking thing and i'll cast hold person on him as well with my hand cone of clarity he has two 19 damn i will with my bonus can i talk to him i will say hey man just give up already come on come on that's my intimidation 21 he can't move get more flies with honey he's held and also we

cast speak with animals we want to hear what he has to say i think at this point me jesus hey hey dude come on can you give up please can you please give up i'm just going to intimidate him again ah
