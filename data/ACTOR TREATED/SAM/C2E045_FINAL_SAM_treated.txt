so well yes how many days will it be sailing you got it right (singing) bishaft ah biscotti i have a small list okay you said that we have some cannons aboard do we have gunpowder okay i would like to fashion if i can three more explosive arrowheads for myself if possible or attempt to three times right in the belly of the ship i have tinker's tools where do i see-- where's that nope but i am good with chemistry which is part of the deal three times all right two 11 13 plus four so 17 15 low hey that's great oh no no i'm down near the cannons that's where the gunpowder is three plus zero two it is at an angle plus seven but wait don't i have something on dexterity saves where i can-- i don't know don't i have something i should know my shit what's evasion it's an area effect so if it's a big explosion maybe no okay oh shit first of all am i singed did the other arrows-- is everything safe is anything else going to blow up any other fire six no everything's fine i'll climb up it's okay there was a booby trap set by avantika but i found it and disarmed it it's all right we're safe now i know i was just making sure that we were safe and we definitely are now thank you no i'll be okay below but beauregard in halfling i will say to her there's someone hiding downstairs we need to act fast but don't alert the others yet they'll overreact you and i are the calm and steady ones we can deal with this sorry i just don't want us to all go down there and scare away whatever it is-- oh no i'm still in halfling what do you think who fjord he hasn't done anything to us i don't know how to translate it gather close everyone in common there might be someone down below hiding in my exploration i might have seen a shape moving down there i don't want us to go charging down there and blow up-- shh not too loud i don't think so this one was very specific in its design seemed to be a one-of-a-kind thing i hope isolate contain kill didn't she die you said jester too (talking through his teeth) near the galley is where i saw the thing move ooh so much better then mine is there a way to flank around behind wherever that shape was hood up 23 why did he send us three do you want me to go scare it out or something i don't know how to do that ooh your duplicate do that too just send the thaumaturgy then okay sam and jester fjord said to contain (shouting) get down i'm going to point my crossbow at her get down don't say a word no this is not good cop bad cop we're supposed to contain contain i mean she's so cute how could i do that to you i'm so sorry whoa what were you doing hanging out on a ship in a pirate island you're a little cutie pie i mean that seems like a perfectly reasonable explanation for me i pull out my dead rabbit's foot that i have i have this too it's something what sort of thing do you have it amazing roll it's just that we're surrounded by gunpowder down here so maybe not right now didn't need that one it's real don't show her that we do i can't argue with that either no we should really have caleb look at this he's much smarter than any of us down here no beau get it get the thing get the ball one luck these are all the right answers a stench of urine that's my bad i'm down here a lot i thought it was me let's go introduce you to the others okay so they're all big they're all bigs sure yes yes we can choreograph something we've done that before no they're all big so don't be intimidated one of them is a big cow man but he's cool there's a stony-faced harbinger of death-type lady she's pretty cool though she's cool she likes flowers i do the same i also put flowers in my hair sometimes well i mean i don't want to-- no no i think she meant all of us i think she meant all of us it's okay you can be-- that's chocolate caleb is very smart and he's good with magic he can probably determine what you're carrying what that ball was that beau has now it seemed legit from bad people unspecified so far oh you did something to deserve this that's not-- no parents you're an orphan so you're an orphan for a while bullshit what are you talking about she's the greatest person in the world oh she is whispering something dndbeyondcom/criticalrole let them know that you came from us give them some love she's got a rodent in her pocket it's a squirrel sometimes a cat so be careful with your squirrel around his cat oh shit happy fun ball was he the docent or something why did you think he was mean what gave off that impression you know him oh the exalted collection you can copy off of me she made 15 gold pieces down there out of nothing she has a bit of magic he's assessing his new crew this is what a professional captain does just to allay some of our fears were people actively pursuing you and chasing you when you got onto this boat and if so how many may they rest in peace do you think they might still be chasing or tracking you or wanting to find you ooh that's not great (whispering) she's holding caleb would know i'm going to seeing as how she said there are folks chasing her as we get going again go up to the crow's nest and do a scan with my awesome perception and see if there's any boats trailing us 11 i run over to them and say oh twiggy just did this thing with her tongue where she made it into a circle it was really great you've got to see it later it's really cool change the name the squallbeater the balleater i never remember to use it like that wow that was very impressive you've made some allies today with that we could paint a new flag with your brush okay are you ever going to use that paint you had mentioned briefly that some of avantika's men and helpers had been armed with firearms if i scout around is there any ammo aboard this ship 29 wait 28 any that fit the gun that i have i stole a gun a while ago oh you might have been-- that fit my piece like that cool thanks that's third base (laughter) we can't see the next deck oh god what i'm not doing that no way you're crazy yes thank you why do we care what's in the-- oh man it's open go or it could be the tail of a whale or something or if it's their pink haversack what is it sure why are you looking at me when you say that no i'm not going in into somebody's laundry bag all right i'll take a big swig and get ready of course i squeeze it way too hard yes (yelling) it was crazy down there the lights the monsters it was insane it was a parade of horrors yeah there was nothing down there no it was nothing but it's a lot of space so if we wanted to store something for safekeeping it's a good spot to do it come on deborah adorable he made you socially awkward you were trapped somewhere this was in port damali wow is the ground dirt gravel or stone just to give us a visual guys d&d beyond check your twitters and giphys for the gifs that have already started pouring in this seems legit 25 but we have healed don't do that again oh halas' cape he's hurt yeah twiggy just hurt him it's your ship scoot me over somewhere too while you're up there marisha just near fjord boom just like us halas did anyone escape it was a lot helpful so we know blue bad black bad-- well maybe one of them is a good maybe one of them's a way out of here but someone needs to step out of it in order to trigger the other-- sure well let's do some honeycomb then smell sound vision that's the way out i don't have to do shit i'm just going to sit there drinking deep pockets that door is still closed so there's no way in or out and every door is bad well that was the wailing one the guy said it was the wailing one
