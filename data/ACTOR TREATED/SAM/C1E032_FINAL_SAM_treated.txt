appointed meeting spot as we go i'm looking at clotheslines for any sort of beret type of a hat (laughter) 13 a yarmulke anything i'm a little thing i have a little head maybe it could be just a shoulder pad all right fine initiative initiative oh i was reading a book sorry they both fail it's been a long day we've had three sessions keep your cheated die all for yourself there so light him up stupid pathfinder it's fun nothing you do does what you want it to do so you're pulling him towards you that's a no nice are any of them in berets damn it are you trying to grave rob right now how is everyone did you defeat your giant you know who defeated ours pike because she's the fucking bomb pike come here and give me a hug i give her a hug what happens just how i remember you warm gelatin many decisions we've decided to take down this horrible foe and percy's been grappling with a lot of decisions as we've gone percy's thinking very clearly he's fine he's allergic to cats or something i have lightning coming out of my ass 12 and pike the cough did they blow it man-done can we get in it well we have two gnomes with us i hope so (laughter) oi i can't see anything (laughter) this feels so cool it's like a shortsword for me (laughter) no one down here but i don't know how far this thing goes and i don't know how well it's guarded and camp in the tunnel i put vax's dagger in my back pocket cover it up with my shirt seven not in front of pike (laughter) of course you can ooh he had two he still coughs pike that was incredible yeah he was right here the whole time excuse me what are you doing outside can we do it here wait pike do you have any sort of cone of silence or anything do you have a cone of silence he's going to make noise where's passive perception the guardian's got this i look around for pike five we should have a feast well that is a problem pike can't help in any way i have questions for us while pike is looking up her spells first question is how on earth are we supposed to send a signal to the rest of the town when we're in a tunnel from where is that our plan we're going to say rebels go wait a while and then attack shouldn't we wait a little remember last time i was supposed to create a diversion believe me i was amazing but maybe we should incite the rebellion wait a half hour and then go well that's another question we are does one of us need to go out there and lead the rebels laura and what do you mean no if he survived the night maybe pike should i'm just saying if pike is fading on us it might be best to send her out to lead the rebels and if in the horribly unfortunate scenario where she can't pike can you leave us anything a potion a spell a prayer a symbol a siggle anything oh oh a sigil i said it wrong heroes' feast raises all of our hit points higher and advantage on wisdom saves seriously go go where what you've got to go outside first okay well we still can (laughs) before we do this i love you all and i wish us all the best of luck today i especially love pike and i'm so happy she's with us for this if some of us don't return i think that the glory of what we're doing today and the justice of what we're doing today has been worth it and percy i hope you get some sort of redemption in all of this to the de rolos let's all go down the tunnel i've got this guys wait why are we pushing this thing i will push as well i'm helping i am not helping 11 wait pike's going to do this doors man what mrs shorthalt you are amazing pike will you carry me over the threshold (laughter) oh you just happen to
