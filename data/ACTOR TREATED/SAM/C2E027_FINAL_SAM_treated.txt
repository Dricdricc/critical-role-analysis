ashly burch everybody and maybe more d&d beyond everybody as mentioned last week the newly revamped digital character sheet for d&d beyond has released with improved desktop and tablet views better at-a-glance information all kinds of customization and an updated pdf export as you guys all remember--not you a couple months back i asked you critters out there who use d&d beyond to write in and tell me about their d&d beyond experiences with the studio move and stuff things got lost some of the letters got lost a little bit or misplaced but we found them i'm going to read you some of the letters from the fans they're from a couple weeks ago dear sam loving d&d beyond just used their easy character creator to roll a brand-new character after my favorite pc was tragically killed last week i'm still really sad about it but watching your show is taking my mind off the loss i love how critical role doesn't remind me about that death all the time again these are from a few weeks ago so i haven't-- dear sam my whole campaign uses d&d beyond and their new shareable links really help us play faster side note i love your interactions with taliesin in this campaign don't change that dynamic it's perfect and i can't get enough of it thank you dear sam-- these are from a couple weeks ago that is the premise dear sam just signed up for a master-level subscription at d&d beyond and all their content is so cool i'm enclosing a photo of a tattoo i just got it's my first and i'm very proud as you can see that's nott and mollymauk dancing together i know it's in cursive so you might not be able to read that they're both saying 'we're going to live forever' what do you think there was a picture included in that one last but not least we got an actual letter from the d&d beyond corporation which also got lost and found it says dear sam hey let's refrain from anything sad or emotional in your ads this week we want players to associate our app with fun not intense loss that might trigger feelings of pain or misery keep it light do one of those dumb songs you write oh and give our love to taliesin he's our favorite and he's the only reason we advertise on your show i could not have planned it because those are from weeks ago matt everyone used the same paper stock and font all right one of them was fake a lot of adventure i'm sure if laura were here she would say there are still many nott the best detective agency t-shirts in the store are there i don't know okay she's not here (scatting) [click tv static] [groovy critical role theme] i want to what what is pointless they learned to do that in a month you're just going to pick his body off but he woke up before maybe we should leave it with him in case he needs it later caleb she's right we can't fight them it would be the smarter bet we should bury him and leave some sort of marker-- keg no judgement or anything but you sort of froze up in the little fight we had when you say you can take us there are you just talking about taking us there and dropping us off how do we know you won't freeze up again we can't fight them we can't fight them molly said not to steal from happy people nope i think you should take everything you can but i can't steal from this one that's a good idea we certainly can't carry it anymore it's very impractical absolutely it's a terrible purchase are we leaving his swords there's one that can teleport sure is tell him his name too or ooh we can make one up all right that's the one it's a loan it's a loan yeah fuck those guys right should we say some words or anything sure i'll pour drinks long may he reign i think you're supposed to say things about how good they were and how many people loved them and what a wonderful life they had but i don't think any of those things are true or at least we don't-- i don't think he even knew that'll be stolen though go after them to throw what away i want to hear you say it why do you want to go after them wrong why if you run we'll kill you cool you deserve it (cooing) you said sumalee not so molly right wow you have to do a mr ed voice hi ah can you bring dead people back to life it was worth a shot right i mean you would have kicked yourself if you hadn't asked and later she was like oh yeah by the way they all know each other i knew it do you know pumat sol it was nila it's nice to meet you too we met your friends family tribe clan they told us that you're trying to find the same people we are i think you're trying to find these folks who kidnapped someone who you know so we have an extra horse ooh caleb can turn his cat into a bird we fought those one almost killed me was it you you can curse in front of us if you need to i mean i think you'll pick it up if you hang around us for more than an afternoon hardcore please tell us i mean if it's not horribly awful to tell son your son has been captured we'd appreciate that metal o'clock do you drink alcohol booze okay more for us yeah sure here if you're going after your son i trust you 100% what was his name maybe that's fully grown for a firbolg okay it was worth a shot yes we should oh that is very lovely yeah we have three horses-- oh wait you had one too wait did you no you were on foot we had three left you are probably going to have to share-- do you have a horse oh you are a horse of course caleb has told us all of this i am going to scout up ahead and see if i recognize them 12 plus zero they were dead when the frost blast hit everybody or maybe he just wanted to move fast without extra weight well we'll cut out their tongues for food and then bury them what it's protein you don't have to watch fine don't worry there's other tongues in the sea (laughter) when we arrive they may have left word to look out for us they know what we look like we should have some sort of disguise i know that you and i can disguise ourselves you can-- when we get to the gates we could maybe just-- for you we'll find a fake mustache or something right god (laughter) we don't turn invisible you guys could hide under the horses or something do we still have the tents did we keep the tents we have the tents okay let's cuddle i will sure oh boy four both for me too i do have my winter clothes i bought them just laying that out no you can-- molly would want us to do this trip maybe molly should pay thank you molly yeah molly wouldn't want to pay for keg why they don't take money oh when you're home with your people are you one of the nicer ones or are you a bad girl at home what's your-- how does it-- they don't rely on you why this is the gate we need to hide in quick hide hide quick so that's just literally around this corner so hide or something right yes wait maybe if one of our horses is a pack horse you could be on top of the horse wrapped in a blanket or something you're part of the gear that the horse is carrying oh we can pay which plan do we want you hiding under the horses or you hiding on the horse as suitcases okay i believe that you can make us totally invisible ask your god then we can do whatever we want yes yes i will mutter a few words and turn into-- oh which one it's a dick man with a drink (laughter) i'll make myself look like rissa because i know that one thank god for the buff it's not as good as you described it you had smells and you had shapes and everything but this is-- shadycreek run all right how much you know what i'll get it don't even look i got this one here you go four from me the greying wildlands that's who we're looking for that seems like where we should go because the iron sheps won't be there to poke around and find us the landlocked lady our horse is smoking i vote landlocked lady lead us there with smoke signals ugh gross oh man it's a consistent brand sure it's really interesting architecture us of use they're good guys do they have a uniform or how do you know them how do you know who they are how can you identify them they're like hell's angels okay okay thank you (louder) thank you horse for riding us this far that's what you are like now (laughter) the trench let's go in the brothel we're here right we can stay here or we go in here do i have to fuck somebody in there i'm a lady but yes you're right you're right that's a fair point let's go in that's their headquarters right yeah the caravan just came by i love it it's so good you're going to-- (shouting) you're going to stay in the alley while we go inside nope they're mostly deaf forever eating a dead body well i mean not the companionship oh champ the mighty nein oh yes we'll need rooms for sure the estate what would we do there we're looking for one of their family but we don't know enough to march up there and say hey we're looking for your daughter we don't even know if it's a daughter or a niece or something i don't know we don't know if she's on the outs with her family if they're the ones who had her killed or kidnapped we don't know anything we'd be marching into a big question mark it's like telling a fortune but with smelling things all right i don't know if she knows what a brothel is (fart noise) everyone's sniffing your bag she doesn't want you to smell her bag it's something you have to earn maybe tomorrow maybe we should get a room or two that way if everything goes wrong if we're indeed going to go to this estate then we could at least have somewhere to crash we can ask around maybe the clientele might know some things about the sheps i think i fit in in this town but they might recognize me no i mean the iron shepherds know my face but it seems like there's so many weirdos in this town that i don't know no one seemed to be looking at me funny when we walked in oh wait i was dressed as a gnome that's why never mind (laughter) spend the night here then we'll have a room by ourselves oh no i mean-- not like that no you're absolutely right he is handsome and he could do much better than a little freakshow like me he could meet any girl in town and sweep her off her feet what do you have any gold left looking up the spell oh elven aging cougar his name is rex listen you should just forgive keg she doesn't know that she was being insulting she's rough around the edges-- and she's right you could do better than me look at this this is a mess i mean the teeth all right why didn't you run changed your mind because we had extra help or-- oh the danger was passed mm-hmm of course i do yes i know that you want revenge for what that man did to you and there's things i want too but mollymauk was amazing showed me something he had this spirit of life that was pretty outstanding you know he was the moment that we all traveled together he came up and we were all talking and all cagey and all iffy with each other when we met all these folks but he said hey want to come see a circus show and that lit the spark right but before that it was-- all i'm saying is he was a rainbow man who represented life at its fullest and that's what i want even more than what we were going for before together we're sort of living life now aren't we before we were in the darkness so i know we have things to do and i want to do them but the reason i want to find these people and rescue them is not to use them and it's not because we've invested time in them but it's because i love them we need to find them and rescue them because we're a team now so if you're just using them or whatever that's fine and i'll support you but i want to find them so that we don't go back to the way it was when we were hiding in the shadows and ducking into alleys to get away from people we were safe but we weren't really alive right with these people we're having fun and winning contests and killing bad guys and rescuing children and it's amazing i hope you're with me on that and i hope we are on the same page that's a good start i think they like you i know it is and i want it for you we've used a lot of people in the past and i just want to make sure we're not using these folks are we okay i couldn't do this without you yes let's get them home and let's kill lorenzo i have an idea i know my last one didn't go so well but listen we can't fight these people i've said it before and i'll say it again but what we can do is exactly what they do they go out and pick off people one at a time why don't we start doing that to them follow them track them see where they go home at night and just pick them off one at a time the weaker ones first and by the time lorenzo knows what's happening he'll be scared out of his mind okay all right to breakfast i'll nestle in what's this what are you doing why are you wearing those things did someone tell you to do this sure sure can we get some hash browns or something i don't think there was a verb in that sentence okay so a few things i mean you don't need to sign it if you're saying apology accepted don't worry about it i have a thick skin about this stuff and i know i haven't put my best foot forward with you we got off on a wrong foot to a brighter tomorrow i just made that up i didn't even have to write it down no okay that's super weird he seems like a nice normal person here listen carefully like while we walk there we should listen oh what's wrong with them what should we know no i know but why we haven't paid you-- okay how long have you been working for the marduns do you like the work you mean like-- what are those marks all over your neck did you get in a fight last night who won simultaneously cool cool cool (laughter) i mean he seems to know them i guess so we're going to go back and ask the creepy guy how to get to the marduns' cops odor sack ooh what is this druid stuff first thing that pops into my mind is do you know kiri but i don't think that's relevant don't they though all right maybe how long has this curse been here how long has the forest been spooky-ooky are there any monsters out there wait they only live for three weeks right that's probably a bad question how far are we from the mardun house i don't know if the bird is going to know-- well we can describe it red wood house red wood mansion (gasp) follow the bird they're probably just guarding the place does someone want to go talk to them (southern accent) a southern gentleman oh are you ophelia oh just making sure it could be someone else oh whispers sam and guys-- liam and is a really good app you can customize that you can with their new upgrade you can be mid dook you're mid dook right now do you know by whom the who what the jagendoths we just killed one of them the grudge gang-- they've hired the entire gang or just the members of the-- where do they hang about they would stay there while they're under the employ of the iron shepherds would you know if they came back do you have spies out there looking because we saw them on the road and they were heading back here does the grudge gang identify themselves in some way how would we find one let's get a fireplace and some iron and burn the shit out of our wrists and then we're insta-grudge gang now the gentleman has us on a meager yearly salary but if we were to do this for you does that include some sort of bonus not yet where's that what's that is that a town all right you don't want us staying here i suppose we should scoot out so that we can't be traced back to you oh it's too late now ooh is that a cabernet sauvignon should we go run recon take a quick scouting pass and see what we can see okay is it a long walk or a long travel you were in great in there you were great you handled yourself so well man you were rock-solid in there give him a goodberry it's a purin tablet stealthy 25 we can send frumpkin but also we have another animal companion now if you wanted to become an animal something or other and scout around that would be acceptable right well frumpkin's a bird right maybe we need something on the ground like a weasel-y thing or a ratty type of thing or a roachy type of thing in owl form okay he'll only be able to see from the sky we should still do that though first go for it yeah but it's minus one oh great (whispering) we have to be very quiet that makes us all stealthy 39 dead sure in his talons he could bring a little mouse and drop it in there i'm just saying we could but the mouse couldn't talk back those are our carts you have a sword that can teleport you you could bamf up onto the walkway with them and knock one off and we could kill him we can certainly kill a guard that would give us a costume but what does that get us we can drag his body off and feed it to a bear steal his clothes they'll be like where did he go where did phil go oh phil you know that old story or we drop in mouse girl and she could run around inside and find out if her son is in there and our friends we don't know sure yes i don't know how much money we have you want to go in and scout around how about one squeak is yes two squeaks is no three squeaks is my son's been compromised please come rescue me i'm dying in here please come get me oh my god everything's gone to shit absolutely you are a strong powerful firbolg are you sure you don't know pumat sol he's one of you there's four of him i mean they're kind of all the same right ashly and all goblins are different you have an owl page on d&d beyond oh god the house is full of tabaxi so judgy you know it's down around to the side or a closed door maybe there's a little crack or something we can send a message i'll send a message saying are you still alive she's still alive ugh a dwendalian king semen stains (laughter) oh boy that's not good you've got luck oh no tell us everything i still would like some help maybe one extra hand do a perimeter check looking for secret entrances stealthy searching (whispering) hey let's run back to town southward to town look at this guy i'm taliesin jaffe were you the little boy being eaten
