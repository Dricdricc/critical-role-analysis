great-uncle vesuvius the court said that he had to give me-- no we'll sleep in the mansion tonight and they all know where they're sleeping but i'll personally show pike to her chambers which are right next door to mine at the end of the long hallway my room obviously the biggest tallest pike's a close second beautiful covered in yellow rose petals as far as you can see mostly chicken please do blues silvers there's a little mini prayer area for her to pray to sarenrae and there's a little statue of sarenrae and if you pull it a little secret door opens to my room but it's a small door that only a gnome could fit through only on my side i did it for you and hey while we have a moment alone can i just mention something to you listen i'm not really concerned with other people's vices or bad behaviors but grog has this sword and it's sort of not good it could be used for good possibly but i'm just worried about it just keep an eye on it i don't know what it is and maybe you could just check it out next time you're friending it up with him i don't want to judge him or what he does but just make sure that it won't kill any of us that's all i care about sleep tight and if you hear any footsteps in your room it's not me it's the servants i assure you of course i'm just making the rounds make sure everyone's tucked in for the night you mean the all-purpose room don't look in
