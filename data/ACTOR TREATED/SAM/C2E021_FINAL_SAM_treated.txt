you mean which side there's nothing over here on my side how do you know that shut up jester are you going to stay behind who oh me yes thank you stealthy though should we create a distraction for it first you're a cultist cult-ish you could heal him and curry favor with him what if we set a trap or an ambush for him or her we could do a little circley-poo and put cali in the middle as bait and then when it comes to attack we spring the trap i don't know i've been drinking a lot someone walks up to it while the others flank around i'll take kiri give me kiri come here little kiri my father won't hurt you anymore it's not an ambush if they can see where we are that you know of yep on my way you can do that that sounds like a great idea oh that's my job anyone who's dead or just one dead

when how many questions do you get (spookily) ooh one more question either where this happened or where they were hiding or we could ask if there's a secret entrance to the safe house then we've wasted a question that would be an interesting story i'm going to check behind us and see how far back fermaw what's his name febron how far back has febron gone hey febron don't go too far there's a troll back there i miss i got a nine yes no we gave it to him already i fired a shot that missed a nine 18 no i got them all words i've never heard before i'll get within 30 feet fire a crossbow shot towards its foot that's good it hits probably 24 sneak attack no oh terrible five points i'll shoot again with bonus action ooh that's not as good 13 i'll use the rest of my movement to duck behind a tree or something while i scream what way to go mee-ster fjord we have to stop it with magic or nets beau dies no caleb pus flew out of it aw kiri okay everything's fine now i'm up okay is there anything in melee range with it no i'll move within 30 feet that's as close as i can get i don't know that we're letting it go so i'm going to cast tasha's hideous laughter on it throw out a little

a bonus action off of that attack okay i'll fire again natural 20 and a 20 just a straight 20 another seven points of damage let me see at the end of each of its turns or each time it takes damage a
