everyone let's go ahead and bring ourselves in to dive into tonight's episode of critical role welcome back (laughter) yeah no shit and you know what i'm stronger for it so thank you guys you've been training me with weights on for two years now so last we left off vox machina having completed their venture over the past few arcs having freed whitestone from the tyranny of the briarwoods having brought down the chroma conclave and essentially brought freedom back to tal'dorei you closed up some loose ends keyleth finished her aramente and you all went to your business for a year-long time jump you returned and each of you recounted the things you wished to accomplish in that year culminating in a winter's crest beachside vacation in the bay of gifts at the port of shamel which involved some escalating pranks yes with a t and it is so named because it is such a centralized port for trade across the various continents in that area so it's a place where it's affluent and it's funny it's kind of ironic 'cause everything there is expensive as you found out but nevertheless you returned to your home in whitestone and reconvened especially after building your bake shop in whitestone but she's not paying attention so that's fine that's okay anyway so (laughs) i know seriously but upon situating yourselves after you've returned and enjoying this peaceful period of recovery and expansion of whitestone itself there was an arrival on the outskirts of the city there was a cart horses pulling a group of four gnomes that all eventually revealed themselves to be family of pike trickfoot after taking them in whether or not you were excited or eager to nevertheless you treated them with hospitality you gave them a place to stay you gave them food for the evening conversations were had information was passed around and a handful of you upon listening in on some of the conversations and pushing for information with the eldest of them uncle ogden discovered some sort of true purpose as to why they came to whitestone dealing with apparently a long-running blood curse that lies in the trickfoot family and ogden having visions had along with the rest of the family that takes care of him made their way towards whitestone as the information gathered by jb trickfoot the esteemed keeper of knowledge about your journey over the past year or so and the exploits of her cousin pike has told you so that being the case you've promised them a tour of the grounds and perhaps seeking more information about what the next steps are in regarding this curse if there are any so with that you all finish your evening eating of your meals drinking deep of your cups and eventually finding yourselves resting 'til the night took you and sleep was had the morning comes you wake up rested and the day is yours what do you wish to do get here soon ashley please have you guys informed pike of this information at the end of the last-- yeah so she's like i mean i think we should right and you watch as she fans out this new blouse it's not the finest craftsmanship but functional enough she goes (sighs) rubs it against her face that's nice and squeezes into it right away lady rushes off quickly as this is happening johann's in the process of eating a breakfast that primarily consists of just fine cakes he has clusters of dried baked good around the outside of his mouth and caught in his mustache he's freshly washed his hair freshly combed over and slicked with whatever equivalent of pomade he carries with himself and as you walk by you see this-- like he has the plate and there's just a crumb-circle around it that has emerged and is in the process of his gluttonous eating he stops and goes such delicacies are a rare treat you have to make time to enjoy the little things in life don't you at least when the opportunity arises pulls up his shirt and dabs at his mouth it barely touches any of the actual food that's around his mouth area he stops and goes right right of course of course we'll just wait for old ogden to find his way down he's a bit of a stickler when it comes to his time so be patient sit down let's have a meal why not get to know each other a little better yes at which point as you're having this conversation the large bear starts lumbering up armor clattering as it approaches the table with absolutely no care or interest in the gnomish guy at the table who immediately goes oh my-my-my-my and he backs out the center of his seat as the bear immediately (impact sounds) paws up and (slurps) starts licking up the crumbs and pieces of wayward pastry that have not found their way to the gnome's mouth at which point he stands up off of his chair and rights himself hm well i'm stuffed let's go see how ogden's doing astra i'll be-- let me just finish this all right we'll pick you up in a second i'll go check in on ogden and he gets up and walks past up the stairs you are searching for what make an investigation check please so you're both searching so make an investigation check with advantage okay takes you a little bit and you're being careful not to be too loud 'cause the last thing you want is cassandra to come in and watch you tearing through her outfits but you do find what essentially amounts to a wide-brimmed captain's hat it comes almost to a tri-corner point at the front and curves upward it's mostly used for costuming purposes it's reminiscent of masquerade balls it's used for-- you actually recall when she was younger it was part of her masquerade ball wear there was a mask with a long nose yeah you find ribbons easily enough make a dexterity check okay oh no you successfully-- (laughs) you successfully create what is a bombastic bow of varying layers that plumes out three times it resembles ribbon candy almost in the way that it billows out multiple ways but it is pinned to the top so it poofs as it cascades down the sides of the hat okay not in cassandra's room but there is the royal stable not far away which does have bells available in case they want to have parade accoutrements for the various horses and other afforded creatures no they're like jingle bells so yeah over the next ten minutes or so between your journey and your finding the proper feather plume you guys manage to cobble together a delightfully ostentatious hat for grog's presentory tour of whitestone okay okay cool there you go he has a couple of dangly bells perfect this magnificent mess of a hat that you guys have created is on par if not slightly beyond the previous helmet that he had acquired while in syngorn so with that completed what do you wish to do well jb hasn't come down yet actually while they're doing this you guys are waiting kind of having your own meals and getting the day started eventually you see johann come down the spiral stairs that lead back to the main entryway to the castle and behind you see jb helping uncle ogden down step by step he still has his walking staff as he makes his way down and they slowly make their way into the dining hall sit down and a simple meal of very very soft oatmeal is presented for uncle ogden at their request before resting the night before and jb gets her breakfast and johann is proud of the fact that he managed to acquire them though it was not much of an ordeal on his end goes and joins astra and they seem to be eagerly awaiting the eventuality of this tour that they're all excited for so you now can approach jb if you'd like to be honest i just kinda want to see the history i wanna see how long it's been here i wanna see makes up the entirety of this crazy place i haven't been inside a castle before so this is a new experience for me well how could i say no to that honey i'm excited right i'm not one to judge i mean you've seen ogden and you glance over at ogden who's now in the process of trying to comb the oatmeal out of his beard while he's muttering below his breath (incoherent muttering) what of course (snoring) which he did he's staring at you beginning to snore loudly and jb's like ogden ogden she flicks him in the side of the head and he goes (chomps) and takes the spoon that she's holding out with the oatmeal and just-- get me a beer no and jb's like ogden she helps him put it back down on the table ah it's been years since i've had a good drink yes and you can see jb's looking kind of nervous she's like actually he probably shouldn't and she takes him and pushes the drink toward grog he's like i'm a grown boy she seems outnumbered and extremely uncomfortable in the circumstance as you look over at johann who's like (laughs) oh this is gonna be a fun tour boy as he watches as uncle ogden lifts the what by his size is rather large cup of beer-- that's the one it's been a long week finishes it in three massive gulps sets it down i don't know honestly he's been off the wagon for about 20 years so i'm curious to see carrying a magnificent hat in your hand no he seems to grow the same he seems relatively unfazed as you both bow and you say this phrase you watch as johann and astra they bow low as well no not at all no here's the thing it was designed for a much smaller head so even for you to get it on it's like squeezing a tiny rubber thimble over your thumb so it's like (creaking boop) it pops up on the very very tip so it holds itself but it only really covers the very very top of your head you feel like it might fall off but eventually you find a little strap inside and as the strap finds itself solid across your jawline the gnomes one by one line up behind you looking at you excitedly ogden and jb at the rear and he's like what's going on you see johann and astra arm-in-arm walk to the side and as jb takes the arm of uncle ogden walks him forward he stumbles up in your direction looks up and goes that's terrible where are we going yay (laughter) all right all right so the three of you find your way borrowing the carpet temporarily you gather the gnomes so wait who-- the weight of all the gnomes the goliath-- you're walking all right so okay easy enough all right so as you all leap onto the carpet except for grog grog you begin taking them around the grounds you begin through the castle where do you want to begin (laughs) all right the carpet glides you guys to the outskirts of the castle you begin taking them along the grounds around the perimeter wall and then through one of the underneath gates to the back garden which you've recovered and are now starting to actually grow again you have like a small hedge maze back there some rose gardens and a small pond you've filled in the exhaust holes that were used for the distillation of the whitestone and the acid pits that were installed by the briarwoods now it is actually a garden once more and so as this happens you watch as astra gets really excited at the edge of the carpet and is like ooh my look at this place it's like natural (snores) (laughter) no please that's interesting johann is like ghost stories you say huh (snores) both of the gnomes now turn back to grog and go anyway what's next on the tour johann is like i like the sound of target practice that's right up my alley take us there boy they both shake their head i have no idea what you're talking about but let's go all right as you guys make your way along the rest of the tour the rest of you who are not on this tour what are you doing okay oh it was amazing kind of a very oversized one it's wide-brimmed and floppy and it's got all these ribbons cascading timely there you go grog so vex pike keyleth taryon what are you guys doing all right you make your way to the sun tree it's about ten in the morning time-wise by the time you get going and you see them kind of gliding around the outskirts of the castle doing their slow traveling tour as you approach the sun tree where are you going heading to westruun you've seen it before you've been to the house you've stayed there so you know the tree she mentions yeah all right as you guys step through the portal created on the outskirts of the sun tree you step through into-- i wouldn't say it's a yard it's not a big yard it's more of a small-- what would be used as a storage space behind this building but you have the two-story red brick building that is your-- and for a while grog's-- home of upbringing wilhand is not in the backyard however you do see that there is a lot of leftover building materials from the reconstruction of the second story which sustained damage from the original assault of the conclave but looking up at the roof which last you saw was amid disarray looks like it's been reconstructed and completed and the home is once again whole you knock on the door there's a slight pause a little voice inside goes eh who is it in the yard another moment passes before the back door opens which leads into the small kitchen it's a humble home but as it opens up wilhand is there looking as liver-spotted and grinning as he was last you saw him his balding top of his head and the crazed white mane of hair behind has gotten even longer and unkempt as he's now on his own and doesn't have anyone to really groom him so he's going a little wild-gnome right now you see his face light up immediately as soon as he sees your expression oh pike pike it's so good-- i noticed well friends dex'avlia and that's keyfen and his eyes go wide ah i almost heard that well come in come in he turns around and muscles his way inside you've never quite been in a gnome home before as you guys are having this conversation you watch as wilhand is rushing around the kitchen frantically trying to make tea he's like i wasn't expecting guests my apologies hold on he's like one hand he's filling this tea kettle and the other hand's trying to find some flint and he's like-- i did it (laughter) okay and he sits down at the table yes it has there's been some fantastic volunteers who've come by they've rebuilt a lot of the city yes okay oh yes the broad stone one ah he was retrieved by his actual legal owner of which i was notified of i don't know how you procured it off of him older gentleman standard human fare taller than me kind of a what you watch as his head turns in a confused way he goes um and he puts his finger in his ear and clears it out and goes i'm sorry what oh yes he was-- -- a bit he was not the kindest or most forthcoming of guests but he seemed to be a busy man of much esteem and left before i could finish making his tea no no not mean at all just extremely forceful (laughter) oh what's your name taryon pleasure to meet you he leans over and goes you're making interesting friends these days pike sarenrae was very specific about making sure that you avoid the bad folk and you're currently dealing with what looks to be some ruffians using some naughty language (laughs) just messing with you what you think i didn't get drunk and say the off thing here and there back in my day i was a bit of a rabble-rouser whether you believe it or not mm-hm hm well that's very kind of you to be perfectly up-front i kind of escaped the trickfoot lifestyle when i was maybe about your age so i'm not as keen on all the familial history but i can say that there's been more than one curse thrown at our family name i don't know i haven't spoken with them in quite some time or really anybody else i decided that you there was something special about you and it wasn't right to have you grow up in such an uncouth environment so i wanted to provide something different for you i don't know if i succeeded but i did my best and brought you into the light of the one that saved me and look at you now and he leans forward and grabs your holy symbol from the front and goes why you're the brightest star she has make an insight check 14 he's hard to read in the sense that he's lived long enough and seen enough things in his time that he's open but he keeps his history guarded by nature he seems genuine but at the same time you're not getting the whole picture because he's not revealing the whole picture he also spends a lot of time alone too so by nature he's a little hermited so that's as much as you can make out oh i would've been maybe in my early 40s yes in what way i wasn't around for that make an insight check i'm sorry i just i don't deal with them much these days they wander they-- i'm just an old gnome trying to live his twilight years in peace and the joy of the everlight i know that he had passed and i heard it was around mysterious circumstances but like many trickfoots before me and many after they tend to die under mysterious circumstances it's kind of the life they lead there we are yes i don't know i haven't delved too deep into the history of the family that's more ogden's fare i just wanted to leave it all behind me for the most part i don't even tell people i'm a trickfoot they just know me as old wilhand don't want to live under the stigma sorry i wish i could be of more help what bothers you child that's the way family is those closest to you are usually the most odd there've been very upstanding people in our family in the past and there've been some downright scoundrels we're as varied as any other folk in exandria it just so happens that some of the scoundrels had a higher profile in the past and set us on a path of expectation besides for gnomes outside of kraghammer it's hard to make a living outside of farming or courier services and other menial tasks tinkering seems to be already a very cluttered business so how else are they going to make their means i suppose than pilfering here and there i don't blame them for that i just don't want to live it and didn't wish for you to live it either i just hope it was enough-- you and the mountain man good i was hoping he would be he was my protector at one time as well really hero what did you do way over in vasselheim you've made the lady of the everlight very proud of you then (laughs) where did you learn to bake you're all very lucky that sounds amazing did you make this oh the tea it's a bit stale mm you're a very good cleric i'll finish this later i've gotta cut down you know the diabetes (laughter) well you'd best be avoiding anything with eyes like coals dreams are dreams visions are different now was it a dream he had or was it a vision do you know if ogden has found faith well i can't say some given the calling they don't know why that is given i'd like to think that even the most dastardly of characters can be redeemed my memory of their family is a dark one but who am i to judge as i have not engaged with their path for hundreds of years now maybe you should ask him i don't know him that well i left before we got to become friends just meaning the trickfoots in general well those are the only visions i've received and they've kept you safe this long yes it's the only life i know i can't speak for him but that would put me at ease but i also don't understand all this-- he glances over at taryon's dragonhide armor and the giant metallic man behind him with glowing runes on his body that's writing this all down and goes you know them arcane stuff tea all right you guys stay for a bit and have some tea with him and catch up and let him know more of the adventures that you've had since last you checked up on him in westruun anything else you guys want to work out here in westruun with wilhand i would tell them that if they have a penchant for sweets they should curb that a bit apparently there's a family history of diabetes (laughter) just a word of advice i'm throwing out there for their own well-being yeah and don't be penises see told you (laughs) i understand i'll look into some books if i hear anything i'll send word of course i will be happy to do so are you sure i don't mind it was delicious all right he responds with and you're getting better but perhaps some practice in time until then avoid anyone of any sort of gnomish nobility for a while that's my recommendation he says to you in gnome yes it's been a while since somebody's done that for me thank you thank you it's a bit unbridled i would like perhaps to the word escapes me and he takes another sip of his tea thinks for a second goes i wish to be less crazy-looking and he reaches up and pinches the edge of your cheek and goes well can i just say that i never thought blue would be your color but it looks fantastic just to try something ah i remember those days anyway don't be a stranger wonderful to see you as well and please do send me some fresher treats thank you of course thank you for coming and a pleasure to meet you uh-- taryon darrington pleasure to meet you yes all right you guys make your way back to whitestone you guys make your way back to whitestone you guys return just (chomps) as you step through as you guys return stepping back into the main thoroughfare of whitestone you gather over this time the rest of your friends have done a relatively decent-- they're like three quarters of the way through their tour of whitestone it's very basic they're not going through every single detail but they're going in various sections and ogden has been asleep pretty much the entire time jb johann and astra have been eager for the most part asking questions and some of the time when you're not looking kind of flicking the back of the hat but you've come around now you're heading back up north after coming from the graveyard and both the pelor church and the raven queen shrine that have been built there and you've made your way back northward into the city proper okay is there any specific individual that you've set as the captain of the riflemen of whitestone all right so as you guys approach making your way towards the northern barracks of the city you hear a cluster of small controlled explosions at which point the gnomes all kind of shudder for a second in that moment ogden goes (incoherent yelling) we're under attack okay all right jb wipes the drool from his mouth as you guys approach you see there's a line of ten men and women in armor with rifles they're currently in the process of reloading them and there you see at the edge is a leather-clad kynan who is in the process of instructing loudly the reloading process the use of black powder and the preparation for the rifles for a secondary shot as they all prepare he goes all right and aim arm up in the air they all (clatter) up in front fire (gunshot) they all go off again these big plumes of smoke shoot out from the front you watch as across the way there are a dozen or so hay targets with what looks like cloth and some figures drawn on them that have a number of holes blown through them in multiple places the shots don't have extremely good aim you're looking at ten different people with rifles as you guys approach gently as they're preparing for the next shot you see kynan bring up his arm and look over and see the rest of you and immediately changes his posture he was already in a formal leader position but as soon as you approach it's almost like oh the boss is here to watch and he kind of (inhales) hold we have company turns around and jogs up to the edge of the perimeter of this training ground and he goes hello by what pleasure do we have you-- oh oh well it is an honor to have the trickfoots among us i am captain kynan leore i am the as to recently assigned captain of the riflemen of whitestone and you see him go from-- his whole structured presentation begins to quickly fade as the nerves kick in you can see his voice get a little quivery and his posture begin to fall a little bit these are my riflemen and women it's called riflemen but it's men and women it's a formality it can be changed it can be changed well we're trying they're very very good people aren't they yes and they all don't know how to answer and look at each other and look at him and-- he puts his eyes down slightly sheepishly and guiltily as you say that but-- very well very well i mean very few get a second chance i just don't want to mess this up looks to percival then yes i have been of use oh he looks over at the rest of the folk and goes at ease go get some food the men break and make their way walking out-- but he leans in and says simon is doing well and he pulls up the front of his armor a little bit and you can see the snake belt itself is still on him i mean-- glances over at the men not watching-- and women okay so as you're doing a whole buffalo bill-- (laughter) i need to specify yeah no it's a whole different pit in whitestone to go to he goes ahead and does a little whistle and suddenly the belt turns into a snake and winds its way up the forearm and (hisses) yeah well he's still yours the snake leaps to your arm and coils around well nothing it's a-- i can i can feed him i just didn't think-- it's a belt i don't know-- i'll feed him when you give it to me i haven't had to use it and then should i let it out i don't know i don't know how these things work okay right you gave me a belt and i've used it and it's been great sure with your extensive knowledge of magical snake belts let's see how well this goes i know i love it yeah blow that luck baby 18 yeah he seems fine as a magical snake it can transform back and forth it doesn't appear to require food or water when it's in its belt form it wouldn't necessarily be conscious of the time in between so as far as simon's concerned it's been a very short period of time yes vax very of course yes here i mean he was-- i was just borrowing it for a while okay yeah as he looks over at percy doing all these trick shots in the air and throwing things up and like showing the spinning and the gnomes are like whoa whoa whoa okay me too and thank you sorry about not feeding your snake i didn't-- (laughter) well thank you i was--  (gun noise) and his rifle goes off like in the ground next to him a big plume of dirt next to him and he goes uh-- men and he goes running off toward the rest of his riflemen yeah you shook him a little bit all of that all of it honestly johann at this point is still enthralled and goes where does one procure such a weapon okay good to know good to know astra and astra goes what i think it's sexy and johann's like if you have one lying around you don't need just let me--  okay the standard rifles you do have those yeah eventually you guys are outfitted with two rifles they're not loaded yet you can show them how to load it all right you load it for each of them okay okay so percy loads your gun grog make an intelligence check okay all right you give him an ample amount of powder and he uses it he uses it the right way it's a lot of it but i mean overall he got the gist of it and he's-- (laughs) yeah both rifles locked in the iron balls properly packed into the rifle you both take aim i would like you both to roll an attack roll using your dexterity modifier you're not proficient so it's just a d20 plus your dexterity modifier grog you have disadvantage on this one what did you roll okay so it wasn't a misfire at the very least okay you pull it up vax aim and (gunshot) you watch as the top of one of the hay targets explodes off you managed to make a hit it's a little off but you managed to at least make contact no but it does come up and you have to catch yourself grog does not move at all when it fires (explosion noise) when you do fire nothing reacts none of the hay reacts and there's a pause and about 300 feet back you watch as a small tree goes (cracking heavy impact) okay you do and it's a really rapid reload we're talking schwarzenegger t-2 spin the shotgun one-handed (gunshot) are you shooting at grog go ahead and roll with proficiency and your dex modiifer the same target vax the impact of the head you hit you watch as the entire upper part of its torso and head (explosion noise) explode into a spray of slightly seared and slightly burning hay as he runs back you can see as johann's like is there any chance that we could shoot one you see astra's (squeals) they both look at each other and they both jump off the carpet they're not even listening they're both picking up the two rifles they pick them up and are looking at it and holding it upward and aiming it sideways they don't really know how to do it do you help them load it all right so for the purposes of this okay no terrible misfire the first shot is johann because he pushes astra back and is like let the men do this first takes the rifle from you picks it up and aims it at a weird angle and i just pull right here on the thing right over here (explosion) before he finishes it goes off it goes flying from his hand and he stands there for a second with his hands open and as he turns back towards you you can see there's a little bit of singe on his eyebrows the burst of the smoke and the flash seared the front of his face ever so slightly he turns to you and goes that was amazing did i hit it i hit it you're up lady astra's like oh and she runs up takes the gun same thing okay so you load it properly she takes it and aims at one of the other targets (gunshot) she manages to hold onto it this one doesn't blast out of her hand you don't see any point of impact she's like ow and she releases her hand because of the heat of the barrel she puts it on the ground and goes that was fun i'm good grog you look down and notice that there's a little bit of bleeding from your knee and there's a small bullet hole that you didn't notice as you were running back it only went in an inch it wasn't that hard of an impact eventually as you guys are heading back now after the rest of your tour you meet up with the rest of the party as you guys finish the tour-- vax bumps you all right you guys catch up with the rest of the party and you all make your way to the castle at about the same time make a perception check okay vax okay no reaction no twitch they have no idea what you were talking about and they have not stolen anything you've been keeping a close eye as you guys all reconvene for a mid-afternoon lunch at the castle everyone's made their way in the meal's been placed less pastry-heavy than the breakfast that johann originally ordered but there are meats and breads and it's actually pretty hearty for a midday lunch and they keep bringing more in you get the sense that the trickfoots don't eat like royals often and they're definitely making the best they can of the situation you see jb eating her meal and helping ogden as you guys settle in what do you want to do okay he's currently at the table and he's tracing his finger on the side while occasionally jb goes uncle and taps him oh right she goes and takes a piece of bread and soaks it in the soup for a second and puts it in his mouth he chews on it for a bit and as you walk over he pushes jb's hand out of the way and goes oh young pike hello i did i haven't had a rest like that in a long time your city gets very loud that's the one jb peeks over ogden's shoulder listening in it was quite nice actually we got to watch them fire these-- anyway ogden pushes in not even paying attention to her it's so good to see you but of course he takes his stick and stands up jb's like oh where would you like to go jb you watch her face go-- of course enjoy i'll just-- and she goes back to her meal and begins cutting it up with fervor or frustration i don't know where you live she sidelong glances at pike helping ogden up as they begin to make their way out you know what yes i would love that so you guys begin making your way while they exit because ogden's a little slower you and ogden eventually make your way out to the front part of the castle walking along the side grounds he's with his cane walking what did you wish to discuss young pike you have definitely had one constructed it's a smaller scale the larger temples here are for pelor and such and you've been away most of your focus has been in vasselheim and emon so you haven't done the full temple construct here but there's a small shrine that you've built so at least you can go there of course lead the way i am your guest i am here at your behest okay there was a big building that collapsed during the briarwood period the lot was cleaned out and it's a small standing shrine to sarenrae at the time being to eventually be the placeholder for the full temple's construction that you'll build around it but for the time being essentially a few small benches set in a circular stone fashion and there's a fountain-like carving a simple carving of sarenrae for people to pray to you eventually walk him to that centerpiece it's mostly empty this time of day nobody's currently in the process of upkeep there isn't a need for it some fallen leaves and it's a little dirty on some of the benches but you brush it off and you both sit on the bench looking up at the big winged statue of her he sits down no idea thank you it's very peaceful after looking around for a minute he leans into you and goes pike we need to talk i've been tying together the missing pieces of our history for most of my life this information has helped me once before and as i'm sure has been discussed at length with your friends there is a curse upon this bloodline my research has brought me some knowledge and i've been able to cast this curse out of one trickfoot before but i failed once before that and i miss her to this day do you want to know the history of our curse over four centuries ago when our kin still occupied the city of witterbach up in the cliffkeep mountains long before our bloodline took the name trickfoot there was a wily rock gnome called og pipemender now og grew jealous of his brother lons and his business's success and his marriage apparently so seeking a means of balancing their standing bringing lons down a peg or two og plotted to undermine and shame his brother and destroy his life now he was successful in this plot at least from what i've gleaned lons was ruined but not before it was revealed to lons that og himself was the culprit now cornered and fearing for his life og lashed out and slew his brother he fled witterbach and wandered the mountains for weeks scavenging to survive on a full moon he was visited by a vision of what is believed to be the lawbearer erathis herself at least an aspect of her at the very least now this grave injustice he had committed did not go unnoticed by the lawbearer and it required punishment and a curse was set within the very blood of og himself one that lay dormant from generation to generation unless those carrying the seed fell to extreme selfishness and wanton destruction of others now we trickfoots may not have the best reputation but what we do we do it to survive and we hurt no other in the process those that wander too far into the dark call up this curse and the shades within them slowly hollow them out leaving a ravenous selfish beast of a gnome these visions that i've dreamt i've had them before they were not wrong i saw the shades within my beloved ishma but knew too little at the time to stop them i caught the shades within others since within johann here even years and years ago and used what i learned to exorcise them out now these visions i have now show you young pike a darkness within you far greater than the others and i don't know what has drawn them to you you walk with such light and i am worried what could be hidden beneath all the layers of silver and gold and blue and sarenrae's blessing that could still draw these shades to you where you've been what you've done i know not i know not the justice of the goddess can presume not to know i don't bother myself with such unknowable things but i am here to try and help if i can if you'll have me i've had an entire lifetime to think and learn and research and regret this is only over the past couple of years but i knew not where to find you until you sent your letter she is very dedicated she's very sweet she's a bit distracted at times she cares much for the stories of you and your friends the poor thing's been at my side for the majority of her youth i feel like a burden she looks after me and not much else so she lives vicariously through the stories she manages to assemble of you they all know we've had time to speak i was the one that insisted we come see you and i do apologize for the rest of them they are unique it's understood like i said we have a reputation one that you've as far as what i've heard been able to kick to the curb it's adorable i don't see them i don't see much anyway i've cast it out once before i've been trying to define a ritual that can do so i find little in faith however the exorcism is based in divine magics and some bits of information i've gleaned from the age of arcanum long ago back when possession was a common thing and gods still walked the earth what i've found-- and he leans forward on his stick -- is to perform this pardon me it's the breakfast all the oatmeal it's good for the fiber what i would require would be the highest point on the highest mountain in the vicinity as high up as we can go like somewhere in those mountains there he points a broad stroke to the north northeast to the alabaster sierras that surround the parchwood and when the moon is full as that was when the original curse was cast upon us there we hallow the ground to prepare perhaps you or another individual of a clerical background could do so and it does take some time to hallow it but with the ground hallowed and the moon is full i can perform the exorcism now should the shades be strong enough to survive the exorcism as they have once before it will be up to you and your friends to slay them while they're bound on that land and if you cast them to the shadows where they came the blood curse on you would be no more they are passed on through the bloodline from an individual yes overall i know not that involves silly crazy god stuff and well they haven't been around often there are a few things we need to prepare for the exorcism that i don't have the access of if you wish to go through with this let me know if you find this all mumbo jumbo and you don't believe me i don't blame you either and we can be on our way choice is yours you're the one the visions brought me to of course take your time they're about-- jb jb how close are we to the full moon he's shouting out into nothing you're not there make a nature check nature check you're not sure you're not very involved or invested in the cycles of the moon very well thank you for being so kind to family that you owe nothing to that warms my heart and to hear you say that maybe one day i will be as well before my time is up i think so too he reaches out and pinches the air about a foot off of your face there it is all right your gray blob is very nice thank you for showing me if you don't mind (grunts) you guys begin to slowly make your way back to castle whitestone that's where we're going to take our break we'll come back here in a few minutes and flame strike all right guys we'll be back here in just a minute we do have another wyrmwood giveaway in the chat room this is for this awesome-- we're still going this is lacewood lacewood deck box it's made of wood that is lacy i don't know well now you get to get a wood that everyone on here is jealous of if you go ahead and enter the code word in the twitch chat is 'family' so when you're prompted go ahead and put 'family' and see if you can win see you guys here in a few minutes [break] she walks alongside you at a comfortable three-foot distance but she's walking with you i am walking next to you she's behind and to the side right she quickens her pace you know gnomish gait it's beautiful what's it like having a home that's very nice we're always moving from place to place we can't afford to put stakes down anywhere and it doesn't take long for people to figure out who we are trickfoots let's just say that some of our family aren't the most subtle she looks down and to the side and averts her gaze they're good people they're very good people johann has done a lot for us but he's more prideful than the rest of us as soon as anyone starts any shit he's the first to get in their face about it he's a fiery one it's why astra took to him she's something she looks around at the whole city probably right here it's very nice people here are far less dubious than the folks in kymal at the very least i miss her a lot we grew up together i don't know if you knew that i don't know the specifics of it but me and her were both in our first decade we were friends she was my only friend at the time i've always been a reader they tell me the first of my kind so i didn't take to making new friends very well that and uncle needs someone to look after him and i didn't really want to drop the ball on that i'm a person you have a library yes please (laughs) in castle whitestone oh your personal library it's not huge i know but it took a while to construct it and then some books have made their way in it's maybe a third full but as you show her she's like what kind of books do you have yeah i've only heard a few things she takes her straightened hair to the side and she nervously steps back with it and smiles with her little gap tooth are you sure she starts getting a little dark and says not in the books no nobody really writes books about the trickfoots i know what ogden's talked about and why we're here i think he wants to try and help not in my lifetime the last one ogden went to was before our time me and pike it doesn't happen often-- the vision at least i don't know if it's a coming of age thing or not no i wish i did that would be interesting would be different she takes the book (sighs) really (stutters) okay well you already have one okay well we'd have to talk to uncle ogden about that he knows it better than anybody maybe i don't know you're sure okay she follows after you as you guys head back to the castle eventually you guys stumble up to the castle and there's taryon with doty what are you guys in the process of doing right now tary i mean yeah we should get ogden though he knows more than i do about it okay and she goes in to tell you what she knows of the curse in fair detail talking about how long ago there was people in the family that apparently killed a brother and pissed off a god and ever since the family was cursed so they left what was once the gnomish city of wittebach and the curse seems to manifest when a trickfoot falls too deep into the spell of selfishness or dark thoughts and habits and manifests in these shades that eventually hollow them out to the point where they are nothing but a being of avarice and greed well it's part of the reason that we have such a bad reputation those that befell the curse kind of tore a path through the countryside i haven't seen anyone i don't know this is stuff that i heard from uncle ogden hopefully we never find out those that draw too close to it that's what i know about it i know that's why i'm worried she's nodding all right yeah yeah i should go you join up with pike and ogden you guys reconvene now it's getting later in the day dusk is taking what do you wish to do all right meal is prepared for the guesting trickfoots specified to keep separate from wherever you decide to have your meal but you manage to gather the rest of vox machina at your behest to have a discussion i imagine probably in one of your chambers separately from the rest of the castle where you can talk in private so as you all slowly gather within we'll say pike's room for the simplicity of this close the door behind you and you have all been brought together make a nature check 25 four days it's tary my apologies for using a word with a-- i read a lot of books growing up i'm sorry pushing close to dusk you are welcome to look weird while you do it four nights from tonight pretty soon make a history check percival okay as far as-- from what pike told you-- as far as high up in the mountains and a good place that you can imagine for a moonlit ceremony there is a place it's a rock shelf to the northeast of whitestone on the salted bluffs it's called the dawn table it's a rock shelf used for prayer when the spring rolls around a lot of fishermen go there and leave offerings it's meant to bring-- i wouldn't say a good harvest but a good season for catching fish and trying to bring food back to whitestone so that's pretty high up it's gonna be probably about two and a half days' travel on foot if you have a way of getting there that part of the mountain is pretty-- they do have trees but the trees are pretty thin they're like pine tree that wide at the most and you need a pretty thick tree to transport via plants you can cut off about half a day's travel about a day's worth of travel i guess all right you sit there and you close your eyes and you focus in front of you on pike's gnome form interestingly enough  you get nothing probably not in one casting but you could do double-cast like two trips and get all of you up pretty quick well teleport via plants whoever can fit through there in that short time you can probably get you guys and the gnomes through but referring to your wind walk which how many targets can that affect at once up to ten willing creatures there's four so you'd leave one behind which you'd have to talk to them about that there's keeper yennen but he's like-- kash has been in vasselheim doty technically counts as a creature though it is much like a golem or a construct of some kind it would be considered a creature it is a construct so in theory you would have to tell doty doty turn into wind and that probably would work it moves pretty quick 300 feet flying speed of 300 which is ten times as fast as you walk and without-- going straight up the mountain you could make the full journey talking with percy about this from the base of the mountain to the dawn table in about two hours the entire journey you could make in about six and a half hours without tree-stride it lasts for eight hours so you'll be using most of the duration to get there you could probably fly back if you want to or tree-stride back if you had a tree you could find up there to do it so yeah you could do that okay so what do you do you go and gather up the other trickfoots you approach the rest of them ogden jb whenever you guys want to you can see johann and astra kind of turn over to ogden ogden goes yes that would be perfect when is the next full moon four days all right that gives us time to prepare i need a few things for this ritual i don't know how to retrieve them necessarily i require a jug of water that has been blessed by a priest of the moonweaver the moonweaver is one of the gods largely elven worship you guys have crossed a number of temples that worship the moonweaver in syngorn and some other-- you do find them occasionally in civilization but they're more the kind of shrines that you find out in the center of the forest goddess of the moonlight and autumn he says also as part of a reagent for the exorcism a diamond worth no less than 1000 gold pieces that will be consumed by the actual ritual i also need a solid pound of dried lavender and a half a pound of powdered sulfur and of course you pike and that should be sufficient to complete the ritual no no either the shade is cast out and destroyed or it's cast out and then you destroy it either way you should be fine depends twice three times it's gone right twice that was the first time i didn't know what i was in for and i couldn't save them and you see he gets really dark and focused in himself for a second you see the glimmer across the glasses on his face and he goes they begin to grow hatred for all those they once loved they begin to strike out at the world around them take whatever they like and those that stand in their way are merely to be cut down eventually at least from what i've seen they continue to take until somebody cuts them down they just look like themselves but their whole personality changes what i've seen are just the visions i've had if you wish not to go through with this that is up to you we can leave and be on our way i've just come to help if we can if we do this ritual and nothing comes of it then you're right as rain perhaps not now but someday in the future when met with a terrible choice if you choose a darker path that may be the window needed for the shades to take hold and begin to install in their dark interests well i need some blessed water the sulfur represents the earth the diamond represents the refraction of the moonlight and the water is the catalyst the lavender is to be burned the sulfur represents the earth in this place but the lavender is burned as a sort of incense that helps provide a space of the hallowed ground to present a cage for this entity so it cannot flee and come back you could probably get most of that in syngorn with one trip yeah then pike will be safe i'll look the fool and we'll go our separate ways none taken that's a good bumper sticker you can cause existing lavender to bloom stronger otherwise the lavender you create in the space will vanish once the spell is done but yeah all right so you guys go to bed okay that you can they have supplies for you at the ready you gather them easily from the pale guard they have some tents that haven't been used for a while you take those with you supplies are given you head to syngorn make an investigation check yeah within a short time as the evening draws in it's not a full moon but it's still a very big moonlit night and you find in syngorn one of the larger temples to the moonweaver there's a night guide there named nusem and it's the temple of the pale light and so as you approach him and give your request he's like a jug of our blessed water that is an unusual request we take no money but offerings in trade of equal value as you honestly see fit whatever you feel would be a viable trade within the eyes of the moonweaver herself roll a religion check do it religion 11 you know that she is the goddess of the moon the night and of autumn she is known as-- she doesn't fall on the good or bad spectrum she's generally a bit of a trickster but however tends to be used or at least called to by young love to bless trysts to not be discovered that's kind of the gist of what you can pick up on that roll yeah takes a moment looks at it i think the goddess will be pleased and he puts it in his robes and he takes the blessed water and hands it to you it's a small pretty heavy-- especially when it's filled-- clay pot that is sealed at the top with multiple rounds of rope and some sort of a dark black tar-like substance that seems to seal the top and he passes it over to you and you take it all right so you gather that you find your way back without issue we'll say without issue okay so you attach it to trinket's armor on the top easy enough so you guys eventually make your way back to the town you guys find an evening of rest you complete restore your spells you sulfur go ahead and make a tinkering check this is intelligence modifier and proficiency bonus yeah okay for you 'cause most of the sulfur that you have currently has already been put in with the salpeter and other means of creating the gunpowder so you have to reverse-engineer a lot of it it's not going to be pure what you have or at least not all of it i mean you have some pure sulfur still but to get the full half-pound of it it's gonna be a little dirty but you manage to get it to happen and vax is providing the lavender okay all righty and the diamond who's giving the diamond or do you have one how much is it worth well choose a diamond all right that'll suffice all righty so as the morning comes you all awaken you gather your materials you assess as a pool what you have at your disposal and presenting these various elements that you've gathered before uncle ogden he inspects each one very carefully sniffing the sulfur feeling and tasting the lavender takes the water and brushes his fingers through it takes the diamond and inspects it sets it all down on the table and goes yes this will suffice whenever you're ready let's make our way to wherever you find is necessary to do this ritual very well trickfoots trickfoots trickfoots they're all right around him and he's like hello anyone johann reaches out and touches his shoulder ah yes there you are come we have an exorcism and so they follow you as you grab your materials how are you doing this you're doing multiple trips okay early morning with the wind walk you can get ten creatures which is you seven plus-- you put trinket in your necklace-- doty which is eight and you can take two of the gnomes if you'd like or would you prefer to leave with the four of them and them come back for them all right so you guys go ahead and utilizing the-- all right easy enough to do you've seen these woods or the perimeter of the woods at least so you know vaguely a tree in the direction that percy points you towards so with that you touch the edge of the sun tree the exterior of it opens into a doorway and through that-- (laughs) the trust-fall that is percival and vex rushing through the sun tree before it closes behind you trust that they are at the destination required and will meet you there it closes and with that with the supplies gathered the rest of you all have the spell commence and you are able to concentrate for a minute to turn your physical form into that of a white cloud-like mist you watch as the gnomes do so and this is the first time you're doing this as well taryon and it's a unique experience you're about as giddy internally that you cannot express it through word because you are a cloud of mist but you watch as the smaller gnome mists also kind of appear and some of them start swirling around excitedly and one of them just seems to drift one of the other ones comes by and cuts it off and shows the direction (laughter) following towards the path which percival pointed you guys so this is about a six-plus-hour journey as you're coasting over the entirety of the parchwood forest and it is beautiful it's actually not too cloudy today you've come past winter's crest it's been a few weeks since (sing) i can fly twice as high yes sorry vex and percy five years of this and let this be a lesson for when you name your characters for your campaign as you guys approach you all condense back into your mist form except for the four other clouds that are all circling and circling eventually one of them kind of congeals and turns back and it's jb well you do now and they all eventually come back and you see before you it's this clifftop flat entry with a series of rocks that jut out at certain places and rubble and some general erosion has occurred and there at the very edge of the cliff-- and it is this cliff that shoots out over you can look over the side and see the sea to the northeast just above the shearing cliffs you see the sunlight hitting thousands upon thousands of small distant sparkles as the waves catch elements of the sunlight down below and as you come up to the edge and look down it is a very very long fall thousands and thousands and thousands of feet to rocks and ocean but there's a large stone archway there not yet you guys are just making your way there you do notice the rock archway looks both ancient and very well-constructed and it's impressive that even though the erosion and the nature of the strong cliffside winds that come up there it's kept as well as it has you also see a number of long-rotted baskets and sacks and dried decomposing fruits and fish bones you can see where basically the remnants of different offerings were left up here as part of the pelor blessing to the fishermen that walk through the salted bluffs eventually vex and percival make their way up here as well and you guys are now full journey about midafternoon with three days until the full moon you can move back a bit yeah the bluff itself is maybe about 70 feet from one side to the other it's flat so you can move it further back towards this edge of the cliff as opposed to being the one that's seaside okay so you guys have a few days here to relax get to know each other ask questions and hear stories about young pike embarrasingly get to tell them of the tales of what you guys have done and inform them from a firsthand basis of what vox machina has accomplished for the past few years they all seem enraptured jb more than anybody and she seems to almost finish some of the tales you get the sense that she's been very very well-versed in what you guys have done and is genuinely invested in the stories as they happen anything else you guys want to accomplish in the three days in particular make an investigation check okay you do note this in the first couple days while it's been long blown-over and destroyed and scattered you do see elements that seem like a large nest that have been wind-scattered up here and left for a long time and as you look through the chunks and pieces you see bits of dried leather flesh and with that in mind over the next two days you begin to see way off in the north what appear to be a number of flying entities that group in clusters that kind of exist over the cliffside down along the actual mountain edge and occasionally have apparently made distant nests and are still maneuvering in the distance make a perception check using the combination of your broom and your ranger-like vision you've encountered these creatures once before at the salted bluff but avoided them there are small clusters of harpies that make their home here on the cliffsides by the ocean yep they picked them apart last time you first made your way to whitestone so you're very careful to make sure that whatever camp you set up is camouflaged as best as possible since that is one of your specialties as a ranger it's not too bad go ahead and make a stealth check please this will be your stealth check for the camp not on your camp i'll say for the purposes of that no add your stealth okay so not on a camp for yourself maybe and it helps you-- it allows you-- your ability to camouflage elements of your space allows you to help and use your stealth for this whole endeavor but two days go by harpies don't seem to pay mind there's a couple of close calls where a couple fly overhead but you all see them coming and get low and tell the gnomes to go inside and get behind the rocks and they seem to pass without actually noticing your presence eventually you make your way to the fourth day and the sun begins to set at which point the gnomes begin to gather up with the rest of you and ogden hobbles his way in your direction going-- waiting for her to cross camera okay (laughs) the time is nigh we must prepare the ritual and for the purposes of this can we bring in the battlemap that is on this side this side please this way's great (impressed noises) is it really that's a problem all right so here are the gnomes clustered doty cannot i believe sure and actually this is a point as well because part of this was supposed to be hallowed ground which requires the hallow spell which is a 24-hour casting period or let me see the actual casting time on that you would know this and he would have spoken to you in advance to do this so we'll say yeah hallow its casting time is 24 hours the herbs and oils and incense required to do this one alone costs 1000 gold which the spell consumes so that's 1000 gold you have to mark off to do this but you infuse this area with holy energy during this time period you guys are waiting and doing so this whole ground becomes hallowed now you get to choose a second effect of this if you'd like which is affected creatures can't be frightened while in the area darkness fills the area if that's what you want daylight fills the area don't know if that's going to affect the ritual or not seeing as how it's a moonlight-based element affected creatures have resistance to one type of damage of your choice except for bludgeoning piercing and slashing you can have energy vulnerability silence what would you prefer okay affected creatures cannot be frightened so any of you and any creatures that end up in the space cannot be frightened the 60-foot radius which is pretty much most of this area becomes hallowed so as the night draws to a darkened close-- or as the day draws to a darkened close you guys can choose your positions to prepare for this yes yeah we'll say this happened-- this isn't the ritual this is a different spell to prepare for the ritual so while you were doing this was during the time in which you managed to go ahead and avoid being seen and use your stealthiness this was in advance of it the hallow spell has been completed the area has been locked in the spell is cast now the final ritual is mounting so at this point you're asked for some help by ogden to move some of these rocks out of the way you guys slowly shift this pile of rocks over here he begins to then with the help of jb take the sulfur and begin to scatter it around in a circle in this opening right here so the other two are gonna stay back up on there all right so percival gets up onto the high ground there all righty over here all righty all righty so you want to stay near this central rock there okay trinket's gonna hang next to grog perfect there a bit right there okay so you're hiding on this side poking through keyleth over here over here okay there's keyleth taryon okay so pretty much where you are okay got you so pike the circle puts you at about there in the centerpiece you watch as the sulfur is drawn around you in a wide circle all right jb now begins taking the water and splashing it throughout the center of the circle she opens the jug with the help of grog and walks around with grog and is just taking big handfuls and splashing all the blessed water to fill in the circle between-- oh god-- where the sulfur was in the interior of it all around so it soaks all the dirt you can see it actually goes darker in color as it absorbs the liquid and it seems you can now very very clearly see the circle and at this point as the night has really hit the moonlight the full moon is plainly visible and that bright bright white moonlight is making stark shadows and a very visible perspective of everything on this field so pike you're asked to stand in the center there as right over here next to taryon facing you ogden hobbles over looks at you he holds the diamond in his hand pike are you ready okay ogden is holding the diamond out close your eyes concentrate on the goodness within you he holds the diamond out in front of him and just starts chanting slowly under his breath okay you drink the potion of mind reading okay he's loudly-- he's holding this diamond forward and he's loudly speaking in a language i don't think any of you understand (mutters gibberish) currently at that moment it sounds like a bunch of gibberish (mutters gibberish) okay against a dc of okay as you focus your attention pushing in to probe deeper all you get is the gibberish natural 17 sorry is that what it says as he's chanting (mutters gibberish pauses continues to mutter gibberish) goes right back into concentrating again what languages do you know languages barely common okay none of you know the language he's speaking it just sounds like gibberish to you oh and dwarvish because you have the belt as he begins chanting the diamond begins to glow faintly a greenish color just very very on the inside just ever-so-gently he begins to chant louder and louder (louder gibberish) as he does the diamond flashes brighter and brighter green and eventually the green coloration fades and the diamond vanishes from his hand and he falls to his knees (heavy breathing) look and as he points forward towards pike you guys glance over and look at pike and you watch as from the ground around her this black cloud-like mass begins to pour out of her legs and knees in a swirl around her person you pike look around you as it begins to fill the space around you and it begins to coalesce into this large cloud of darkness it rumbles and gathers like a miniature thunderstorm and you watch as the clouds begin to churn forming dozens of screaming faces all wailing in a discordant moan roll initative (yelling) all righty who's at the top we've got 25 to 20 all righty 20 to 15 18 15 keyleth 15 to ten ten to five tary what'd you get percival you're up first it's pseudo-surrounding her and right behind her like it's kind of forming behind her and adjacent to her body okay go ahead and roll damage they took my pen 5d6 of kids in the hall damage got it (laughs) got you so as you fire-- this is with bad news or with your-- this is animus okay so as you fire and turn it over you look down and watch as the bullet just seems to pass through it and then almost catch the edge of the rock here and splinter off and doesn't seem to affect it directly at all nope you watch as the energy kind of crackles and dissipates amongst the rock okay you go ahead and attempt to hex it as you focus on it nothing seems to hit the hex has no effect and you don't sense any connection with this creature you don't see any of the smoke or shadow surrounding it the hex has no effect okay right now the two other gnomes are just waiting off to the side watching aghast and you watch as ogden is slowly with his staff backing up hand out looking freaked out backing into taryon look over and noticing his presence and then focusing back on the horrible thing that's surrounding pike right now and he looks genuinely frightened is that your turn okay percival's done vax you're up it hasn't had its turn yet you're watching this 12-foot-tall swirling almost slow-moving tornado of black cloud and smoke that is starting to form all these horrible faces forming this cacophony of sounds and screaming and moaning fly her up next to percival okay so you try and pick her up make a strength check 'cause she is a very heavily armored tiny little-- tank of a gnome 17 you do and it slows your movement to half when you're carrying her but you manage to pick her up as you do so you watch as the form sends this pseudopod of a screaming face and arm swinging out towards you that is a 17 you just pull her out of reach as it swings out in your direction for the rest of your movement you pull her just up to the edge of the rock there and you can set her down if you want oh god is that your turn okay that brings us to grog right there you come up right to the side of it and you can look up and see it now it's forming this wall of screaming faces at you and a lot of them are watching as-- all of them are facing pike as she disappears and all of a sudden all at once a hundred faces go (shhhp) to you and (gurgling growl) what are you doing okay 28 hits go ahead and roll damage 24 points of damage as you rush up angrily you swing your axe with additional all right 28 all right cool you swing and as your axe cleaves through the side of it you watch as parts of it break open sending chunks of it flying and the creature (shrieks) seems to scream in pain from the impact sure 18 you hit go ahead and roll damage that great weapon master man you swing with the second strike this time you watch as some of the faces implode at the impact and you see a flash of dark matter just get strung out about three or four feet from it as you strike through and it (shrieks) gives a horrible scream in pain as it does so you're not going frenzied okay that ends grog's turn it is now the creature's turn it's going to move moving upwards and trying to catch up to pike but because of the nature of the hallowed ground it gets that far and then stops and is held in place you do go ahead and roll an attack mm-hm actually i think reckless has to be on the first attack of your round yeah you hit 26 all right with it being downed by that movement it moves in and makes its way towards ogden ogden who is backed up against you at this point taryon you watch as the spectacles-- you push him forward (yelps) as it swings forward and you see two of the mouths reach out to attempt to-- that's a three (laughs) both snap and the old gnome would've been bit except you pushed him forward and he kind of like catches himself and both of them miss him by but an inch and he turns around glancing at it still has his hand forward like no as he's clutching his staff at his side to keep his standing that finishes the creature's turn vex you're up jb is over here by trinket and is currently seeing this whole thing occur and is about to go ahead-- it's not her turn yet but she's going to probably-- looks like she's heading that direction to dart behind the rock as you concentrate hunter's mark finds no purchase on the creature you either give trinket the full round of attacks and then you get one attack as a bonus action or you get two attacks and then trinket gets a bonus action attack you did as a bonus action okay so two attacks from trinket go for it both hit go ahead and roll damage nice 20 points of damage from trinket not bad trinket rushes out and bites into the smoky faces and pulls back and you watch as some of the shadow gets yanked with the teeth and then disperses and then vanishes in the air and then turns around big raking claw and part of its midsection shifts with the impact and has to reform you gonna stay where you are okay that finishes your turn all righty keyleth you're up you are-- you have to move five feet further in to be within the sulfur and water line okay okay five-foot radius yeah so you can-- it basically encompasses the whole size of the creature so you watch as in the middle of the sky the full moon that's partially almost at its zenith you watch as almost a secondary moon appears next to it for a moment and a single column of bright moonlight hits the ground yeah and it's illuminating the creature from the inside and where the smoke is you can now see there are portions of it that are burning on the inside like there's small holes being dug through it as the beam continues to focus on it are you gonna-- you can still move the rest of your movement or you can stay where you are right there okay you leap over some of the leftover sacks and offerings there and put your back against the column all right perfect that brings us to the gnomes' turns these guys you watch as johann and astra just move behind the side of the rock they're too entranced to look away but you guys seem to have this handled so they're watching from the side you watch as ogden begins to-- oh god-- he hobbles back behind you taryon and goes like excuse me and pushes alongside you to move behind the rock here the creature does though and (whoosh) just misses over the top of his head the gnome's size is too small and it keeps missing him by about a foot and he backs up going (heavy breathing) holding onto his staff that ends his turn and you watch as jb rushes over behind this rock here and starts shouting up ogden are you okay that's going to end her turn pike you're up you can yes i'll ask you to make an acrobatics check 'cause you're having to leap down from these large five-foot stone drops so you leap down this one as you leap down to there as you hit the ground it's just too much height with all the heavy armor and all the chaos going on that when your foot hits the rock sprains your ankle for a second it kind of folds to the side and you fall down to one knee i'll say with that your movement's going to get you right there you're not in the circle currently okay okay spirit guardians here so you're designating them as the creature their speed is halved when the creature enters the area or starts its turn there it has to make a wisdom save or take the damage right that's how it works okay so that ends your turn pike as you cast the spell there you watch as a series of small ghostly divine-focused creatures appear on the horizon of the circle all looming towards this dark entity that ends your turn pike all righty taryon okay let me see here okay the bead hits the ground and detonates and you watch as there's a flash of arcane energy in the sphere as it encompasses it doesn't seem to affect the creature it looks like it's partway in and partway out and unaffected by the bead do you move doty forward okay there you go so doty just tary all right so that's all doty does is just get ready yeah he can he acts entirely different than you yeah okay he can make a bash and a headbutt yep also how helpful has taryon been in comparison to vex in the past both go for it awesome doty swings forward fist goes through you watch as the creature (gurgling yelp) and then as it's recoiling leans forward and gives it a big old hefty rune-covered doty headbutt to the creature and it seems impacted by it doty not in the circle doty's just outside of the circle apparently that ends taryon's turn percy okay you rush forward at this side you come up to it with your silver rapier 17 that hits go ahead and roll damage okay you watch as you go in to stab it with the rapier as you do it (shrieks) it retracts and you can see parts of it kind of carve open from the impact go for it 24 that hits okay cool as you stab through with the sword electrical energy coursing through you stab through watch as it carves a big hole in the side of its smoky physicality and it kind of shrieks in pain and recoils now some of the faces turning towards you noticing the impact the impact did yeah you watch the weapon hit and you watch the shock burst off and the creature reacted to it okay third strike you swing through heavily and you watch--- how much damage is that 15 points of piercing damage with nice okay you swing with one wide arc and as you do it leaves this large spray of electrical energy that is left behind in pulses after the blade has already passed through it's almost like a lagging slow-mo burst of electrical energy behind the blade as it swings and as it does you watch as the smoke dissipates and retracts from the impact screaming and small faces you see turn to black mist from where the blade passed through okay yeah so roll damage three times 11 13 ten points in a series of zorro-type slashes you just carve through and you watch as it's starting to break apart and dissipate the screams went from aggressive to now (groaning) this like deep sucking inhale it looks like it's starting to look pretty rough that ends your turn all right vax you're up go for it all righty that hits all right all three hit second one's a crit so sneak attack for the first hit yeah you can put it on the crit yeah the ridiculousness of paladins oh a crit i'm gonna pump a smite into it oops 48 for the first hit shit man rogues no okay 29 then third hit 18 times two 46 plus one 29 that's right you got it little boop poke in the side four points all righty as you rush down and stab it in the back as the blade hits and flashes with just the blast the creature (groans) and you carve down and it feels like you're cutting through a cloud through air-- but you watch it separate around as the blade carves down you come up with the second swipe this time hitting directly there's a flash of divine energy as the burst goes off you watch the creature take the impact and separate slowly after where it hit the clouds being pushed back by like a slow-motion blast of the divine energy you pulse through third strike and you swing past and you see it catch the edge of the side (growls) reacts to it slowly but it seems to be having an effect feathers rest to the ground okay grog you're up all right go for it that is your whole plan huh get her scientific that hits 38 on the first one that hits okay ooh third hit it's three hits and that's over 100 damage in one round as you swing up and make three giant axe blows you watch as each cleave is carving a line through this creature and as you hit with each axe blow you watch as its faces begin to disappear in smoke it's almost like with each blow it's beginning to lose physicality in the world and it's beginning to shrink in size it's still wailing and screaming in your face but the impacts are making an effect that ends your turn grog the creature is now going to go ahead and swing in a wide circle in its desperation it's going to go ahead and cause this-- top of its turn yeah well it has to make a save all right so what it does is the moonbeam hits down on it and you watch as it seems to not really react to it like it burns a little bit and you see some kind of sparkling white energy but it's not reacting directly from it at the moment it seems to be like generally trying to avoid it but it's not seemingly taking any damage from it now it's going to go ahead and do a big sweeping strike to try and hit everything around it you watch as these pseudopods begin to spin like a buzzsaw in the vicinity what's your ac grog yeah that's right misses you against trinket yeah what's trinket's ac 21 misses against vax-- that's a natural one and against percy that is a-- what's your ac that misses travis and oh and against doty as well doty-- what's doty's ac misses it spins around and it manages to just have no effect on any of you you move out of the way dodge it misses you it just passes right through doty with no effect that brings us now to vex's turn he's literally the worst creature that's ever existed wait 'til your turn it's okay what're you doing vex you can make an investigation check to see you might have to go closer okay trinket has to attack as part of your attack action wait let me double-check that i know i changed that that's how it used to be so yes you can do that you can do that you can have him attack and then watch him okay okay have trinket go ahead and attack that hits go ahead and roll damage 12 is it a bite or a claw trinket reaches out and bites and snatches through and you watch as the black smoke dissipates in the area and screams again in his face as he pulls back you're using your action to investigate roll an investigation check pardon me buddy all right that ends-- that's the end of your turn right no you can move this way this way closer to the gnomes okay well since i left my-- imagine you're flying for this one i left my pillars at force grey so i'm going to have those back i figured you were since you usually are unless you don't want to okay then you're back by the gnomes all right cool that ends vex's turn keyleth you're up okay keyleth your turn okay you step forward a little bit there are multiple faces they're all different creature faces they all look to be humanoid they're all shouting and screaming and shifting and roiling inside sure this would be your action to do that but yeah yeah make a perception check okay glancing at it all the faces seem relatively blank and it's mostly the same face over and over and over again so there's no real variation to them that's your whole action yeah okay so at this point the gnomes over here are just staying where they are you watch as ogden takes another hobbled step back past taryon and goes protect me and puts his hand up to you and kind of hides partially behind you taryon jb stays there she seems relatively safe and watches as vex approaches and is like (heavy breathing) and moves along the side of the rock pike your turn no the closest gnome to you would probably be astra she's over here so you walk up to astra most of your movement there as you back up make an intimidation check 11 as soon as you put the mace she goes pike what are you doing pike the creature's still alive and she points over in that direction she's not paying much mind to your threat you still have your bonus action you can be pretty accurate with a guiding bolt but guiding bolt is an action okay so this is less of an attack and more of dropping it on her foot as it hits we'll say 'cause you dropped it on it she goes (yelps) and she picks her foot off pulling it out from underneath and it's-- she's wearing a light leather boot it hurt her toe pretty bad she's like (sounds of pain) and johann's like astra are you okay pike be careful he's kind of helping her does that end your turn all right taryon you're up she's right there jb is over on-- like ten feet to your left ogden's just right next to you almost holding onto your-- the back of your leg for protection and he's like protect me okay that is a no that is a no-no-no that was a natural four to an addled old man all right so roll 5d4 force damage as you throw the bead down it bursts in a flash of energy and light and you watch as ogden's staff just gets fucking thrown 25 feet in the air from the blast he's like (yells) he falls on his side and gets back up and you see him now encased in this sphere of force immediately this smoke creature vanishes can doty-- i don't think doty can move the sphere can he okay yeah it's a hamster ball he's just like-- at this point he goes you killed it that's amazing pike is saved the sphere gets picked up wait huh okay she's just starting to dart off and you grab her by the wrist go ahead and make a grapple check make an athletics check eight you go to grab for her wrist and as you grab she wrenches out of it and goes darting this way what's the dc or the save on that i have it right here it is a strength check against your spell dc so you watch as they both turn invisible and then all of a sudden a bunch of vines go (crinkles) around a gnome-like form (cheering) she gets some distance what's the grasping vine-- 15 dexterity natural 20 you put the grasping vine out and she just-- (heavy breathing) i know all right so as you aim you watch as a raven swoops down go ahead and make an athletics check natural one you grab her and lift her off the ground and she's now screaming as you pick her up into the sky the moonlight still kind of casting down doty is now carrying this sphere and walking towards the edge over here okay she's breathing super super fast and at this point you see as he's walking over to the edge ogden's like you-- look you saved everyone good job (laughter) pike pike we have-- you have been saved from the darkness of a family line of terrible curses he's walked to the very edge of the cliff pike pike pike pike what would sarenrae think what would sarenrae think yeah more so than you've ever seen him he's been crotchety and immobile this whole time and now you watch him up against the glass and he's standing up straight and he's like pike pike seriously it's fine it's fine what would sarenrae think oh no-no-no seriously it's fine we're family yes i-- it was used in the spell the spell that we used to summon the creature make an intimidation check i'd say you have advantage given this circumstance given this circumstance you definitely have advantage he goes (sighs) and holds the diamond out in front doty goes and-- tary no-no-no he's now looking down at the sphere of force below him and looking down to the waves crashing at the very very small distant shore you can have the diamond back it's just-- look we don't have a lot you have plenty we hear of all the great deeds you've done all the dragons you've killed all the vast amounts of money and gold you've procured the past couple years of your adventures and we get sent a measly sum a small hint of nothing but a paltry pinch she didn't and yet we came to offer you nothing but a fantastical story of redemption and the healing of a family and you got to know your cousin who you've not spoken to since you left the sphere dissipates it's been a minute and he goes (screams) and just plummets off the side okay go ahead and make a dexterity saving throw what is it (whiff) (screams) not safely where are you dropping her you're over here right now you picked her up and went over this way she tumbles stops about five feet from the edge she's still hyperventilating you dive down he's just like (screams) just tumbling down as he falls faster towards the cliff rocks and you can just barely see the waves crashing from the moonlight that's hitting him as you're just in a full-on raven dive towards it grasping vine is a concentration spell you'll lose the entanglement if you do it and with that without even really much of a resistance from her she's tangled up in the rope and falls on the ground on her side go ahead and make a dexterity saving throw actually for this in particular because it's less of a reaction this is a-- make a dexterity check this is just a plus your dexterity bonus you reach out once and grab a section of the cloth and it tears-- and he keeps plummeting you watch as the stones below-- it's a jagged base of the salted bluffs about ten feet before impact as his screaming has stopped-- and you grab him and just (whff) right across the surface of the water but inches his toes-- the tips of his feet skid across the surface of the water as you (whoosh) and rocket him straight back up towards the top of the cliff it's going to take you a little while to get up there now diving is one thing he is unconscious in your grasp yeah so you're slowly flying your way back up you guys are bent over and you can see the raven wings-- you can't quite see whether or not he got him but all you see is vax slowly making his way back towards the top of the cliff she's wrapped up in the rope and she's like (breathing heavily) hi pike i'm sorry i'm sorry i don't care about the money that's what they wanted honestly i just used this as an excuse to get to see you again it would have been fine if no one had found out anything we would have been heroes we would have had no reason to not be friends again we would have saved you as far as you know from a terrible curse and maybe that would have-- maybe then i would have been a hero to you but i'm nothing i'm a caretaker to a swindler and move around too much to make any real friends so that's just my lot in life i guess that's all i know you can see now she's just tears now at this point okay yeah they've let the invisibility down at this point they're both just entangled oh there's some sort of misunderstanding here we were under the impression that there was a terrible curse no no we-- look look okay look we have been following-- (squeals) we've been following that man because he is-- he's my dad and we're really broke and we blew through all the money you sent us very quickly i mean come on how much do you guys got like ten thousand gold that's more than we'll see in our lifetime drop in the bucket changed our life you would have been fine you would have been great you wouldn't have known any better our lives would have improved drastically we would have gone our own way but maybe stayed for a week made you dinner but here we are are we bad are we evil i don't think so but that's up to you miss priest at this point astra's like shh honey honey just calm down and he's like no no-no-no-no no okay she can think she's better than us that's fine you want to fight the trickfoot name that's great you're still a trick-- he hits the ground and all you hear is muffled but she's still one of us (laughter) yeah i gathered as much you wait another few minutes it's a long flight up at this point without the haste i mean the winds do help a little bit because the winds are hitting the cliff and heading upwards so the updraft does help a bit but it takes about five or six minutes or so for him to eventually get his way back up to the top probably longer than that even then eventually you watch as vax returns and drops an unconscious unmoving ogden onto the rocky cliffside floor funny thing when that orb disappeared and he fell so did him and the diamond so he is not with the diamond the diamond is nowhere to be seen he's unconscious okay hello gotcha he glances over at jb who's right now-- head is down just looking at the ground you can see a little bit of moonlight that's coming by you can see the wet streaks on her cheeks he goes that's very very fair that's very kind and very fair as you should right understood loud and clear young pike trickfoot he takes the coins so sorry and how do we get back okay make an investigation check 14 okay i mean they're all pretty prostrate at this point feeling through ogden and astra and johann you find about 400 gold worth of silverware various other coins you find some random odds and ends from the castle that have all been pocketed and hidden in boots hidden in hidden pockets okay entanglement drops gets up okay well i guess we have a long journey ahead of us isn't that right dad and uncle ogden is now standing without the hunch and is like i believe so i think we have quite the journey ahead of us it's about maybe 25 feet this way it clattered against the rocks here and fell to the ground okay you go and grab it it's the same gnarled wood still-- okay okay it is a staff of major image read loud and clear percival (panting) crystal well-- despite circumstances and given that there's no reason to be false it strangely has been a pleasure to meet you all and pike it's good to see you doing so well for yourself come we're leaving johann's like uh yes all right and with that the rest of the trickfoot family begins to make their long meandering way down the mountainside leaving you guys there as you make your way back to castle whitestone with jb we'll pick up that next time as it's getting really late and you can't really beat a button like that on an episode jesus all right guys we're going to end tonight's session there thank you so much for watching (laughter) interesting note all of the attacks that didn't affect him were all the attacks that ogden couldn't see happen i was 'cause i wanted to make it look realistic i don't know a lot i'm sure critrolestats has a number of damage that was dealt to the air i wrote them all down there was a little part of me-- a little part of me that was wondering because-- my little hope was that taryon was going to investigate i tell him and then keep it to himself until everything happened and they went off on their own and then as they were walking away be like by the way that wasn't fucking real (laughter) anyway guys have a wonderful night rest well tomorrow's another day pick up move on
