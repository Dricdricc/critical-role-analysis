wonderful way to kick off the holiday unless i am mistaken that is the last of our announcements with that friends let's jump into tonight's episode of critical role welcome back last we left off the mighty nein had been making their way through the swavain islands in the lucidian ocean after vanishing from the island of darktow with the damaged squalleater renaming it the balleater as you do managed to escape from the diver's grave and the ship graveyard that turned out to be as well as the entity that lived there you had acquired another sphere of uk'otoa-- every time upon making your way to the bisaft isle to get repairs for your ship as it limps along the ocean you discovered that you had a stowaway who had followed you on the ship since darktow the delightful gnome named twiggy befriended you and revealed the item which had sent her on her path to becoming a stowaway the strange clockwork arcane sphere that she seemed to have stolen from an auction house to keep away from a bad man upon toying with this sphere you discovered that it seemed to have some sort of planar elements bits of conjuration magic to it and was dispensing coins and cold weather attire a little more tweaking sent you somewhere else the present party was transported to some extra-planar dungeon if you will an abode of a hundred plus rooms that apparently belonged to a mage from long ago upon exploring and making your way through the various traps and tricks you managed to avoid a few pitfalls trigger a few others gather a few objects fight a cabinet find some books and end up teleported in a scattered fashion into the realm of a young blue dragon yeah for two of you by the skin of your fucking teeth you all managed to figure out the way to trigger the exit and escape in time with twiggy dealing a final blow to the dragon on the way out of which some of you may believe her as no one was present to watch it happen after which you made your way-- you realized you'd been missing for six days that there was some time dilation between the time you spent in the sphere or at least within a few chambers in the sphere versus the time out here the crew had been waiting for a number of days the repairs had been completed on bisaft isle you guys decided to call it an evening and rest up lick your wounds and reflect over what had transpired in the past day the past week the past month who knows with most of you going to a rest and beau and caduceus heading up to the top of the ship to calm and discuss these things you all called it a night so mighty nein as you are still at dock on bisaft isle what would you like to do the following morning let's say it's a long night's sleep because there's a lot of recovery so i'll say without any sort of necessary reference to wake you up for an early point you sleep in till near noon the one that says this is laura's don't fucking touch-- laura i didn't know there was a donut in there it just said don't touch to be fair that's one of the perks of being an adult you know a little bit you've passed here once or twice it's the largest of a set of four parallel islands but for the most part it's not really cultivated the jungles here are fairly thick the fruit trees and exotic creatures make it an interesting pass-by port but also a dangerous thing to push into the thick mangrove trees choke most of the coastal areas except for on the south which is where the actual town of bisaft port is which is where you guys are currently set you do know that because it's cluttered it tends to be a favorite spot for contraband out in the jungle but the creatures that live there are pretty dangerous so most people avoid that there are some remaining signs of the ki'nau people that used to be indigenous to these islands before they all became part of the clovis concord that's about all you know i mean it's a small village maybe 800 people or so not all of them i think a few of them were part of the locking mechanism was embedded in the shelf sure insight sure you've learned enough yes you have proficiency bonus okay so you guys head back up to the deck and over towards the dock couple of things you notice one you haven't really been out of the ship to see the port by the time you guys returned it was nighttime and didn't have really a good view as at night on this island there really isn't a lot of light it shuts down at dusk bisaft there's a lot of ships probably about 20 or so they're mainly concord military vessels similar to the one you saw and avoided on the outskirts of nicodranas glancing over there are a few groups of soldiers on the docks stretching looks like they're loading supplies into the ships they're making a stop and the ships are waiting for others to fill up because it's a small dock it's mainly meant to maintain at most six or seven ships at a time so they're having to go in waves to take supplies and they're probably cleaning out some of what bisaft port has sure yeah there's a number you can go ahead and stop there's one of them nearby that is sitting there stretching legs and gathering their supplies in a small sack they probably bought a few things to take on the path yes we are making our way through the waters this is just a quick stop well with the recent attacks the war at the empire it's getting a little hairy so the marquis olesya lapidus is calling many of the warships to the southern coast to be a precaution near the border (noncommittal consideration) this is a conflict between them but it is still important to be careful we have an alliance from a trade standpoint with the empire but they are not entirely the most pleasant people so they can deal with their problems and if comes to us we'll keep it to the shore the good news is as far as i know xhorhas isn't a naval-oriented people what i have heard and he leans in a bit is the underelves apparently snuck past the mountain range and attacked further inland felderwin was assaulted and the fields were set ablaze a smart move in cutting the food from the people eh these beasts are clever be careful felderwin yes i don't think-- we are running along the coast and just heading to the southern area south of the jungles and a little bit past nicodranas and keeping a boundary in the waters you as well he grabs his stuff and throws it over his shoulder and heads back to the rest of the crew apparently set some of the fields ablaze you passed by felderwin when you were traveling both north and south on that road there and it's a heavy source of agriculture in fact it feeds a lot of the military at this point you hear a (throat clearing) you turn around and you see a human male in his mid-40s with salt and pepper brown hair with a thick mustache somewhat stained linen clothing with a length of rope wrapped over his shoulder and he goes hello i'm dockmaster podderan i was the one patiently waiting i guess for you all to return and pay for the good repairs that were required of my crew so if you want to pay up or we're going to have to keep the balleater ourselves curious name balleater by the way reaches into his satchel pulls out a small leather ledger past a few pages there's little counts a couple notes there tears it out and hands it to you it's for 225 gold for full ship repairs 225 no that pot was taken by darktow when they came aboard correct that was the other downside with avantika being wrapped up in this whole plot in darktow was as soon as she was executed they commandeered anything that belonged to her crew and left you guys the ship with the supplies on the ship you got to keep the cannons the cannonballs the gunpowder basic supplies that were left over for survival and upkeep but anything of worth was taken by darktow as their prize appreciate that all right well when're you planning to head off could you leave possibly by end of day i'll give you back 30 gold if that's the case i need to-- and he looks off towards the ships that are waiting and goes i kind of need the space make a persuasion check he goes well come find me and he points over to one of the nicer coastal huts set up right at the outside of the docks right turns back and heads off to his business various military crews are still running up and down the docks carrying supplies to and from what would you guys like to do okay make a perception check the closest place-- the scent catches your nose there's a place called the bisaft meadery meadery no it's a small open-- it looks like a simple tavern but only the back half of it has walls where it's a thatched top there are support beams and there are a number of tables and stools set up and a number of mead barrels set up in the back as well as an open grill made of metal rods welded over each other and a bunch of wood burning beneath it some of the people that live here in bisaft that run this meadery are preparing an open breakfast essentially and a lot of the soldiers are crowding over and filling up spaces the scent catches your nose of cooking boar and various fruits and vegetables that are also being mixed in giving you this sweet meat scent that hits you as you're stepping off the dock the closer you get you realize you've got to get there pretty quickly because it's starting to fill up with a lot of these soldiers as you get to the food it smells delicious it's made for a mass meal for the number of people that are here so this is their way of preparing as much as they can so it's nothing meticulous it's nothing gourmet necessarily but it looks delicious and it looks serviceable yeah due to the nature of this being a small port and the military that are coming in through here people live here from all over you can see a spectrum of skin tones that lead you to believe that there are people both who come from the ki'nau who are from the island people that have settled from the empire folks that have come from marquet and come here and even probably is a few super pale folks here that may have found their way over from issylra for the people that live here it's a fairly diverse cultural capital though a lot of it seems to be mostly ingrained at least the basis of it in the ki'nau people and the base of a lot of the menagerie coast pocket bacon pocket boar well you go ahead and ask there's maybe four servers that are running around like crazy that are in the process of handing things out and taking stuff but there is one individual you see this woman in her late 50s early 60s beautiful brown skin big smile a little heavyset who seems to be looking over the place like she is the owner of this meadery looks over to you and as your eyes meet notices the look of i need help and goes over and goes hello darling how can i help you well i can help with any of these of course what's your name beau well a pleasure to meet you i am bentha tamalos and welcome to my meadery call me bentha please pleasure to meet you as well darling well how many bottles would you like do you want to have glasses separately or do you want to just buy bottles and serve yourselves well it's all pretty sweet it's all brewed here with our island-cultivated honeybees i do as well yes mm they're not immediately local would you like a tour of our hives (laughter) i do have to ask unfortunately there is a tourist price for the tour five silver all right the bottles are 15 gold a piece you wanted two bottles that'll be 30 gold and you wanted how many cups or do you just want your bottles she looks up at you and goes do not worry honey i get you no problem all right i'll prepare this she does some calculations and goes all right for all of that together with your glasses for each of you the meals prepared for each-- unfortunately not much of a pastry opportunity out here on the swavain her smile maintains but the eyes go hard but she goes no doughnuts however for everything involved that would be 35 gold for all glasses of mead all food provided and five silver for the tour for this blue young woman over here all right the food is presented it smells wonderful the din is quite loud now as the various naval officers and naval soldiers of the clovis concord are surrounding the space and chatting talking about bullshit some of it is in common some of it is not while you guys are eating your food anything else you want to do the mead is quite good it is very sweet even just finishing one glass you're like oh this is dangerous and probably going to give you a headache if you're not careful what yeah severe ren faire flashbacks as you guys are in the process of eating your food a recently-awoken and somewhat harsh-looking morning yasha wanders over comes by and slips it over as you guys are finishing your meal and yasha's quietly staring into the plate and eating with a distant intensity like she's prone to-- make an investigation check okay magic shops just so you guys are aware are super rare there's one in zadash and there's maybe one or two in rexxentrum there's definitely not one here they're a relatively rare thing but herbalists are not too hard to find and healing potions while they can heal the crafting of one doesn't require massive arcane knowledge it's through knowledge of medicines and proper brewing techniques however the army has bought up a lot there are two regular healing potions you can find for sale for-- marked up because you're at sea-- 70 gold apiece you can try and haggle if you want to depends on what you're looking for there is a blacksmith by the name of keisha budan who does most of the metalwork for the ship repairs and other general goods that require metalwork around the island as you approach the space she has-- you can tell from the large smokestack pouring out of the top of the forge that she keeps-- but as you approach you can see a young woman in her late 20s or so massive arms her thick black hair pulled back into a tuft and she has a leather apron on you can see now a lot of metal reinforcements used for holding beams together in shipbuilding and she's laying them out one by one as she finishes hammering and then quenching and then hammering and quenching as you walk up she rubs her brow can i help you i can do my best i don't get many like your height in here anyway at the very least i'm looking forward to sating my curiosity she takes it this is very good craftsmanship i could not do this unfortunately the break is very bad do you have the other part of the weapon if given maybe a week with the right materials i could maybe try to work on it but honestly your best bet is probably to go into the coast we don't do much in the way of masterwork weapon craftsmanship here on bisaft my apologies it has been very busy this past day or two it's a lot of commotion but they'll be gone soon we get waves of people coming through she sits up for a second and looks you over can i have a hug (laughter) she goes and takes it and cuddles you yeah thank you you're quite fuzzy and i was curious any time we're here on the island nowhere else to go there are worse places to live i'll tell you that have a good day what's your name caduceus keisha the pleasure was all mine you walk away to the sound of (clanging) in the background as she goes back to work because spice trade and various-- spices not spice-- trade here is quite prominent as well as other such materials in that same avenue various herbs and compounds used in alchemical and medicinal purposes yeah you can find incense here actually it's marked up a little bit because it's bisaft and because it's a trade post out in the middle of the ocean the people can charge a little more and they know they can depending on how much incense you want to get for a person burning incense in their house we'll say about 20 gold worth which would cost you 25 here okay so you take 50 gold worth but it'll cost you 60 we'll say you mark off 60 gold but you write down you have 50 gold worth of incense all right the bee tour she takes you around behind the meadery there's a jungle path that leads through the very lush green trees and it's a very humid day the morning was a little gray in the sky and it looks like it might rain in the next few hours or so she leads you through and is talking about how many years her family has been running the meadery and it's a wonderful place there isn't much of an interest in mead out here in the island so she feels like she cornered the market a bit she has friends that bring it to the other island towns and it makes a fair amount of money she's very proud of it as she's doing the talk she leads you around there are a small sect of wooden hive setups you can hear already as you approach the slight hum of them there's a young boy maybe 12 or so who is wearing a very thick smock with a hood who is in the process of scooping out some of the honey oh well stay here preferably do not get close enough to let them sting you and if one's on you don't freak out and smack it please the tour is not intended to bring you that close she looks very confused and goes okay do you say that she goes well if you want honey i can get you honey ah misan the little boy goes what bring some honeycomb over here for a customer okay he cuts a little piece off with a dull knife and holds it on the edge of the knife and walks over you see the bees covered up his arm and he puts it over and hands it to you it's gooey it's very sweet and very waxy the boy heads back to his work and she's waving some of the bees away and goes sure let's walk back i'll be happy to sell you a jar or two how many would you like of course two jars that'll run you five gold pieces all right she claps her hands together happily and leads you back telling you more about the waves of various traders and merchants that come through some individuals some names she throws out that she's met and flirted with and one that asked her to marry him when she was younger but she turned him down you have no idea who any of these people are but you can't help but be half-fascinated because they're stories you have two jars of honey plus honeycomb for five gold ashley and you're approaching right as they're about to leave from the hives a fungal bloom you can do with decompose druidcraft would be the creation of flowers unfortunately (buzzing) they're doing their business they're not paying any attention to you in the moorlands they have-- it's a marshland where you're from you were given enough supplies for a week or so off of leaving darktow and you guys can create your own food and water there's enough gunpowder for a dozen or so volleys of cannon fire you can drop a gold piece and be good for the next two weeks on flavoring the food for you and the crew at this point in the day it's starting to get close to dusk which caleb during this time-- as you've spent most of the day on the ship to your own devices what are you doing correct you have four books total i think one thing you notice about the sphere its arrangement is entirely different remember where all the places where you had shifted since you had gotten it from twiggy since you've returned it's like an entirely new sphere it has completely refigured its surface the bands have shifted all the different places where you'd place your fingers and thumbs to try to move the different hemispheres are in completely different places it seems that whatever you triggered to get you to the internal space and then returned from reset it in some way the puzzle has started all over that's easy enough to do the jar of beads the book all right so that's the spell book the ink is not normal it is faintly enchanted specifically for the intent of scribing magical things for the purposes of scribing scrolls or scribing spells into spell books the ink will make up to 500 gold worth of scribing you still need paper but essentially any parchment can be made useful as if was the most premium of spell craft parchment with that ink you have the books too the other books one of which after reading through it is essentially a number of studies on the effects of alchemical compounds on corrupted plant life there is one that speaks of public debate records within the forum of zeidel regarding the moral implications of arcane experimentation on prisoners of ghor dranas and warnings of the war with the gods it's a transcript of a debate forum all you know about zeidel-- make a history check actually from your studies zeidel was one of a number of extremely erudite societies in the age of arcanum that had harnessed crystals to make their city hover aloft there were a handful of these in the age of arcanum that could travel across exandria cities that were mobile as far as anyone knows all of them had been wiped out during the calamity zeidel as far as you've learned is one of them that's all you know mm-hmm the last one discusses the theories behind the ice fields and the underreaches of eiselcross and the beasts that live and endure it eiselcross e-i-s-e-l-c-r-o-s-s eiselcross you know is a rather large body of land to the north of the main wildemount continent it's considered part of wildemount overall but it's just a frozen arctic cap it's separate the frozen depths-- there's a large channel of water that separates the main body of wildemount and eiselcross but aside from two very small ice fishing villages that are expansions of the dwendalian empire it is mostly uninhabited nobody really goes there there's a bunch of creatures that have spent a millennia or more living in that place that are extremely dangerous and it's just snow and ice so nobody goes there cool enough all right eiselcross is far north of that off the map you guys manage to make your way back you manage to recover your 30 gold from the dockmaster podderan you get back to your ship and you caleb hear the rest of your party return as the rest of the crew begins to prepare for setting sail off the dock all right with that as everyone gets prepared orly comes out from underneath the deck and turns to you and goes captain where about are we taking off towards it's 'ar-chi-pelago' we'll go ahead and make sure we're heading that way he turns around to the rest of the crew begins giving a couple orders heading over and getting his map out pull up the anchor and slowly you guys begin to make your way out onto the lucidian ocean just as the sun begins to set now the sky itself has been pretty gray and cloudy and you've been smelling the coming of weather no more than 20 minutes after leaving the rain begins for most of this travel you've kept an aspect of your consciousness looking out for errant weather and there've been a few moments where some rains have come through-- that brief interaction with the diver's grave in which a storm was conjured but it didn't have the same feel that you'd been hoping whatever this draw was that drew you southward and to run into these friends again at the coast as you begin to push further and further towards the direction of the storm there's an excitement in your belly that you can't describe as the rain begins to hit the deck itself the endless patter of heavy droplets smattering against the dark wood the winds begin to pick up a little bit and some of the crew begins to look off you see marius glance off and go captain should we put up the storm sails the wind's picking up a bit it takes them a little bit-- they start diminishing the presence of the regular sails and getting smaller more durable sails pulled up in there you're probably helping them with it it's an all hands on deck thing to get this going quickly with that they begin to pull the sails into place the wind immediately picks up again once the sails are back in and the wind is starting to pick up a bit heavily you see orly glancing over the edge his large shell slick with rain smattering against the backside of it as he turns around towards you and looks at you through the darkness the little bit of light there is from oil lanterns being held across the deck goes captain i think we're heading into a proper storm (more ominous) captain we're heading into a proper storm smartass we can if we take a few more days to-- aye aye captain all right everyone all hands on deck as everyone gathers to begin to ford out into the evening-- your nerves are slightly set on edge as you can see the distant flashes of lightning arcing from storm to ocean the heavy sheets of wind obscuring most of these bolts with that the rain gets heavier and heavier i need you as the captain to roll a survival check for me if you don't mind i'll give you advantage on this well that adds onto advantage yeah it acts as a luck point it actually technically is a third die but you've already rolled okay good keeping it steady in going in the ship's handling it fine the winds are heavy but the repairs you made thankfully have brought the balleater up to a very functional ship the crew is experienced and now that they seem to be a little more comfortable under your leadership and with the help of the rest of the party - you guys have taken some time at sea to learn a number of skills that are helpful - your first bit of evening travel into the storm seems to be going well it goes on for a few hours the storm doesn't seem to be getting worse necessarily but the waves are rocking quite a bit eventually into the early hours of the morning sleep is going to have to come to some of you at the very least so you're going to sleep who's staying up for how long to keep watch or you can leave it to the crew it's up to you they're experienced but you're the captain you're staying up where are you staying at the helm you're staying there with orly orly's staying with you anybody else okay standing at the back of the boat everybody else sleeping the wood is creaking with each shift of the boat as the waves climb higher and higher occasionally slamming into a valley between as the rest of you are enduring the chaos of the rains above keeping focused and keeping it steady it's exhausting both the attention required for you specifically and the hour being late thankfully you slept in so you can go on for quite some time yasha where on the ship are you standing the lines seem to be okay fjord's at the helm with orly so they're both towards the back probably closer to the bow or the foremast okay in keeping this going do you head back up to help fjord or are you heading to rest as well it's hypnotic the sound of rain and the movement of the waves and the flashes of light and the rolling of thunder you grab the edge of the rail of the bow looking out straight into the storm that you're passing into it's a blur of light and movement and darkness the horizon beyond your vision is obscured it feels like you're riding this into a tumultuous sky you begin to fall into a trance your eyes closing for but a second we're going to take a break we'll be right back in a few minutes in the meantime we do have our fantastic wyrmwood giveaway from our friends at wyrmwood this is an awesome holly inlaid dice vault with burmese sal burl wood with a red interior this is a gorgeous fucking piece it feels nice i want to keep it but no this has to go to one of you lucky winners you have to move over to the critical role twitch chat at twitchtv/criticalrole to enter during the break you can jump on back to geek & sundry after but the keyword tonight is holiday put holiday once in the chat more than once and you'll be disqualified exactly one lucky winner when we return from the us or canada excluding quebec as you know we'll back shortly and we'll see you then [break] so the rest of you are currently either focused on helping on the ship itself or are down below deck resting sleeping or concentrating on whatever is needed taliesin oh you're just saying you're down there gotcha it's important as the sound of the storm and the movement of the ship begins to lull you into this trance your lids grow heavier and heavier and as your fingers tighten and clasp the edge of the bow your vision goes darkand you're kneeling you open your eyes and you're cleaning a fox you hunted and pulled from the nearby brush you look across the surrounding iothia moorland the sheen of the shallow pools dotting the flat swamp brush landscape the grays and browns of the valley beneath the clouded skies that raised you-- this is the home you knew the muted colors are comforting you hear a voice shouted at a distance yasha you turn and see the rest of your hunting party of the dolorav tribe walking towards you dirty and smiling is zualla her leather marked with mud her brown eyes barely visible under her tangled hair that's a hearty fox for one care to share it the warmth in your chest fills you there's a flash of lightning behind you at that instant you see zualla fleshless and bone then darkness once more another subtle flash but blue and muted another a roiling ball of storm clouds grows before you in this veil of shadow swelling as the interior sparks and flashes with light intensely and they occur more and more rapidly as this sphere of roiling storm grows and swells you sense something contacting you and while it isn't speaking with words you interpret it through language through your mind loss loss is excruciating loss is paralyzing loss is inevitable loss can bring sorrow bring hate bring cruelty and darkness another bright flash you see a muddied field of burning huts corpses lie at your feet your blade bloodied a figure turns to you eyes aglow with yellow their deep red skin and hooked horns peeking from beneath their folded wings their smile curls open your anger is beautiful to behold orphan maker another flash only the rolling storm remains (thunder crash) the thoughts return this voice coalesces into more of an actual throaty deep timbre loss can instead teach you what is important it offers perspective it offers focus might the courage to protect what has not yet been lost to be alone to push others away can prevent loss but it also prevents growth strength purpose how much how many will you lose until you find your strength the thunder gets louder and louder cutting through the veil you find your consciousness tug at your mind and slowly you begin to shake out of this fugue state the sound of muffled rain once again growing loud around you the cold sensation of it dripping through your armor another crack of thunder as the dream begins to fade the voice says show me show me what is important what is worth protecting this storm was birthed only for you your eyes flicker wide and you're back on the edge of the ship the wave hits the bow of the ship once more you hold tight your hair slicked down across your face as you look up and with that a single bolt strikes down slamming into the front of the ship where you expect to see splintered wood and fire instead there is just a darkened spot the impact muted what you see there instead a creature a man-like shape made of crackling blue energy it stands your height vaguely human-form shifting with unstable power suddenly two vibrant wings of lightning open from its back like an angel it walks towards you it's going to claw across the front of your body all right that is going to be a 16 to hit what's your armor class all right as it claws across the front of your body its hand seems to almost pass through the resistance of the armor for but a minute before you feel this shock to your system as it arcs through you feel the lightning pulse through your body you suffer eight points of bludgeoning damage plus five points of lightning damage you were below deck and there-- oh you're upstairs you guys watched a bolt of light strike down towards the ship all you see is this faint dull glow like a mote of energy that's rolling around make a history check yes you've heard tales of something called ball lightning bits of storm matter that just scatters across it's usually innocuous and people either watch it fizzle out or get it thrown overboard it usually happens in the cusp of a storm and you watch it dance along the vicinity of yasha but that's not what you see i need you to roll initiative all right it's going first as you reel from it reaching back for your blade the creature seems to be intent on you its form seeming to shift and bend with the wind and the rain it's going to reach out towards you for two more strikes that is going to be a 13 to hit that's going to be a 16 to hit that is going to be five points of bludgeoning and two points of lightning it's your turn your skeletal wings flare out from under your back your hair blown up from the wind and the impact of the wings flying out from underneath the shawl it needs to make a wisdom saving throw i believe that is a six it has no bonus it is afraid of you for how long all righty does it get to save at the end of its turn or is it just afraid of you okay got you oh and then it lasts for a minute if you do the extra damage once during each of your turns you deal extra necrotic damage to one target when you do damage to it it equals your level so you do an extra seven points of necrotic damage once per turn to it keep that in mind that's the end of the round you guys look over and watch yasha at the end this mote of lightning dancing around her rolling across but slightly hovering above the surface of the boat's deck suddenly she unleashes her fallen form the wings rising up other members of the crew that are holding down the ropes see this and take a step back not entirely familiar with this appearance correct they're not frightened of you they're just really spooked by the reveal it's going to swirl around you suddenly it seems to move with pulses of energy with an unnatural speed whips to the opposite side and it is going to attempt to try and slash into the lower back that's going to be a nine and a 21 to hit okay that's going to be eight points of bludgeoning damage reduced to four because you're raging plus four points of lightning damage oh i'm sorry it has disadvantage on the attacks i need to roll that other attack again okay still hits because it's frightened of you it's going to attempt-- all right it's going to attempt to move away from you you can attempt to i'll let you grapple as a reaction sure it's an athletics check for you because you're raging it's at advantage yeah it's staying you reach out and your hand passes partly through it and it goes numb the field of sparkling energy lightly electrifying the skin around your hand but you manage to get hold of something-- it's not solid matter but something as it tries to move away you keep it there barred in place that ends its turn it's your go go for it you've got two attacks are you doing this reckless or not 21 hits go for it describe to me your attack as you're holding it with one hand and pulling the blade out you're watching her reaching out and grabbing this small sphere of sparkling energy she grasps it grabs her blade and strikes through with both hands arcing downward because you do have two hands you'd lose the grapple because it is a two-handed weapon but you also have sentinel so if it tries to get away you can hit it plus the seven once per round 30 points of damage you have two attacks every turn i know it's been a while i know you forgot your sheet 12 does not hit what was that no i'm afraid that does not this first swing strikes through you watch the spark flash with energy for a second the second swing goes wide it moves around zigzagging as it curls around her you want to do anything or just watching okay so you rush over in the direction of where she is and this entity back to its turn right there in front of you it's going to attempt to use anger of the tempest it pulls back from you-- it's no longer frightened of you it goes from its defensive position to leaning in towards you it looks up at the sky and as a moment there's this slight smell of burnt hair that catches your nose before a bolt of lightning arcs from the sky and slams into you i need you to make a dexterity saving throw you do have advantage on this 15 does not make it laura and you take 23 points of lightning damage and as the bolt hits you your whole upper torso goes numb your fingers aren't responding and you drop your sword to the ground the creature bends down and picks it up and holds it up looking right at you doesn't move your turn not anymore and frightened doesn't force you to move you just can't get closer it's your turn you can use an attack to try and disarm it if you'd like okay make another athletics check you have advantage on it because you're raging no it had a plus three and rolled a 13 so 16 as it pulls back attempting to use magician's judge against you you reach forward and grab it and for a moment you're both struggling back and forth you manage to rip it from its hand its fingers actually evaporating as you rip it from its form and then reform where they were previously the energy's still arcing around it and it moves around to almost try and move to your flank but you shift around to face it you have your other attack if you'd like you call it at the beginning of your turn 11 does not hit goes wide unfortunately your body's still numb from the impact of the lightning bolt you reel from it angrily that finishes your turn do you want to roll to get involved roll initiative six yasha your initiative was all right jester you can go i'll let you in go for it as jester touches you and the healing goes through the entity before you its eyes flare with intense energy glaring right at jester and it swells to twice its size with her presence arriving you watch this thing all of a sudden get brighter and more intense you don't know what that means top of the round its turn it's going to take two more strikes at you let me see if it gets its lightning back nope all right it's going to make two more strikes at you yasha ooh that's going to be a 20 and a 21 first one comes at you with ten points of bludgeoning damage reduced to five and five points of lightning damage so ten total the other strike 11 points of bludgeoning damage reduced to five and then three points of lightning damage it appears to be growing in size it's your turn yasha how are you attacking with it what are you doing to attack it's whipping around you right now he's considered a large creature so he's about five feet taller than you you see only maybe a three-foot sphere glowing in its face but it's larger than the one foot it once was all right you swing coming down towards where the leg is 18 hits roll damage no every turn you do it once plus seven 19 points of damage on the first strike carves through the center of its leg area you watch as energy dissipates the leg goes (poof) and vanishes now it's hovering lightly with the other leg below it you see energy sparking around where the leg's reforming what are you doing with your second attack reckless for all your attacks this round yeah 19 hits roll damage a second time ten points of damage you strike it again with the blade it seems to shrug it off it seems to be hardier than it was when you started this fight anything else you do on your turn what the necrotic damage divine fury you get once per turn the necrotic damage from your shroud also happens once per turn you have a bonus action you haven't done anything is that your turn jester you're up what are you doing jester okay how far do you back away okay you back away ten feet as jester backs away top of the round it's now the entity's turn first let's see if it gets its-- it gets its lightning back it's going to first attempt to move away from you it's going to hover away and actually begin to rise up in the air you do get an attack of opportunity towards it it is not reckless though because it's only on your turn 13 misses the swing goes wide and it hovers 15 feet up near the mast where the lower sail is it hovers up in this space and looks up in the air once more as its electrified wings unfurl and its arm goes up as it stares down at you you see these large blue sparks where its eyes would be as it pulls its arm down the bolt strikes down and slams into you once more make another dexterity saving throw with advantage that succeeds okay and that's a good thing you take 13 points of lightning damage and you do not drop your weapon you shrug off the numbness from the impact but it is 15 feet above you which is out of your melee range it's up near the sail on the mast it's your turn do you wait for a response no response just the sound of thunder and lightning rolling how do you move closer to it it's above and back up by the mast and the sail about 15 feet above you not with the wings no okay i mean they're designed for climbing so you go ahead and as it's up in the air you rush over to the mast climbing your way up you get to the edge and there is where the sail is in the side you're holding onto it off the point you manage to get within melee range of it you used your action to call out to the stormlord and waiting for the response but you're now adjacent to it okay jester you move further away get closer re-enter what are you doing okay ten more feet next round you watch its physical size reduce it shrinks back down to its original form matching yours one-to-one as it floats there its electrical wings not flapping but arced held aloft at each of its sides on its turn it does not get its lightning back it's going to attempt to strike at you twice as it rushes you towards the mast trying to knock you off the first one's going to be a shove attack to try and knock you off the mast that's a natural one no it goes to shove towards you and you just pull in and it zips past at that point it comes back around to try and claw at you with its other hand that's going to be a 20 to hit that is five points of bludgeoning damage it would be ten but it's reduced to five then four points of lightning damage it's going to attempt to move up further away from you leaning further up and away from the masthead make another attack of opportunity if you'd like (background music thunder) 21 hits roll damage and because of your sentinel feat you prevent it from moving ten points of damage as you arc past with your blade and strike at it attempting to move away its midsection separates and the lower legs fizzle out and no longer exist suddenly its lower part of its torso flickers and then grows two new legs made of pure electrical energy as the wind's blowing by your hair being thrown past your shoulders the rain beating down on your face as you're holding onto the side of the mast leaning your arm in and then striking with your two-handed sword best you can it can't seem to find its way beyond your reach now it's your turn okay i'm going to say because of the rain-- didn't do it last round but as you're now up in this area holding on while also striking it you have disadvantage on the attacks because it is a two-handed weapon all right 18 hits go ahead and roll damage 25 points of damage to it as it arcs past one of the wings gets shaved off and falls and sputters and turns to particle sparks before vanishing into the storm the wing begins to flicker to regrow itself you have your second attack well reckless is preventing the disadvantage what'd you roll no this one unfortunately goes wide with the second strike as your arm's looped through the mast trying to hold on this time the other wing manages to flicker in and it just ducks out of the way jester staying out or coming in all right back to the top of the round the creature now-- you see the storm growing heavier and heavier around the rain now is coming in heavy sheets across the deck the crew's yelling off you hear the shouting of the crewmen trying to keep the sails from tearing you hear fjord shouting orders to them from behind but the words aren't reaching you it's just noise lost in the wind and the sound of the storm around you it's going to attempt-- we'll see it does get its lightning strike back as you're up there holding the mast knowing it's coming as the creature puts its hands up the bolt strikes down once more slamming to you and the mast i need you to make another dexterity saving throw wasn't a great roll so you're lucky on that that's 13 points of lightning damage but you drop your sword which falls onto the ground that's its turn what are you doing yasha it's five feet from you it hasn't pulled away you've prevented it from leaving but it did manage to knock the weapon out of your hands the energy that it seems to create has this field of electricity you do see the bright points where its eyes are that are these two beacons of intense electrical energy and the faint heart-like glow that emanates from the center of its torso the full thing is made of energy from different intensity levels that almost give variations to colors of blue and white make an athletics check you do not have disadvantage on this you have advantage because of your-- because you're raging still okay 12 that's a 16 you try and reach out for it and it just manages to duck out of the way you have a second attack are you doing another grapple or are you-- go for it with advantage because you're raging yeah it does not succeed on that as it ducks past the one you reach out getting to the limits of your arm reach from the edge of the mast as you do your hand plunges into its chest next turn if you can keep it up as you're holding it there and it's grappled its strength is zero your hand is plunged about two or three inches into the energy field that is its torso you can feel your fingers vibrating with energy and it hurts it hurts but you grit your teeth glaring past you can hear the waves crashing around you the ship itself is rocking with heavy momentum but you're focused on the moment on its turn it's going to attempt to attack you that is a natural one you are lucky but the second one is a 13 again wait wait yeah 13 plus six shit man okay oh let's see it does not get its lightning back that would have been good to roll beforehand make a strength check with the raging it's okay you begin to pull and it's giving as you're yanking its wings are flickering and sputtering its arms are reaching up to grab yours and its eyes that have been intensely burrowed toward you begin to go wide make another strength check with advantage (crackling pop) as you pull it from the chest the body flickers out and you're falling the momentum pulling you off of the mast you plummet 15 feet slamming into the deck you take five points of bludgeoning damage from the impact reduced to two because of the rage you crack down onto the hard wood of the deck no fucking way that's two episodes in a row your fingers are buzzing you look and there's nothing there because the lightning mostly impacted yasha the damage was minimal to the mast thankfully if she had succeeded on her save oh wait no you succeeded the last save the mast is a little damaged but with immediate mending i'll say you can undo it a little bit okay as you continue to help keep this ship going through the middle of this storm you make your way below deck and find caduceus in his chamber since it was your vision if you wish to look over the words that were told to you keep that for you to the dock-- to the deck okay okay you make your way back up it's still raining but the storm's ferocity seems to have slowly diminished it's still a storm but you seem to have come through the bulk of its intensity and danger and from your experience knowing you're probably starting to come out the other end it'll be a few more hours of fording this but you're getting pretty exhausted okay orly stays but sends marius to go ahead and wake beau comes back up and she's in his wake as the storm subsides slowly over the next few hours and one by one you all eventually find yourself feeling comfortable to return to your quarters for an evening's rest the day's travel comes to a complete circle the morning comes with clear skies as the distant gray fades in the north another half day's travel leads you to see a few bodies of land on the horizon i reckon towards them islands he points over to the bodies of land on the horizon now coming across the gravid archipelago-- and you'd know this a little bit though you've not actually traveled to these before-- you can see this trio of islands are rather rocky and are only marked with small pockets of trees and jungle much of the land on these islands is steep volcanic peaks with sheer cliff faces pockmarked with caves similar makeup as a lot of darktow actually they were both probably created from similar volcanic activity from under the ocean but not very welcoming-looking islands with little safe land to navigate or exploit for resources there is very few reason for ships to stop here as you guys begin to make your way you can see the two nearest to you and the third there what would you like to do okay he goes ahead and continues the path of the balleater nothing quite like high fantasy this is going to go real poorly this can be turned off fun device thank you jeremy crawford for showing me that at the stream of many eyes it was yes no it just said somewhere between them yeah whoever is helming that will be able to make either two separate perception checks or aid one to make-- are you aiding caduceus or are you both rolling perception yeah with advantage okay you keep an eye out there and spend the next hour or so as you guys are coming into position scanning the shores of each of the islands there's no sign of civilization they're mostly dangerous jagged rocky shores with pebbled beaches and bits and pieces of hints of mangrove clusters at certain points of the shore and elements of the occasional bit of jungle you can see in pockets or valleys on each island for the most part you don't see any sign of civilization i'd say about now you guys could have reached what would be considered as close to the center as orly can possibly maneuver the boat i mean there are caves all over the volcanic rocky cliffs and peaks that come out each island there are caverns and shelves it was a violently-made series of islands there is a moment of transition it's a little awkward (sploosh) into the ocean (swishing) below disappearing into the depths go ahead and make a perception check for frumpkin sam and from the upper tier of the water frumpkin sees-- the water here is pretty clear frumpkin is a bit distracted by the heavy schools of fish that seem to be glittering beneath the surface and catching a little bit of the light that's making its way through the waves and causing this array of sparkles roughly 30 40 50 feet below the surface continues deeper deeper make another perception check okay first thing frumpkin notices is the ocean here is not as deep as the diver's grave it goes down maybe 300 feet it's still deep but it's a third of the depth you ended up having to go down frumpkin does see a shape amongst the clusters of seaweed and other bits of life that exist down there in natural ocean life you can see chunks of ocean rock and volcanic rock things that may have been lobbed from ancient volcanic detonations and a tower a sub-ocean tower that's leaning at an angle you can see bits of broken rock based around it and the seaweed is cluttered up around the base of it architecture constructed the top of it is somewhat jagged it has sustained some erosion or damage towards its top and it leads down inside you can see shelves or bits where there may have been stairs or levels but most of that has fallen inward and from frumpkin's exterior perspective mostly hollow and disappearing into darkness the further in with a 14 frumpkin also notices a little bit of movement towards the very tops of the seaweed there are humanoid bodies that are tangled in the seaweed a bit that appear to be floating there and then one of them twitches and goes (moaning) sam and yeah seems pretty clear fumpkin didn't get a great look at them it was uncertain one or the other but they appear to be humanoid and wrapped in seaweed and then-- one of them seemed to twitch and move for a second before going back to rest at this point it's early afternoon maybe one or two hours after noon a familiar lightness in the lungs seems to take root inside the air tastes a little bit different once the incantation is complete you feel the familiar point of anxiety build in your chest since last time you dove you see her leave for a bit and then come back with an empty bottle of mead about a quarter mile a quarter mile to a mile to the nearest one actually it's probably a little more than that a few miles understood yeah it's about a mile to the shore looking at the map there well one by one you all make your way into the ocean (splashing) the water is cold but you adjust and begin to find your way down are we swimming stealthily or are we brazenly heading towards this temple all right so we're stealth missioning in i need everybody to go ahead and make a stealth check please okay you're moving at a slower speed swimming below trying to be as stealthy as you can making your way further down the filtering light grows dimmer and dimmer-- there's a certain point where i assume you're not trying to kill your weasel i fucked with you for a few weeks when you were new to pet ownership but then after a few close calls i figured-- the deeper it goes the harder it is to see the colder it is-- a familiar sensation it's clear water so the light does carry further and you guys aren't going as deep you do manage to make out as you get further and further down the general shape of the tower within sight it is comparatively murky because of the lack of light but you can see the shape you can also based on the warning that caleb had given see some of the figures you see about five of them all tangled or wrapped in threads of this seaweed regular seaweed not the strange crimson type that you came across in the diver's grave what's the range on that all right you're going to have to get pretty close to try it okay as you swim down to get within range to use your eyes of the grave thankfully the nearest creature doesn't seem to notice your approach it is not undead make a perception check actually roll at disadvantage because you don't have darkvision unfortunately and you're low enough now where the light is limited 16's still okay now that you have a better look at it at a closer perspective the humanoid creature-- no clothing it is thin the limbs are a little stretched but there are tiny fins at the edge of the arms along the sides of the head there are gills it has a strange glance looking around like a sentry almost it's not undead it appears to be more of a fish person it has four appendages it has arms and legs nope what's interesting is that one of its lower appendages its right leg as you're watching curls up and then unfurls one of its legs seems to move similarly to one of the appendages of frumpkin just one the others appear to be human one limb well the nearest one you saw has you aren't close enough to the others to make out what their physical representation is you have five here that are watching you have to decide what is it going to be is it a brazen attack is it some form of a stealth mission what are you doing travis and they're clustered enough around where they're not going to not see you you have nothing you're hiding behind no a stealth mission in this would be invisibility you would have to do something where they cannot see you otherwise they're going to see you i mean they're not a perfect ring of five around the top they're all hanging right towards the top of the tower from the different layers of seaweed they're anywhere from 15 to 20 feet from each other their arrangement is a bit uneven mm-hmm looking at them all it looks like they're less wrapped and tangled and more like they have an arm or a leg that they've curled around it and are anchoring themselves to it kind of you're above them okay caduceus has made that journey as you continue to push in that direction you get to the exterior of that range they seem to have not noticed your presence yet all towards the same target okay those that need to roll attacks roll attacks those that need to roll damage roll damage nope natural 20 both hit 12 to hit hits this entity breathing under the water watches this glimmer of arcane energy its attention turns up towards it as it releases the seaweed then (multiple explosions) and goes limp under the water as a small cloud of its own blood begins to fill the space around it at which point the other four look up and notice your presence from the lights that have been glowing and the death of one of its comrades roll initiative ooh not good well not good for them either 25 to 20 20 to 15 liam and all right that's yasha 15 to ten your movement is halved when you're swimming except for fjord your movement is halved while you're swimming just so you know you guys are about a hundred feet away so it's going to take a little bit to get there for the melee folk caleb you're up first caleb and jester the four of them now begin to quickly swim up in your direction they swim fast they swim faster than you do at the very least about as fast as fjord does yep you can see their webbed fingers and the spines and the scales of their arms and legs they look like the creature from the black lagoon with a little bit of a slight more humanoid nose and mouth they're now clambering up towards you in the water what are you guys doing okay same one or different target it rolled a natural 20 again on its saving throw two natural 20s in a row oh no this is guiding bolt never mind he doesn't roll anything wasted natural 20 matt well done it's okay roll your attack 14 yeah that hits their armor class is 11 14 points of radiant damage it bursts and glows underneath it's still alive you see the blood splatter and it has this glowing energy surrounding its torso making it easy to see in the dark depths below awesome that finished your turn you cast haste that ends your guys' round and you're backing away yasha your turn okay so movement of 15 feet dash 15 feet that'd be your full round there get you 30 feet down so you're about 60 or so-- well no your movement speed is 40 so it's 20 20 yeah you're about 60 feet away you'll only move 20 feet then so you're 80 feet away got it okay you're holding your action to hit whenever it comes close all right that finishes your turn caduceus you're up what range no they're about a hundred feet away they haven't taken their turn yet what spell are you holding okay finishes your go nott you're up what's your interior range with your weapon correct automatically misses a target beyond the weapon's normal range you don't roll disadvantage for the first half the first 30 feet but anything beyond 30 feet is an automatic miss because at that point it loses momentum and can't keep traveling which you just learned you didn't need to you guys fucking destroyed it before it came to you it was already dead you've learned no you do not roll disadvantage if it's ranged it goes (shearing) and just floats okay so you swim 15 feet you can bonus action dash if you want 30 feet in that gets there now it's their turn they all double-move 60 feet as they swim upwards getting as close as they can that definitely gets them in range for your spell you were 80 feet so no one gets into range with you so bane you're hitting three of them with bane okay there's three of them that have not been hit there's one that has got it all right saving throw is wisdom sorry charisma ooh minus one for them fail fail and fail they were 80 feet away from you and they just moved 60 feet there's 20 feet between the two of you now all three of them fail all three of them are baned got it beau you're up they're about 40 feet from you you move towards the one that is glowing you swim down that's 20 feet so you're still 20 feet away that's the additional 20 feet that will get you right into range of the one jester hit it's like (snarling) as you get really up close to it now with the glowing light around it you get a good look at its face it's covered in layers of scales and spined points that come out at various points of its facial features its eyes are yellow and a sick little side lens that closes you have advantage because of the guiding bolt 18 hits oh but you do have disadvantage underwater with melee attacks however so it cancels out what was your first roll ten misses that first strike just-- it's too slow 13 hits it would be five damage it's hurt but it's still going that's the end of your turn beau fjord you're up your speed is 60 underwater so you can go to any of them you aquaman it through the water towards it okay the first one's going to be at one of the ones that's untouched yep both (whiffing) next two the second attack action can only be used for a single weapon attack or disengage dash-- yeah so you have to use your sword the falchion comes into your hand you dash towards which one the one with beau or-- oh buddy underwater man not feeling very underwater-like right now unfortunately that's okay finishes your go top of the round caleb and jester it makes its saving throw that's right that's a natural 16-- what was the save yeah it's 16 sorry that finishes your turn then or are you going to move closer stay put all right you stay put caleb okay at your range roll for attack it travels half the distance then sputters out consumed by the ocean you don't know you move back even further yasha you're up you can move your 20 feet and get in range for any of them take your pick there's three untouched and there's one that beau has done some damage to yes one of those that's untouched yet it's disadvantage on your attacks with melee underwater unless you're reckless in which case they're straight rolls are you reckless go for it first attack single roll 23 hits roll damage this is your full 3d6 okay there you go i'll let you do that it's okay remember that 20 points with the first strike it carves through immediately filling the water around it with its dark blood as it scrambles around looks pretty hurt go for it well reckless is a single attack ooh no second one goes wide you're not used to fighting underwater you've only done it a few times and still it's a big blade through a lot of resistance that finishes your go caduceus you're up natural seven that's a failure it has a minus one the burst of light from underneath it hits it it starts gurgling in pain it is holding on by a thread it is torn asunder and you can-- bless you it's obscured by a cloud of its own murky blood right now that finishes your turn caduceus nott you're up 14 hits roll damage (impact) it is done okay go for it 11 hits exactly even better there you go definitely hits correct you only get that once per turn eight damage one (gurgling) the other one (gurgling) two immediate fires two of them go limp and begin to float in their own ichor well done okay finishes nott's go it's their turn now they're in range two of them move one of them towards you yasha and one's against beau trying to-- it's been a lot it's going to make two attacks against you with its unarmed strike it's clawing at you with its hands that is a 12 and a 19 oh no let me do that 18 misses on the third strike it's going to use its piscine anatomy i mean one of the other ones maybe but that one no this one it strikes twice at you with its claws then its throat (bubbling spitting) and it spits this tiny needle towards you that's going to be 21 oh with another negative three 18 the other one is going to attack you twice yasha you were reckless so it has advantage on its attacks against you it would be 19 and a 16 19 minus two so it's a 17 16 minus three is a 13 one hits you for six points of piercing damage as it claws-- or this would be a bite it grabs and bites towards you oh no it's a strike so bludgeoning it's halved to three you take three points of bludgeoning damage this one is going to attempt to grab you with the tentacle natural 20 you don't know it's a critical hit up to you are you canceling it or not okay it still hits but it's not a critical you take eight points of bludgeoning damage reduced to four and you are grappled as its tentacle reaches around you another one that looks like it has a protrusion from its chest almost like a third arm-- it's a tentacle that wraps around and grabs at your torso and is crushing you you can feel faint bits of it that are scraping at the skin that finishes their turn beau you're up there's the one that was attacking you that's right in your face and there's the one that's grappled yasha with a tentacle go for it two attacks with disadvantage eight damage all righty (impact) it looks like a person or a creature that had been hit with a staff pretty hard 11 just hits 12 points of damage its jaw snaps out of place it looks like it's trying to bite towards you but its jaw is limply unable to close it's still going ki point two more hits all right roll your-- 11 damage you crack again the jaw actually tears off and blood's filling its eyes are going wide it's barely holding on okay so ten damage gotcha all right that's all right and your final attack okay with the last hit as its jaw snapped apart you grab its head and ram it into your knee and as you pull the leg back the face is collapsed inward and it goes limp like oh god okay that finishes your go fjord one left and it currently has yasha grappled in the tentacle and trying to crush her yep they are you may as the body is floating in the water away this cold sensation takes the nearby 20-foot radius around it what little bit of light is filtering through here gets darker and a darkened spectral form emerges from its body this ghostly wraith emerges from the corpse under fjord's command go for it that hits that hits damage on both 18 points of damage both bolts (impact sounds) into it it's damaged but it's still holding on and it's turning towards-- dash in with the blade out at the side make your strike you do not have disadvantage because of your armor so that hits go ahead and roll damage with your blade well-- don't you get to add your charisma modifier to the damage bonus pretty sure as a hexblade warlock you get to add your charisma bonus to attack and damage rolls right am i wrong about that you have in the past i'm pretty sure unless i'm reading this wrong it should be yeah it's based on your strength maybe it updated recently and that got reset i'll have to double check because-- correct well it should be an additional plus four damage is what it should be yeah right i'll fix that okay after the two impacts and the sword slicing through it it's still standing but it's hurt it's still holding onto yasha and right now it's distracted trying to figure out which way to go that finishes your go fjord caleb and jester you're up next there's one holding onto yasha that is a 13 on its toll the dead and the-- 12 damage ooh as the tentacle is grappling and crushing your body and you're trying to find a way to force your way through suddenly the tentacle just pulls away you look over towards it the tentacle isn't attached to anything it is turned to chum in the water as bits of its scattered body begin to slowly dissipate and disseminate throughout the nearby sea (thrumming) magic missiles impacting and scattering its form currently there doesn't appear to be any of these creatures around you there's just the darkness of the tower below and whatever the inside of it holds it's hard to see this low in the water when there's so little light when it's not moving once it shifts it's like watching a shadow out of the corner of your eye with these two faintly dull glowing yellow eyes it's vaguely humanoid in its shape but it's almost smoky and amorphous when it shifts and moves and finds its place nearby its head lolls around a bit mimicking the shape and the movement of the creature before it was engaged in combat okay you sending it in there by itself okay you guys watch as the specter vanishes into the shadow of the tower below oh just the entrance okay it moves comes to the top-- no it does not open its maw and devour your specter fair enough yeah it drifts in and once it hits the mouth of it it's near impossible to see because it's just black on black until you see its head turn and you can see the very faint light of its eyes it sits there awaiting its next command it's making you uncomfortable as far as you can tell there is just the one entrance if you want to try and swim along the edges of it you can look for other entrances perception check for frumpkin please okay frumpkin having a hard time seeing through the clustered seaweed around its base-- i mean with a natural one yeah you don't see anything frumpkin makes out no shapes or anything within that period frumpkin's not used to being an octopus okay he still hasn't quite figured it out okay you're not in combat right now so we can just-- that's true though you're getting really close to the end of it it lasts for a minute so-- you guys have been chatting back and forth and doing this and especially with frumpkin looking around like that yeah haste has worn off no you just get stunned for a round but you're not in combat anymore yeah a little heart palpitation moment okay are you going to do a spiral around it or are you going to go down one side what are you doing are you just stopping you guys are above it at this point you're about 60 or so feet above the top of this curved tower it's at a slight angle yeah okay are you doing it stealthily or are you trying to go for speed all right it'll take you a little bit but go ahead and roll a stealth check yeah blessing of the trickster all right make a perception check for me please as you're keeping an eye out okay make a perception check all right as you curl down there are slits there are narrow peering points at different areas you do see the occasional window or an opening where somebody could probably squeeze through at the very base of it there does appear to be an open doorway correct okay you're keeping an eye out from the top as you head down you see that entranceway look over look around and see the other faint bits of windows you look back down at the door and you see the very edge of something in the door you see a yellowish-green shape looks almost-- best i can describe it at this distance is a hint of crustacean that then vanishes into the doorway okay you wait for 30 seconds a minute nothing but you get the sense that something noticed you okay you all join fjord okay the specter drifts down to the center of the doorway and hangs there okay the specter vanishes inside make a perception check yeah you don't hear anything caduceus just instinctually you hear what sounds like the thrashing of water the impact of scraping against stone more thrashing then silence okay you're both now resting a distance from it make a perception check with a lack of light-- you have your goggles which helps-- you can barely make out shapes and there's a few of them it's like looking into a boiling pot where there's shapes shifting in different places clustered with what little bit you can see at your peripheral it's like whatever texture the bottom of this temple has the texture is moving from the top it's about 60 feet sure mm-hmm you make out the same thing do you send them in it's a little more than 60 feet tall to the peak okay as you guys are paying attention and glance inside there are different shelves of broken floors that have either fallen through or stairs that have collapsed where there's-- you can see where at one point this temple may have been ascended by somebody but a hollow on the inside towards the base of it you can see three of these large creatures covered in chitinous-like armor their lower half has four legs that are insect-like or you could say crab-like if you will and then the upper torso has two large pincers that are jagged on the inside their face-- you don't see eyes it's this smooth surface with a series of these weird worm-like tentacles that emerge from underneath the mouth that curl as soon as the light hits they begin to look around towards it and glancing up and they have all backed into it and that shape that you were seeing before was all three of them clustered together and rotating and moving in the space they're not backing away from it they're back-to-back looking and preparing for whatever is the source of this you are about 50 or so feet let's say if you want to get closer mark down your bless all right is everyone gathering on the floor you've all descended down to the floor of the ocean about roughly 50 60 feet from this open doorway that leads inside the temple as you have your spells prepared ready to delve inside you take a breath of the deep ocean water in your lungs and exhale its thick cold liquid and steel yourself for us to pick up in the new year oh no it did some that's what you saw that's what
