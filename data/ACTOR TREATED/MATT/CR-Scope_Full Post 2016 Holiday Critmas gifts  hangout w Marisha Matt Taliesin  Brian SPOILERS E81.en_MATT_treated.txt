embarrass me what it's coming together a little i've never mailed my shrinky dinks before hopefully they made it okay if not super glue fixes them up this is from liz wooden or sithkitten5 on twitter dear everyone about nine years ago my husband asked our group to start playing d&d together on the weekends i was reluctant at first but i fell in love with it and everything about the game i played a lot of wonderful characters over the years and unleashed the creativity i thought i'd lost along the way i started looking at other ways to get my d&d fix and when we weren't campaigning the search eventually led me to critical role can't watch the show live but thanks to the internet i'm able to listen to the monday upload during my lunch and planning the sessions at work i'm an occupational therapist that works at a private school for kids with autism the simplest way i explain my job is that i help these young men and women become as independent as possible and give them sensory strategies to help them cope with day-to-day life my kids run through the entirety of the autism spectrum some of them are working on typing paragraphs while some are completely non-verbal and working on life skills like washing their hands it's a rewarding job but it's also very tough progress with these kids is often three steps forward two steps back but it's also not uncommon when these kids get frustrated or hurt themselves or get aggressive towards staff members i've gotten my share of bruises bites and scratches in the name of helping them live as full a life as possible that's an incredible pursuit again thank you for letting us watch each week your adventures have been able to cheer me up even the hardest days at work that means the world to me episodes were also a lifesaver when my son was a newborn 2am feedings were much easier to handle when i knew i had you guys to keep the two of us company i look forward to every episode and even got my husband to watch it aww our gaming group has never had much money so we've always had to improvise we design our characters using an online generator and i take those designs and draw them onto shrinky dink pages then use my shrinky dinks as map pieces that's awesome there's a bunch here for everyone ashley sam liam laura travis taliesin not yet that's the next endeavor it's my little gilmore little gilmore thank you so much liz these are amazing this is from-- oh shit yeah i know syler scotshear i got your letter and a sincere thank you so much i'm glad you're journeying along with us and hold tight out there in ohio i know it can get weird this is a wonderful scanlan shirt i work for the customs department my name is burt reynolds which is in reference to a pre-stream episode that we have in our short pre-stream trailer that ashley put together that's awesome thank you so much syler yeah and o fortuna she's good man someone better lock her down yeah to be fair not all games should be streamed that's for many of them their first time playing let them enjoy the experience privately and don't push them too hard guys let them enjoy their game but yeah don't bother them about it guys let them have their private game oh this is to liam o'brien courtesy of coolstufftommeggle i don't know who it's from but i'll make sure this gets to liam i know what he's growing it for no but you guys'll be

bad news in there i think it stanzas for them yeah this is from wilytouchstone craig tryhurst sent in dear matthew i wish to express my new appreciation and admiration for your skills as a gamemaster and a storyteller from critical role force grey and other projects thank you many people who begin as gamemasters underestimate the demands of the role and the breadths of skills required to run an enjoyable game much less to those who try to craft a compelling narrative-- it's time-consuming but with practice anyone can be awesome at this find your own style yeah the awesome charm it can go on your dice bag i'd have to look at it yeah it is yeah i have it on my phone which you're holding so i'll figure it out later it says normally i would not dare-- oh okay i feel like-- the one force that i've come across that transcends simple chance would be the embodiment of true elemental chaos i've used this implement in my own past games my players came to regard it with reverence and dread one ill-fated player even cursed it as evil incarnate invictus which i'm pretty sure was one of the things you shout in the old ultima online when you use a spell for this very reason they've secured it with this reliquary bound and warded if you have faith in your players it may bring your narrative to new heights or set them adrift upon a sea of paranoia the choice is yours or at the very least laura has a new swanky dice jail oh i love it it's chained shut with sealing papers on it i legitimately have to get a pair of pliers deutsche post craig also has a bunch of additional things this would be the o'brien family the riegel family the foster-johnson family that's you this is the jaffe family the mercer-ray family guys i mean i don't know it's a strange position because on one hand we're doing okay and we're busy people things are going okay for the time being career-wise so we have a hard time accepting gifts per se but we appreciate all that you guys do for us there's so much heart put into each of these things and we've incorporated them all into our living space so it's this tradeoff you don't have to do anything by any means if you feel inspired and you want to then go for it and we'll find a place for it i don't know having to learn through the years how to accept gifts it's a weird process i'm appreciative of all the wonderful people that for some reason follow along with our chaos what performed by craig yeah adapted and performed by craig himself that's awesome what's what we had a critmas last time you didn't open this big box i don't know we're getting to the bigger boxes here we have a couple-- oh yes bring that over marisha and i will pull some stuff i got your specific letter amanda by the way to go along with the brass dragon thank you so much i'm going to read the full thing later on canada's great we haven't been to any of the major cities yet we went to nova scotia for a store opening up there it was really fun really pretty up there we're trying to find a way to get back to new york soon oh what chris moss said critical role i've watched you guys since november it was nice to binge watch all the back episodes every night and then

atari were a good time and a brief time while in the first gulf war desert shield and desert storm thank you very much for your service by the way chris i was a sergeant in the united states marine corps then after that i got married and had two boys and never got the chance to play again until you guys came along i did get into some pc gaming when i had two boys now they're both grown up and on their way to college and i've no time to play but there was something missing after i found you guys at geek & sundry i was going through my d&d suitcase came across these books that needed a new home

yeah the day you realize i remember there's a time where my parents-- there was a party they were going to for a friend's bachelorette party and it was at chippendales and i heard them say it i was like what that's not fair and that's when i found out dear cast of critical role i'm not sure i have as much to say as my wife but i wanted to explain the gifts for almost two years now my wife's been watching your show and has fallen in love she has watched through the ups and downs not just in our life and campaign during that time we've helped her through so much matt has pissed her off and brought her back along which i'm sure a lot of us critters out there while i don't watch as much anymore with her i do catch the occasional episode and laugh my ass off aw that's really sweet it says pass on the family and it's been a couple of hard years for both him and his wife and they've both lost two members of their respective families before that one to explain the gifts i wanted to thank you for all you do and wish you all the best of luck in the future the gifts you will find 12 mugs enclosed in the box eight are special for the main cast the remaining four are etched with my version of the vox machina logo on one side and critical role logo on the other these four you're free to give away either to the crew or as gifts if you feel they're good enough to auction out for charity

last one with him screaming vax so i figured i'd make another one that's continuing thank you for this amazing-ness that is critical role i didn't make one for any particular member of the group so if there isn't a spot for it in the studio then the cast will simply have to fight over it oh no we'll find a place for it that is so cool quite literally if you have another battle royale in the horizon have the winner choose who gets it i do kind of like that we'll see if there's a place on the set and if not we'll do just that yeah it is straight-up a shield i wasn't sure if i was going to get a box that's awesome it says vox machina it has the symbol on the other side it says dungeon master of a thousand voices and it has a skull and crossbones man this is going to come out so it can stay in the kitchen wait you know what let's do that one now to preface this-- no this is the one that was at the post box yeah and we had to particularly get it in our vehicle it is labeled with many fragile stickers as soon as you picked it up today it was like-- (parts moving)-- it has many small pieces moving inside so there's a little part of me that's feeling really anxious about this hopefully we're good whatever it is i'll fix it if it's not there but hold that for a second i literally went to pick up today and i was like oh no please no i get the sense based on the audio that perhaps fedex did not treat the box as kindly as you would have hoped it's huge there's a letter in here that says-- to matt and marisha hey sun tree hey kiki dear matt and marisha i'd like to donate a framed poster of vox machina to you i ordered it and it was a bit damaged on the edges so geek and sundry sent me a replacement i had them both framed hung one on my wall and decided to send the other back to you and perhaps auction it for charity whatever you like especially yours jason morrison is it thursday yet @jasonofarabia yeah we can leave it out it's thick plastic but that's okay i feel like we shouldn't open it entirely because the more we don't open the higher the chance we can-- we will get this reframed we didn't get one-- the framed one it's our actual poster i actually want to make a really good charity gift or something yeah we'll get that fixed i wouldn't trust glenn with anything fuck that guy say who they're from so that we don't have to take too much longer jay carter iii francesco spezzari yeah that's going to be useful (chuckling) no from jamie savage this is actually the breakdown of the epic battles made easy from the dms guild they printed out for me well it would've been helpful if you guys hadn't bypassed the entirety of the actual war so it never would've come up so it's their fault but no this is great which by the way guys i've actually downloaded this already jamie in preparation for these types of things not with these specific creations of course here but this is awesome if you guys haven't seen it on the dms guild this is a really good way to help or break the large-scale army-versus-army combat d&d without being a billion dice rolls and bog down the actual narrative so thank you so much it's awesome thank you guys all so much for all of your amazing generosity to the community to us and our ridiculous d&d show please continue to support all the amazing causes that you do and we do and each other guys thank you so much we love you and we'll see you soon is it thursday yet brian you going to do what i do you're doing what i'm doing yeah it's not so easy when it's your-- huh how do you turn this off huh how do you do this how do you do it how do you do it brian how do you turn this off huh all right so maybe well you know what i'm going to do i'm going to go ahead and-- hard close bye guys
