throat) ie scanlan but he's on his way i'm sure but also since we have a lot of new people watching and we figured it would be cool for them to actually get an idea of the character backgrounds as well but going forward we'll just be playing them for the intermission break so we'll be back here in about 10 minutes or so in the meantime enjoy the character backstories we'll see you guys in just a moment [dramatic music] does it it makes more than my eyes pop (laughs) so thank you chat that's amazing we did some videos with that it's a little warm in here for it at the moment but i'll be

of you folks came through that this week so welcome welcome to our chaotic little show critical role everyone in the chat room be nice be welcoming they've been really awesome any other announcements we want to make before we jump into the game glowing recommendation from tiberius stormwind let's get this on the road then so we can get into the story so to get everyone caught up to where we are the party was initially sent on a quest into the mountainous region beneath the dwarven city of kraghammer to find a folk hero of the region named lady kima of vord who's a halfling paladin who had gone missing while on a vision quest that had apparently led her to some evil that was brewing beneath the city as the party went in search of her they ended up finding themselves climbing deeper and deeper into the underdark a very scary portion of the subterranean world encountering numerous beasts and talking cellphones discovering that there was apparently an alliance that had been forged between the illithids the mind flayers that lived down there and the duergar who normally are at odds they've forged some sort of pact upon battling their way deeper into the cavernous regions below the lava-encrusted obsidian walls they began to uncover a plot that apparently some monstrosity some new dark leader by the name of k'varn had been the one responsible for uniting them and currently resides in a temple in the center of the subterranean illithid city of yug'voril you guys made your way down to what seems to be the cavern that contains the island that yug'voril resides upon you manage to scavenge a few broken boats from the lake that surrounds the island percy repaired them and you rode around the outskirts to what seemed to be some sort of a beach-side cavern upon entering the cavern you found a partially-buried chest or container of some kind in what looks like a camp that had been destroyed and scattered and a few rotting corpses against the walls as you continued to inspect the area the corpses began to rise from their sitting positions with previous experience in the realm of undead you however know that these eyes of these creatures carry far more intelligence than your run-of-the-mill zombie and that was where we left off at this point in time which requires a music change right in we have a good number of the party that is still out in the boat that is being towed by keyleth currently in shark form there's keyleth's shark form right there so in the cavern i believe we had vax we had scanlan tiberius and vex on the flying carpet and are making their way down you scouted ahead and began to check the interior before this happened so these creatures are now rising up off the ground looking insidious in their expression all glaring at you as you're the most apparently-nearby individual what are you doing and it's going to stay aw damn it all right so top of the round who's got 25 to 20 anybody ooh percy with the rolls 20 and 20 for grog and vex all right 20 to 15 16 for tiberius a really strong 13 for vax all right (laughs) don't say that you got this you'll be fine well that's the plate armor and-- i don't know why and what have you guys got initiative-wise pike then scanlan all right so top of the round percy you're out in the ship are you going to stay on the ship (laughs) i know timing is everything what are you doing quick this beach is just gravel there's no particular physical element maybe on the far end there might be a part of the wall but it's going to be an awkward hinge and there's really nowhere to latch-- well if you have an adhesive you might be able to stick it to the wall at the far end of the beach-- the cavern wall that you're up against-- but there's nothing actually on the beach floor at all okay so as you hold it up you line up your enchanted ice chamber of your pepperbox fire and with an extremely loud echoing (gun noise) gun shot sound throughout the cavern you see a blast the bullet itself ricochets and spins off into the distance into the darkness but you do see left behind where part of the rock has chiseled from the impact ice has coalesced and cracked and has for the time being held the rope to the edge of the cavern all right so percy is there percy it's going to take you a few rounds to get there it's long winding pathway but you're in the process of making your way there all right great so that brings us to grog and vex grog and vex what have you got no the boat is not beached the rope that the boat is attached to is currently attached to the wall so it's anchored you're in the boat grog's in the boat clarota kima as grog leaps out (sploosh) splashing it's shallow at this point you're about waist deep in the water you trudge up to the shore run across the gravel beach and start heading straight into the cavern after percy yelling into the cavern a big old goliath scream laser pointer if anyone needs it by the way there you go all right that brings us to vex you're still on top of the flying carpet the three of you best you can tell there are three that all look similar in stature there's one over here that is generally larger taller more lanky and appears to have a semblance of armor on him still and he almost seems to be giving looks and silent commands to the others what's the range on hunter's mark you're back here yeah you can get there hunter's mark on that one trinket's ears perk up from the distance he can hear your whistle echoing through the cavern on the beach side he stumbles out of the boat (sploosh) big splash and chases after grog all wet and soaked the fur pushed against the body conjure barrage what's the range of that you are quite a distance from most of them you might have to hop off the flying carpet you're currently not in control of the carpet tiberius is you can do that vex delays on that grog's turn's ended all right so the undead take their turn so as all the entities rise up they all swarm in rushing around with an unnatural speed they all leap up you see portions of their jaw dangling with these sharp awful blackened teeth that are broken and gnarled you glance around suddenly as this darkened room which you're able to make a little bit of light from tiberius's light on the end of his staff they move (whoosh) with a blur of speed and they're right up in your face first thing you notice one of them is giving off an awful stench the smell you smelled when you first entered the cavern is now so strong that it's nearly overpowering it's hard to find a source to it however you are taking a claw strike from each of them that is going to be a six that misses hits 18 and then 20 all right so three claw strikes you take seven points of slashing damage another seven points of slashing damage and then a ten so that's a total of 24 points of slashing damage as all these horribly-muddied and half-rotted claws start sinking past the armor into your flesh the back of your neck one catches you in the side and it all happens so fast you feel like you're almost spun around by the sheer force of the impact i need you to make three constitution saving throws 15 all right okay you're currently paralyzed my friend yeah all right that brings us to tiberius and vex right here i'd say you're approximately-- you can probably push it 20 feet it's about there all right so as you finish casting you can see some of the actual sand that fills the bottom of this cave begins to swirl up in a wind around tiberius's hands and as he lifts his arms up a single column of stone shakes and shifts out of the ground lifting your paralyzed body 15 feet into the air thankfully the actual cavern itself is about 25 feet tall so it doesn't crush you against the ceiling it can only go 15 feet for level 3 or 20 i'm sorry 20 feet so you're barely brought up to the ceiling it crests the top of your head but not enough to actually crush you or do any damage but you are seemingly out of harm's way from the current undead onslaught all right so tiberius as you lift up the pillar with one hand the dust settles and falls from your hand and as it does this hand back here begins to coalesce this small bead of red burning energy you fling it out with your off hand it streaks across hits the base of the pillar and explodes with a blast of red fiery magical energy go ahead and roll damage your dc on that is 17 right they all failed their saving throw it's 8d6 same damage your lightning bolt does 32 damage causing him to fall you used your movement to move the carpet sorry you only take i'd say 2d6 no 1d6 because it's only a 20-foot fall you're able to catch yourself and it's also sand so it's not too hard all right that finishes your turn wait you did land in a bunch of rocks of the broken pillar roll another d6 points of damage if it was the sand it wasn't so hard but it was the fact that i realized there was a whole crapton of pillar rubble that your paralyzed body fell upon unable to brace your fall so that's going to hurt in the morning vex you're up if you want to yeah you still haven't used it for the day okay you're attacking him twice yeah all right and what's the other attack both hit go ahead and roll damage that hits well the bracers only affect your damage not to hit you get +2 to all damage rolls with ranged attacks you roll the regular damage multiply it by two and then add your modifier at the end and hunter's mark on both of those because it's on the board (laughs) there you go the smoke filters out of the way and you make the visual you see your brother on the ground currently seizing and in the rubble you see the shadow of one of the undead still standing angrily it rears back with its claws forward and gives this horrible gnashing sound as its jaw opens and actually widens this long tongue (wet sucking noise) whips out on it as you bear down and release one arrow (shoomf) piercing the side of its shoulder as it reaches out to break it off its tongue still out the second one goes into the tongue out the back of the throat (choking noise) it reaches up and breaks off the arrow in the throat looks towards you goes to lunge and as it does you can see it just collapses on top of his body no longer moving all right so the rest of you finally make your way into the cavern you manage to shrug off the rest of this paralyzation stiffly get up and find your way out of the rubble yeah you can get out of the boat keyleth you're left out there as a shark as everyone goes inside vex you go over and lift the top of the chest which was unlocked previously by your brother as you lift it up for a split second you see what looks like a flash of orange energy-- a very familiar one as suddenly a secondary fire blast (explosion sound) emanates from the treasure chest itself the blast radius sends the top half of the chest careening off and scraping off the roof of the cavern you guys who just turned the corner see this giant explosion sending you about 20 feet backwards yeah so a reflex saving throw for both of you or dexterity sorry (sing-song) carry over from pathfinder i meant dexterity 30 jesus christ yeah you both manage to find a way to dodge most of the impact but you still both take 14 points of fire damage then you take nothing you take 14 points of fire damage the familiar whine of the trap catches your ear you dodge out of the way instinctively your sister's not so lucky you take the brunt of the damage but not the full damage if you want to inspect what the chest once was as you go back to where the chest was most of the chest is destroyed it's knocked off its hinge what you do find inside though is what looks like a very very there we go what looks like a slightly-charred two-handed blade a giant sword that is currently laid inside looks like it's been there a while in storage there was a set of natural armor that's been completely destroyed by the blast there are a number of coins in there there's probably a good hefty pile of gold slightly molded by the moisture that's been kept inside this chest until it was detonated gathering it up you find approximately 420 gold pieces but for everything that was damaged inside the chest the sword which would be considered a greatsword seems to be largely unaffected by the blast other than a little bit of soot that you had to rub off the blade there you go she hands you this fantastic sword okay there's definitely a magical aura emanating from the blade you take a moment to inspect it and you ascertain the magical nature scanlan could it's a little big for you you'd be at quite a disadvantage using this weapon you guys were inspecting what remains of three of the undead creatures they have been turned to ash pretty much from the force of the explosion the arcane nature of the detonation you find pieces of them most of them have been charred and burned away from the bodies who are already in partially-decomposed form the larger one that you had hunter's marked though upon inspecting it while most of its armor is destroyed it does manage to carry a partially-mildewed coin purse looking inside you only find about five or six pieces of gold but you do find one really really nice looks like it's taken a little bit of damage but it was once a really pretty diamond tiberius you reach into the bag of holding you pull out the mending wheel which is a magical artifact that you found earlier in the campaign as part of your personal quest it looks like a large spoked roulette wheel when it's laying down with these strange points that fold out of it once you spin the wheel you place an object in the center of the wheel it's lifted without gravity and mends itself back to its undamaged form you place the diamond in the center and spin the wheel you can see the actual cracks on the surface of it slowly begin to mend eventually the diamond is brought to a solid undamaged finely-cut example of a diamond you have no idea it hasn't been too terribly long you rested at the camp after taking out queen ulara so i'd say it's probably been about-- with the travel to get to this point probably about six hours since you rested go ahead and roll perception you take a look at the liquid and it looks enchanted but the way its mixture is the colors seem to swirl and shift in a very caustic way you can see from glancing at the glass vial it's contained in the interior of the glass looks slightly pock-marked almost like the viscous fluid within has actually damaged the glass slightly you're unable to really ascertain what the nature of the liquid is but those are the details you can make out currently all right make a medicine check it ends here this is the end of the cave it curved around and ended in this little portion here so you had a perception check what did you roll 22 you see best you can and you guys follow her eyeline you look up and you see what first looks like it's part of the cavern ceiling it has this weird texture it looks almost like the smooth rock that the interior of the cavern comes off as however as you see it shift and move it looks almost like a portion of it is moving and slowly crawling and it looks like there's a red gleaming eye and then two and something drops down from the side almost like a tail that seems to dangle for a second at which point it detaches (fwoosh) opens up almost like a giant ray with a screeching mouth that (screeches) screams at you it lands down in the center of the room your foot is still healing but unfortunately based on the medicine roll it is getting better but not enough to complete the process of you getting all your toes back let's roll some initiative folks that's how it works so at this this thing leaps out from almost nowhere the only reason you picked it up is your acute vision and as it lands it's right around the corner from the two of you and it has this long almost spined tail and this jaw that opens up this nasty toothy gaping maw all right initiative rolls of 25 to 20 22 25 all right nice all right and grog what was yours again all right 18 for tiberius 15 to ten 11 for scanlan ten all right so top of the round as this creature sits there it's giving off this weird horrible moaning sound (screeches) that's starting to just fill your ears at the top of the round is vax if you want to try and move her you'll basically move both of you you can do that but you'll have no other action okay grab your sister currently you guys would be able to get onto the carpet what why would a giant winged-thing fly percy no you're not on the boat you guys have come into the cavern after this point when you gave chase you guys are in the cavern oh you did then yeah you're still out by the boat you take the butt of your gun and you start bashing against the ice that you set against the wall it cracks and eventually you get the rope free from the side of the wall okay that brings us to grog all right okay so you just bolt out i say rage run and barbarian speed you're going to get nearly completely out of the cavern keyleth are you staying out in shark form at the boat okay all right pike all right so you turn and run you catch up to grog because he traveled twice the distance that you could have with your tiny little gnome legs in your full-plate armor you're like (grunt) plus it's sand so your feet are sinking with each step it's rough for you to get around because of your size and the terrain you can try to all right make an athletics check with disadvantage because you're in full-plate armor all right what's your strength what was your athletics total so that brings you to a ten ten is what you needed so as you run up you leap and grab onto grog's back grog i want you to make a-- that makes you a nine so as you jump to grab onto the back of grog's back you manage to find purchase grog instinctually reaches back with an elbow and hits you right in the side of the armor which knocks you flat on your back you're currently prone in the sand right there and grog just keeps running you glance over your shoulder for a second but because you're raging you don't see her you just see shadows in the cavern so you start moving your hand in the air freaking out holding your axe in one hand and your greatsword in the other just (panicked screaming) the large ray-like cloaked creature swoops down towards the top of the-- all right it's going to make a bite attack against tiberius and a tail attack against scanlan so it's the two that are immediately visible to it so the bite attack against you tiberius that's going to be a 21 the bite attack against you is going to be a 23 (all laugh) tiberius all right it comes out and sinks its teeth into your form across your shoulder area and it bites down you end up taking-- (laughing) ten points of piercing damage and the creature wraps around you (squelch) completely envelops you him so that's going to end its turn tiberius your turn okay because it's attached to your head it's going to have disadvantage so i think it's-- is it a dexterity saving throw its head is right by your mouth go ahead and roll damage i rolled a natural 20 and a six so because of the disadvantage it does not make its save yeah roll the damage for your fire breath depends on your level as a dragonborn should be on your sheet no no it's here i'll it is 3d6 at 6th level 21 points of damage you all hear a muffled (explosion sound) as bits of flame begin to shoot out from the corners of where it's wrapping around the torso of tiberius surrounding his head the creature's tail flicks around in pain you hear this muffled (screeching) sound as it keeps still tight around his head fighting through the damage and maintaining its hold on him okay all right we're going to do a contested roll on this well no for this i believe it's the roll plus your spell modifier should be five so roll a d20 add five to it 20 all right so your ioun stone is floating around your head which is currently surrounded by the creature it's clinging to your head you can feel it grinding into the top of your skull you instill the ioun stone to trigger as you do the force begins to pull it (grunt) off of and flings it off of your head the creature is detached and thrown back at that point of the wall off of you all right they move out that way scanlan are you staying on the carpet anything else you want to do pike's laying in the dirt right now as scanlan grabs you and holds you for a second for a moment you're confused and you hear that strange shrieking moan in the distance and suddenly the darkness gives way to this flash of purple arcane energy and the two of you (boof) fall a few inches into hard wood and you feel the boat rock for a second as you're now on the outside in the boat being tugged by keyleth the shark okay vex (bear moan) trinket runs up are you staying on the carpet all right you jump on top of your bear and you start bolting down the hallway all right that ends your turn clarota just (whoosh) vanishes kima (laughing) goes running on her halfling legs towards the flying carpet she takes her full turn and she just manages to get on top of the carpet and that's her turn and she goes go go go go (laughing) all right so for the time being we'll say you guys manage to (whoosh) make your way outside of the cavern to the ship being towed as you guys all get into the boat-- as keyleth begins to pull away the boat picks up speed into the water and you hear that moan sound begin to get louder as the creature (swoosh) out of the cavern giving chase all right so for the purposes of this-- all right so going off same top of the round vax you're up first due to its distance the darkness behind it and the fact that you are in a boat you are at a disadvantage on both your attack rolls so you super miss on that one okay so you throw both daggers (whoosh whoosh) unfortunately it's hard to make the form of the creature it seems to almost-- i can't say change its color but it embraces the shadows around it and it gets harder and harder to see and for a moment you swear you see two more appear at its sides you fling both daggers and they vanish into the darkness and return to your side that ends your turn percy you're up so you've leaned your giant sniper cannon that you've constructed up against the side of the boat aim it up best you can and take a shot you are at disadvantage for this shot so it cancels out it's just a regular shot 13 13 unfortunately misses (gun blast sound) the ship actually rocks from the impact of the explosion for a second there you all feel like it's going to list and take on water who's on the carpet still okay tiberius is still on the carpet so you go ahead and reload yeah that'll be your turn that comes up to grog the creature is approximately 40ish feet away at an angle so it's about 50 feet away from you up in the air you can try and shift your weight to the back of the boat and get closer with your movement if you want you can certainly try all right cool keyleth you're pulling the boat okay so you manage to get some distance for the ship pulling it further behind you're moving slower than that because you're pulling it towing the entire boat behind you so you're going 20 but you're putting distance between you and the creature for the rest of the party which makes it harder for it to catch up all right that brings us to pike yes add your spell modifier to it oh you found your sheet awesome 12 does not hit unfortunately once again you fire and you think you hit one of them but it seems to hit one of the group of three that's now flying overhead and one shimmers and vanishes seemingly unaffected by the bolt but that one image of it disappears no not unless you want to move somewhere in the boat all right it's now its turn it is going to move it gains up on the boat to about there it actually gets a little lower it's starting to gain on you guys make its way (shh) gliding down towards the front and you see now there's now two of them side by side that are coming down towards you guys it's then that that strange moaning sound it's making (moans) begins to grow louder and louder and all of you close your ears for a second everybody make a wisdom saving throw you don't actually hear in the water you're muffled it's to the point where it doesn't actually affect you plus you're in shark form yes all right scanlan all right tiberius four percy one oh no grog grog and vex now let's see you rolled a what 11 okay yeah so no vax however is okay so kima vax and grog and clarota all hear this horrible moaning sound and plug their ears and shake it off not a problem everyone else-- this creature-- all of a sudden its form becomes far more frightening than you ever saw before it almost seems to swell with the cavern it's a natural ability all of you are considered frightened nope it is not a charm effect it is a fear effect you are scared of it currently you're scared trinket's not affected but you are essentially until the end of its next turn it's disadvantage on all attack rolls and you cannot move closer to it you can take that turn now yeah as it's moaning it would be within 30 feet turn around all right so what's the dc on that 13 for what kind of saving throw okay for the creature wisdom saving throw it rolls a 12 (all cheer) it doesn't cancel out yours it just means it's further away and can't get closer to grog you're still scared of it until the end of its next turn but now it's keeping its distance from the boat it was starting to catch up to you guys and now it's actually pulled back not wanting to get near grog all right tiberius it looks leathery it has almost the texture of a very very thick bat or lizard skin but it's very dark from what you can see you've had just little glimpses of it here and there most of it's been shrouded in shadow it's almost like a thick leather cloak that's come to life okay so tiberius you move your movement to later not unless you have an anti-fear spell scanlan you're up all right all right so you take your turn are you just using the which one oh grasping hand okay all right attempt to grapple use the hand's strength score to resolve the grapple strength of 26 so roll d20 + 8 okay so nine plus eight you're at 17 its contest was at 15 oh but you are at disadvantage so roll again okay so as you rear back your eyes squinting just scared to even do anything with this creature you try out this new spell that you've only just recently managed to conjure to your attention as scanlan finishes singing the rippling sonic energy from his singing shoots out from in front of him and forms this giant slightly ethereal-looking arcane fist the size of the creature that reaches out grabs onto it as he's moving his hand controlling it silently from a distance it grapples the creature holds it in place as its wings are also folded on itself and you pull down let's see here grasping hand all right so you are trying to it's locked in where you're holding it okay so you lock it there great you can use a bonus action to crush it so as you're holding it in place you use your bonus action to squeeze it it takes 2d6 + 5 bludgeoning damage 16 nice as it is currently held in place screeching (screech crunch) you hear this strange crushing sound of bones breaking on the inside of its strange form all right and it is considered grappled which is bad for a creature like that that ends scanlan's turn vex all right you hunter's mark the creature 16 does hit all right technically because it's grappled-- it does not technically it just means he can move it so yeah it does not cancel out the disadvantage yeah okay great there you go so as you're on the boat you can see the hand grasping it gives you a moment of bravery you pull out (swoosh swoosh) let loose two more arrows into the slightly dark shrouded exterior of the boat both arrows strike true into the currently-grappled cloak-like creature nice portions of it are trying to squeeze free of this arcane hand one strikes through its wing leaving a gaping wound in the middle where you can see it's going to have a hard time maintaining height at this point the second one strikes it and actually pierces one of its red glowing eyes it gives out this horrible painful screeching sound (screech) into the cavern as you can now see what was once two gleaming red piercing eyes left with only one and darkness on the other side of its face that brings us to kima and clarota kima at this point in time is unfortunately at a disadvantage of finding out what to do at this distance being a paladin she is going to attempt-- nothing she's going to wait it out so you're taking your turn after laura interesting okay so clarota at this time is also going to attempt a mind blast on the creature it moves to the back of the boat and while it's currently grappled he's going to attempt that the saving throw does succeed so it only takes half damage okay marking that and then as you do telekinesis roll a d20 plus five the grapple does not give you advantage no so you have disadvantage on the roll technically because you are scared of it plus five 17 all right so as you focus your energy once again-- even just facing this creature is a terrifying thing-- you see that one gleaming bit of red that's piercing through the darkness the secondary form around it dissipates where there was once two gliding one of them vanishes entirely as that gleaming red is suddenly much brighter yanked from its socket it now gives out another painful screech (screeches) as it is blinded being crushed by a bigby hand and you now have drifting amongst you at your control one of the eyes of this creature (all laugh) okay write down in your inventory cloaker eye this guy's not having a good day vax you're up well no you resisted the fear you have low light so you're fine hits hits because it is blinded you do have advantage on it-- not advantage you are able to sneak attack it's currently held aloft grappled by the hand it has no visual sight currently all right how do you want to do this okay so as the creature is flailing about in torturous pain suddenly the dagger (fwoosh thunk) sinks into the empty socket in the front of its face as it does its body tenses up and reaches out against the force of your arcane hand you actually have to focus to keep it in place in its final death throes all of its tension and then it falls limp within your grasp you now have this limp creature at your disposal as scanlan slowly drifts over the limp body of this creature to the edge of the boat-- there is no wind in this tunnel history's not going to do much for you nature is what you're going to want to do nature or arcana those are the two roll for arcana yep this creature is a cloaker it's an aberration it's one of those creatures that drifts over from the far realm or at some point in time drifted over from the far realm and is an unnatural entity to this plane they normally live subterranean when not moving they are nearly invisible and blend in almost like a straight leather cloak left and discarded to the side hence the name cloaker okay so you guys are now currently in this boat drifting along in the open area over on that side if you guys start heading that direction you'll find out okay as you guys are moving along you leave a little space for percy it's a little unwieldy in the ship it's hard for you to do this so it's not going to be the best job fair enough as you're plucking what you think might be interesting from this creature's body as in the process of skinning it you probably take a moment to realize that a normal blade is going to have a hard time cutting through its hide so you might have to borrow one right so you gain a d10 inspiration dice yeah this is going to be a survival check on this roll survival 17 did you add the inspiration dice to that you don't have to if you don't want to okay 26 would make a difference in the confined space on this ship as you guys crest around towards the northern side of that island you begin to move around you can see to the right of you there is this tunnel that filters out the side of this cavern that's just a continuation of the water a river on the far end you don't know where it goes it disappears in the darkness and you can hear in the distance the light sound of rushing water it begins to curve about 20 feet in so you're unable to make much past that distance and it looks like a continuation of the water flowing through or into you're not quite able to tell from this distance percy you manage to pull from it all the teeth in the process so that comes to roughly 45 cloaker teeth you don't know what that'll be worth but you have that at your disposal so you can write down 45 cloaker teeth you manage to skin most of it you get most of the top of its hide usable it's still wet it'll take a while to do that let alone in an area where it's dry on the surface but you manage to pull most of the top of it off so you have this wet skinned portion of the back of the cloaker at your disposal okay make a tinker check well for that it should be dex i believe plus four because you're proficient with it so it's your dex plus your proficiency modifier 11 yeah you did you still have the hide in the time it takes for you to get to the beach you don't have much material at your disposal and to fashion anything that's on that side the most you manage to get is a slight lift to it and by the time you get to the beach it just collapses on itself okay it'll take you some time it's doable but it'll take a while as you make your way towards the beach keyleth you see in the distance in the water what looks like something slinking on the very bottom of this underground lake probably a good 50 60 feet down you can barely make out what looks like a dark form probably about 100 to 150 feet away and it's only because of your shark form that you're able to make out any sort of semblance of it but it looks big and it looks like it's slowly moving through the bottom of the lake doesn't seem to be moving towards you you guys are maybe 300 feet from the beach the creature no only keyleth does okay i'm going to ask keyleth to make a stealth check in shark form the dex bonus of a shark form is zero so just roll a d20 giant shark according to here it says one it's a zero dex is 11 17 okay as you deftly drag the boat at just the right distance to curve around this large subterranean form it doesn't seem to take notice and eventually drifts far enough away where you can no longer make any sort of visual connection with its form you make your way to the side of the beach you drag up to the point where the ship begins to hit the gravel you begin to move curve to the side and it (grinding sound) lifts up and comes to a rest at the top of the gravel beach you guys all step off the boat okay grog you go ahead and haul the boat up okay okay okay so looking at the beach here it's an open beach you can see there are a few rock formations small 15-foot-tall portions of stalagmites or stone that either have been here for a long time or have been constructed or put there to jut out of that part of the beach but for the most part it's just an open gravel beach that slowly comes to stop at the edge of the cavern and there is a tunnel about 15 20 feet wide ahead of you perception check (all laugh) 16 you do not see any sort of half-submerged statue of liberty my apologies yeah i'd say it's probably about a good half a mile or so make a perception check it's hard to tell she seems very focused on the task at hand her eyes have been for the most part up in the air around you unfortunately grog you don't think she's paying much mind to you at the moment because she's more concerned about keeping the group alive and where you guys are currently headed you'll have to try harder to get her attentions it's okay grog yeah now that you know the idea of what to look for for a cloaker go ahead and make a perception check okay you guys glance around and currently looking at the walls on the exterior of this beach area nothing matches the description of what you saw in the previous cavern for the time being it looks relatively safe on this part of the beach there is a singular cave on the far end there's a slight outcropping and then it leads into that one 20-foot-wide cavern that goes deeper in there yes you want to make a stealth check one more time stealth check first 31 okay so making your way up you dodge from low on the side of the beach jumping in front of these strange stone platforms keeping in look for cover you make your way up against the side of a wall begin to glance inside make a perception check 19 it's pitch-black in the cavern you have no light source unfortunately you have darkvision which does help you to a certain extent you cannot see the entirety of the cavern but you can see about let's say 40 to 60 feet in the beach gravel comes to a halt and comes to this smooth stone flooring you don't see anything that particularly catches your attention it looks like it has some natural change in the topography it's not a polished floor but it's definitely been worn over time okay so as you cast light on the arrow it's blinding you know at this point to close that one eye as you release it in the distance there you go that's the one you fire the arrow into the depth of this cavern before the light spell wears off it arcs inward and it hits the back wall and ricochets off looking inside it all looks like a natural cavern interior the light is the same glowing white light that you're used to once it enters the deep part of the cave the light almost gets a purplish hue before it's snuffed out the white light becomes purple and then (ffft) is snuffed at this distance it's hard to make out any sort of source you don't sense anything directly at your distance you'd probably have to get deeper in the cave to make a true assessment of the magical source you have pass without a trace now too okay good to know (laughs) yes as do a lot of you guys all right tiberius's flame breath (fsssh) coalesces and begins to ignite the tip of the torch as grog lobs it in end over end you see it hits the far end of the cavern topples and hits the ground the fire itself the bright red burning as it comes to rest takes on once again a strange purplish hue you see nothing in particular you catch what looks almost like small whiffs of almost a mist or a fog but it's like (ffft) then vanish (shh) almost like there's this perpetually materializing and dematerializing tufts of small clouds of smoke you can attempt to yeah okay so pike as you step up to the mouth of the cave looking where the torchlight is you cast dispel magic as you formulate your divine energy grasping onto your symbol of sarenrae around your neck you can see this strange pulsing shimmer of divine energy that clears out the area the purplish hue to the light vanishes and the light becomes a natural torchlight for a moment and all the wisps of smoke vanish then slowly filter back into the space it's hard to tell you can't see the entire cavern from this distance because the cavern opens up and then curves around there's a whole portion you can't see without entering it i think we have a specific goal at this point in time and who knows what dangers or terrors roam these tunnels aside from our specific directional choice at this moment all right you all gather yourself on the exterior of the cave you get into defensive positions and prepare-- all right all right extra wisdom so keyleth transforms herself into her earth elemental form it's hard to explain why but his strange shimmy is slightly inspiring you've learned something about yourself today that you hope nobody else wants to bring up in conversation you get a d10 inspiration dice okay so as you guys all mount into your defensive positions keyleth are you going straight through are you going beneath above this large earth elemental form takes a few lumbering steps forward and begins to sink into the sand and gravel below just (shifting sound) the most awkward earth elemental exit ever grog's loud laughter bellows echoing through the cavern you make your way underneath the ground using your tremor sense to formulate where the top of this cavern would be and you poke your head through the floor looking into this you can see now there are portions of this cavern where it looks like elements of the mithril veins that the subterranean kraghammer mines were currently pulling from seem to now spread down into this cavern there are small veins that trickle through the rock in this cavern of mithril you also look up and make a perception check this is wisdom yep all right total of 29 you take a moment and formulate your vision the firelight still trickling through although you have darkvision you look about the room and you can see there is a strange energy about the room there's something about this room that feels similar to when you encountered the frost plane during the first westruun winter's veil encounter there's a type of energy that seems to be brought into being whenever you've caught a mind flayer shifting and bamfing out of any sort of combat you come into there's something about this room that seems like it's crossing over or has a thin barrier with some other plane you don't see a particular doorway but it feels like there is a very thin veil here and as you focus more on the vicinity you can see what looks like little bits of energy that leak through that mist you were seeing seems to be elements where the actual reality of this room is warping temporarily and shifting you take it and you throw it up it arcs across hits the other side of the room and clatters to the ground as it clatters to the ground you suddenly see lightning-quick five of these large fast-moving slithering weird creatures that were up against the wall and now visible at this point strike at the rock and seem to start fighting each other for whatever that movement was they're large bluish and purple in color when it shifts in its form with these sharp beaks and what looks like four tentacles that wrap out from the face make a nature check if you want no this would be arcana arcana this wouldn't be nature okay arcana is intellect though it's not wisdom is it oh you did oh i see 15 unable to really make out more than you've heard of creatures like this unlike most aberrations and creatures that seem to bleed over from different planes of existence this one is not an aberration in its form this is just a subterranean monstrosity it's known as a grick essentially it looks like that as they all take a moment and realize that whatever they were fighting over is not living and not moving they hiss at each other and slowly find other alcoves and what you can now see are small caves that are dug into the rock nearby something draws them to this room as any natural space with this strange fluctuating energy would do so it seems to be yeah they're not too weird they're weird but they're not too weird you've seen it all all right after a few moments keyleth reappears for a split-second as you're doing that you realize that laughter's probably very audible so as you start laughing you revert back from elemental form yeah her elemental form is gone she's now back into keyleth's form all right both you guys go ahead-- well no roll your counterspell roll what level is your spell so no your spell just (pfft) no he has to make a save for silence what's the save on that one right but what's the actual save is it wisdom is it intelligence you do know that the essence of spiritual weapon it creates a weapon that is partially in form with your deity's weapon of choice or preference it's mainly melee weapons nothing too intricate no that is a delayed-blast fireball which is a higher-level spell so the bomb that was constructed ages ago by percy that was originally intended to put on a summoned pony but now is finally being used tiberius you approach the edge of the cavern make a stealth check right so you would have advantage on that invisibility and telekinesis are both concentration spells you would lose your invisibility to cast telekinesis a 21 total on the first roll okay got you so as you make your way up to the edge of the cavern you come in partially you guide the bomb towards the back and you lob it towards the far end this large awkward saddlebag-style construct of percy's design made of leather metal bands hits the back wall-- okay okay the bomb hits the wall hits the ground tumbles for a second awkwardly slumps over on itself at which point in a blur of motion the strange hissing sound a bunch of momentum hits the room and you see all these creatures begin attacking it-- so the fireball impacts the far end of the wall where the cluster of these strange worm creatures are it explodes with a large blasting echoing explosion sound hold your ears roll damage on that all right how much damage is that 32 points of damage that blasts open percy roll 4d6 points of damage from the actual bomb as the fireball detonates the saddlebag simultaneously with the explosion of the fireball okay all right great so simultaneously you guys hear (explosion noises) you can feel the sand shift and move and some part of the beach some of the gravel moves and rocks a little bit pitch-black smoke comes pouring out of the cavern you have to guard yourself as the smoke slowly clears you get a glance in there and you can see there are bits and pieces and chunks of grick matter across the wall and the inside of the cavern with some gaping half-bodies of these creatures torn open from the explosion there is nothing living and nothing moving from what you can see at the center of this cavern the occasional (dripping sounds) chunks dripping off the ceiling perception check okay glancing through you can see the small tunnels that these creatures house themselves in as a defensive position these creatures are not hunters they're more scavengers but they fight in packs and wait for things to find their way in this tunnel was definitely a place where they do that to keep fed however this tunnel appears to be empty other than the strange phenomenon of this energy in the tunnel make an arcana check 16 as you take a moment and step inside and feel the essence of it there is no portal there is no doorway there is no tear there's just a very thin veil between this plane and another you're unable to really ascertain the nature of this energy coming through but you're able to see there is these strange warps in reality as you walk into this room you look at your hands and for a second your fingers seem to bend and go to form as you look at people's faces they twist and shift and then go back you don't know if it's purely a visual thing or if matter itself is actually twisting but it's very discombobulating being in this room for any length of time clarota as he enters behind you guys puts his hands together and goes this i believe is the veil where k'varn stepped into the cavern the tentacles writhe around clarota's maw this is a boundary a thin membrane between this prime material plane and elements of the far realm you wish not to do that your mind would break we have not the power to shut this down it is how they overlap i don't know (all laugh) we'll have to find out i do not know i have not traveled the boundary myself it's about 20 25 feet yes his tentacles quiver as you call his name and he looks over at you with a curious hungry-to-be-of-service expression on his tentacled mind flayer face i have not seen k'varn with my mind or my eyes i've only heard of him arriving after i was cast out of my colony which kima mentions again that that is what we're trying to prevent making its way to the surface that's the horn of orcus i don't know i'm not a scrying type okay so the scribe rolls itself on top and poof vanishes in front of you okay okay you have a long distance you can pull on that one you take a moment and concentrate not in your immediate vicinity you do sense that across the way on that island there are hundreds of aberrations hundreds you can't make out the details you just sense the presence you see clusters you see some wandering the outskirts of the island and the center of the island you sense there is one very strong source of aberration-based essence no in the center clarota gives you a look and says most likely or at least is related to the kin from the other side of the veil that pay attention druid okay as you're doing this grog kima who at this point as you got out of this conversation is currently rewrapping the handle of the maul that she found earlier in the cavern stops what she's doing glances over at scanlan with a very stern look and goes gnome i mean no disrespect when i say toy with my mind again and you'll find the business end of this hammer right up your rectum you've bothered me enough recently with your antics as she does that she motions towards your nether region i'd watch it she keeps wrapping the handle of the maul as we're taking a rest at this moment to prepare for whatever you guys want to do next let's take a quick restroom break for the group let's say about a 5-minute break if we want to just play 3 videos or so we'll make it quick so we can get back to the game before we do that all right just a second things are happening you guys are so awesome all right so they came in from this side guys that's great thank you so much yep presents for your friends 5-minute break guys make it quick we'll see you back here in 5 minutes thank you [dramatic music] welcome back break is finished once again i want to remind you guys we're just a little over 100 shirts left if we can manage to get to 1000 in the next 45 minutes-- shop for your buddies' birthdays-- don't do that yeah no worries guys so to bring this back to where we were you guys have been puttering around after you're clearing out this cavern on the northern shore of this large cave surrounding yug'voril what is your current plan of action you guys didn't end up resting i think just been preparing you manage to make a way where the central focal point of this cavern's entrance you manage to eventually carve all the stone to close it off about 20 minutes of you doing this as you're having this discussion a small slip of parchment apparates in front of you with a flash of purplish energy written upon it it says tiberius you speak of the far realm which i am quite familiar with there are many aberrations however i do not know the name k'varn per se in my research there are many things that can fall under the description you say it's vague enough unfortunately i have not much to go off of if you had an image or a visual description of this creature i'd be able to help but at the moment i have no way of giving you any more knowledge my apologies and signed at the bottom okay go ahead and make another tinker check you guys are on the beach the island itself i'd say is about a quarter- to a half-mile away it's hard to tell from this distance with no light source any movement whatsoever over there or any sound they make over there yes other than the bioluminescent fungal plant life and forest that coats this side you have no light source on that side whatsoever and it's just faint enough where you can make out the outline of the island itself but beyond that you have very little visual it doesn't necessarily cling it's more of a presence thing than it is a material clinging energy which you already closed off at this point in time so you're near the edge of the wall where you've already blocked it off okay so you get closer to that presence you do have scrying as a spell i would say if you both expend-- if you have it prepared do you have scrying prepared all right well we'll see what we can do well see for druids it's not so much a spellbook more than it is just an innate nature you have a book for your own note-taking but the actual spell itself comes from you harnessing the divine energy of nature around you so there wouldn't be a way that it should be able to help you in that spell more than a slight bonus to the dc but i'll keep that in mind yeah definitely would give inspiration you feel inspired it's possible all right then no you can only have one inspiration dice at any given point in time and it's a d10 you are so you're smiling through the spell (laughs) all right so you take ten minutes to yourself to prepare the ritual you carve out a portion of the beach where the gravel is most easy to manipulate and you begin to set up this extensive scrying ritual okay so as you draw the circle across the portion of the gravel and stonework-- actually this is further in the cave so the gravel has given in to more solid stonework you begin to carve across the ground with a small piece of charcoal that you use for your ritual drawings this giant runic circle you draw points for you to sit and a point for pike to sit as well to help you focus in this vision once you've taken the ten minutes to establish all the various material components and littered it with pieces of dried animal matter some herbs and lit a small bowl of incense on the side to help you in this spell you sit down take your place pike you take your place and you begin to concentrate you draw the essence of the nature energies around you and begin to project your vision towards the description of this dark horn pushing what you can best ascertain is the direction of the temple from where this ritual is being conducted all right so given the circumstances bonus from that let's make a will save all right so you feel your vision project beyond you it's a sort of out-of-body experience as the energy that makes up keyleth is no longer given physical form it's just adrift in the darkness you feel yourself drawn pulled almost like there's an energy that draws you as if poison from a wound it pulls you upward and you're looking down over the top of this entire cavern suddenly the darkness tends to fade for a moment and you can make out the general outline of this island once again your vision (shhh) zooms in and shifts you can look over the city you can see yug'voril over top you can see the glowing aspects of the forest surrounding the outskirts of it and you can see in the center of this ruined city that has been reconstructed in the image of the temple that stands this giant pseudo-pyramid with a flattened top you can now see it from the overhead view of this temple it is actually open and that strange glowing source of green energy you can see is slowly emanating from the top your vision is pulled forward again you feel yourself drawn towards it and as you come towards the top you can see the open portion of this temple's roof is a crossbeam made of gold or brass and there is some sort of structure hanging from it that falls deeper into the temple you then move past this into what is the topmost chamber of this temple it's darker at first and as your essence tends to coalesce and find some sort of visual here you can see now this brass cross-beam that is held aloft in the center of this temple chamber drips down into a spiral of metal this strange arcane contraption that does not match any of the construct of this temple previously it almost seems like it's been a new addition or is taking the place of something else that was a central focus of this chamber you follow this strange arcane structure about 15 to 20 feet it comes from the top of the temple chamber to the center where held aloft underneath it by another 15-foot drop you see in this dark room a pool of a dull bluish purple liquid and it's pulsing with life and with energy you now look down your eyes focus and in this pool this ten 15-foot-wide round pool you can see this pulse almost a heartbeat of purplish energy what look like small purple stones but they're not stones they're minds they're brains they're essences and they're all working together interconnected you're looking upon the elder brain of yug'voril the center of the entire illithid colony that resides in the center of this chamber you can see now this green energy that's being brought down from this metallic structure at the top of this temple is being funneled down over and is acting as an arcane prison for the elder brain it's sealing and controlling essentially and what you had gathered from your previous discussions with clarota this is what has taken the minds of the mind flayers and bent them to k'varn's will your focus shifts now from the elder brain and you look around the room and in the dark shadows of this room you can see there are cages there are metal bars you're unable to really ascertain what the material is but in each one of these small cages you see some creature some of this realm some not horrible forms mutated torn some missing limbs some in the process of slowly dying because they're unable to keep a physical form intact it's a collection a horrible collection of malformed entities that are being experimented on pulled apart put together this also serves as seemingly a laboratory for k'varn and you feel a presence in the room suddenly your essence shifts around and you look in the darkness and you see slowly drifting out of the shadow a single gnarled black horn underneath that horn you can see now the physical form that it adorns dark brown leathery skin with slightly pointed edges almost like scales that form out of portions of this flesh you see below this horn one large piercing sky-blue eye that glances up and meets your gaze as it does from beneath that eye you see a toothy maw tear into a wide grin and around the outskirts of the singular eye numerous other eyes (whoosh whoosh) shift around coming into the light you see now a fleshy ball that is drifting in the air itself under its own physical form this aberration this horrible entity is now floating forward you can see metal plates that are grafted to the physical body of this creature apparently k'varn has experimented on itself these eyes are attached to strange finger-like stalks that twist out of its body these eyes darting around the room looking at different directions and then they all (whoosh) singularly shift on you at once as it does you can feel all of a sudden your presence which has been drifting through the scrying spell locked in place and for a second you feel like you can't breathe as k'varn presses towards you this fleshy sphere of eyestalks and teeth this small chuckle billows up deep within its mouth (chuckles) so guest do you like my home you're welcome any time at which point the horn seems to glow with this creepy greenish energy and you feel this piercing pain blast into your head you try and scream but you can't there's no breath go ahead and make a wisdom saving throw no because that's a concentration spell keyleth is sweating profusely and you can see she's flinching all right so 27 all right good you take 11 points of psychic damage and are thrust out of the scry spell your vision is pulled out of the top of the temple and suddenly you're back in your form as a sharp pain hits you across the side of the head vax is holding you it's not a beam but you do see a slight green glow at the top of the temple in the distance you saw it when you first entered and it's been this dull beacon as you traveled around this island that's a beholder i'll give you a detailed description essentially this pyramid comes to a top and then flattens up at the very top where you would expect there to be a flat surface is instead essentially a windowed opening you don't think it's purely open like you could just jump through there is some sort of glass that coats it but there is a brass cross-beam at the very top and then part of this cross-beam holds aloft this strange series of metallic wires that spiral and intertwine that serves as a conical focus piece you can't see the interior of it essentially a slow beehive at this point as you guys look over at clarota you see clarota for the first time in a while looks visually disturbed has withdrawn from the group and is leaning against the side of the beach cavern wall and the tentacles that normally slowly twirl are all tensed and pulled up into a knot that k'varn is of this new creature a beholder and carries this horn that lady kima has spoken of it's a great danger also keep in mind the temple is not made of average stolen metals this is the center of the elder brain we reinforce it with magical protection it's the center of our entire species' knowledge every brain in there is our elders' as we pass to the next generation our mind is brought and introduced to the elder brain we have that room protected from simple acids we must make sure we are ready no it was open before there seems to be some sort of new focus k'varn has constructed i do not know but if i've seen anything of the nature of this insidious creature i would say plan for the worst nothing is more terrifying than underestimating a beholder then kima says the key is here is not to think how to fight him head-on we have to be smart about this while he has the home turf we have the element of surprise we choose the grounds in which we attack and we choose the methods in which we set the battlefield i highly doubt he's going to leave his home turf but if we can find a way to perhaps turn it against him or use it to our advantage maybe some reconnaissance i don't know i don't know that's up to you you can attempt it once a day and once it works it can't be done for another week in some way essentially you formulate how you want your deity's aid and if you succeed-- you have a 10% chance of success-- in some divine way sarenrae will guide power or aid to you i would say your materials are very limited clustered mainly in the city region at this distance it's hard to make out any sort of visual not at once no clarota can just hover you can have him alongside the carpet so percy you're on the boat as well i could but the time required would be months weeks not in our timeframe i believe to the bottom of the carpet okay go ahead and make a roll 16 easy enough to do all right so you take a little bit of your thick heavy leather thread the stuff that you use for something and you loosely attach it to the bottom of the carpet so as grog's pulling along-- make an athletics check by the way you guys are-- all right so you pull it across it's a slow speed but you're making your way i would also like grog to make a stealth check 29 stealth as you're very carefully breaking the water's surface-- okay so as you guys make your way across the channel towards the far end of the island which is the beach that's in view you see the water disturbed slightly about 200 feet off to the right something deep below you can see bubbles rising up as you carefully make your way ever so quiet across to the beach you find purchase landfall hits you on the other side of the beach apparently not disturbing whatever lies beneath the surface okay so you pull the boat up the rest of you guys bring the carpet over you come to a landing part totally fine the beach comes to a steep incline that leads up onto the island proper there's cliffs on both sides of this beach and as the incline increases up about maybe 500 600 feet from where you are you can see what looks like a few buildings or rubble of what was a small gathering of structures what you're seeing now is this you do see towards the right of those structures those fungal-based trees they rise about 25 30 feet in the air there's no leaves it's almost like a cluster of weird fungus-like vines that drift from the top surface and the trees unnaturally sway in place almost like they have a rhythm to their movement really nasty dr seuss trees clarota says no those trees merely exist on this island they feed off of the essence of it and they provide food for other things that live here wandering spores other creatures we feed our captives our slaves of the colony with the fungal essence of the tree the trees are not dangerous but whatever resides on this island is probably under the influence of the elder brain and my people which are in turn under the influence of k'varn small sightless rats cavern insects but the dangers lie in the spores that wander the forests you'll know when you see it spiny drifting it's a psychic discussion he looks at you and gives you a stern look takes the ale from you i have no need for such false sustenance all right go ahead and make a nature check all right 16 on nature okay from a safe distance you look at it the trees do not appear to be anything beyond a subterranean forest fungal trees oh you wanted to go over and collect some okay it's quite a ways up it's up the side of the cliff it's up an incline and the forest starts adjacent to the structure where they're going so you can make a stealth check to make your way there if you'd like no most of the forest starts further up this incline as the island itself begins to level off all right 28 for stealth you get advantage on your roll what did you roll with advantage all right so you guys make your way towards this ruin and as you come to it you caught a small glimmer of it on the bridge that was constructed across the first beach you came across in this cavern the stonework is interesting it's almost like an influx of jade and marble the stone itself does not seem to be anything you've seen naturally around the cavern either it was brought here or was crafted from some substance that resides on this island but it has this weird green jade marble almost vein-like visual to it and you notice all the structures aren't straight and smooth everything has this slightly non-euclidean bend to it every edge has a slight curve it's off-putting there isn't a rigidity to any of these walls and the buildings themselves almost seem to sag or they sit or rest at a strange unnatural angle many have been long-crumbled and you find some of these buildings have fallen in on themselves you do notice as you approach the edge of it there is a large circular structure a pit that is built central to this parts of the wall have fallen in but for the most part still remains intact and in the center of this pit on the floor you can see what looks like splotches of dried crimson long-left blood splatters of some sort of creature you see dried bones but the bones while dried have some sort of fungus growing on them you also see what looks to be tucked against one of the walls a campsite but a very large campsite the fire pit is 15 feet wide and is just a small cinder you see what looks to be a pile of furs there is actual embers in the fire pit there looks to be a large bedroll made of patchwork furs but the pile itself is huge three times even which means it houses a lot of individuals as you're taking this look too as you guys are having this visual you-- well you immediately hear a sound it's a slight rumble in the ground and what sounds like a footfall and as you glance over your shoulder you can see what looks to be some sort of towering humanoid dragging something behind it it glances up with its nose in the air (sniffs) who goes there and you look to see what looks large almost goliath-like bald skin is smooth no hair but its skin is purplish in color where a normal giant would stand naturally it's horribly hunched like its back has a horrible scoliosis twist to it one giant popping yellow eye glances out towards the edge of where you guys are it doesn't seem to have found any of you immediately but something has alerted its attention it seems to have caught some sort of trail in its natural homestead you see it standing probably close to 15 20 feet in height as it begins lumbering up (krsh krsh krsh) towards you all of you were stealthed as well you can make an insight check you don't see him all you guys are staying back at the beach while they're checking 17 this entity looks like it's hungry it looks malicious and looks like it's caught the thrill of the hunt since it seems to have seen something near its

so blessed and excited that we have such amazing friends and viewers out there you guys are the most amazing fanbase for any show i've ever had so thank you you guys earned this most definitely i'm willing to stay as long as we need i know some people have families they've got to get back to how many shirts were sold by the end of it last i checked we were at 1032 the shirts are still available for another week it says pan main camera up (all laugh) it's saying the banner's cutting off heads in the back who wants to pick a question and run with it over the course of the first major arc of their campaign every town they went to there seemed to be this recurring theme of children disappearing so they kept trying to follow this thread and asking around and these kids kept vanishing and the one common thread they were discovering was shortly before each kid disappeared they began playing with a new kid who had long black hair and golden eyes and then they would disappear within a week of playing with that child towards the end of the campaign during a celebration after they managed to save the city of emon they looked over and found that the sovereign uriel's child was talking to this black-haired golden-eyed child so the party in the middle of a platform grandstand bowing before the townspeople they just pulled their weapons out and jumped off after this child who grabbed the sovereign's son and pulled him into this pocket dimension what it turned out to be was this entity which is a variation of the dread emperor for those who are familiar with that character the dread emperor had created this pocket dimension world this giant bramble forest that surrounded a gothic castle where it existed this weird messed-up individual brought children there because it loved to be around their innocence and their naivety their sense of play yeah it was messed up but once the children got too old they were no longer useful so he killed them and put them in a basement so the party gave chase they fought their way to the castle and they discovered that what was dangerous about fighting this dread emperor in his library was it was wearing golden armor and attached to this armor via four chains were four children by collars and if anyone attacked him directly he shared the damage he took with the children however you guys started attacking the chains with your weapons and you were doing enough damage during the first few rounds to save most of the kids you broke the kid's neck that's what happened the vine wrapped around his body and it broke his neck because he was still attached you just grabbed the kid trinket plushies would be amazing i would love to expect those at some point in the future i'd like that that would be cool as far as writer's block good music i have a number of playlists where if i'm having a problem i just close my eyes and listen to good music a lot of soundtracks i find elder scrolls soundtrack is great stuff like that gets my mind going someone asked if the group would ever do hot pepper gaming matt and there are plans in place for most of us to partake i don't know if everyone will but some will yeah so that will be fun everyone's ten now i think it's a q&a (laughs) what is your alignment you should look at your sheet okay it's not so much required to be lawful like the older editions are but it depends on the deity you chose i'm still keeping an eye on your actions in the game that crack in your thing is still there we'll see how it plays out that was really good come in buddy that's a long question training to be an actor and then pursuing the opportunities whole different character yeah i can see that a little bit i was a ham oh yeah you were a child actor you're like oh i was working with spielberg when i was six as a note guys for those of you that have seen mr mom the little kid with the woobie yeah that would be amazing if anyone out there wants to make it a comic book that would be great someone asked how did we all get into d&d high school for me for most everyone else this yeah this is liam's fault it happens hold on yeah awesome question how do we send you shit talk to overlord small boxes of shit dm the overlord for where to send your boxes full of fecal matter (laughs) i know real fast a note to all you guys because travis and laura have a vacation planned in two weeks depending on where we are in the game if the party's about to go in to fight k'varn and then they have to leave the following week we might actually take a week off and instead do a three-hour hangout and answer questions and i might go over teaching people how to play the game because we don't want to do a boss fight without two of our party so just as a heads-up that might be something that happens we'll figure it out (laughs) as trey i hope you've enjoyed your game tonight and if you have any questions please feel free to put them on the screen thank you me and marisha met-- a mutual friend of ours was putting together a sketch-writing group-- this was years ago those never pan out not in la but we met there we harbored secret crushes for about a year and then when we reconnected a little over a year later i was out of a relationship and she was just getting out of one and we both started talking again and then eventually we were like hey this is cool we should do this yeah it was for damnation the cg movie yeah i do it doesn't happen often at all but that's okay i'll have the opportunity (laughs) do you guys have backup characters rolled for when you get tpk'd that's really cute that would be interesting yeah we're going to have some fun people jumping in for a few weeks here and there because you're doing it right i love vin diesel we're working on hardwick a lot of the people you guys have mentioned we're actually talking to i'm going to talk to nathan i'm going to talk to chris-- we don't know if they're available dame judy dench yeah yeah i think he still doesn't to know what to make of it really because my first conversation with him about it was very brief and very much like cool i was like okay probably yeah we'll drag him in it sometime danny sexbang yeah yeah you stopped the fight it was amazing (laughs) there are artifacts that can do similar effects yes like soul transfers and stuff like that probably try that guy in something oh this is a good question what if a party member dies do we have to scratch out the name on the shirt you're welcome to it's a possibility there are magics that can through challenge reverse death but death is definitely a possibility and permanent death is definitely a possibility it's probably going to happen what's what you don't know that you have no clue what their alignments are nearly ashley almost died permanently yeah yeah yuri's probably going to come in at some point soon yeah he guested once before the show as ghost fist the dwarven monk you guys have seen them but they're very rare in this setting at least in this part of the world tieflings are super rare you haven't encountered them much yet yet if you're brand new to the game fighter's pretty easy i personally would say paladin or ranger are fun because you can taste a little bit of magic but you're also combat-based it's a nice introduction to how all things work and the magic is a slow build you don't get it immediately so at level one you're just a melee guy-- or combat guy-- and eventually you start getting abilities i think the hybrid classes are good for that someone else asked before how often do players interact with their personal stories occasionally there hasn't been much room for that since everyone's been underground for this entire run but there are personal stories happening in the world and i'm sure they will come up as things progress as well they have in the past and they're going to again they're incredible that was a great photoshop i think kit's artwork we're using as the basis of the official art but you're welcome to create whatever you want going forward yeah do you write a synopsis for previous ventures actually the synopsis for each episode is on the geek & sundry website underneath the episodes so it'll tell you what happens in that episode underneath just go to geekandsundrycom he writes them all yeah so simple his birthday aw no best and worst d&d memories yeah there's no pre-planning someone asked why do i treat ones as regular failures instead of flops because i run my campaigns pretty hard and i think if 1s were critical fails the classic way we would have tpk'd by now because in some rule sets when you roll a one it's a serious-- i like treating it as no matter what you're doing you fail regardless no matter what your bonus is you fail i think that's enough in old campaigns i used to run if you rolled a one attacking somebody your weapon would go flying across the room and you'd fall on the ground or if you were trying to lift a boulder the boulder would fall and crush you and you're dead which can be fun for certain games but for this-- for this there's enough challenge where i think we don't need any more reasons if it's funny and it makes sense-- if it's a difficult challenge and you roll a one there might be some drawbacks to a failure in that case but i don't think it's a consistent thing i need to do yeah so the dread emperor had maybe three or four hit points left people were hurt on the ground it was this epic confrontation yeah he's never killed anything he pulls out his blade and just goes for an attack and we're all like yes go and he rolls a one and it's him charging towards him blade in the air you son of a bitch running dread emperor just side-steps scanlan goes flying-- loses his balance crashes through a three-story-high stained-glass window in the back end of this library out into a bramble bush with all the glass tumbling onto him and is like ow on the ground it was pretty great no holds bard i like that someone asked do i fudge my rolls no because at that point it becomes too weird if you don't stick to at least what roll is there then you lose the essence of fate and i think that's what makes it fun for me it makes it scary because then i don't know what's going to happen (laughs) it's going to be fun the very first game we played you all had come together as individual mercenaries in the city of stillben which is a swamp town on the far eastern side of this continent you all for your own reasons had come there because you needed money you were trying to establish some way of making your skills useful and there was a job board and all of you came together in a tavern saw there was a posting and you decided to combine forces and try it out that's how that started and then they met percy along the way in a prison in the umbra hills yeah scanlan i'll try to make it quick in what was the final boss battle for the first arc they were going towards the center of the city because a glabrezu a treachery demon had infiltrated the sovereign uriel the king of the area and his family filled their bodies with shades as opposed to their souls they managed to recover the family but they got into a conflict with the glabrezu and as the fight was ensuing pike got too close the glabrezu took a swipe at her and rolled a critical hit and did enough damage to bring her to death instantly so mid-fight went down the whole party froze your constitution score it was awful it wasn't just like she fell and died the glabrezu has giant pincers grabbed her by the torso lifted her up and then snapped her in half essentially and they had to recover both halves of her that was over a year ago no it wasn't a year almost a year i definitely have ideas to keep the campaign going past level 20 and to epic or mythic stages i would like to if it goes that long we shall see i'm not a character well that's cheating that's one of my favorite deterrents you avoided essentially what would have been a throwdown with the entire thieves' guild of emon by bluffing your way-- by pulling out a silver star-- and convincing them that you were part of the customs department gilmore you guys haven't met gilmore yet they haven't seen emon yet that's a good question which laura should answer what kind of dice do you all use and what do you do with bad dice (crack up) the dice god i did see a question someone asked who has the most magical items tiberius tiberius is a hoarder someone asked who has the most magical items i like that the name of the one true dice god is rngesus for random number generator that's great hufflepuff you're a slytherin hufflepuff love this guy here look at all the hearts has pike tried healing (laughs) she heals quite a bit it's been awesome i've seen this a bit advice for first-time dms i'll give a bunch of that if we end up doing the week off but quickly i would say improvisational classes help tremendously but being able to think on your feet be open to players being creative don't always shut people down it's not you against them it can be but i like to think of it more open you can let them try whatever they come up with but depending on how elaborate or how ridiculous it is it might be really hard to happen and let them fail spectacularly because it makes a great story build out a sheet of a bunch of fantasy names in case they go to a place or meet an npc you weren't expecting then you can just pick a name and make something up on the spot about it and take notes afterward it's how i used to do it i wouldn't know where people would go and i'd have a whole list of names and i'd be like-- kind of but i still have to pick out of random places sometimes depending on what you guys do most of it does i write a lot of it up but there are moments where you have to pull out of the ether because players go this way and you're like uh all right let's see where this goes but have fun learn the rules well because everyone's going to look to you for rules have fun let players play let them be creative and let them succeed or fail spectacularly a few times i tend to prepare pretty openly and loosely so i can have some realm of understanding where you guys are going yeah that was-- yeah yep a lot of that was pulled out of my ass yeah same time intrigue let a girl keep her secrets i did not start with newgrounds voices but i have been watching newgrounds since late 90s oh the chick tracts enjoy your boxes buddy it was better for a group this size i think pathfinder with eight players becomes too weighed-down with floating modifiers and it becomes very difficult to keep fluid it's fine if you're a bunch of friends at home playing for eight hours but when you're playing in front of an audience of thousands on the internet every week we have to use a system that makes combat go a lot quicker so 5th edition was the way to go there's your emote laura yeah you guys rolled really well taking out the abyssal abomination yeah i forgot about that no you guys would start a level behind the rest of the group the detriment to it is you would be a level lower that is the drawback of dying or losing a character is you would be a level or a half-level behind the rest of the party it's possible you guys all know it we all knew it going in i'm not going to hold that back i'm not going to be marvel in this bitch okay i'm not going to be like oh death i can take it back any time and it doesn't matter anymore no there are it's harder to do in the underdark there aren't so many traps or timed circumstances i like the hourglass for certain circumstances that have a very definite time limit and i do think up what the challenge is what type of skills would work or let the players come up with creative ways that they can apply their skills to a situation to succeed and i figure out loosely off the 4th edition rules where i have number of successes vs number of failures in that period of time and if they don't manage to do it in that time period it's a failure i think it's fun it builds the tension and the party goes oh shit we've got to do this now i love it hourglass is awesome mansions of madness yeah which is awesome how do i handle experience leveling in this game at certain milestones when characters have a chance to rest-- have a breather or sleep for the evening-- then that's when experience is divvied out for the next session characters don't level in the middle of a battle or anything but i keep track of it usually on a session by session basis and if there's a moment of rest then people can level up i also saw a question when did percy build the bad news and how long did it take four or five months in-game yeah how is critical role going compared to how you envisioned it one of our biggest fears when this thing came to our attention when geek & sundry contacted us was we didn't want it to change the game for us we did this together for fun we enjoyed it and it was just a wonderful thing for us for two years and so our biggest fear was it changing that dynamic and so we tried to be very careful that we didn't alter how we played and didn't change the format really other than having cameras just a little more distance there's been very little change except we have other people now that we don't have to spend hours telling them oh what we do is we play this and this is what happened you guys already know because you watched it and it's awesome yeah he's proficient with a tinkering kit essentially so it's a proficiency bonus on top of that and what it will be is he'll tell me or describe to me the schematics of what he's trying to build and what materials he has at his disposal or ask me what he needs for it-- so if he has the materials i'll tell him how expensive it is or how to get the materials and he attempts the roll if he fails wastes all the materials it's a complete waste if he rolls decent it's functional for the most part but the thing with tinkering is it doesn't always quite work how you want if he rolls really well then it's pretty damn good at the workshop the keep has a workshop for him yep congratulations buddy totally it's not overwhelming it's really cool it's good to know there's people out there that have any interest in dungeons & dragons i grew up an indoor kid i was not quite sure if i could tell people i play this game and now people are much more open to the idea like oh dungeons & dragons it used to be like you play d&d what the shit now it's you play d&d what's it like it's much more open it's great thanks for coming yeah thanks for staying sam sam's got to run back to his family all right so we'll get a few more questions here and then we'll go ahead and close it on this guys no i feel the same way oh look at all the ashley hearts someone asked about the pewdiepie thing what it was like dming for him and ken it was fun they were great they were a lot of fun we only had half an hour to play both for me to teach them and to play through a session so it was a very new challenge of all right let's do this dungeons & dragons but it worked out pretty well we had a good time and left on a cliffhanger and as long as they want to keep bringing me back to do it occasionally i'm happy to so let them know that you enjoyed it and they should have me back because it was a good time just keeping the balance that's going to be great two quick questions i want to answer real fast when you're done one how did i get into dungeon mastering by having a really terrible dungeon master yeah really nice guy in high school my first couple of games i ever played and he was just terrible and he had a player character in the group that was a paladin but also a samurai and he gave him all the best magical equipment and would fight party members it was awful i got frustrated so i bought the books myself and learned to do it on my own i've been doing it ever since what was that i forgot what the other one was humans are pretty awesome (laughs) forever okay if i could play a character it would be a dwarf probably a dwarf bard i love dwarves so much marisha want to give us an example (crack up) oh that's awesome thank you liam thank you chat or be one that's not true it's communal storytelling you forge memories with friends it's a really cool improvised story that you all create together (laughs) laura and you guys were amazing thank you so much there you go guys thank you all so much sincerely for watching for being amazing and for tuning in to enjoy our silliness
