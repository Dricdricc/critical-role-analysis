question all righty so let's go ahead and jump into this wondrous-- so to get you guys a little bit up to speed with some of the fun that's happened previously on critical role our band of intrepid adventurers vox machina after having a horrible encounter with the chroma conclave a gathering of chromatic evil dragons that has just torn through the tal'dorei countryside destroying cityscape after cityscape the party has fled and has been seeking information on how to possibly eventually topple these creatures and restore order to the land of tal'dorei they began seeking these artifacts known as the vestiges of divergence that promise ancient power from wars long past that could aid them in this journey after acquiring one with a near-death experience by vex'ahlia over there they began their next step in the journey however as part of a recent scrying spell by keyleth the druid they discovered that the pyrah tribe of her druidic heritage the ashari were decimated as their home of pyrah was the portal to the fire elemental plane that they normally guard was where thordak the cinder king the great red dragon tore through into this prime realm and managed to seemingly wipe out most if not all of the tribe vox machina made the relatively grim journey back to the mountainside finding it now brimming with volcanic rock and volcanic activity that previously lay dormant upon climbing the side of the mountain you found remnants of the pyrah tribe still alive and making their way up the mountain as damaged as they are in hopes of sealing this now progressively swelling tear between the prime material plane and the elemental plane of fire not just that there was aid that came to the pyrah tribe and it involved a number of air ashari one of which was korren keyleth's father there was a brief tearful exchange and reunion before the rest of you steeling yourselves began to walk in towards the center of the mountain's caldera towards the remnants of the cindergrove the now-destroyed and sundered petrified forest in hopes of closing this rippling tear to the elemental plane once and for all and this is where we begin so the group of the six of you gathering alongside the dozen or so pyrah members with various burns cerkonos who is the leader of the tribe now missing his arm cauterized at the shoulder all advancing forward quietly in this tense push of necessity you can see in the distance swirling between the trees clusters of glowing elemental entities that are either spilling forth from this recently and have taken this landscape as their own or are just enjoying in their-- elementals like to burn shit and so you're seeing fire elementals wandering about just tearing through what remains of this countryside and let's see you actually vex'ahlia-- as you guys are stepping forward keeping an eye on these glowing distant entities these creatures you catch out of the corner of your eye what appears to be a number of other humanoids a small cluster of shadowed individuals far off to the left tucked around the bottom of a tree make a perception check 23 glancing over in that direction you see towards one of the larger broken petrified trees right on the outskirts of the cindergrove forest you see what appear to be a cluster of humanoids two of them have flesh the other two do not these skeletal creatures shuffle in place clutching a blade to one side while the other two appear to be in partially rotted states they're mostly disinterested in their surroundings and stand there head to the side aimless-- from what you can tell one of them does appear to have ashari wardrobe the other one does not at this point korren keyleth's father and the head of the air ashari in your absence puts his hand forth and goes i'm sorry you're saying that you see along the way undead creatures all right given the nature of the elemental presence here we're going to have to probably divide and attack the central place from multiple positions otherwise they're going to have too strong of a fire-front at the edges of this border do you feel confident enough to handle your own sliver of this assault that's all right-- well we'll keep an eye out we'll have two of our druids overhead keeping eyesight if anything goes wrong signal up there you know how keyleth and we'll send them down to aid you all right the air ashari will come from the northeast cerkonos take the rest of your tribe head from the west you continue on forward if this troupe you've found of seemingly lifeless entities looks even remotely dangerous do not engage they are not our target but if this is a scourge that has spread into the cindergrove i fear we may be in worse shape than i had originally envisioned regardless stay silent stay swift he looks back to the rest of the air ashari and all of them their outer form shimmers as the wind begins to collect around their feet ever so quietly and they all with an intense speed begin to trek at an incredible pace seemingly blending in with the rock surroundings as they go disappearing around one side of the cindergrove forest cerkonos and the others nod cerkonos looks to the rest of you brings up his one hand and gives a touch to the top of his chest and sternum and bows his head and goes i wish you all great luck see you on the inside and the rest of the fire ashari turn into burning fire elemental forms and begin to streak through the various broken rocks and pieces of glass-shattered obsidian that peppered this landscape in the caldera leaving the six of you ready to trek forward yourself they look like wherever you're traveling-- because there's an open expanse of about 80 or so feet before you actually reach the edge of the cindergrove and they're right on the outskirts of the cindergrove forest so lest you're very careful they would technically see you if they're paying attention there's four of them as long as you're maintaining your concentration how long does it last for concentration i believe it-- an hour yeah so you can still be under that effect so i would like all six of you to roll stealth checks for me if you could no just the plus ten which is better than advantage 38-- with plus ten all right so as the entire group bends down into a ninja-like stance just darting across as fast as they can keeping low to the ground and using much of the shadow of the overhead clouds and smoke that has completely engulfed the above skyscape behind you bounding very loudly is a gentle gnome swishing brown hair-- right it's not working and as you're darting across you're jumping over little open globules of molten lava that is starting to pour out from various crevices in the stone floor you try to hop around to avoid that and in doing so your foot catches the edge of a piece of stone and you begin to go into a tumble make an acrobatics check you are (laughs) you do manage to catch yourself with a slight tumble skid a bit on your ass and land on your feet it would've been a cool three-point landing if anyone else had attempted it but you just barely catch yourself look back at the group with a sheepish grin and out of the corner of your eye you see one of the undead entities turn its head and look right in your direction it starts wandering in your direction all right roll for an attack 18 that hits go ahead and roll damage at this distance it'll take a little bit to rush up if you want to-- i'll say at this point they're roughly 60 feet from you so if you wanted to-- oh if you go full speed you can oh throwing it 15 damage on which one the skeleton or-- it would be from you yes the-- what extra two okay is this against one of the zombies or one of the skeletons all right then that would be one of the zombies all right the arrow streaks through the air slamming into the chest and it embeds itself causing a piece of tendon to snap and curl back inside the torso its arm falls a little more limp than it was previously and it just keeps walking forward all right go ahead and roll a stealth check you-- three of them are grouped together by the tree the one that noticed is slowly wandering toward you okay all right correct mm-hm 25 with that as this zombie entity is hobbling forward the dagger strikes it right in the center of the skull right where its mouth and jaw hinge hit severs the base of the skull to the spine and the head just rolls off onto the ground underneath the body takes two more steps before falling forward all the other undead creatures all of a sudden turn into the forest as opposed to towards where the death happened-- and you see running out from the forest towards you a blue-skinned humanoid rushing out arms in the air you see agreeing before you a blue-scaled dragonborn if you would like to describe yourself for the party go for it 17 he's telling the truth she eyes you up and down trying to get a feel for whether or not you're who you say you are go ahead and make a stealth check if you don't mind gern nope he wasn't there when you cast it 11 no and then-- no as you guys begin stealthily there is a couple of (footfalls) heavy footfalls of the lumbering dragonborn no tail on this one the only other dragonborn you've seen without a tail was the paladin that worked in the council tofor brotorus so that does catch your attention a little bit not just the dragonborn lumbering but now the three undead that are (groaning) stepping behind and it's at that point you hear the cracking of what sounds like heavy timber no more than 30 feet away from you you all stop in place suddenly and you glance over and you can see the flickering of light of what appears to be a flame-based elemental energy that's tearing over the side of a newly fallen petrifoid-- petrifoid-- (mocking chris' accent) petrifoid tree look what you've done to me this is your fault very very lucky charms so yeah how about that so as the flame begins to trickle and burn over the edge you can see there is an intelligence to it there are a couple of arms that writhe over the side and the head pops over and glances and stops in place frozen staring over in the direction of the bounding dragonborn it's smaller than what you're used to seeing but it is indeed a creature made of elemental flame it would be considered an elemental okay so you're using your transform-- i think it's the first time you've been fire elemental yeah so you guys watch as keyleth's form suddenly erupts into flame which freaks you out for a second as you're uncertain as to whether or not she did that it has for a moment an essence of keyleth's more lithe form that most elementals would but still these long curling flame like-arms these eyes that glow a bright white fire in the center of the face other than that relatively formless other than what looks like where her hair would be these wisps of flame curl up behind her so as you approach the elemental form-- the creature behind the form you can see is drifting away from the trunk of the tree it's turned away and is moving away from you yeah no no you're just-- you're in the caldera to-- yeah you haven't traversed the plane you're making your way into the remnants of the cindergrove you guys hear in the distance this echo of this weird sucking-crackling sound that goes-- it halts for a second looks over its shoulder and then goes into double speed disappearing into the trees away from you okay as you follow it past the initial treeline it's where a bunch of trees have fallen over and formed a small blockade in this portion of the forest you glance over as you're shouting that and you can see what appear to be another of the same small elemental that this one has gone to to have a brief conversation beyond that you see a larger one roughly your size that has just turned around and noticed your presence and all of them look over at what appears to be another humanoid creature but instead of a lower torso of legs it's an elongated snake-like body its black and red scales across its entire form two human arms and a humanoid face but these webbed red spines down its entire back at this point in time keyleth as you're standing there looking over this edge they all turn and the creature the weird-- i'll say it-- a salamander-like creature begins shouting out phrases in ignan which you understand it says go he's not here yet alleviate this uncontrolled one at which point they all begin to swarm towards you as you guys are watching this from a distance all you hear is (guttural noises) it's really confusing and a little hilarious to be honest i need you to make an intimidation check what you got keyleth all right as this happens the two smaller elementals shrink down and glance over at the larger one the larger one looks about and shouts back at you in ignan once again do you serve him he looks back at the long snake-like humanoid who's standing there who glances at the other one and goes she wants us back very well and they all turn around and begin to slowly drift back towards the center of the cindergrove where the flickering light was (flickering flames) so the fire elemental is just like (calm whoosh) and it's more of a smoldering sad elemental at the moment there you go strong sad elemental all right go ahead and make a sleight of hand check okay vex make a perception check 28 yeah you are skill check roll again so it's the earlier one yeah okay you just see as you're all just walking along your new blue dragonborn friend just reaches down and snatches something from the dirt pockets it and keeps walking you have no idea you just see a little cluster of ash and dust on the ground that's been partially disturbed all right as you continue to press forward you hear in the distance a loud cracking sound echoing and you can see what appear to be a number of trees in the far-off side to the northeastern side of the forest as a brief whirlwind flickers up you assume this is probably from the fire ashari who've taken that side of the entranceway and you can see two flickering lights drift up in the air before sparking out in the distance i mean you can make some localized fire happen not in the way you would want to you'd have to drop form for that and cast a spell okay as you go ahead and take the arrow-- what do you have around the edge that are going to-- are you just going to light the shaft on fire there you go the arrow arcs off vanishes across the little bit of the remaining treeline all right do you guys continue to press forward okay you begin to push further forward towards the center of the cindergrove as you're noticing more and more of these trees are pushed flat it's almost like that russian forest the meteor had landed in and exploded all the trees are flattened-- think tunguska thank you where you begin to climb over a number of these flattened portions of the forest and in the center you can see that one river of molten rock that had been trickling down the front of the mountain is sourced here in the center where once previously you guys had performed a ritual to pass into the elemental plane has now torn into this extremely bright rift that flickers it's like looking into the sun you have to avert your gaze you cannot look directly at it without actually hurting your eyesight and you can see there are multiple paths of this molten lava pouring out from this new volcanic activity you can see it burbling up and bubbling underneath like the very presence of this tear itself is causing the activity to just raise and grow more fervent at the base of the rift you can see a number of other elemental creatures that are in the process of surrounding this opening-- (door creak) you're not here okay i don't know perfect as you can see all these elemental entities are swirling around there are two more of these strange snake-like humans these salamander-like creatures that are discussing and one really large one that stands there holding this strange trident-like structure and it's shouting out commands left and right and you can see these salamander entities and a number of these elementals are all gathered around the portal and they're all just focusing this slow steady beam towards it and as you can see it tearing flickering and slowly expanding with each popping expansion of this doorway the ground itself shifts and rumbles all right if you'd like to yeah there's a lot of fire most of these entities are either fire essence or just made out of straight flame all right fatty arbuckle skeletal claws clasped around the side of this marbled-looking bluish-white candle and clutches it and just goes (snarl) as it shuffles forward down this ashen pit towards the dome where the lava itself is beginning to pour forth and the doorway is you can see the shadow of its form as the light passes it looks like the cover of the thing how it's just bright light coursing past this dark image of the skeleton walking away from you it's walked quite a distance thankfully at this point it's probably a good 40 or 50 feet before it reaches the first salamander and you see as it begins to step forward they all turn and look and one of them shouts over (snarling) one of them glances over reaches out and pulls out a long brass-colored longbow and begins to notch an arrow carefully as it hobbles forward they look at each other one of them shouts out in ignan which you understand keyleth shouting you who walks here just keeps walking forward like a little wind-up toy made of bone until eventually the one with the bow gives a nudge with its head and the other salamander entity draws a heavy-bladed object and begins to step forward towards it ready to go ahead and cleave it as the skeleton steps forward it gets right at the corner of its range do you want to command it at which point the skeleton just as the blade sweeps past and crashes into its torso shattering the rib cage the arms go (crack) the wax bends and cracks in the center and there's a brief pause where nothing seems to happen and a swirl of sudden localized storming blizzard just encases a ten-foot radius hitting both of those salamander creatures what does it say on the candle specifically that's a fail and a save and it's half damage on success great okay so one of them failed and one of them saved so go ahead and roll 4d6 damage nine okay nine and five cold damage to each so (bang) it blasts open oh and a dexterity check for your buddy who makes it so fatty arbuckle actually walks out of there with a mere five points of cold damage out of ice and frost his busted-open rib cage though he did suffer did suffer seven damage from the impact of this weapon so fatty arbuckle pretty damaged but still standing there just going (snarling) is everyone just going to sit back at this or-- it's up to you or you can watch this horrible bludgeoning of this skeleton in the teeth of death all right travis i assume you're going to be rushing in there then anyone who wishes to immediately go into battle now let's roll initiative all right let me go ahead and-- all right so this is quite a ways away from the portal itself lava flow traveling around that side all right and we have keyleth over here as the fire elemental the big one that you haven't seen yet oh sorry that's gern right there we have fatty arbuckle and chilling over here we have coral and stimpy they seem to be fire-based creatures yes yes it's back it's this far back yeah there is a pool of magma that goes this way you guys are on one side of it and pushing this way further the rest of the actual portal's back this far all right so initiative order we have 25 to 20 anyone okay 20 to 15 all right 13 keyleth all right great so top of the round percy you're up first all righty 25 hits strength saving throw that is going to be a 20 aw the blast of your impact (bang) hits the arm he manages to hold onto his trident-like weapon all righty so go ahead and roll damage on that 13 points of damage all righty go for it scanlan you're up on deck by the way so be ready 20 hits that's a nine failure (gunshot) you see his fingers are pried off as one of his pinky fingers is actually blown off from the impact shooting dark deep crimson blood that seems to burn the landscape around as it drips the trident tumbling to the ground and getting lodged in a piece of rock almost ready to spill into part of the lava seven points of damage all righty all righty so minus five to the attack 14 unfortunately misses there okay got it scanlan you're up this big thing here yeah the fire elemental you see that these things are all baddies here all righty so and you watch out of the corner as well gern you see this tiny little gnome step to the side conjure some arcane purplish-blue energy and then thrust his pelvis forward as a bolt of lightning energy just rockets forth tearing-- slamming both into the larger salamander creature and the elemental behind it go ahead and roll 8d6 damage what's the dc on this yes yeah ooh that is a failure and a failure all right so full damage against both oof all righty as the bolt of lightning energy tears through both of them eventually absorbed into the stone behind them the elemental flame form flickers and falls to the ground for a second trying to reform itself while the salamander looks down at this blackened burned char mark in the center of its torso from where the bolt entered and exited out of its back to strike its compadre not too happy and confused how such a large damaging thing came from such a small little creature if you'd like to roll a d20 for musical taste four it catches you by the ear with delight your general frustration with modern music is completely bisected by the more oldies classical sound of his tune so you get a d10 inspiration dice so just keep that on the side if ever you make an attack roll or a saving throw that isn't as high as you want it to be you can then roll that and add the d10 to that roll so you just have that in the wings as you feel inspired all right that brings it to the elementals' turn now this flame elemental is going to streak over (whoosh) to blern who's-- or no sorry this is to fatty arbuckle there's too many weird names tonight and this larger fire elemental here is going to-- he's not doing anything he used his whole round to get there but now as the larger elemental burns into the center of scanlan percy you can feel just his presence itself is extremely dangerously hot the air around you is blistering you can feel your hair curl back in its presence the small elemental is going to go ahead and make two attacks against fatty arbuckle that's going to be a nine to hit i think his ac's 13 so i don't think it's going to hit yeah second one rolls a one and with that grog it's your turn so you go into your rage at the top of your turn and then what would you like to do what's your speed again five ten 15 20 25 30 35 40 you can get right there between scanlan and this creature if you want to i'd say that's your movement you can move ten more feet if you want to this way oh you mean like this way instead that's about as far as you can get right there if you do not attack anything you would lose your rage you can throw your weapon if you want to go for it so you watch as this muscle-bound goliath comes leaping around the corner as it affixes a chain to the edge of its weapon flinging a two-handed sword like a giant boomerang and-- 14 against the larger one unfortunately it makes an impact but it just ricochets off of its plated body armor and then tumbles to the ground you can go ahead and make your-- okay no problem you pull it back with the chain and catch it mid-air ending your turn there indeed vax you're up yep that hits hits hits oof his form flickers briefly for a moment from the sheer impact of the dagger hit nine all righty the two other daggers impact partially passing through its form not quite as impactful as the first that first one did seemingly cause the creature to have a hard time coalescing its fire-wreathed physicality that ends your turn vax gern you're up so you're right there 30 feet is how far you can run and that's about six squares you could you could very much so all right so you want to move around here yeah there's probably a good chance this is not going to be-- after everything else fatty's survived his own master deals him the possible finishing blow everything under that area gets affected so yeah you could do that what's your spell dc it should be at the top of your spell page 16 all right and it is a constitution save let's see if they make it that is a failure a failure and a failure oh i'll roll for fatty fatty does not succeed nope nope all right go ahead and roll 8d8 points of cold damage by the way guys if we hit 16k before the end of tonight's show we're going to go ahead and have a sloth come into the studio 44 all as he's shouting out at you releasing this amazing condensed blast of pure winter hell in front of him it comes scattering across this way freezing the corner of this turning partially some of the lava here to stone just by proximity blasts past these entities and as the arcane snow comes to rest you can see the fire elemental here itself is having a hard time keeping itself together its flame is (whoosh) sputtering and flickering barely keeping itself together however by its side you see three very still frozen-solid statuettes of the remnants of the two salamanders and fatty arbuckle taken by the cold of winter we'll say for the purposes of remembering that too put a couple of frozen frozen and frozen all right i believe that ends your turn gern all right it would be the salamanders' turn but they're frozen damn they got pummeled vex you're up you don't know you believe so all right right behind it all right go ahead and make an acrobatics check without issue you land-- not even no two-point landing on your feet knee down still clutching your ready-to-go bow unscathed by the boiling cauldron of molten rock okay right there go for it two attacks you're on deck keyleth 21 hits both hit all right nice both arrows burn to ash when they impact but the sheer blow and the magical energy behind it from the bow that you threw it from hit it and you can see it begin to shake its form even more itself did you do the hunter's mark damage as well okay good cool that end your turn vex keyleth you're up okay all right whatcha got whatcha got i'll say given the use of lava control in this they are still elementals go ahead and make a persuasion check no intimidate this would be intimidate 15 you can see the smaller elemental here that just watched its friends get frozen solid as well as whatever that skeleton was turns towards you and (snarls) and begins to make its way this direction yeah the large one doesn't seem prominently fazed by your display i would say that whole thing of bringing up the molten rock and the shout and everything would be your action there you go all right ends your turn keyleth brings us to percy yeah it's right up in your space all right go for it that hits you take nine points of fire damage as just striking it the flames burst back and burn towards your face and torso from the impact okay that would be four four damage all right and roll damage for your strike hmm all right do you want to make a second attack you said or are you just going to keep going back and forth what's your plan whatcha doing whatcha doing percy okay as you roll away it's going to take an attack of opportunity at you that is an 18 to hit okay so you use your shield brooch okay as it strikes out towards you streaking its elemental claws outward you back away instilling the power of the brooch and you see an arcane shield temporarily ricochets pushing its claw away from you you run away unharmed to the other side of the rock go for it 15 hits elementals aren't very hard to hit all right and you reload all right that ends percy's turn scanlan you're up over there that's your call okay he's 15 feet from you yeah is that a 15-foot radius cube so you can just make the cube here and it'll hit none of them all right level two thunderwave coming on up oh it's a self a 15-foot cube originating from you so yeah so you can hit that guy all right cool so level three that's 3d8 let's see if it makes its constitution saving throw it does not not with a natural seven so go ahead and roll your damage 3d8 thunder damage 20 how do you want to do this (cheering) you even missed your own thunderwave spell you were so distracted with your frustration you look back you cracked your knuckles and it's gone but you didn't see it happen and it's a little disappointing overall all right you guys look over as this elemental runs off towards the glowing doorway you see further down this passage it's not that far away from you but you do see the flickering doorway that's like (sputtering) you can see other entities beginning to step out of it and you can see one larger form it looks fiery humanoid just (crackling) comes out lower body made of ash and cinders make a perception check you can go find out yes 26 currently from where you stand-- 24 from where you stand you can look off in the distance you can see parts of the treeline across down the cindergrove shifting and moving and you hear the distant sounds of combat but you do not have a visual perspective it looks like the other teams have not quite made their way to the center you're actually the first team to get here and you made your way around a possible encounter and in doing so arrived before the other teams did however it looks like a secondary line of defense is now pouring out of this doorway there's three statues actually including fatty arbuckle yeah as you shove-- and it's a pretty heavy form especially with the ice that's you know formed around the body-- --but not too hard for you grog because you're grog you give a little shove and as it topples over it just shatters into 100 pieces yeah this time you give this one a full push this one actually gets about ten feet in the air before scattering across the ground pieces of it actually spilling into the molten lava and there stands frozen in place fatty arbuckle chest destroyed arm limp to the side just-- you see the half-giant goliath handing you the frozen body of your skeletal friend we'll get to that as soon as we come back from this break we're going to take a quick bathroom break and we'll see you guys back here in about ten minutes or so to continue this next step in the adventure [break] no not i don't think tonight there will be a sloth apparently that will come here for 16k and a sloth and if you want to watch laura freak out-- also we have a giveaway winner for the evening toastkingjr is the winner of tonight's critical role giveaway congratulations well done you we'll be sending you a lot of fun goodies your way very shortly so-- oh yes well you've made him proud make sure to let him know we'll give him a little a little pipe or something inside too it'll be good all right so you guys gather yourselves stepping through the battlefield you had just encountered the shattered and slowly melting pieces of ice that once were some of these fire elemental denizens scattered around your feet you step forward as you see the somewhat human somewhat flame-based entity come pouring out of the void surrounded by other elementals and one of the other standing salamander general-type individuals you can see-- yes coming out of the rift this is the actual doorway right there yes this is all molten-- well this is actual lava from the inside of the mountain that has been called forth and cracked through the surface because of the presence of the tear no you did not i'd like you all to make a stealth check by the way as this is transpiring and these entities are now making-- no you cast hunter's mark so the concentration on that ended unfortunately sorry as you guys are all having this conversation hushed behind this barricade of broken tree elements you can see this salamander general turn and hiss in that direction look over and point his trident in the direction of where you all are you can see the larger fire elementals all of a sudden turn their attention in the direction of the party as the humanoid floating about five feet off the ground his lower form just this swirl of cinders and black ash chuckles with his arms crossed points forward and the elementals begin moving forward well this would be the initiative order now so everyone roll initiative all right folks this brings us to 25 to 20 20 to 15 16 for gern 15 to ten 13 for percy ten to five eight for grog scanlan what's your-- so that would be just below you percy all righty i believe that's all on that end there and that brings us to-- oh seven thought i got you there we go so right before grog is keyleth great all right top of the combat round all right tell me who wants to roll an arcana check as you see this entity rising up-- for people who are proficient with it yes you do (laughs) and as you say that you recognize this entity and blurt out its name just instinctually as you get a proper view of it one of the many denizens of the fire elemental plane this is an efreeti it is a fire genie efreeti yes the species is efreeti but an ee-frit ee-freet however you want to pronounce it a flame genie generally hailing from the city of brass and/or spaces around and in the fire elemental plane floats above all of you arms still crossed opens its arms and as it chuckles both hands just are engulfed in flames that congeal into these large fiery balls as it flings them both down in the direction of the party this is going to be at scanlan and vex to scanlan that is 13 vex that is 15 both just (fireball impacts) cracking into the ground to the sides of where you're standing barely missing them it keeps glaring down at the rest of you with a smile ending that it brings us to vax you're up as far as you know depending on the individual you don't know who saw you and who didn't right from where you are all right okay the first one was what the first and the third hit if you are hidden though which you would technically be hidden from this individual you do have advantage on those attacks so you can reroll the-- no no it's a sneak attack if you're hidden a surprise round is if they have no idea that you're there not bad flinging both daggers one strikes it square in the sternum and the blade cracks and pops as it hits the center of the chest it (gurgle) you know it can't make any sound as it disappears from the wound returning to your belt the second dagger manages to come towards it tries to parry out of the air but in doing so just gets it embedded in its forearm and it shrieks out in pain as that too vanishes and appears once again in your belt are you going to move or stay where you are go get 'em tiger right there all righty vex you're up i mean you could get behind them if you want to they're maybe about that wide practically as far as the cindergrove's concerned they're pretty sad-looking a lot of them have been destroyed and torn and pushed down around this way here all righty mark the efreeti go for it that does not hit nope that does hit streaking past and the third one hits as he's holding the flame balls in his hands seeing the small impact he just glares at you though the impact 17 points of damage and you are hiding behind the tree that's the end of vex's turn it is now the elementals' turns this is going to move in and actually consumes the space of gern and his followers so as you're sitting there you just see this fire elemental just streak around real fast and all of a sudden step into the space where you and your two undead followers are flames whirling around you all of you immediately take five points of fire damage you and your two allies stimpy and coral poor guys with that it's going to make two strikes towards you gern the fire elemental rushes in and just (slithering fire noises) that is going to be a 13 to hit what's your armor class just hits you and that's a natural 20 (sighs and groans) 19 points of fire damage from the second strike and you are currently engulfed in flame you caught fire from the impact with the fire elemental certain ones do not blue ones that ends that elemental's turn this one is going to step into the space where both percy and scanlan are both of you guys immediately suffer seven points of fire damage correct so you'd take three points and it's going to make a strike on each of you that's going to be a 14 versus you scanlan and then versus percy same roll 14 misses you both with a series of terrible attacks that ends their turn gern you're up at the start of your turn-- yep at the top of your turn because you're now on fire you take six points of fire damage you're just wreathed in fire all around it's a bad bad sunday for gern this direction you mean so you can move around to this side of the elemental pushing past your allies whip around you get a little bit of a view through the fire and flames swirling around you you concentrate and release a burst of cold energy it might not be close enough it'll be enough to get those two there it's better than nothing all right so constitution saves on the elemental what's your dc 16 it fails on the salamander that's another big fail with a 13 so go ahead and roll 8d8 damage nice 35 points of cold damage to both the salamander and the elemental in front of you great so you see as a blast of winter arcane energy just skirts forward casting most of the dark area here in snow and ice and sleet you can see the front of this lava pond is cooled for the moment and actually can be walked across probably for one or two more rounds yes you are also still on fire someone has to take an action to try and douse the flames on him whether it be himself or possibly your allies you can still give actions to your two undead buddies both actually the scales are starting to crisp okay i'll allow this you're intentionally going prone so you start your next combat round on the ground which means you'll have half your movement as stimpy hobbles over (zombie groan) there is behind the elemental yes the zombie can take one action unfortunately it's not a super intelligent creature one or the other you guys glance over out of the corner of your eye and you see is the dragonborn all of a sudden jumps to the ground sprawled out snow angel style as this undead begins flailing about on top of his body you're starting to get elements of decaying goo and-- but the flames do eventually go out over the next five to six seconds or so what would you like stimpy to do you would yes sure he picks up some of the frost on the ground with his skeletal hands flings it funnily enough it hits because it's right there we'll say for that particular instance it takes-- three points of cold damage (cheers) percy you're up no it's constitution yes at the top of your turn by the way you take nine points of fire damage down to four because you are also engulfed in flame as is scanlan for having passed over the space there this way here running past the fire elemental it does get an attack of opportunity on you swinging out with its flaming appendage that is going to be a 13 to hit on which one okay that elemental is now currently hexed oh okay is it saving throws or is it ability checks that does not affect saving throws unfortunately go for it 18 hits 25 and with that shot (boom) (cheering) sorry this is the one that took all the damage from the cone of cold so this one is still fine robbed you of victory you did seven damage no you have not all right nice you're adding your hexes to this right add d6 to each of these buddy 12 misses unfortunately you shoot too far it actually separates its body for a second the flames flickering away from the impact of the bullet passing through no effect unfortunately you can you will be on fire percy scanlan you're up it's ikea-made you just have to build it it appears to be flying the very essence of this creature is partial flame and magic and it's levitating as its lower form is a tiny dervish whirlwind of black ash and flame large first you take four points of fire damage because you're on fire that was when it originally got to you and then you're still burning every turn until you put yourself out the range on the resilient sphere is 30 feet so you're going to want to get closer to cast it this is cool currently if you want to go across you can get there and that'll be enough distance okay so it has to make a dexterity saving throw what's the dc the dc on your spells is a 20 right now right and it rolled a 19 18 plus one and with that suddenly you guys see scanlan concentrate shouting the magical incantation through the hand cone-- you see a pink-purple-hued globe of crystalline magical arcane energy just form around the creature and the efreet goes (grunting) the sphere is weightless so no he stays where he is all right second level that's 2d4 plus-- 2d4 plus five you heal whichever one doesn't matter to me all right scanlan i believe that ends your turn keyleth you're up there is 30 feet between them yes a 30 foot long spell could-- it could only hit one it's 30 feet between them 35 between them these two there is definitely so it's ten feet wide and it'll go (rushing water) like that you mean okay so you back up to there all right okay dexterity save on each of them dexterity save on the first one no not for the saving throw the first one does make the saving throw however that is a 19 plus three so 22 on a success it takes half as much damage and isn't knocked prone so it takes half the other one however does fail how much is in the spell right go ahead and roll that i'd say how many gallons would that be that's a shit-ton of gallons 14 okay so that's 14 and 28 i'd say that tidal wave how many gallons of water would we say each one of those is well it's ten foot tall ten foot wide so that's i'd say we're looking at close to 50 gallons of water right we'll say for the purposes of this for the width of it and the space you had to pass it through we'll say roughly 60 gallons of water passes through each of these elementals water susceptibility for every five feet the elemental moves in water or for every gallon of water splashed on it it takes one point of cold damage so they both take an additional 60 points of damage which destroys both of the elementals so keyleth you have more movement still if you want to move somewhere there okay that brings us to grog you're up right there are you raging first or are you-- all right so you got two attacks reckless attack 24 hits 23 hits nice 23 nice all right so as you rush past looking over at the cooled rock that's starting to crack and bits of steam vents are starting to push through underneath your feet scanlan the area you're standing on isn't very sturdy you're probably going to want to move pretty soon however you see this barreling form of pure anger and blade come rushing past as grog slams into the salamander twice with his blade that fails first constitution and fails second so you gain plus two strength salamander loses two strength however because you've taken with each strike within melee of the salamander's heated body it's so intense by its proximity that you suffer six points of fire damage from the first melee attack against you halved to two the other one would be 12 so you take six total of eight fire damage just from slamming and attacking this salamander all righty that brings us to the very end it is now the salamander's turn after being hacked twice by you grog it turns around takes its trident in both hands looks at you with this horrible snarl you can see now these glistening almost ruby-like sharp teeth in its wide grin (snarl) these long catfish-like tendrils that waft off its face as it slams down the spear towards you that is going to be a 23 to hit you take 12 points of piercing damage halved to six and it's going to also turn around and its tail its long snake tail (whoosh) whips you that is going to be an 18 to hit it misses all righty the tail comes towards you and you knock it out of the way with craven edge that will end its turn top of the round i'm going to make a roll for the consistency of the currently cooled lava pool it maintains however you feel your feet cracking beneath-- this efreet-- let me look at the logistics of this spell now because-- it is enclosed for the duration up to a minute it's pushing against and it takes these two flame balls it conjures and throws them out towards you guys they just go (impacts) against the sphere and then go out and it's just (growling) it's really really pissed off it can't do anything all right ending its turn because it can't do anything vax you're up okay right there about go for it okay all three hit nice all right good to know (whoosh) as you jump in front of the way of keyleth you unleash all three daggers in rapid succession each one finding its mark (impacts) into the body of the now profusely bleeding salamander you can see now streaks of its own blood are pouring down boiling on contact with air the significant difference in temperature from the exterior and its actual interior body causing it to change from a liquid to a gas end your turn okay vex you're up you can roll a stealth check a hide action is a hide action as a rogue do you have the-- i don't know what number that is technically you do not have cunning action yet that's a 2nd-level rogue ability so you would use your action to hide if you go from hide to hide you can do that but you are not hidden at the beginning of the round right there go for it roll for attack that'll hit correct yep 18 points of lightning damage all right so as you turn around the side of the tree releasing the arrow as it goes through the air streaking it suddenly bursts into an arcing bit of energy (crackling energy) a bolt of lightning that strikes into and begins to spill around the insides of the elemental you can see it shakes it off as the energy disperses i'm pretty sure you have to if you go from hiding to hiding you can do it read the ability read the ability i'll say for the sake right now of the distraction go ahead and do it for now and we'll correct it later if need be i would rather you have fun than not so what's your stealth roll no it's in the pdf anyway what did you roll 15 okay good to know end of your turn this elemental creature-- comes up over-- (yelling) as another one tears out of the portal and begins making its way here at full movement to there this one's going to go ahead and make two strikes towards you scanlan yep that's going to be 11 the attack roll and a natural one elementals can't roll today and you're already on fire so its fire form won't make much of a difference to you either way all right so that's going to end its turn and the other elemental pours in that's the end of their round all right that brings us to gern flames are out you push-- not stimpy-- coral off of you coral standing (groan) no you can make a quick little aside you have to shout it out though you can certainly try you can certainly try okay what's the range on the spell modify memory where is it there we go 5th-level it's a 30-foot range so you're going to have to get a lot closer you're getting up from prone which is half your movement so you only have 15 more feet you can move so you wouldn't be able to even get into range that's true cone of cold you're out of fifth level yeah and this guy hasn't been touched really except for her lightning arrow you can yeah okay as you stand up and dust off yourself your fantastic zipper-covered dance jacket brushing it off with your hands you lumber forward to the outskirts of this newly cracking rock crust that once was a lava pool and will soon be once again inhale as you guys look around you see this glow this blue crackling blow-- glow on the inside of his mouth the blow is how he got to the mountain and then got inspired to shoot the lightning gern blanston flying high no erection this crackling electric energy in the back of his toothy mouth as he-- (snarl) releases this blast of lightning energy forward striking into the chest of the fire elemental that freshly stepped out of the portal what's the saving throw dc on that 14 it rolled a nine so go ahead and roll the damage on the breath how much is it i'm rolling really bad tonight 16 points of lightning damage to that elemental (impact) it pulls back from the blast you can see its form has to reconvene there's a little bit of black and gray smoke that billows out from the wound as it turns to you (snarling) you've definitely got its attention with your bonus action would you like to do anything with your compadres yes you do all right as the skeleton leaps down into the worm (crash) just flat laid out cracking part of its pelvis yep no music whatsoever all right i'm going to go ahead and-- i'm going to ask you to go ahead and roll a performance check ten trying to recall and hum the song that scanlan once sang to you naught but ten minutes before you don't recall it much at all and it comes out (tuneless humming) it's discordant enough that on a low wisdom save i'll say the fire elemental's next attack has disadvantage that was the strangest round of combat i think i've ever had in d&d all right percy you're up follow that first top of your round you take nine points of fire damage all right cool there you go perfect wasn't sure if you had to be hidden at the top to do it to which one this guy there right there all righty did you misfire oh no you get down with the gun and (click) you look at it and you can see some of the metal bowing in the centerpiece like that's bad that's bad that's bad that's bad 25 hits sharpshooter no that's sharpshooter wow nice roll that's your turn okay finishing up percy that brings us to scanlan you're still concentrating on otiluke's resilient sphere pretty rough you're going to want to step off of it very soon probably oh snap okay you can still move after that so the bolt arcs past go ahead five no and a 12 plus three 15 no both fail their saving throw 8d6 points of lightning damage to both of them it's a wonderful display gern 33 nice roll technically a second spell can only be as high as second level you used two spells in one round however in spite of that the blue pill does give you ten additional hit points healed yeah it actually does pick up their pace a little bit now that they have a backtrack well it's currently being surrounded by a swirl of hex shadow and looking around very confused and wondering why it got up in the morning do you want to move out yeah you can it will yes but better than possibly falling in yes you are takes an action to put it out though unfortunately that's 18 plus six i believe that does hit you you take 12 points of fire damage you already took that damage earlier yeah i rolled for that already you take nine points of fire damage i think it was plus 12 if i'm wrong whatever it's fine all right that ends your turn scanlan keyleth yeah all three of these guys are alive and this guy's in a hamster ball yeah it's a rover just holding him in place all righty let's go ahead and roll some saving throws on their end ('the prisoner' theme starts playing) yeah six and an eight both fail who is number one so good so good the original one not the remake patrick mcgoohan two failed saving throws go ahead and roll damage on that 28 points of water damage plus the additional blast of water gallons surging through them manages to completely scatter both these guys how much water would be in a tidal wave oh there is no way they're surviving that unprotected flames are different than lava pools water doesn't cool it it just evaporates you do you have a very heavy cloud of steam now that is (steam sound) to the side the dancing skeleton and zombie are now just these shadows lit in this cool music video light now as they're (groan) dancing exactly tidal wave on fire elementals is nasty man (thriller starts playing) perfect this is happening guys is that the rest of your turn keyleth do you want to move somewhere yes what's your question no grasping vine is a 4th-level spell i believe and as a bonus action you can't do anything more than a 2nd-level spell in the same round everyone's keeping the dance master alive over there eight points of healing to you gern we can't save him grog you're up go for it 14 misses unfortunately are these with great weapon master that hits go ahead and roll damage 28 points of damage okay this time as you release the first blow of your sword forward he catches it in the blade of the trident and deflects it off to the side slamming it into the ground almost pinning the weapon for a second he gets up in your face and grins (snarls) and the actual breath that emanates from its teeth begins to burn and singe the edge of your beard hairs that infuriates you and you lift up craven edge between the blades of the trident it's a test of strength as you both tense and eventually you lift it back and with the backswing slash him right across his chest with that blow you see a strike of extremely hot hot blood splatter across (sizzling) singe the front of your chest and leave little burn marks on you he does make the save well played does that end your turn efreet's going to start pushing against the ball which is going to begin to coast through the air this way just gliding through slowly yeah that's about all he can do this turn no no it's what you do it's what you do all right vax you're up okay hold off on those two attacks just in case how much your critical sneak attack does okay so as you throw the dagger it goes right past grog's ear and you hear the (whoosh) of the wind as it just brushes past your face after you finish your backswing with craven edge as the salamander creature rears back from the impact it looks towards you and its eyes twitch ever so slightly to your right as it sees the incoming blade a little too late as it (impact) right into its right eye socket its tongue lolls out of its jaw as it falls onto its back and its tail moves and twitches for a few seconds before it eventually goes limp grog stomps it into the ground the twitching stops the salamander now destroyed it's currently in the eye socket yeah yeah you reach down and grab the dagger and as you pull it out (poof) it turns into smoke in your hand okay yeah one spell at a time what are you doing i know what you're doing what are you doing are you doing your vine as well so without any other command your two friends coral and stimpy are still over there dancing as the mist slowly dissipates from the deluge you pull out from the side of your little satchel there your flying broom which is a pretty decent medium-sized broom places it in the air and it rests there slightly shifting in place you leap up onto it and grab onto the front as you shoot up from the side as you place yourself on top of otiluke's resilient sphere placing all your weight onto it it sinks a little bit then it comes to a halt about three feet it sinks as you're just standing on top of it what do you want to do okay well you've already cast a 5th-level spell twice how many 5th-level spells can you cast per day yeah unfortunately you're out of 5th-level slots yeah you're getting down to about the 40-second mark yes you can do that you can jump onto it and begin to push down you leap in the air and jump on it again and as you do the orb (sinking noise) and just slowly over the next 15 seconds shove it down to the point where you're over the orb on the very top as you can feel the spell about to dissipate grog go ahead and roll an arcana check six this isn't working no it has to have an anchor point somewhere okay i want you to make an athletics check actually no this would be a full strength check just roll a strength check you have advantage because you're still raging although you wouldn't be raging anymore because you spent time concentrating on the spell you could go into a rage for this if you'd like to spend another use of your rage okay you go into a rage all right as you step into the lava you suffer 26 points of fire damage from wading up to your knees in molten rock halved because of your resistance 22 with that you (boof) you shove the sphere which shifts back about halfway to there you have to catch yourself on the side grabbing the broom and holding it out here as you're stepping the other direction i want you to make an acrobatics check seven as you (slipping noise) slip off the top of the sphere begin to fall back toward the lava behind you in a very lord of the rings gollum tumbling into mount doom type of view (sploosh) back first into the lava actually you take six points of fire damage impacting-- rolled really low on that (sploosh) you can feel the back of your scales and the flesh on your back immediately begin to burn with horrifying pain you're holding your broom aloft 'cause you don't want that to go in the fire and with that the sphere breaks (disgruntled moans) right now we're going back to the initiative order since combat has re-initiated with the sphere opened that brings us to the top the efreet now freed from its sphere is going to go first he is livid all right he's going to fly back up (groans) you do yes you can go ahead and roll-- oh wait no it's a 2nd-level spell it auto-- yeah yeah because it is a 2nd-level spell as its form begins to vanish scanlan what do you do to counter it and that bit of chaos is just enough as he begins to cast his innate invisibility spell it looks over what in the-- shit and loses the spell concentration the invisibility field vanishes and it stands there above all right that brings us to vax make an acrobatics check darting around the side there because you are hasted with this so you can actually just dart around the side yes go for it that hits shit jeez 34 how did you get 34 on your attack 30 okay that's okay a 30 works 34 i was just like (groaning) bleeding from the nose i couldn't deal with it 30 hits seven got it cool that ends your turn vax that brings us to vex all right it is that's right so you hunter's mark once again put that back on there all right all right so lightning arrow again go ahead and roll for the attack that hits go ahead and roll damage gern you're on deck 23 points of damage all righty (impact) the lightning slams into his chest and you can see it arcs through its scimitar that it's holding up in its hand and it shakes and almost drops the weapon and catches its arm as the electricity disperses out the edge of the blade and looks back at you he's now glaring at both you and scanlan all right that's as far as you can get there gern top of your turn you take 24 points of fire damage from the lava as you're sinking into it (sizzling) right now you can try and cast in this area but you would have a hard time concentrating i'd say you'd have to take a concentration check to even get a spell out because you're in so much pain i'd say you would probably want to move out of the lava before you do that so you (straining) stand up it's too deep and you're having to basically wade your way through which is burning your hands as you get over there you were holding your broom so here's what you do you go ahead and you lift yourself up out of the lava onto the broom and then (blowing) push you're not fully on it and it's hard to engage its mental commands directly with the current amount of chaos around you but you do manage to skirt yourself to the very edge of the lava and land on your feet which are numb after the sheer amount of pain you've suffered and you don't even want to look down at what you look like from the waist below so she takes the broom from your hand what are you going to cast okay as you should be all right so you get to go ahead and roll let me get to the spell here real fast disintegrate oh it just makes a dexterity saving throw it doesn't even get a chance all right what's your spell dc again 16 it rolled a two that's going to be bad all right roll 10d6 plus 40 damage damn disintegrate doesn't mess around it's an all or nothing spell if they make the save nothing you don't make it (explosion) 76 points of force damage as you get out you can see your vest itself is burning there's still elements of embers burning at the edges of the leather and the cloth the bottom part of your scales are a combination of blue black and little bits have cracked open where you can see red flesh underneath there's a lot of burn damage they're really glowing however as you turn around as your fin jewelry on the sides of your face jangles with the speed as you spin around and point your finger upward the arcane energy forming at the end of your finger this singular beam of dull green arcane energy streaks forward the efreet who is currently focused on scanlan and watching vex run past looks down just in time to see you release the spell opens his eyes and attempts to dodge out of the way unfortunately not fast enough it blasts in the side of its shoulder and you can see as a whole chunk of its back muscle shoulder and lower torso are just turned to dust exposing bone and elements of its musculature and flesh underneath it goes (snarls) and looks down it can't even make a loud emission of pain it's just gutturally whispering its horrible suffering as it looks down it reaches up with its hand and cauterizes the wound on the back of its body leaving it a charred cinder it glares down at you extremely angry i hate you most of all scarecrow percy you're up unless you want your dudes to do anything by the way they're still over there dancing they're just cheering on you can certainly try all right so the hex moves over go for it 22 hits strength 23 yeah sorry little bitch plus 1d6 don't forget wow disintegrate spell fucked him up nice is this with your pistol and what's your first range increment on that the pistol your first range increment that's right good call all right so fire again yeah that hits roll damage scanlan you're up next by the way all righty (two impacts) just as it manages to cauterize the wounds from the disintegrate spell both bullets blast into its torso and you can see it's now thinking the height advantage would be helpful after being locked in a hamster ball and now being repeatedly blasted from every which way it's not enjoying its current experience by any means 18 hits nice this one (impact) blasts into the center of its chest and you can see part of its pectoral muscle tears open and flame erupts from the impact it reaches up and (snarling) go for it okay 22 hits this is going to be a rough round for him ooh you got it that's a hit go for it roll damage damn man all right (two impacts) these holes are beginning to appear in its body where the bits of fiery flesh are being blasted away from the impacts of your weapon all right that brings us to scanlan you guys held him-- if the spell you put into it was a fourth 3rd-level spell yeah right yeah so it wouldn't be a 4th-level spell because you didn't cast into it as a 4th-level oh got you it wouldn't count against your daily it's in addition to that all right all right with a five it does not make its saving throw go ahead and roll damage 8d6 how do you want to do this (cheering) it's hard-pressed from this angle unfortunately grog is at an angle where you wouldn't really be able to do that mind you when you blast him he'll plummet close to his feet if you wanted to so as you charge up and blast the lightning bolt from your crotch region you then do a little dance maneuver with your waist causing it to (crackling) carve a scanlan s into the torso of the efreet as it plummets to the ground slamming into where the lava would be while the fire doesn't hurt its form you can see grog as it stands in the ground (groaning) its form is turning into ash around you it's actually just dissipating and turning to ash as its eyes roll up and meet with yours all right you suffer 26 points of fire damage reduced to 13 from taking another round in there as you take craven edge and take the head off as the head rolls away-- you grab it it turns to ash you get out of the lava stand on the side and look over just as the rest of the head turns to ashes okay roll sleight of hand yes you can plus total of 16 as you're dealing with this you have no notice of this you may question it later if you like but you have no idea where it went and didn't see any of this transaction happen make a deception check make an insight check now 13 she's telling the truth man that broom just went straight in the lava at this point you hear the flickering of flame and the portal itself has begun to expand even further glowing brighter okay as this is happening the flames themselves grow higher and higher the lava begins to boil and roil as you guys all move up to the side you can see the lava is beginning to (bubbling) splash out and spray bits are starting to scatter as some of the nearby trees tumble over you can see the four fire ashari as well as korren come across one of the clearings the other way you see what looks to be another salamander gets thrown about 15 feet from the trees hits the ground skids and is motionless as you see cerkonos with the rest of the pyrah the fire ashari stepping through keyleth we saw your symbol is it time all right let us try to close this rift and the rest of the druids all begin to gather around the outside of this portal as it's flickering you can see piercing into the extremely blinding light keyleth you take a moment and using your attachment to the fire ashari and the fire elemental plane from your last passage through it you can see past the brightness and see beyond the doorway you can see on the other side there appears to be probably another half dozen or a dozen or so of a few other elementals and salamanders that are now making their way towards the portal all right as the rest of the ashari begin to gather around the portal and concentrate they are managing to hold the rift in its current size you see as beads of sweat begin to pour down korren's face not used to this type of terrain he goes (gasps) we need more power if you can aid whatever you have to bring to this please now is the time does anyone wish to help with the ritual all right how would you wish to help what do you think would lend itself to a fire gate-sealing ritual it could be a spell it could be a use of a skill how would you like to-- make an arcana check 19 the blink candle which you crafted from various parts from blink dogs and other creatures that have natural translocation capabilities might have the capability as this is a doorway between planes and teleportation magic is based on creating short-form doorways between similar spaces might have some impact on the ritual if used properly as coral takes the candle (groans) turns around and begins to just slowly melt steps into the lava nine points of fire damage to coral who was already sitting at-- and had taken six damage right so 15 from 33 coral's at half health coral as this is rough terrain gets part of the way there then continues walking forward the rest of the way takes an additional 17 points of damage so that's 32 points of damage what's coral's hitpoints 33 is the max yep on the sheet right there i can read my own text 33 hit points coral at one hitpoint gets up to the lava take the candle and (boof) as the energy expands from it you can see a ripple a heat wave ripple that billows outward coral vanishes entirely and the portal shrinks down by about five to six feet actually closing in its space suddenly you hear a (zip) and coral appears about ten 15 feet in the air-- smack coral falls those 15 feet taking six points of bludgeoning damage let's see if coral survives this with undead fortitude nope that is a roll of eight versus a total dc of 11 with the damage taken and coral just splats like a really really old orange just slammed into the concrete just (splatting) one of the fire ashari goes (cringing gagging) and just ends up concentrating on holding the gate however that did aid the ritual we have two more folks who could aid in this ritual how would that help the ritual yeah oh yeah all right go ahead and make a nature roll with advantage this is your understanding of the natural elements of the world around you and the connection you have with the fire elemental plane 23 as you begin to concentrate your hands instinctively burst into flames to coalesce your connection to the fire elemental plane as you complete the plane shift spell your form shimmers for a second and for a moment it looks like she's only partially there she's actually translucent as flames begin to lick up the sides of her body at this point you can see the lava flow in the mountain begins to slow and the bubbling begins to come to a stillness the portal itself shimmers again and then shrinks down to the size of a normal doorway about five foot by ten foot tall and it's just barely holding on as you're concentrating on holding it in its place you can see now the rest of the druids around are sweating profusely who wishes to take on the last part of this ritual planar shift you said finding ways to tailor magic essences into this type of a ritual you don't know you'll find out however you wish to aid this ritual and justify how it would be helpful in this instance hmm okay okay i will say-- hmm how do i make this work i'm going to want you to go ahead and make an acrobatics check all right you rush up leaping off the side spinning in the air as you do you unfurl the cape and turn it into a limited parachute-type projection and as you slam it down towards-- i need you to go ahead and make a wisdom check to see if you have the capability of triggering the magic of the item at the right time to be impactful yeah 13 that's better as you come down you take the cape and encase you trigger the magic at which point the remainder of this doorway just blinks out entirely the cape gone the doorway gone as vax (splashing) right into the lava okay you take 22 points of fire damage as you splat into the lava so it resisted to 11 so you (splashing) in the lava all of a sudden images flash in your head of the time that you lost most of your foot in the underdark and you go-- and before you can even react all of a sudden something wraps around your waist and yanks you out as a vine pulls you in an arc and slams you into the hard obsidian floor on the outside of the lava flow the rest of you gather there as the rest of the druids finish their concentration the lava pools themselves have gone still and you can see elements beginning to cool and there's currently no sign of a tear between the elemental planes that's currently bursting through she would be back here you're on the ground right next to a dancing skeleton you would be part of the ritual but you fell next to the dancing skeleton taking another 21 points of fire damage reduced to ten the druids look around and give a nod of acceptance all of them acknowledge you who they have not met and don't understand quite where you came from or why you're here one of them who is currently missing an arm on one hand dark weathered skin long jet black hair cruising down to the middle of his back approaches you and his one right arm he puts on the shoulder and says into your eyes i do not know you friend but you have come to our aid at an hour when we really required it he removes his hand very well candle he does this and his finger bursts into flame and you can see a flame flickering we do not need candles here in pyrah but thank you insinuated actual finger at this point korren your father approaches you and places a hand on your shoulder and turns you around to look you in the face and you can see there's smears of dirt and still glistening from sweat from the whole ritual and looks a bit weathered and winded from the experience keyleth i'm proud of you i think we will stay here and help the pyrah try and rebuild and he takes your chin and pulls it up and looks you in the face with a broad smile on his face he says the road before you keyleth is hard and fraught with loss and sadness to live is to struggle against the void but it's those moments of darkness that define the joy of the world around them learn from the loss and push forward as a beacon of perseverance of hope for life after pain this is one of the pillars of strength of a leader one that i have learned with the loss of your mother but you are my beacon of hope and to many more than you even expect and he looks back towards the four other members of the zephrah tribe that are all just looking at you and they nod i trust you will not go forth while we stay here i want you to grasp your destiny vanquish this terrible beast that lies on the shores of tal'dorei complete your aramente whatever your destiny is grasp it but you've chosen this path and all destiny really is is the choices you make leading towards a goal that perhaps you do not yet understand but when you've returned i wish for you to teach us the wisdom you've gained on this journey kaitiaki keyleth no it's all right we will keep an eye out for it though well unless there's anything else we have business to attend to in restoring this area i wish you all great luck  call to zephrah come home and we will come with you as he looks over all of you giving each a look of-- a nod of respect and appreciation-- (don't you by simple minds plays) glances past to grog vex and lingers a very long look on vax and just gives you a nod yeah stay safe for her sake and korren turns around and walks back as the rest of the zephrah ashari walk along with him you through all this chaos get a little bored and frustrated with all this weird nonsensical stuff look at the ground and realize there's a lot of hidden treasures scattered amongst this vicinity make an investigation check yes as you look down and say all these treasures around you get a closer look the ground here is rugged rock and black ash and dust and pieces of charred and burnt petrified wood and right around the outskirts of where the lava pool is you can see what look to be broken slivers of soot-covered dragon scale just peppered throughout the landscape barely visible until you look real close thanks to the constant barrage of blacken soot and dust that falls from the nearby area you just leave you guys watch as gern blanston begins walking around and like a gutter snipe or one of the people on the beach with a metal detector starts combing through which she says with a strange doppler effect even though he's but 20 feet away from you and has chosen to ignore the rest of your party to go about his business as your skeleton's in the background dancing yeah only one left there's plenty of charred corpses littered all over this mountaintop you could make undead from it follows him all right so the rest of you what is your next course of action you already cast transport via plants this day that's how you got here and with that vox machina leaves gern to his business as they go and camp out at the base of the mountain and with that we're going to finish tonight's game (laughter) yeah you heard it guys critters' call to action make it happen all
