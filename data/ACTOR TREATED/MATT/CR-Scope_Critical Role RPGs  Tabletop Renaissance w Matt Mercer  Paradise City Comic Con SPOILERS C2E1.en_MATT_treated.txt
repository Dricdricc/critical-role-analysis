hi that was-- hi good to see you guys thank you all for coming and welcome to our panel about nerdy-ass discussions (cheering) me and a bunch of other nerdy-ass voice actors that are friends of mine began playing at home privately years ago we were asked to stream it on twitch and now coming up on our third year anniversary which is crazy audience yeah we're not going anywhere i mean cameras or not we're still playing for now everything's pretty kosher we started streaming it and we were very scared to stream it because when you put anything you love on the internet it's a dangerous scary thing especially tabletop gaming which had been a largely misunderstood genre and hobby for a long time the idea of doing it so people could just watch it seemed like folly i was like no one's going to-- this is just opening us up to everyone telling us how terrible we are and to go away thankfully i was very wrong for the most part there's still that factor and i expect that that's fine we've found this incredible community of people that not just watch our adventures and are invested in our adventures and do stories and art but go off and create their own which is what i really want to was use it as a platform to empower other people to create their own adventures to find a new hobby they didn't know was out there or didn't understand how to get into or rediscover it because it had been a long time since they had given themselves permission as an adult to get back into it then doing so find incredible friend groups and reconnect and find in my opinion is one of the best uses of your social time with a close group of friends there's really no experience like playing a tabletop rpg in my opinion it's been really amazing and i feel like a proud papa seeing all these people out there who either got into d&d through our show or other streaming services got back into it and they tell me about their adventures and their characters sometimes for a while but that's cool because that was me for a long time they'd be like you play d&d i'd be like oh yeah let me tell you about my dwarf fighter and they slowly turn to ash it's been incredible these recent years seeing what this panel's about the tabletop renaissance that a lot of people are talking about is seeing what was once a hobby that had difficulty being understood being respected in a lot spaces for many of years and suffered through the satanic panic of the 80s recently thanks to things like stranger things thanks to twitch and live play introductions that have been going for years even before we started ours now into other forms of media it's not just being proud to say that you play dungeons & dragons but more and more people are asking i've always wanted to get into that do you know anybody or do you know how i can learn we have great people like matt colville who are doing youtube channels about how easy it is colville how easy it can be to run a game and all aspects of it that i know i was very scared of as i got older and tried to dive into it now is great time to learn and a great time to dive into it it's super exciting i'm super excited we had a very emotional end to our last campaign in october a game that we ran for five years characters that we in many cases lived and breathed to the point where you guys didn't see this but before we went live last thursday travis turns to taliesin across the table and went percy i was-- and we all slowly turned to travis and said did you just call him percy that's when we realized that it was probably best that we ended the last campaign we're starting to blur that line a little intensely no end of shit going forward for that we ended that campaign it was very emotional for the past few months it's been a lot of preparation for the new campaign which we just started (cheering and applause) are you (cheering and applause) jester stand up and take a bow (cheering) ariana amazing job that's awesome audience oh my god oh yeah actually come up and i'll take a picture and send it to her (cheering) that's so cool so stuff like this happens now which is crazy to put it into context we were already pretty nervous going in because when we started streaming originally they were characters we had already been with for a few years privately so everyone was very sure of themselves and their personalities story arcs we just opened it up to the world this was a new campaign everyone keep this in mind too while we've been playing this for a number of years for a lot of our party it was their second campaign ever because the first arc vox machina was their first experience playing a role playing game they were super nervous about it audience except for liam taliesin me and marisha everyone-- i'll switch over to this one we're sitting down at the table and getting ready to go live everyone's getting jittery and they're nervous going oh my god i hope it's okay travis goes and checks the numbers two minutes before we go live and he's like there's 70000 people on twitch we're like what he goes i think it's broken reloads it oh now it's 80 all of us turn pale i'm curious to go back and watch our faces on the vod to see how all of us are just-- hi the total numbers came in between the platforms we were streaming to twitch youtube live and alpha and i think between them all we hit 125000 people watching live (applause) it's been a huge part of my life i owe a lot of who i am as a person i owe a lot of my career and my skills socially to growing up playing role playing games it's a space where you can therapeutically work through issues in your life through a character that's other than you it's a place where you can find empathy for personalities and people and different walks of life and in different situations than those you're in no worries all right audience my flight left at 8am friday morning i had to wake up at 5am and after the nerves the jitters of that first campaign on thursday i didn't get to sleep until about 3am so i got two hours of sleep woke up went to the airport got another hour and a half on the plane because you know plane and then went right to my signing yesterday i might seem a little frazzled over the past 24 hours i apologize but there's a good reason yeah fair enough sorry hi audience hello again what's your question audience yeah most stories whether it be film television novel the first chapter isn't you learning everything about the characters there's a lot of elements of their life that's already happened and part of for the reader what's interesting is to fill those gaps like for the new campaign i did a session zero with all the players before we started streaming it it was a prelude that was both a space for them to feel comfortable this is a little private thing that they have for themselves to figure out their character that way when we come into the session that first episode you already feel like it's a lived-in world as opposed to everyone awkwardly going hi i'm a tiefling there's a little bit of that too but that happens with any beginning of the campaign don't feel like you have to front-load all of the exposition or all of the information all of the backstories up front if anything it makes the world feel more like you're getting a glimpse at a living space if people continue to act and be without all of the information available to you it's already happened and it's still happening don't feel like that should be constraining to you audience this is a whole long discussion and i'm trying to keep it concise so we can get to the next question the fate system i've enjoyed a lot of times i've played traveler and diaspora which are both fun games both hard sci-fi and weird sci-fi especially traveler because it's one of the few games where you can die in character creation because you get to choose your character's path in life what jobs they do and if they go into more dangerous jobs they learn better skills to start with but there's a chance that if you have a dangerous job you'll get killed on the job and have to start over it's kind of fucked the old school deadlands system which is phenomenal it's a little more complicated it's not as streamlined as the newer one but the idea that casting spells is you playing a card game with devils and demons and the better hands you get against the dm or the gm of the game who's playing the devil's side gets you different abilities based on the spell you want to do it's got a lot of really cool old western elements there's also the amber diceless roleplaying game when i was in high school based off the amber series and that was interesting but that takes a lot of trust because without dice it's a lot of you all deciding together what succeeds and what fails that can lead to arguments i learned very quickly if everyone isn't on the same page and trusts each other at the table those are a few examples of what i've enjoyed i've heard good things about the newer star wars systems haven't tried that yet anyway i have to get to the next question but thank you man hello audience for one reading a lot it helps expand your vocabulary there's a lot of words that you'll come across in books and be like i don't know what that means you look it up and be like that's cool and now i know that word and i can use it that was huge for me growing up and continues to be whenever i have time to read a cool way to keep that sharp moving forward also consider when you're setting a scene it's not just visuals consider all the senses consider ways that you can set a scene with both what they're seeing what the temperature of the room is if there's a certain acrid or iron-like taste in the air or if it's very cold and causes their teeth to feel pain when they breathe in is there a specific sound of distant shaking or perhaps water dripping off wall condensation think of how the different senses are affected when you set a scene and that helps immerse your players or whoever's reading your story as you get into it that's a big topic but from running a game standpoint i find those are good little tricks whenever you open a new sequence a new location for the players to immediately pull them into the world and help them imagine exactly where they are that helps the immersion it helps the players get ready to dive into it in character that's a really quick tip that i hope will be helpful audience no worries thank you audience good how're you doing audience yes which by the way i do want try and avoid spoilers in case people haven't seen the new episode audience generally no not my players i've had that happen in the past if a player wants to play a character of a certain kind i'm not going to tell them not to i might help them finesse it or let them know in some situations where it's going to be difficult based on the world we're playing in or they don't understand issues that might come up for instance if somebody was like i have a charisma of eight i want to be a warlock i'd be like maybe let's try to mix up those stats a little there's certain concepts that may not be the strongest concept in fact we have a few race and class combinations in the new campaign that are by no means optimal when you consider min-maxing character strengths but that's also cool because you get combinations you wouldn't expect to me it's more important to create a character idea then it is to create something that's optimally powerful if you can do both and that's your game that's fun too but i don't think that should hinder you necessarily there's never been a concept that i've shot down i can help players finesse it if they're unsure or if they're trying to feel out how this would fit in the world then i'll work with them and we'll talk over their story and talk about their abilities and how that might fit for their narrative down the road it's rare that i shoot something down unless the person is a real dick my concept is a person that sets children on fire i'm like eh i don't know if that's going to play well with the rest of the group buddy audience yeah thank you audience hi audience ooh personally that's a lot of decisions let's see audience that's a member of vox machina vox machina as a whole oh man to be perfectly honest not checking for traps at the tomb of the raven queen because that led to a chain of events that led to a very sad story audience yeah but it made for a great narrative not all things have to be positive there are a lot of things to gain yeah there's always and urge as a gm to be like i want this to end up okay i want it to be all right a lot of times that's a good thing but some stories are powerful because it doesn't work out in the most positive light that's realistic and sometimes that's a very healing experience to go through that i know it was hard for some people in the game to deal with eventualities in the narrative and missed opportunities to be vague but overall i think it made for a more impactful story and memorable one it's an example of sometimes you have to let the narrative guide where it's going as opposed to try and shoehorn a happy ending unless your players are all in a really bad place in the world and you're like uh and everything's okay because at the same time you want your players to have a good time audience thank you audience couple things one if it's really hampering the narrative and it's preventing a lot of people from having a good time talk with them about it outside of the game after a session where it gets particularly bad you can be like hey guys before we leave or i'm going to take a moment here i just want to talk for the sake-- any time you're at the table you try and find a balance between being respectful of everyone else's good time and not trying to derail it constantly before other people want to go for the most part a lot of times because it is a very free environment people will want to be impulsive and i'm going to do what i want that's fine to a certain extent but you do have to be respectful of everyone else at the table otherwise you probably won't be invited back to the table you're supposed to play the game as a collaborative experience even though there can be tension there can be moments where there can be conflict inside people can be selfish if it's in character but if it's so much to the point where nobody else is having fun and that's a problem with the way you're playing the game maybe this table isn't where you should be playing there are tables that that might work at there might be a bunch of powergamers who are down with the idea of being crazy and weird i've had those games too and they're fun but you have to make sure everybody's on the same page talk with them about it and if they continue to do it or you want to teach them a lesson sometimes make those choices lead to a very bad-- not tpk scenario but if they're getting in serious bar fights all the time they're going to get arrested they're going to get imprisoned they're going to get interrogated they're going to get branded as a criminal on the shoulder whoever the head of the guard there is going to take a personal liking to make sure that he makes their life miserable now they're a watched individual every town they go into everyone seeing their face grimaces now it's a oh my god there's consequences to your actions that's a way to do it too where you don't have to kill the character but you can certainly shame them audience yeah shame audience hey buddy good to see you audience first part i'm going to relay what i've heard from other people i've run a few games for kids liam has a lot more experience with this sam recently did it patrick rothfuss runs it for his son one the best thing you can do is keep the math minimal so you can focus on the narrative if you're teaching kids math that's a different thing but make it so it's more of a storytelling thing the dice roll maybe a modifier here and there but however way you can simplify the rules i'm sure there's people online who have more reduced home rule versions of d&d for kids if you research enough i've seen a few out there it's pretty cool second steer away from focusing on the violent combat aspects of it and focus more on the problem solving like communal problem solving one thing that patrick rothfuss does for really young kids i find is not give them a weapon give them some magical items and some tools and it challenges so they have to think of creative ways to get out of it he gave his son no weapons but gave him a rope that ties itself and then put him in a dungeon area where all he had was his rope he ended up using it to tie up monsters maybe ask them questions and eventually convince him to help him out then throw the rope up to climb areas where it was dangerous or use it to wrap around things he could swing across let them become creative and problem solve without always having to kill things as adults we can keep a difference but you're not going to teach a bunch of kids that sometimes the best thing to do is slaughter your opponent that's maybe not the best thing to teach them gauge the group to see if they want high adventure or if they want dark liam was surprised when his daughter and all of her female friends wanted to play and he's like what do you want to play and they all went curse of strahd and he was like okay the more he ran it the more that they were craving some good scary horror and so he felt it out you feel out the group at first you play it soft and see what they're interested in and then gear it more towards their style but simplify it focus on the story and narrative problem solving and challenges i think are generally more interesting than always having combat although combat can be fun depending on how old the group is and be conscientious about it those are a few the opposite side i don't want to confirm anything because i like to see anybody else's interpretation my personal mind-- and i'm not saying this is canon because i don't want to kill anybody else's idea-- i like to imagine in that final battle one of the loud explosions that you heard in vasselheim was him lining the entirety of his shop all of his explosives with a torch in his hand (as victor) they'll never take me alive and a bunch of cultists come in right for him and in that final moment as he lures them all in he took them all out with him that's how i like to imagine it (applause) audience i mean talk to your local bethesda that would be crazy pretty cool i'd love that heck yeah i'd love that it's crazy to me that there's even a book that's out there and it's something i made up that's crazy to me so that i can't even if i think too hard i'm going to bleed from my nose ugh aneurysm i hope so hello audience right for one thing depending on how you create your character whether it be random-rolling for-- take a low statistic somewhere interesting in your character whether it be super low strength-- they're super weak and have a hard time getting around if you want to be real hardcore dark souls-level go a super low constitution and be super-- one thing about a unique character is a serious flaw or a number of serious flaws that makes them human it makes them easy to connect with that doesn't necessarily have to reflect in their statistics but in the 5th edition rules they do a good job of introducing players to bonds and flaws and personality traits and it's a really good introduction to that play up the character you create what are their long-term goals i think is an important thing so they know at least what they're eventually driving towards what's their short-term goal what is it they're trying to accomplish right now and the use of having this other party how are they intending to make this group of new friends help them get to that goal consider the things that they really don't like and try to avoid is it confrontation with family is it a specific type of creature that they had a bad experience with that they're always looking over their shoulder for like a bogeyman-type of thing is it they have a fear of public speaking is it an issue with law enforcement they're like i've dealt with the man which will always get them in trouble which is fun too find certain things that you can write down and stick to that may get your party in trouble because honestly some of the best experiences are getting your party in trouble try and find common ground between the characters conflict is good and that's why a lot of my campaigns i'll talk to the players and ask them if any of you have previous relationships what are they as opposed to having the awkward we all meet at a table and don't know each other and introduce ourselves like an aa meeting and now we're fighting adventuring i find if you have a little bit of back history that you develop together you already come in feeling stronger connection with those characters and that strong connection between the two of you has the other players wanting to engage more with that because they want oh i want that there's no real trick to it more consider the whole spectrum of good things about them bad things about them wants goals fears and write them down it won't be perfect at first it's a messy process figuring out your character to be fair all of us at the end of the first episode of the new campaign we're like okay then that was better than expected we were all waiting for it to fall apart and even then after we're getting phone calls from the players like okay i think i'm getting an idea now so it's a process those hopefully might help a little bit could be a long topic audience no worries audience welcome audience yes audience i think that's a glorious plan audience (gilmore voice) glorious plan (applause) hey buddy audience that's adorable audience for one thing it is an arms race in a weird way because it's you trying to outsmart multiple other people as a dungeon master that's supervillain territory that's you going these are my peers that i respect and love and we're all on a very equal playing field as far as intellect goes-- audience yeah and they're all trying to beat my stuff for one thing it's fun when you have a group that are all we can do a lot of damage you're like oh that's cool that doesn't help if you fight a lot of creatures that you can't damage you can only defeat them by discovering these three relics throughout this area and destroy them at this one pillar but while that's happening it's stalking them the entire time the fear of we cannot touch this thing coming up with challenges where the creature can only be damaged if you acquire this one npc and have them within a proximity of it because their backstories are tied but you have to keep them alive as much as you're also getting ready to damage this thing coming up with abilities that the creatures can have that can shut down or convert party members to its side nothing's better than sinking your party against itself by the way it's a delightful thing in fact it's really frustrating when grog's berserk ability allows him to ignore charm effects i was like ugh oh man it could be so much fun just want to tear him apart from the inside you have to think outside of the box and remember even the creatures in the player's handbook if you're like this creature i've put up against them before or something similar to it and they stomped it you look at it and go well they stomped it because they have a lot of damage output this creature they resist a lot of the abilities that it can put on them or conditions nothing's stopping you from customizing it nothing's stopping you from changing it which is great too if you have a group of players that have been playing for a long time and they already know what creatures can do nothing's better than having them fight something like don't worry guys it's resistant to fire or it's vulnerable to fire and they do fireball and it's all of a sudden immune they're like wait what because suddenly they don't know where they are they don't know what's going on the real fear creeps into their eyes don't be afraid to customize monsters consider encounters that sometimes cannot be won by sheer damage output sometimes rely on conditions as a difficulty factor if a creature has a radial stun that's going to mess things up real fast especially if it's on a five- or six-regeneration thing every few rounds or so all of a sudden half of the party is stunned that sucks for them (laughter) audience no worries i'm sorry about your party by the way audience hi audience oh yeah audience we've been a fan of escape rooms anyway me and marisha we've done a few of them they were doing a show for alpha at the time called escape where they were asking people to do different escape rooms and they had one that was a harry potter sorcery theme they were like well get the critical role people and we were like yeah chris sabat voice of vegeta was in town and they're like well get him in he's like i don't know what i'm doing and we're like great it was a fun escape room they invited us to do and we totally almost got there and lost at the very last second which was frustrating that was them asking us to do it from an internal geek & sundry standpoint but they knew we were fans of escape rooms my proposal to marisha actually was i designed and built an escape room that was lovecraft-themed we were all sneaking me and taliesin and a bunch of a friends were sneaking off for days at a time i had to record i had sessions back-to-back these days well see you this evening then we'd drive down to huntington beach this friend of ours had a warehouse and we're building flats and getting old furniture and made an escape room for her escape rooms are a thing we're fans of but i think i've built the only one i'll ever build because they're a pain in the butt audience thank you audience hello audience i know what you're talking about audience part of that is checking in with the player the player involved-- we had many discussions outside of the game about the possible paths the character might take it was very much a one where do you see the character wanting to go what are the decisions he'd make based on certain scenarios and are you comfortable with pursuing this regardless of how it turns out making sure that the player was okay with that because once again you want to make sure they're having a good time and you don't want to for the sake of well the dice said completely destroy somebody who's going through a hard time in their life you have to be conscientious of that check in with them make sure everything's okay make sure they're okay with going along with whatever happens if they say no then you can be like okay well maybe we'll take a break from this scenario for a little while and come back to it until you're ready or if it's a real scenario you can salvage it and-- so a part of you is the dungeon master you have to be true to the narrative but you also have to be respectful of your players there and make sure that they're still having a good time and you're not putting them in a place that isn't at the time mentally healthy for them it's a hard balance but it's one that only comes with experience and making sure that you still respect the people that are giving you the time to be part of your story audience thank you audience works in a lot of scenarios i find audience you can have a low-magic campaign and have magic characters just consider that they understand that having magical abilities is probably very rare and probably very feared if it's a world where there's almost no magic and somebody suddenly throws a fireball anybody in the vicinity's going to be like chain them up that's a problem consider it can be a very fugitive-type game where they're trying to keep their abilities on the dl they're trying to hide it from society you can also consider maybe magic itself is visceral and dangerous you can have an element where if they roll really low on an attack like wild magic-wise and whenever they cast a spell roll and if it goes really badly they lose control and it might hurt them you can think of narrative reasons as to why magic is still a dangerous and sparing thing audience that can work out yeah are we talking spell plague like warcraft like plague audience okay there we go yes that can work well oh blood plague is what i was thinking of old wow players know what i'm talking about they were watching the desolation of ironforge you can tailor classes if you want to you can tell people-- if you really want no players to be casters you can have them multiclass down the road if magic becomes more prevalent if they'd be interested or you can reduce the overall damage of spells if you're keeping combat more tailored but that gets a little more fiddly with the customization and if this is your first time dming i wouldn't recommend messing with it that much audience okay so you're already down the path audience fair enough but then you consider healing-- some abilities may not be spells they can be variations to it for instance maybe they're an alchemist maybe a fireball is a giant sphere of some concoction they made and they throw it and it explodes and has the same damage and the same radius but it's not necessarily magical or a healing spell can be somebody who is a fantastic field medic and has a bunch of salves and medicinal herbs that they can jam into their wounds real fast and it's a cure wounds spell you can find ways to tailor existing rules take away the narrative magic aspect of it to a certain extent-- it might be a little unwieldy in the higher levels-- ice storm turn the ac on very high by then maybe there's other ways you can narratively consider the use of magic in the world but those are some ways you can go about it i hope that's helpful audience look my wife ran that game many of you in the audience will understand they had no choice she was amazing it was her first time ever running an rpg and honey heist is a game designed for bear puns there's a difference between too many bear puns in a game that isn't honey heist and being in a honey heist where it's practically in the rule set i didn't feel too bad about that we knew what we were getting into with that audience that's why i was being careful audience that can change either way often part of what's the thrill of the game is preparation usually gets thrown out the window as a dungeon master when the players make contact with your plans people always say a plan never survives contact with the enemy same deal when it comes to running a roleplaying game the balance for me preparation-wise is not to prepare too much super detailed because more often than not you will end up throwing out the hours of work that you did for this whole thing that never happened the party completely missed instead spend a little bit of time with bullet points and basic notes that can give you the general idea of a direction it can go or a location they can be at that way if it doesn't go to you didn't lose too much time with it you can always bring it back later if they go to it you have enough written down that you can quickly make up the rest fill in the gaps and hope that process allows you to loosely prepare a lot more possibilities and as such be more comfortable as a player i mean your job is to mess with the dungeon master your character sheet is your preparation and then you come to the table and you see how you can fiddle and ruin their work (sighing) audience yeah i know there's a lot of maps that never get seen but at the same time i would prefer-- those are all map ideas that i take a picture of or save in case they come up later in the campaign or the ideas can be reused so they don't all go to waste and i would prefer to prepare things just in case and have them go away then railroad my players to go i worked so hard on this map you're going to fight here dang it it comes with the territory i suppose thank you audience oh welcome audience whenever anything intense happens in the stream people always make jokes like oh matt's sleeping on the couch tonight (laughter) yeah and we do every time something really crazy happens audience oh man i'm scared for this new campaign they're all level two right now oh man oh boy it's so funny they rolled their characters and liam's like i have 12 hit points i'm like (cackling) audience oh man we had our session zero the first hit laura's character took she went to zero hit points and i was like oh no little different now isn't it (laughter) audience yeah basically gods it's fine it's great i'm sorry audience oh welcome to the chaos (applause cheers) audience i would say i've never tried to slip easter eggs outside of the game into it because i want to keep it very separate the more i bring in pop culture elements like the side jokes and stuff the more i think it can break immersion i want to keep it wholly of our own realm but there will be character voices that i've used in projects that will bleed over into it partially because i like to voice a lot of characters there's going to be a lot of voices that are similar and a lot of voices you've already heard that's a little frustrating i'll do a character and i'll be like yeah let's have a woodsy kind of farmer type i'll do a sort of southern accent like this and everyone's like oh look it's adara from pillars i'm like no all right that's going to happen but generally i try to keep it separate audience thank you all right we've got about ten minutes left so i'm going to try to get through questions pretty quickly i'm probably not going to get through everybody if i miss you i'm so sorry we're going to try question audience honestly it's hard to force a character to be beloved by the players sometimes for a lot of npcs you don't expect them to latch on and they do so there's no real-- gilmore is a perfect example i never expected for it to continue that way but i'm glad they did because he is an amazing character there's no way to engineer it necessarily but as long as you flesh out npcs that have a similar dynamic-- as i said earlier about making your players more three-dimensional and having a series of positive/negative things about them you will comfortably begin to portray them as a dungeon master in a much more realistic way and that will read better if you involve the npc in a scenario where they either save the party or tremendously help them out of a jam they're immediately going to go that guy's awesome we're going to go back to that guy or that lady saved our butt and we're going to go ahead and pull her into this next storyline so that's really helpful or for villains also not every villain is black and white consider a lot of enemies or villains don't see themselves as the villain some of the better ones feel like they're doing it for the right and nobody else understands or it's selfish reasons but for them are good for me bad for many other people thinking about what makes them a three-dimensional villain makes them a very unique and memorable villain remember some of the best villains get away and come back later especially if they're intelligent not everything stays to die not everything is like i'm going to stay until i'm at zero hit points (death groans) so they're like i'm at half health this is not going well peace (poofs) that's frustrating for the party too because then you have the i'll get you audience no worries audience good how you doing audience i hope so too audience thank you very much good color scheme that's a natural 20 on the first roll (applause hollering) whoo i love when the dice work for the narrative (laughs) i was waiting for it like this is going to be a one i know it audience thank you audience that's great audience glad we finally got to put that out there audience i have a very specific playlist i listen to when i'm writing my game it's a soundtrack that is a symphonic version of the chrono trigger soundtrack mixed with symphonic final fantasy vi soundtrack those games played such a role in my youth in my formative creative years that just having those running puts me in the mood to write so i'll put that on the music i've also found that minecraft soundtrack that is now on spotify is actually really good writing music too it's just nice and atmospheric in the background other than that rituals involve making sure that my place is set i know exactly where everything is behind my dm screen i have my dice box here with the dice in there i have my folder here i have the preparation sheets of the session here i have maps to the side i have platforms over here i have a drink here i have a music setup here i have an actual specific layout that to me the ritual is placing everything in place before the game and if i'm running late i don't have time i'm gonna flip out and nobody can talk to me like hey matt can i just like-- (roars) no setting it up i'm scared how i am at those times in hindsight so the setup ritual is for me definitely a ritual audience unfortunately if i do it to one it opens up to chaos here and they have to rush me out here thereafter are you going to be here tomorrow audience well i'll see what i can do it's a slippery slope a lot of people are also in a similar situation i want to do as much as i can but it gets to a certain point to where it's unwieldy audience thank you buddy audience hey buddy audience (laughs) well we spend the whole week rehearsing leading up to it we got like four days we have dress rehearsal on wednesday it's great audience when the players are talking especially to each other that's where you write down notes so when you think up that guy's name is jim all right cool you meet jim you talk about jim and as soon as they're like all right where do we go next just be like (quiet mutter) jim not necessarily writing in the moment if you feel like you need to stay engaged continue to do so and the moment they start talking to each other listen and write a note assuming they do it a lot just be like oh they're talking cool ah yes it's finding the balance of the downtime when they're all focused on you that's when you can go ahead and write your notes audience no worries audience look you think we haven't tried it's interesting this has been a unique experience since we started the show a lot of people are not comfortable streaming their d&d game we've asked a lot of people one of the frustrating things i've had is we've tried to invite a lot of people on from different diverse backgrounds and ethnicities because we're a bunch of white kids who play d&d-- audience yeah it's shitty that in order to bring more diversity into our show i'd have to fire friends from our group and i don't want to do that so our guests are an opportunity to bring more people in but a lot of people i've reached out to about it are like nah i'm good it's a little nerdy for me audience well no but for some people it is and i've noticed that steve very much he's like i don't want to do this online but the more that it's gone and the more that people have been more welcoming in the community it's been more positive it's starting to turn around deborah ann woll who you know from daredevil and stuff we asked her to be a guest two years ago and she said no she said this is a personal thing for me and going on the internet in front of a lot of people to flame me for this i don't want to do it i completely understand and respect that since then she's been like it's actually fun we've hung out a bit she's really cool so i may try and bring her in for a guest in this season so we'll see it's starting to change but it's been a challenge to get people to come in because when you're on the internet you're exposing a lot of yourself in a space that's improvised and very open and very sensitive and the internet isn't always kind we're trying audience no worries thank you i think we have time for one more question i'm so sorry for those who didn't make it i'm so sorry i apologize but i love you all (audience sighing applause) that's awesome hi buddy audience basically how to develop voices for the game audience practice whenever i'm in the shower whenever i'm driving my car whenever i'm by myself for the most part (occasionally when marisha's around) i'll be improvising doing impressions or trying to come up with weird voices and dialects i talk to myself a lot that's a good place to figure things out if you come up with an interesting voice that you've never done before you can pull up your phone and record yourself and you can listen to it later to replicate it the more you practice these different voices the more comfortable you are pulling them out at the drop of a hat also when you write down npcs or you're creating characters for your campaign taking notes of what kind of voice it is is a really good reference point whenever you have to go back to the character you could write low gravelly or high-pitched and reedy or cockney accent or really terrible russian accent things that when you glance at the npc sheet you already have a ballpark idea of where they were before then you can jump into it it comes with experience it comes with listening and repeating and trying to copy other voices out there even if you don't become a good impressionist in the process of trying it you'll find your own unique voices different things you didn't know you could do beforehand recording yourself listening to it practicing and don't be afraid to try them out in the middle of the campaign even if your friends give you shit for it they're your friends it'll be fine [applause] audience you guys are an inspiration to me mic thank you mic you guys are amazing mic
