welcome everyone to a kind of critical role (laughs) critical rejects and/or the delightful return of some interesting characters and some fresh faces you'll see here in a second tonight as part of the extra life charity stream we're going to be running a one-shot game continuing the current crazed adventures of the illustrious vox moronica (laughs) it should be some interesting fun in that regard let's see i don't think we have much else to announce other than we're going for our next goal at 60000 felicia is going to do a rock band concert if we hit 60k tonight i'm vying to maybe be the drummer for that because i'm pretty good at drums and by that i mean i'll destroy them good or bad you'll find out but let's see if we hit 60k felicia will do that it would be awesome you guys have already been fantastic blowing through the goals as we have so we'll see how much this momentum of positive awesomeness we can carry through to the end of the stream tonight and as part of that let's go ahead and bring ourselves into the mood for some critical rejects [dramatic music] fantastic all right and following that up we have in the center over here the illustrious snugglelord if you want to go ahead and give us a rundown of what you're all about fantastic that is our illustrious snugglelord and to his left we have returning the wondrous talented and very forceful personality-- that's ulfgar all righty on the other table we have three-- well characters in a bit we'll get to the introductions when they become part of the story but for now we have three of our talented members of vox machina and the regular critical role crew will be jumping into some new characters tonight that will be unveiled later go ahead and introduce yourselves real fast no just yourselves rocking thank you awesome great introductions all right i do want to talk about the donation aspect of tonight's game or has that already been established and on that note let's go ahead and jump in and begin tonight's game so salty pete actually the snugglelord i believe has a custom miniature is that in the studio at the moment that's okay we'll use this for you in the meantime but-- that's okay you'll only hear about it on twitter so to begin salty pete snugglelord and ulfgar having done some dubious yet strangely publically lauded deeds in the recent months enjoyed a small period of fleeting coin surplus where they drank and gambled away most of their hard-earned bounties this period of hard luck almost seemingly brought on by the mildly antagonistic scoundrel shendo mccree has you nearing doing far dirtier work than you were used to which that'd be quite dirty based on your past history well things you've done in the past involved from what the public knows saving a small village from a poisonous arcane sand golem and some artefact beneath on the outside and not known so well you burned half the village down you nearly threatened to kill the few survivors that were there and took what little bit of gold remained in the pockets of those completely distraught villagers you did you did you're right i take it back however currently ailing from the immediate lack of funds you sit about the raucous alcohol-misted tavern known as verian's beer den drinking what remains from the inside of your coin purses and currently discussing amongst yourselves how the hell to pull yourselves out of this looming debt all right if i could have you guys all roll a perception check real fast go ahead and roll a d20 add your perception skill to the d20 roll snugglelord 19 okay while salty pete is currently staring at the lowly stumps of what used to be his digits on one hand the two of you notice on the far side of the bar a young girl maybe 16 or so rushes into the tavern from the back with a hooded cloak covering most of her features she runs over to the tavern owner behind the bar a rather robust-looking gentleman in his mid-30s big square chin gaston in appearance and a bit of swagger to how he runs this establishment this being the verian character she runs up to him and hands him a piece of parchment talking to him for a bit you can't make out the actual speech and they're too far to make out what the lips are saying but she hands him the parchment and they speak for a bit verian then reaches down and hands her a little bit of gold ulfgar you recognize the amount of gold passed over as you are very tuned in to the presence of gold (laughter) as you approach verian at the bar and say this to him verian looks at you with a quizzical expression and goes well i don't mean to tell you one way or the other but i am first off very confused but mildly blushing at this offer you've given me but strangely enough you walk with those two at the table you were just at i assume yes all right well snuggleface as well come this way it appears i have a notice for the three of you and i would like to share this information yes it's requested right here well that is information that comes with a price in this place understood information is expensive and i paid quite a sum to be the messenger it's the way the work is done my friend go ahead and make a persuasion roll (laughter) he goes a tempting offer based on the knots that have been acquired over many years of hard labor behind this bar but i think as you would respect money talks for what i fail to see despite your somewhat demonic appearance the soft cuddly exterior of the clothing you wear i have not this-- you stare at me with such darkness i am confused by this snugglelord make an intimidation check with disadvantage (laughter) yes roll twice and take the lower (laughter) verian crosses his arms clutching the parchment in his hand and goes hah that was adorable but no seriously 15 gold so is the promises this parchment provides it looks very informative eh go for it with disadvantage it's going to be a hard one as your hand slides across the front of the bar your finger touches the edge of the parchment you wink and point with your-- most fingers in the direction and he glances briefly and as you give a slight tug you feel his meaty hand slap onto your wrist and slowly pull back your hand his glance comes back towards yours meeting your gaze and goes it is now 20 gold my friend suddenly the paper is snatched out from verian's hand the influence of the dark deity somehow pushing fate along this child that shouldn't have even been in this tavern from the get-go is just small enough to stay out of sight runs off going (laughs) clutching the paper in his hand out the back door all right you guys charge out into the night air looking across both sides everyone make a perception check real fast to see if you can ascertain which direction the child went all right ulfgar your keen eyes glance back and forth to the left you can see the small child ducking into a nearby alleyway before disappearing into the shadows you guys continue following and curving in that alleyway and you realize that child while trying to do their best to escape has somehow found themselves cornered in the back of a dead end the child turns real fast (panting) breathing heavily i mean no harm look i need money for my mum to eat and i'll give this to you for five gold it's cheaper than what the man was offering aye aye thank you sir thank you for understanding we were hoping that we could come to a deal on this five gold please the child is slowly backing away further into the alley-- make a persuasion roll i'll say with advantage because you've been the one person nice to this kid since you arrived (laughter) 13 the kid well i'll happily take your rations and the one gold you've got if that's okay i mean you've got one gold that's an easy enough transaction right are you going on an adventure what does 'expendable' mean really all right so i won't talk to the fuzzy one and i'll just talk to you two okay here's your parchment thank you i'm so excited i've always wanted to be an adventurer and he reaches to his side and he pulls out this wooden sword that's moldy and haphazardly constructed and he swings it around hah stephen my name's stephen my brother's named steven and my mom wasn't very original but at least this way we can tell each other apart oh thank you it's a p-h then all right let's go you look over the parchment that you received the actual note the note says seeking the ones called vox moronica i myself am known as the alchemist kioli i have an issue that seems to befit your skillset come to my home the grey brick building at the corner of the town square there i shall be able to present to you perchance a way to make a bit of coin for yourself okay for the money then as you guys continue towards the center of the town square you eventually take a look about and you find the grey brick building on the corner indeed the windows themselves a dim light from the inside the door is closed it looks to be a small relatively unadorned or simple building more for function than visual presentation as you walk up to the edge of the door the door appears to be closed and locked okay roll add your dexterity bonus and your proficiency modifier plus two should be your proficiency modifier with but a swift move of your wrist the door slowly creaks open and you can see the low reddish-orange light from the interior of the room becomes visible immediately as you push the door open and glance inside it is cluttered wall to wall small wooden crates and some broken glass jars that contain dried weeds and other types of plant matter as you peek around the corner you can see there are a number of shelves and tables set up before you that have strange long glass contraptions with small brass wires that wind up along tubes liquids bubble and churn in all sorts of different colors and textures the smell that hits you is this very aggressively iron-like viscous scent that causes your sinuses to immediately expand with this burning sensation across the room you see hunched over a small iron table with big thick leather gloves on a humanoid figure that is currently crouched in the middle of a very very intense-- some sort of a situation such as working or tinkering i'll stay with my uncle pete hi uncle pete okay as you open the door and step into the room you get a better view of the interior i'm going to have you go ahead and roll a stealth check as you step in and look around the rest of the door you see there's actually three other individuals inside this room on the other side of the wall all patiently sitting arm-to-arm as you step in you get about two or three steps before your elbow bumps one of the nearby tables as it hits it a glass jar that's been on the edge topples and falls shattering on the ground instinctively the gentleman who's hunched over at the other table goes who's there and throws something in the air i need you to make a dexterity saving throw (laughter) you take four points of acid damage as suddenly this vial that's spinning in the air shatters on the ground before you filling your space with this horribly caustic liquid it fills your lungs and pocks the outside of your skin and you're coughing it burns the inside he goes oh i'm sorry i'm sorry you spooked me wait what are you doing here that door was locked for a reason intruder intruder um steph-- at which point wait are you vox moronica i recognize you the snuggle one yes i called you here i'm sorry about the vial thing-- good step inside step inside oh interesting usually when i call in the aid of various mercenary groups it takes them a long time to inquire i appear to have two that have arrived at the same time conundrum at which point looks over to the group of the other three who are currently waiting on the side of the room if you guys would like to describe yourselves what's your name again liam kurt all right at this point the poof of cloud smoke slowly disappears as the guild leader has extended the stapler looks over towards the alchemist who invited you and goes oh that's josephine i've known her for quite some time don't worry she-- that's how she gets in and out of the room it's a bit spooky a stapler that's curious have you tinkered this item yourself and she extends it and goes no i just know that whatever you were requiring in these groups was a bit dangerous and i figure they should take this fair enough that's not a language oh no he's just johnny depp as a pirate (laughter) she bamfs out puff of black smoke-- hi i'm his warrior baby well anyway i've called you here for a reason but-- i'm certainly afraid no one's heard no shathrum that's a dark god we don't speak of dark days in the past it rendered whole communities forfeit of their lives i really hope that you're not saying that's what you're looking for all right well down to business then do you have an identify or a detect magic spell okay you take a moment and it is indeed emanating a magical force on it you gather it has some semblance of an abjuration-based spell enchantment you'd have to actually take some time with it to ascertain its nature anyway you've all stumbled loudly into my home you snuck up on me i know and that's fine i have two mercenary parties that are now vying for the same job perhaps it'll be worth it when you hear what the business is about all right now it appears i've lost my assistant i would like to find him checking in on his well-being is what i ask of you discover where he is and bring him back safely if possible it's been-- well we've been working on some sort of planar shifting through alchemy and forgotten lore for a while now and we found a nearby arcane nexus in the east toward the center of the zorla swamp there's a nasty horde of goblins that live out there but we managed to barely sneak past them at the time and we set up a portal anchor at a place underground now our first attempt already proved successful we managed to open a doorway to some unknown location i'm not stupid i'm not going in there so i sent my assistant in with a rope tied around his side off he went he stepped through-- i think so too protects my well-being and what good's an assistant if they're not disposable right so i sent him in he stepped through didn't return for about 30 minutes nearly bringing all 300 feet of rope in with him i know it went taut i pulled him back in and eventually he came back safe and sound little chilled a little confused but fine came back sneaking past the goblins a little bit of a run as they discovered our passage but we made it back fine that evening he recalled a landscape of shifting shapes and earth purples and darkness and forms without form and creatures that drifted between the realms all kinds of interesting things one swam through the air and through him leaving him tickled and unscathed but that's all he recalls he says he only recalls about five minutes of this portal then darkness for a bit but he was in there for a good 30 minutes i think he lost some time in there anyway pulled him back he was fine but he grew a little more distant over the next few nights not really answering my calls as quickly seemed to be lost in thought a lot and eventually in the morning he went missing i used my divinations as limited as they are to discover that he had run off into the swamp by himself beelining for that doorway that we originally found and opened so i count myself lucky on a blue moon and i wish not to endanger myself by going after him myself thus i'm willing to pay 2500 gold pieces to the group who finds him and brings him back 2500 gold pieces i'm going to not actually there's children present to be honest i would prefer you work together because i get the feeling this isn't going to go very far if you don't east to the zorla swamp past the goblin hordes you'll find some sort of a mound with a tunnel in it beneath there is where we found where the planes are weakest and where alchemy allowed us to open that doorway he's probably somewhere within there scattered he does not have the means of opening the portal himself this i know he's probably somewhere lost in that den don't know why try and bring him back safe if you could balium and deswomwom what was the phrase belial and asmodan asmodan write it down asmodeum is what keeps you regular if you're talking voices i want this out of my home get out do this job come back for the money pulls out a parchment and takes an extended 45 minutes to handwrite with a quill an extremely detailed contract making you all wait and then he gets halfway through and goes no no and crumples it up and grabs another piece of paper i messed up this draft too crumples it up (groaning) there you go legally binding no worries get out that door is easy to dam-- with a sparkle of dark innovation you look up and see a star in the sky twinkle a voice behind you goes (victor voice) hi you're the one who's dressed proper where are you off to oh you're nice and soft whoa rubbing your back this crazed old man with bits of dirt and soot all over his face i need a friend i could be your friend then why would you wear this it's so nice to touch my name is victor no no my name is victor as you guys through the moonlight start making your way outside of the actual town towards the outskirts of zorla swamp-- all right the little boy who's following you goes okay don't worry i'll protect you and he pulls out a small wooden sword and is like (fighting noises) a cookie i'd love one right now thank you stephan starts crying as the large scary devil man in the-- he dries the tears from his face and goes okay the closer he gets the slower his walk is and the more the look of trepidation is on his face you can see him struggling with the idea of like i really want this cookie but she is really freaking me out right now thanks grabs the cookie and darts back ten feet and starts chewing it rapidly at which point in the distance you see catching up to you now with heavy breath-- you all move so very fast but you're not too fast for victor to the swamp and he goes running off in front of you as you guys are having this conversation and we'll say going forward preferably don't suggest encounters because that-- yeah that's going to screw me up however as you guys are having this conversation you see victor go charging off into the swamp turn around and go never mind never mind bad idea (screaming) and from behind you see these two dark-armored knights on top of these strange slightly shifting tiger forms come charging out of the darkness of the swamp after you about 25 feet okay as you cast entanglement all these vines go (whipping noises) forming out of the swamp and writhing in the air as they reach out towards the forms they seem to pass through their physicality i need everyone to go ahead and make a history check if you could all of you guys okay you understand that the zorla swamp for as long as it's existed especially during nights of heavy moonlight part of the dark enchantment is it tends to conjure up series of dangerous illusions things that have temporary form at moments it almost has this weird magic where imagination can cause forms to exist for short periods of time they're illusions and can be destroyed or dispelled in certain ways but until then they can prove to be as deadly or dangerous as what you see before you this knowledge hits you as they approach and both of them ride by swinging these giant swords one swinging past you salty pete the second one is going to go for-- (laughing) is going to aim for victor (laughter) first the one swinging towards you salty pete the giant sword that is a 16 to hit what's your armor class you take five points of slashing damage as the sword (whooshes) it hits you and you can see as it approaches to you in that instant its form is shimmering and doesn't seem to have physicality to it yet the impact still feels like a heavy steel blade wings you in the front of the chest you feel a thick bruise beginning to form beneath your armor as the tiger growls rides past you into the grasses behind you the other one swings towards victor who's like (old man yelling) running away-- well towards victor which is the old guy you want to-- okay i'll have you guys roll athletics checks contested this is happening ulfgar grabs snugglelord lifts him up and throws him forward-- at which point you skid to a halt your heels grinding into the wet earth that begins to initiate the formation of the swamp that you guys are traveling towards as you finally come to a stop you see victor go thanks and run past you as the giant semi-illusionary warrior swings at you that's a 23 you take six points of slashing damage as the blade smacks you across the abdomen you can see part of your fuzzy exterior slash open and red begin to slowly pool and darken the material all right everyone roll initiative all right all right well first and foremost salty pete as they turn around and begin riding back for a second ride-by you have your first turn you pull it go ahead and release the arrow towards the first illusionary entity roll for attack 18 does indeed hit go ahead and roll damage on that arrow eight points of damage your arrow arcs across you can see it strike true in the front of the armored goliath knight as it hits it you can see its form disperse for a second attempt to reform and a beam of moonlight comes streaking out of the sky hits it and it immediately disintegrates you can see both it and the tiger's form roll into ash and vanish before your very eyes we had the 20 who was at the 16 it was the highest next i believe the stapler who's clutching the stapler as you're holding it it begins to shake and glow with this weird goldish red energy at that moment as you guys are carrying-- you find though yourself are feeling scared and cowardly thus your inability to this pulls you to immediate initiative i know this pulls you to the front of the initiative order with its magical enchantment i need you to go ahead and roll and add your charisma to this (laughter) did you add your charisma to it the stapler for a second begins to form this large glowing orange orb in the front that all of a sudden releases the blast knocking you off your feet you land prone on the ground as you guys see this giant burning red metallic staple flying across the darkened sky towards the entity however the illusion passes underneath it and it goes disappearing into the distance you finish your turn getting back to your feet next up i believe it was you edna yes all right go ahead magic missile go ahead and roll damage on that one six total damage as edna releases this screaming belial into the night air the missile streaks off into these three silver darts of arcane energy smashing into the sides of this semi-translucent armored goliath you can see its form sparking and shimmering like it's having a hard time keeping physicality in this world but it's still maintaining its position riding forward now towards you since you are the source of its initial anger next up who's the highest initiative go for it quaalude okay so you move over to get between edna and this entity you release thunderwave is it just a saving throw on their part i believe right yeah have your spells ready found it first okay so yeah they have a constitution saving throw what's the dc of your spell it doesn't matter it's a four all right so that's 2d8 damage it says actually you roll that you roll that damage go for it okay so as you rush in front of her you put your hand out in front and slam your fist into the ground as it does this giant light wave of thunderous energy blasts out flattening all the damp grasslands around you and sending the shockwave forward that as it hits and impacts the front of the illusion it casts it into dust as the wave passes over as it rushes just about to strike you with that the thunderwave passes and the entity is destroyed and is no more so as you all stand there clutching your glowing shaking stapler that slowly fades to its mundane-looking self the immediate danger seems to have passed you go over and take it and as the vibration is slowly-- no it's definitely radiating some magical presence essentially once per short rest you can use your action to initiate it and it fires an arcane heated giant staple that does upon impact if you manage to hit does pretty hefty damage of course of course i will sir oh i'm going to smash some skulls in for me dad this many you hear a voice echoing from the distance is it gone (panting) thank you for saving me o great soft one well come on let's continue onward and he goes running into the swamp as the small-- pushing into the swamp proper as you guys continue inward you find about 20 to 25 minutes of walking through the actual swamp sludge is so thick that your boots are getting caught and stuck with each individual step everyone go ahead-- everyone make an athletics check so you guys get about ten minutes in before you realize that edna isn't with you you look behind you and-- in the distance you see her actually physically stuck in the muck of the swamp who's helming the tracking of this group trying to find this cyril this assistant 24 okay as you guys are moving forward you begin to pick up what looks like recently set human tracks that are deeply sunken in and leaving these pools behind in the swamp so you kind of start taking charge and everyone begins to follow the child stephen is kind of following in step next to you excited to kind of see that now there's another leader of the group you however are now being very very closely followed behind with this slightly under-his-breath cackling and muttering soot-covered old man who's like i don't get out often it's nice to see the moon can i touch you again just once more good good i'm still breathing very good keep that up i need a reminder every now and then smell this and he gives you this weird clump of blackish powder that's in his hand he reaches out and puts it in front of your face oh okay i will walk beside you but this this may save your life one day and he shoves it into a pouch at his side in frustration for this conversation snugglelord in anger you all of a sudden just flex and for a moment (poof noise) your little imp familiar appears on your shoulder and just kind of pats you on the side of your head i have a brother --entire time (laughter) of which the imp at this point reaches forward with its smiling young boyish handsome face and whispers into your ear uh snugglelord i'm afraid to let you know your flap is open at this your imp kind of leans in and says my apologies for bothering you master but is this a bad time he waves and nods and kind of smiles quietly at everybody describe him again sorry no pants got it it's like a strange alternate-dimension donald duck this angry yelling by the way has been echoing through the forest and for a split second you cort hear this (whizzing noise) as-- what's your armor class you hear the sound and instinctively push out of the way your hand slaps what looks like some sort of small wooden shaft that just flies past you the rest of you in the middle of this moment look around you and you see starting to crawl out of the nearby trees a bunch of small angry growling humanoid figures going (growling) roll initiative so we have over here snugglelord salty pete all right takes me a minute to set up here guys make sure you have your initiative numbers ready oh wow hold onto that number just for a second we'll say that this is next to snugglelord that's victor and we'll say that this little kobold with the spear is stephen all right so-- okay so 25 to 20 20 to 15 15 to ten ten to five okay double fours all right all right as you see all these goblinoid figures start shuffling out from the sides of the trees nearby and some seem to be laying low in the swamp and some have stealthed up upon you kind of chittering to themselves we'll say they're preparing for another round of either ranged kind of nasty arrows or some of them are pulling out these jagged little bladed elements ulfgar you have the initiative on this round ready for anything as you are both swords out okay the closest to you would probably be the one behind you the one that hit you before all right so you go ahead and move up to it both swords out-- all right go ahead and swing for the first attack 14 okay as you swing with the first one it swings down towards it it manages to catch purchase on the goblin's body armor but the armor seems to streak it off to the side and your sword plunges into the swamp floor with the second one you swing down and this time the goblin actually reaches up and somehow catches the blade in its hand you're like how could a goblin catch a blade and not cut its own hand off and you realize you were swinging it with the flat end for some reason the goblin goes (cackling) and is standing there clutching your blade putting you in a very bad position that will end your turn alongside you though your new son bravely runs up to your side clutching the hammer that you had and says leave my dad alone runs up to the goblin and swings natural 20 (yelling) double the four that's eight points of damage while you're captured your seven-year-old son goes up with the war hammer and the side of the goblin's skull explodes to the side its grip is released as it falls to the ground what was that one what was that i'm excited okay bring it to us when you find it all right no worries chat why are you guys laughing at me deck of many things is a bad thing for you guys so we'll get to that on your turn that's what you'll do on your turn so suddenly you realize-- you feel this strange weight appear in the back pocket of your suit and you-- all right we'll get to you next-- with that that gets us to quaalude you're up you turn into a giant bear-- all right we got a goblin here and two goblins here immediately in your vicinity well this is you this is edna and this is kort and over here you have salty pete who's the pirate dwarf you have snugglelord and you have ulfgar over here roll a claw and a bite go for it what'd you roll to hit four misses yeah 18 does hit go ahead and roll damage for the claw attack the bite you try and snatch up the goblin it manages to move out to the side but you manage to swing your claw wide and manage to catch it in the face seven damage as you swing the claw hits the side of the goblin's face you hear it scream as the claws spear through the side of its jaw and neck leaving open its jugular bleeds out and goes gurgling to the surface of the muddy waters of the swamp by the way you have enough movement to go up to him if you want to okay so you move to there so that goblin you're staring him down he looks very scared watching that you just destroyed his ally okay that ends your turn it is now their turn this one turns here this one rushes into you this one comes up to ulfgar these two both rush into salty pete this one runs in against you actually this one's probably going to come over to victor all right so first we're going with it against you that is going to be a 14 what's your ac as the bear okay that hits you go ahead and take five points of slashing damage as its scimitar streaks across the exterior of your bear hide there's going to be one against you kurt that's not going to hit that's an eight so as it comes towards you you dodge out to the side and knock it away it doesn't even get close enough the one that's coming up behind you-- that's going to be an 11 to hit 11 all right you take five points of slashing damage as it jumps in the air and arcs down with a blade hitting your back the one that's going after victor that hits as you see one of the goblins rushes out with this small spear and jams it into the side of victor the blackpowder merchant who goes (yelps) my kidneys this goblin here still has his bow out he's going to make a bow attack against you salty pete that is a nine against armor class it just breaks off the outside of your armor there are now two of them-- or no sorry there's one that's going after you ulfgar that is a natural 20 you take-- okay eight points of slashing damage as the scimitar manages to hit you extremely hard about the top of your armor you can feel the blade sink in about two inches and hit bone it's not very nice in this part and this last goblin's going towards your son who just bashed the brains out of one of its allies that is going to be an 11 which does hit because he doesn't have any armor on he takes five points of slashing you see the other one come out with its scimitar and hack into the side of your son he screams out in pain you can see there's a big streak of blood down his arm and one of his arms is hanging limply to the side tears welling up in his eyes when he looks at you like dad and with that snugglelord it's your turn in this moment you feel a great boon come down that same star that sparkled in the sky and out of a sudden poof of dark shadow this pillow lands into your arms holding strangely the visage of both you and some other distant hero from another plane of existence you clutch it to yourself knowing that having it will give you a plus-two bonus to your armor class so what are you doing on your turn snugglelord all right the enemy closest to you is aside from you guys-- you're right here there are two enemies right here that are pretty close to you so right there this guy here you mean okay so this one that's currently attacking the blackpowder merchant and stabbed him with the spear okay (laughs) you turn to the one that was firing at salty pete you hex him okay it is currently hexed all right all three of them how many eldritch blasts can you throw at this level right okay so go ahead and roll for an attack against it and add your spell attack which i believe is plus six right eight okay you come around and you focus and your eyes go dark black and there's a burst of smoke energy out the sides as all of a sudden the shadows from the swamp reach up and cling to the body of this goblin it looks down freaking out it is now currently feeling the entwined dark energy of your hex you put your hand out before it and you release a burst of dark arcane energy that goes far too wide and strikes one of the nearby trees the goblin-- the goblin looks at you and goes (cackles) the blackpowder merchant is still holding the spear to the side of him and goes (cackles) you can move if you want it's still your turn you can move and then it'll be the end of your turn misty step's a bonus action you can only move nothing's currently in melee with you so you can move however you want right now okay and with that salty pete it's your turn is there a deck of cards somewhere by the way guys that's usually how this is played that's fine we'll use what you have there so go ahead and hand it to salty pete go ahead and pull three of those you draw three of them yep go ahead so king of diamonds you said you pull out the first card suddenly within your hands it bursts into a golden flame looking into it your eyes spark and the experience of a thousand generations of your family past come coursing into your body you gain 50000 experience points you gain 50000 experience points there you have it banhammer of doom is yours also acquired within your hands-- so go ahead and roll 5d10 and add that to your hit points it'll take a while so we'll just go with it add your hit points you can tell him what happens all right so and the crossbow that's in your hand all of a sudden fires aglow with bluish magical energy it's now considered a +2 magical crossbow so the second card you pulled is what (laughs) all right your intelligence is now permanently five lower you're allowed to draw an additional card if you choose to what's the third one you drew okay if you singlehandedly defeat the next hostile monster you encounter you gain experience points enough to gain another level oh no okay the card disappears in a flicker of fire but you see in your mind suddenly your vision press deep into the nine hells you see a large pit fiend demon all of a sudden glare back and go salty pete you are my quarry and then vanish in flame just as the card did you don't know what happened but you get the feeling something very dangerous is now hunting you no that happened as well deck of many things guys i'm going to right after this battle okay that ends your turn so add your hit points i'll give you the sneak attack bonus that he gets now all of your attacks and skills are also plus two kurt you're up kurt and edna little boy is right here the hammer all of a sudden the edge of it bursts into flames through the sheer force of frustration and anger your accent does not come back but you feel the vengeance for losing it now is coursing through the actual weapon that you hold all right go ahead and roll for the attack 21 hits all right so go ahead and roll the damage for one of your regular weapons and add 1d6 flaming damage to it 12 you walk up and just smash it into the mud the actual flames cause a sizzling sound as it hits the marshy ground what was once a goblin is now a charred and liquefied mess edna what are you going to do you could yes okay it appears just go ahead and roll a d20 and add your intelligence modifier to it to see how you're able to conjure it in the right space above it what'd you roll you rolled a one okay so here's what happens make a dexterity saving throw as you finish your conjuration you go this way and the rock appears right above you four you take-- you take four points of bludgeoning damage as the rock slams down onto your head you can feel your neck jostle and your whole head ringing for a second ulfgar you're up okay that hits go for it yeah okay roll damage on the first one nine points of damage as you bring your first sword down it embeds itself about seven inches into the chest of this small goblin who looks at you twitching its eyes slowly rolling back in its head with a big grin you bring your second blade down and swing it outward it cleaves his torso in two but the inertia pulls outward in the direction of your son go ahead and just roll a d20 18 okay you manage to steel your will enough to stop the blade but an inch from his face the metal sitting there and shimmering with power he looks at you with a moment of sudden confusion and fright quaalude you're up go for it bite/claw attack on him (laughs) this is your attack yeah strength the attack bonus should be with the bear's stat block i've got the monster manual right here if you're a druid-- brown bear there you go plus five to hit so 17 and 12 17 hits so the first attack hits that would be your bite 1d8 plus the strength modifier five points of damage you bite at it with your bite get a big old chunk of its shoulder and tear it off and it screams out in pain the dark blood of the goblin pouring down but it's still standing angrily at you as you swipe your claw at it it ducks back out of the way and it looks at you with this foam at the edge of its mouth so it would be seven total so as it darts back and looks at you growling it's lost way too much blood and tries to make a swipe at you but falls face-first down into the swamp you can feel the gurgling of its final breath pulling out into the water at the top of the marsh it is gone you can still move if you want okay make an intimidation check the goblin catches it in its mouth and starts chewing yeah goblins are a little weird all right that brings it to their turn strangely this fight-- most goblins are very cowardly creatures but you start noticing in these goblins as you're fighting them all of their eyes are clouded over and they're fighting with a fervor and a perpetual anger where they don't even really notice the danger they're in this is uncommon to a species that is generally cowardly by nature the goblin that you just finished chewing looks at you and lashes out at you with its scimitar that is going to be a 20 hits okay you take five points of slashing damage as it arcs its scimitar across your bear form leaving another big streak of slash damage across the front of your body we have the goblin that is hexed it is going to be attacking you salty pete that is going to be a 17 to hit all right so for that you take five points of piercing damage from a shortbow arrow that (impact) into your back okay so you see this arrow sticking out of your ally's back and you suddenly feel like oh no i need to go and help my friend but we'll get to your turn-- we'll get to your turn when we get there all right so the one is going to be attacking the powder merchant it misses you now have-- this one is off on the side it is going to rush up towards the snugglelord now with its scimitar in the air and that's going to be a 14 to hit what's your ac 15 that'll do you hold your pillow out in front of you and the blade arcs off sparks flying almost like the exterior of the pillow is iron for a split-second bringing it to your turn snugglelord chat as this happens you feel this urge to heal your friend you hear this tiny (hoofbeats) and you see this really really small pitch-black unicorn comes up and runs up and just latches itself to the outside of your crotch and forms this protective barrier so it's your turn you're right here this goblin's in front of you you feel the uncontrollable urge to go and help someone who's been wounded recently which would be either edna or salty pete (laughter) so you move to her put you there it's fine the urge makes you move a little bit faster than you normally would you get up to her but the goblin does get one swipe at you as you run by that is a 16 you take five points of slashing damage as the blade streaks across the back of your tiefling form you rush up and hug edna from behind-- go ahead and roll a d8 go ahead and roll a d8 snugglelord marisha and three you heal three points of damage from the warm embrace of the snugglelord and you almost take damage from the piercing of the tiny unicorn horn in the side of your hip salty pete who is now the conan of this adventure it's your-- you have to really be in a situation where you can hide properly which by the way currently the powder merchant is fighting this guy so this guy you could still do some sneak attack damage if you hit it you just want to try and get away from it because if you're attacking with a crossbow you have disadvantage if it's right up next to you right there yeah where do you want to go from there do you want to move-- okay so you move over there so you pull your sword out go ahead and roll for an attack okay that hits go ahead and roll damage plus sneak attack how much damage is that 31 it had seven hit points so as you vanish stealthily into the darkness of the swamp you can see the goblin that's currently harrying the blackpowder merchant victor looks over its shoulder huh as suddenly the blade protrudes from its chest with such force that its ribcage tears open spraying the contents of its torso all over the blackpowder merchant (coughing) good job kurt you're up as you look over to your child in this beam of-- a silver-platinum light comes down from some mystical source you hear the flapping wings of a dragon-- chat you mean ryan copple oh ryco okay well-- and just then ryco appears on the battlefield three-point landing avengers-style looks over and you can see now this beaming platinum light that's on your son coming down is now coming from her as she holds aloft her holy symbol she looks down and goes stephen you shall be the savior of this group at which point you see now his muscles pulse into him and now he looks intensely ripped as bracers now attach themselves he's still seven years old but the scariest-looking seven-year-old you've ever seen all right so kurt all this happens around you the princess winks at yougo fight once-irishman (laughter) there's one there and one here yes all right go ahead and roll an attack that hits go ahead and roll damage as you rush over you take the hammer and smack it into the side of the goblin and it goes just scattered into ash and slowly drifts down across the bottom of the swamp floor edna it's your turn no there's just one over here and one goblin that looks hexed and is currently very outmatched the party is ever growing all right go ahead and roll magic missile damage the goblin which now pulls out a second arrow and is aiming it towards you as it pulls back the three arrows go (swooshing) as each burst of arcane energy slams one into its chest one into its shoulder and the final one slams under the chin causing the front of its head to explode out into a glimmering spray of crimson into the night the current threat disengaged you all look around at the chaos that just ensued and have to take a moment to really digest what has transpired and with that we're going to take a quick five-minute break we'll be right back to continue what the hell this is welcome back ladies and gentlemen to the adventures of vox moronica and all the chaos that ensues all right so here we go so well stephen is now currently a level one monk which is still pretty good for a seven-year-old i'm just saying so you guys as the battle winds down and the initial adrenaline wears off you can see ryco the princess that landed in a three-point stands up and looks over armor glimmering beautiful face long dark hair glances about and gives everyone a look-- huge enormous and glances about the rest of the party and goes you warriors have proven yourselves to delve into this dangerous night and this swamp who do you call leader she approaches you and what purpose do you-- chat so what was the top of that one the accent is back the badger gary reaches out to you and (animal sounds) okay chat as the illusion of the fingers fades you hear in the distance echoing in the dark forest (cackling) you sense some very dark evil is very very near at which point ryco has now approached the de facto leader of the group and says your name and your purpose in this swamp pardon me roll persuasion with advantage as the rays of moonlight come streaking through the tops of the forest this crystalline beautiful moment-- you roll twice you take the higher frames the two of them this male and female form masculine-- chat load those up we still have a couple messages to get to guys ryco glanced down at you and you can see this red flush in her cheeks she goes well you warrior you shall be my champion i accept your hand nevertheless she takes your hand and pulls you up and while you yourself are caught in her eyes she in a very forceful warrior self reaches out takes you by the hand and frenches you deeply in the center of the swamp (whooping) it is now she looks disappointed then smiles and goes well i entrust you are here for worthy reasons now as my future husband i wish you all health and i gift you this and her fingers go out and with a magical array this strange leather girdle appears and hovers in the air this will give magical power to whoever should wear it and a gift of switching their sex to the other side to gain a new beautiful perspective on life who would take this boon i would like the entire party to roll a persuasion check whoever rolls highest-- ryco does this with her fingers and the girdle drifts toward you and goes it is your choice then you decide who takes the girdle at which point she looks over to snugglelord winks and then vanishes in a puff of smoke so you take the girdle do you put it on all right as she puts the girdle on you can see her older elderly woman form shimmers and shifts into instead an elderly hunched-over man with a hook nose and a cleft chin at which point stephen the monk kid and the old blackpowder merchant both together shout-- which i can't shout together because i'm one human being-- look an explosion look an explosion and you guys look off in the distance and see this bright red glow as an almost nuclear-sized red burst comes coasting through the trees as the blast wave comes coursing through the swamp expecting to be turned to dust instead a wave of warmth drifts over you you open your eyes releasing the tension and you and you and you and you are all women you turn back to edna no it's now stephanie as you now seem to have a monk daughter who all of a sudden the muscles rip even heavier as she all of a sudden ascends to level ten to match salty pete because the deity shathrum demanded that this blast of energy also instill the heroic presence within this child who ages four years into the future at the tender age of 11 this daughter now strong korra-style glances up at her mother and goes now i can protect you mom everyone roll a perception check roll a perception check for the love of god roll a perception check all of you both quaaludia-- q and edna glance off and you see in the distance this large mound of swamp earth that seems to be similar to what the alchemist had told you to go ahead and locate where apparently this doorway had been opened all right making your way deeper into the zola swamp toward this mound you begin to recall you've heard mysteries about this zola swamp and you've heard such things as rampant curses the magical energies here are so strong and cross over so with many realms that chaos seems to burst out at periods of time and you feel like this entire group has fallen into a nexus period in which the magical energies uncontrollably alter the landscape around thus the events that have transpired in the recent time as you make your way toward this earthy mound you look about the outside and you can see there are a series of animal limbs and strange crudely carved runes and various skulls that are all hanging by pieces of twine all around the outside of this entranceway that seems to delve into a deep animalistically carved natural tunnel into the swamp floor proper onto it wouldn't be insight per se insight's more of a person's motives you can go ahead and roll a religion check okay what are you looking for nine you're going to be busy for a while all right so glancing about-- --the rooms as you look across them the carvings there are these strange ancient symbols you can see what looks almost like a g and an s these are symbols of the great ancient deity shathrum yeah it is an open tunnel that leads deeper into the earth itself the feminine bravery that seems to have taken root in salty pete you can see the confidence of a modern-day woman taking over what was once a relatively questioning male leads the charge deeper into the swamp earth before you the tunnel dark and moldy from the interior the cold air hitting you-- you can smell mildew and rot and what sounds like wood that has largely fallen into dusty awfulness descending further into the cavern you hear in the distance low muttering this small synchronized cacophonous chant this (whispered incantations) echoing maybe you'd imagine 20 30 feet ahead of you around a bend you can see a little bit of flickering light that's pushing into the hallway from around that turn okay as you shimmer to the side of the rock go ahead and roll a stealth roll with advantage 19 okay you crest around the edge you enter an actual chamber at the end of this hallway closed off and there's a couple of small rocks in the center but in the middle of this you see a large bonfire an orangish-blue flame is flickering and burning you can see stones arranged almost like a haphazard half-fallen doorway you can see what appears to be four goblins around one of which is larger than the others with all this war paint across its face and they're all chanting in unison (chanting) all right you have mage armor on yourself you can see though the lead goblin is throwing things into the flame with each toss the flames flicker up into vibrant blue flames and then die back down the color turning more and more from a blue to a bright vibrant yellow it's pulsing now the fire's pulsing roll stealth salty petunia okay all right so as you come around the bend too you see the druid which is currently hidden across the rock you also have the same view and you can see the danger at this suddenly as you're watching you see the flames flicker in and the goblins all stand up and a tendril spikes out of the flames this small purple door seems to open up and a tentacle reaches out and wraps around a goblin and pulls it in it screams all the goblins keep chanting keep chanting it opens up even further and further and from what you can see now this entity starts pulling through it's this weird fleshy mass almost like this amorphous giant cluster of flesh that is surrounded with teeth and eyes eyes that glance around in all positions mouths that open up and screech and squeal and then disappear it's constantly moving and shifting in its position and as it comes out this weird twisting cacophony of voices of all different shrieking sounds and low guttural murmurs all happening at once (eldritch noises) the goblins smile and look more and more feverish as suddenly it reaches out and grabs another one stuffing it into its maw until eventually only the lead goblin remains as he stands there chanting and chanting and chanting the creature moves forward and slowly envelops and rolls over the goblin you hear this scream as its body is completely consumed as it pulls back you can see almost the goblin's face appear as part of its fleshy mass for a second and then vanish into it you also see a partially absorbed human arm and half of a face that matches the description of the assistant cyril that you were coming to find there it is so i would ask all of you to roll initiative please you're off to the side yes i'm aware you are still stealthed currently as far as you know yes you will all right so initiative rolls everyone we have 25 to 20 20 all right all right 18 for snuggs over there 20 to 15 15 to ten all righty salty ten to five five to one so top kurt you're actually up first and you are back here with the rest of the group in this circumstance all right so as you move forward to get within visual range of it moving past your allies gary appears right in front of you this dice will be your gary badger and you can go ahead and throw the hammer at the entity it is with disadvantage because of the distance it is from you right now so go for it it does it actually lands over here your hammer ends up slamming and streaking across hitting this piece of stone and then arcing off to the side so is that a regular hammer or the magical one all right that's your turn next this creature comes streaming forth (eldritch chanting) okay as it moves forward the ground you can see around it the actual stone floor begins to almost warp and bend like it doesn't have in its near vicinity the same hard physicality as it did before all righty so first it's going to go ahead and start-- it's going to go ahead and reach out with one of its tendrils towards you it has a bunch of these biting mouths on it whips out toward you no this is a 20 to hit it will actually move right up to there that side there so it hits you take 17 points of piercing damage yes and make a strength saving throw 15 the impact of it pushes you back and you almost fall over but you catch yourself and throw the tendril off your body and angrily growl at it in response that ends its turn snuggle you're up at the top of your-- okay yeah you're far enough away okay sorry snugglelord my apologies true snugglelady please kill me please kill me kill me running towards it is that all you wanted to do yeah it has to make an attack at the end of it go ahead and roll the attack for it what'd you roll a four this creature should be easy to hit it is large and it's not moving very fast but the blackpowder merchant has bags of this dark powder attached to it that it carries with it and runs forward and starts trying to punch at it and it's like hitting dough (impacts) no damage whatsoever but it seems to have gotten its attention to some degree so that's the end of your turn do you want to move closer okay that brings us to quaalude quaalina q however you wanted to be here you are go for it first things first roll a wisdom saving throw roll a wisdom saving throw okay oh this is a d8 okay as you transform into the direwolf right there you snarl you hear all the voices in your mind and for a second you feel like you're really confused and you don't know where you are you spend the remainder of your turn trying to shake the voices out of your head you're unable to do anything this turn the chaos of this the mouths speaking in unison drive you temporarily mad salty you're up at the beginning of your turn also make a wisdom saving throw okay as you pull your sword out you're like i'm ready for this you hear the same voices through your mind and once again you start looking about and rubbing your eyes trying to figure out where you are what's happening and you spend the rest of your turn standing there listening to the voices okay all right what's the save on it what's the dc on that spell 13 as a flash of light bursts in the direction of this creature covered with eyes all the eyes close and you hear the yelling becomes more of a shrieking sound and you see it starts writhing around angrily it is currently blinded so well done on that you're way back here do you want to stay where you are do you wish to stay where you are you are right here all right that's your turn edna ulfgar so you move to the side into combat with the creature go ahead and roll for each attack that hits i will ask you to make a wisdom saving throw real fast 16 yeah you hear the voices cascading through your ears as you rush forward however you steel your mind focus on the attack and push through it unaffected go ahead and roll both attacks the second one gets double on the dice plus whatever the damage is of your strength it should be on the-- awesome so a total of 13 damage whack whack you're cutting off parts of its body you can see the slices of flesh that fall off on the ground kind of quiver and squeal before going motionless you see the eyes close and kind of slightly leave open as if a person had just passed away i'm going to keep this on it for blindness so we have it as a reminder all right that ends your turn ulfgar up to the top kurt you're up oh gary goes on your turn as well i'll say in addition to you what'd you roll with your bonuses you have advantage because of your reckless attack with the advantage okay that's still not enough unfortunately all right so you go to try and swing it as you go to swing-- i forgot to make a wisdom save i've got to remember to do that we'll say for the purposes of storyline here as you go to swing the voices come into your head and for a second you stop and slow your arc by the time your hammer actually hits it it goes (soft impact) there's no power behind it gary also is going to rush forward you go ahead and make an attack for gary i know i'm making it up go ahead and roll a 13 that'll hit so go ahead and roll 1d4 plus two damage from the badger's claws so the badger reaches out and grabs the side of it and bites into one of its tendrils as it does it rears back and there's a splash of greenish brackish blood that goes across its face and on the ground all right that ends your turn it's now its turn it is blinded for this turn first it's going to go at-- you see one of its mouths rescinds for a second and then releases this giant globule of dark green goo that slams into the ground and explodes right in the center here i need you two and you two to roll dexterity saving throws yes edna kurt salty pete and snugglelord you will all have to sing in unison-- no you'll just lose five stats chat guys sing along and with that momentous occasion as the spittle hits the ground suddenly it does not explode it's lifted in place and is shattered you feel all of a sudden the warmth of the moderator guildmaster fill all of you and with this divine energy your bodies are suddenly elevated to the strength hardness and experience of a seasoned adventurer so go ahead and roll seven additional of your hit dice to add to what you've got except for you all righty even with disadvantage that is plus 12 for its bite attack this is going to be against you what's your ac 16 so even though you're kind of hearing the voices you see one of the tendrils whip out toward you you smack it to the side with your hammer disabling it and not taking any damage from it it's going to roll to see if it can get rid of the blindness that is a natural 20 so it is no longer blinded that ends the gibbering mouther's turn that brings it to snugglelady (singing) that will destroy the game (normal) so we'll say for the next round of combat you guys have to do-- anything you do or want to do in this combat sing it as if it's a musical when the round's over then it'll stay permanent and you can continue forward so (singing) snugglelord what is your bidding (singing) and with that you heal five hit points from the hug of the snugglelady (singing) quaalude i want you to make a wisdom saving throw it's his direwolf form singing what's your answer sing it (singing) your brain resists the voices you hear your mind is your own tell me what you shall do dear (singing) roll your attacks (singing) double your damage now (singing) as you tear a piece of the creature astray your turn ends victory is yours i say soon next the turn goes to salty pete (singing) the gibbering mouther's immune to prone its mass has no legs it cannot fall over salty pete it's your turn to be moreover (singing) you're close enough where you must make a wisdom saving throw (singing) all right salty pete you make a melee attack randomly determined creature within reach that would be the snugglelady roll an attack against the snugglelady (singing) surprise attack of a 24 against you counts as a sneak attack what's your rogue class i mean are you an assassin or a thief you're a thief okay good good thing you're not an assassin (singing) if you were an assassin that would've been a critical hit as well all right so roll damage against the snugglelord you take 11 damage (singing) 11 damage to the snugglelord snugglelord snugglelord (singing) edna it's your turn (singing) edna has more powerful spells now because you are level ten do not forget (singing) a lightning bolt perhaps (singing) the moment that edna not being familiar with these high-level spells has the instinct to release this energy she's not used before the bolt streaks forth from her hands striking snugglelord kurt the black powder merchant-- (singing) too late (singing) and the gibbering mouther make a reflex saving throw you and you and blackpowder merchant does not make it with a seven what is your damage 8d6 reflex saving throw (singing) you take 28 points of lightning damage (singing) you kurt also roll it (singing) you also take 28 points of lightning damage (singing) it's not over you see because the bolt that you released also hit the blackpowder merchant he failed the saving throw he took almost enough life to take him to zero but it ignited the blackpowder and boom (laughter) (singing) a cacophonous explosion rocks the cavern i need another saving throw from all of you except for edna and your son (singing) it's your dexterity saving throw so add your dex (singing) all right what did you roll (singing) ulfgar what did you roll ulfgar what did you roll (singing) yes roll a dexterity saving throw (singing) all right (singing) yes you do anyone who rolled lower than a ten just took 21 points of fire damage (singing) snugglelord is unconscious and currently dying that brings us to ulfgar (singing) all right so you're attacking with a chromatic orb attack is that what you're doing as an eldritch knight (singing) roll for attack roll for attack (singing) that's all right 11 still hits this monstrosity (singing) so roll your sword's damage plus an additional 3d8 (singing) how do you want to do this (cheering) (singing) how do you want to deal this final blow you've slain the creature describe your epic blow (singing) you release your blasted orb of arcane energy the cold flowing from your fingertips the mouther it skulks it turns and it wails but the cold energy holds it in place you see its flesh begins to freeze it cracks its claws suddenly it freezes in place unable to escape you reach down with your blade and shatter it scatters across the ground victory is yours (air horn) you guys have completed a round of combat successfully the musical the battle is won but go ahead and roll a death saving throw a d20 roll a d20 okay so you're fine you're not bleeding out yet so you guys all sit there and look about yourselves in your sex-changed forms except for edna the snugglelady lies on the ground bleeding out as you heal snugglelord up you look about and you look down the gibberling which has slowly turned to this frozen shattered mass as it begins to thaw over the next few minutes as you take a moment to take care of your wounds and such you see there is the arm and part of the face of the assistant you were seeking there on the ground the assistant you came here to seek there are parts of his body there on the ground oh no there are a couple pieces of the assistant there are many pieces of victor however at this moment you feel a shudder of the room (impacts) you look over your shoulder and you see now coming down the hallway these two giant leathery red hands pulling its way through the hallway as a demonic pit fiend pulls its way down the tunnel behind you and goes where is salty pete it's too fast go ahead and pull a card you are granted the ability to cast the wish spell one time so as you pull the card and look at it you feel suddenly the grace of the gods enter your mind and you see the face of that reika woman who appeared in the forest earlier she goes i grant you the last of my power one wish to save you in this instant choose wisely and the vision is gone you look down in your hand and you see a single pearl pulsating with energy infinite possibilities there in your hand as you see-- i'm going to pull up a picture just so you have an idea of what you're about to face-- standing about 15 or more feet tall this thing coming down the hall (impacts) the pearl vanishes from your hand this cold wind begins to blow throughout the tunnel the pit fiend goes i will destroy-- and turns into what were you asking again (yapping) this little puppy dog now comes up to you and starts gnawing on your ankle it falls limp in your hands as you drop the puppy the pieces of victor begin to shake and slowly pull together as it does the arm and the face of the assistant shake and all of them swirl together to form one horribly mutated blackpowder merchant/cyril the assistant going augh which of you-- help me he's quivering in place with three arms and an additional face attached to it covered in soot it looks at you going what have you done as you make your way back to town carrying this moaning horribly tortured entity right now that's-- making speech itself is a pain-- you make your way back to town this legion of female heroes all level ten you've returned-- yes big knockers you've returned to the alchemist who turns around and goes oh you've returned great i'm glad you could make it where's-- whoa what happened to all of you there's nothing wrong with age have you brought my assistant back as he hobbles in he goes oh three arms that'll be even more useful thank you so much for the extra arm i'll give you a 100-gold bonus he hands you the sack of gold coins both of you guys make dexterity checks right now this is contested dexterity checks with that as ulfgar reaches out no the snugglelady vanishes you hear laughing in the distance running into the night so now we're going to go through and have each of you guys give me the epilogue of what your character's doing post the story just so we can wrap up here so ulfgar snugglelady yes ye olde corona it's an elven wine all right salty pete so after this adventure you imagine yourself on the desert island however you suddenly wake up with a headache and realize shortly after you were hit with the chromatic orb by ulfgar you went unconscious your money's gone and you're left with a heavy bruise and a bit of a sore back end yes that happened beforehand one finger for each sea all right quaaludia
