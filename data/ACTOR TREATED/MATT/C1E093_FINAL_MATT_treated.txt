again noelle for coming and playing this again this week and on that note let's go ahead and dive in to tonight's episode of critical role [dramatic music] i'm sure it was somewhere in there i think you did okay good little else though there you go that was awesome well there you go chain devils period no n-o period just don't however your new dwarven friend transformed into some sort of a lycanthrope werebear taking a greatsword from grog's stash in the bag of holding you gave chase over one of the guardians and keepers of the stronghold killed it and in doing so alerted other members of the stronghold killed them and in doing so alerted other members of the stronghold and grog creeping forward down this hallway revealed a central chamber where betwixt two pools of what appear to be molten glowing blood and sitting upon a throne the corpulent grotesque sweaty slick pit fiend named utugash sits there the terrible toothy grin who speaks telepathically into your mind so what do you bring to me to pleasure and i need you all to roll initiative yeah just like the last one spoke to you kind of yeah all righty folks so given that point 25 to 20 20 to 15 who has what all right so as the pit fiend's still just standing there its arm hanging over the edge of this giant axe it's using propping it it stares at grog it seems to be completely lazy confident and doesn't feel threatened whatsoever by the presence of this goliath that has stepped into its visual range however top of the round vax and vex what do you guys want to do so you guys are right there the only entrance you know of is this one right there that's okay now you know okay you move along on this side the distance between you and utugash would be 25 feet okay that hits trinket into the room or just into the hallway trinket from here would be five ten 15 20 25 30 35 40 trinket has a speed of 40 right trinket can get there you don't know no as long as the enchantment's in the radius it's fine (laughter) you rush in you get there are you waiting for trinket to get there before you throw all right go for your attacks 55 points of damage slick all three hit no it doesn't he's immune okay so you're now hiding against this side of the wall there as trinket runs in into the center of the area as trinket rushes in and rushes up to the side of the pit fiend what are you doing that's doty all right let me check one thing real fast on beastmaster you are technically taking the attack action yourself i'll allow it that's true yeah i'll allow it how it usually works is your action is the attack and then as a bonus action you can give it it's like you're both attacking at the same time you're holding your action but it is still an attack action so i'll allow it go ahead and use it it's fine 21 hits awesome are trinket's attacks magical so trinket gets an attack scrapes the claw gets up there as it runs into the room the claw strikes slashes across the front of the belly of the giant red pit fiend it doesn't do as much damage as you hoped it would it does some damage but not as much as you'd hoped all righty that ends your turn you're holding your action until you have visual on the pit fiend taryon what are you doing okay so for the purposes of this this is now a window here yeah no it's beautifully carved yeah it was like some italian architects designed this beautiful-- perfect so to taryon use your action to rush forward you rip off the patch slam the patch on the side and you watch as the stone suddenly crumbles to dust in that space window is now open in the side of that wall as soon as that happens-- vex go make your attack two against the pit fiend go for it 30 hits go ahead and roll damage yep that's cocked yeah rolled a 20 nice all righty go for it second attack 21 hits all righty so both arrows fire off you watch as the one slams into the side of utugash and the vines wrap around utugash brings one arm up tears them off of his body picks up the axe and hefts it over the shoulder looking back at where the window now exists where once there was none looks over and sees you and taryon through the window you could attempt to make a hide but he was looking directly at you you can move on inside yeah you already used bonus action so yeah you can move out of the way if you want this way or this way towards doty okay so you're going to move on the other side of doty that's going to be your movement there okay cool that is going to bring us to taryon did you want to do anything with doty how big's the window in size he could pull through but it's going to take half his movement to do so and doty runs this way five ten 15 20 25 30 35 doty gets right there just crammed through the hallway and squeezed through and that's going to be where doty stays all right that ends your turn all right at this point now utugash puts one hand up and gives some sort of a marker in the air you're not quite sure what the meaning is or what it's doing you're the only one who really sees it taryon well you see it too grog actually you don't actually he just goes like-- that's it all right keyleth then tova and grog you're on deck so-- taryon is you moosh past taryon blight okay range on blight is 60 feet right 30 feet you're going to have to get closer each square is five feet it's five ten 15-- yeah the big squares are ten so you'd have go through the window to do it okay so you step through you get about there you have ten feet more movement so that'll do it all right so you're not going to have enough movement you'll get up into the window you won't get all the way through that is a 21 what's your dc yeah so takes half damage go ahead and roll damage no you learned as the last battle that pit fiends as do most devils have magic resistance they have advantage on saving throws against spells you figured this information when you researched they seem to have resistance from non-magical weapons from the research you've done yeah you get up partway through the window and that's the extent of where you go all righty tova grog to get over here that would be 30 35 feet would get you right at the front door there you could go through the window you'd lose about ten feet of your movement but you'd be able to get through it you'd probably push her out of it if you carry her through that's going to use part of your actions this turn or you could just barrel through and push her out what're you going to do yeah you can get right up next to him you rush over and go right past now bear and bear side by side keyleth you get knocked out of the window prone all of a sudden this giant werebear (impact noise) just shoulder checks you and you go flying out landing on your face on the heated stone (sizzling noise) ah take three points of fire damage (groaning) currently no your full movement gets you right up next to the pit fiend you have a bonus action too your claws are magical in general okay so you take the sword and chuck it aside for a second and bring out your bear claws and you're going to go for a double strike a 19 to hit 19 misses unfortunately 25 does the first strike goes (scraping sound) scrapes across the front of the belly of the pit fiend no damage sustained chuckles deeply you back up with another strike 14 damage all righty and you can use your bonus action to attack a third time if you want to if it's self-inflicted no all righty so go ahead and roll your crimson rite die which i think is a d8 so you just roll a d8 and you take that much damage there you go so you take one point of damage and as far as the mutual suffering-- all right there you go so you watch as you rush up to it you slash it twice with your claws and as you pick up your sword you put one hand up and as you close your fist you watch as blood pools in the center of your palm and drips out the corners of your fingers as it does you watch the veins on the outside of utugash's stomach pulse for a second and his chuckle goes (groans) like he got a tummy ache all right that ends your turn so that finishes tova turn grog certainly you may you transform into your larger self you may that hits 36 33 damage both hit go ahead and roll damage for each nice so 40 points of damage on the two strikes as you rush up almost diving into the pool you skirt off to the side slam the titanstone gauntlets together and grow to your larger size swirling the axe in the air you go (whoosh) and the second strike in a big x formation across the side of it you see it gashing across the arm and the upper muscles of the shoulder and you see his fingers grip the axe with more anger and frustration right right the hammer okay you may yeah it's a dark dark blackish-purple all righty that ends grog and tova's turn percival okay make a perception check you glance inside and you can see what appear to be piles of goods small chests boxes crates it looks like various things that have been collected and just shoved in this corner and locked up there is a lock on this door through here yeah you have visual you don't have a bonus action we'll say because you moved up and just glanced inside okay the lock okay go for it 27 okay go ahead and roll damage on the lock 16 points of damage the lock blasts off and leaves hanging a small piece of twisted turned metal that once was the top of it the door is now unlocked and open utugash 31 hits okay 8d6 lightning cabal's ruin man vestiges (singsong) at your disposal 23 points okay it's a 29 he had a natural 19 go for it okay nice okay because you blew the lock off and the door's somewhat ajar we'll say you move it open and get partially inside that's as far as you can get all right so you get behind the door and you're ducking in the side there perfect okay at the end of your turn utugash is going to use a legendary action to attack you that is going to be a 16 to hit i think that hits you because you have no armor on so as the giant axe swings towards you that's going to be 23 points of slashing damage with the axe however that does trigger the mutual suffering so he takes 23 points of necrotic damage from the impact as the axe swings and cuts across your bear chest all of sudden where the blood bulged earlier you watch a secondary wound open simultaneously where no weapon was apparently visible and blood begins to just trickle out devil blood and he's going to use as part of his last legendary action and does another maneuver with his finger like that he did this so at the top of the round-- the only people in the room right now keyleth is face-first on the ground i need tova and grog to make perception checks if you could have trinket roll a perception check whatever his perception bonus is trinket doesn't know why but he's like (sniffs) and you watch trinket looking around the room the pit fiend is not alone you don't know where anything else is but while the room appears to be empty trinket is picking up other scents in the room (laughs) sure why not your bear form you speak bear there's something here (laughter) you hear the sound of grinding stone you don't see anything unfortunately the low light in here and your not great perception you don't pick out any visual other than-- a familiar sound to you grog-- as something in the ceiling opens up and suddenly searing hot oil comes spilling from the ceiling down onto both you trinket and tova i need you to make dexterity saves tova trinket and grog nope three all right that is 21 points of fire damage to trinket tova and grog 21 points of fire damage devils have a strange thing called immunity to fire damage they're devils man it's considered fire damage because it's the heat that does it so you take half of that put you at ten so as that's happening as the oil splashes down you guys are tensing from the impact vax you peer around the corner and you hear (creaking) and you look to the other side just as the portcullis has been lifted and you see coming out of the opposite side the chamber is one of the bone devils that you've seen wandering in the street and is pouring from the other side its claws come through it's as wide as the hallway its jaw unhinges its tongue slathering these small flapping insect-like wings across the back of its scapula its claws reach out towards you once he takes the damage the curse is up it's just for one hit but he took 23 free damage which is nice vax he's going to take three attacks on you that is a 27 all right that is a 20 and with the tail that is a 24 okay so the first claw hits you you take 11 points of slashing damage and as the first claw strikes you across the chest the second one you manage to duck right out of the way it slams into the stonework and as you glance up you try and dodge and roll out of the way as the tail scrapes you across the back that is 18 points of piercing damage reduced to six and you would have the possibility of becoming poisoned however you guys are still under the effect of heroes' feast so that does not affect you now it is utugash's turn utugash stands here with the axe and goes the mouth not moving you just hear the voice echoing between your ears it's sourceless and in your face now that we're all gathered around-- there's a flash of red in the eyes and suddenly the ground circling him erupts into flames a wall of fire is now currently circling the vicinity this entire column of 20 foot tall flames encircle him and bursts up singeing grog trinket and tova it's about 25 feet a little bit you can't see through the fire the fire completely obscures your visual of him all you see is flames and you see the vague shadows of tova grog and trinket now currently engulfed in them i need you guys to all roll dexterity saving throws nice all righty everyone but trinket failed 23 points of fire damage to grog and tova so that's 11 to you and trinket trinket takes 11 currently nobody else has visual range you have no vision for percy any ranged attacks you cannot see the creature utugash sits there in the flames surrounding him seemingly not interested in moving at the moment enjoying the current position all righty vow of enmity is in play dance back past doty all righty at the bone devil that hits about 25 feet tall a little four or five foot gap very small 52 points of damage nice as you throw the dagger as the creature watches you dart past it streaks out to try and strike at you but you're already gone as you turn around you throw the dagger it strikes right into the chest of the bone devil as it bursts with this dark grayish-white light indicative of the raven queen's direct impact as it bursts you watch as part of the flesh tears open showing the dark bluish purple sinew and muscle beneath and the devil just (growls) that brings us to vex okay you glance in and you just see fire and the butt of trinket sticking out of the fire yeah just up in the air kicking you can't see it i'll say you have no visual on him you can go ahead and shoot go for it try it disadvantage no he's completely covered okay you watch as you fire your arrow and it disintegrates upon touching the wall of fire the actual shaft burns as it impacts in the flames give it a shot okay so second attack blazing bowstring go ahead and roll with disadvantage 19 you go ahead and fire it isn't consumed by the flames but the arrow you hear exit the other side and then ricochet off the far wall and miss the creature's target all right go for it 26 does hit 15 halve that to seven seven points of slashing damage across through the fire still bravely fighting into it that's a good plan backs up and gets out of the flames backing up against the wall all right where do you want trinket to land by the way over there okay you back out of the way of the window over here okay as trinket backs into that corner i need trinket to go ahead and make a dexterity saving throw a giant cage falls from the ceiling of heated metal and lands on him filled with spikes and (sad bear noises) you hear trinket yell from the other side trinket takes seven points of piercing damage and six points of fire damage from the heated metal and trinket is currently restrained has to try and break free to get out nope utugash is evil there is a definite distinction it's important guys all righty so that ends your turn vex taryon you're up it looks like there is no visible door you'd have to tear it off of him i'd say it's about halfway done this has all happened pretty quickly because as soon as the battle started with the cambion that you guys chased out every round thereafter it's still going so you still have five more rounds of haste okay you jump over the window keyleth breaks your fall yeah and you see a column of flame just flickering and burning in the center of the room occasionally you see a wing tip carve through the top as the creature is moving within the wall of fire double your movement if you wanted to yeah you rush into the flames i need you to roll a dexterity saving throw 30 points of fire damage halved because of that's true there you go so 15 points of fire damage to you taryon as you rush through you're like hah the fire was enough and you sit there and look right up on this massive like swollen devilish entity with giant red leathery wings lower jaw with hooked tusks that stick out the bottom gleaming yellow piercing eyes giant horns that curl up from the brow a giant axe in one hand and the other hand just points at you and goes hi in the center of your head all right go ahead and make the attack well no-- hold on i'm going to pull up your class here just to check it out when you throw it they have to make a saving throw so what's your dc 17 okay and it requires a saving throw because it's the acid it's dexterity okay that is 17 creature must succeed or take-- yeah he resists it entirely yeah sorry so as you throw it it hits the edge of the horn and just shatters and breaks behind it you do have a bonus what you do is you have an extra attack-- as haste you get your action that was your action you have another action to do a melee attack if you want to okay go for it roll for an attack so yeah as hasted you get the additional attack that hits actually go ahead and roll the damage and it is a magical weapon so he's not resistant to it is that fire damage no 13 points of damage against the pit fiend as you stab it and you can cast sanctuary on yourself as your bonus as doty charges forward and rushes in i need doty to make a dexterity saving throw doty takes 30 points of fire damage well because he hurt himself going through the metal outside so doty comes rushing in and goes (impact sound) and just collapses on the ground next to you superheated (sizzling noise) you don't think so he's in the fire yeah no the flames curl around sorry all right so that ends taryon's turn at the end of the turn the pit fiend sticks a hand out of the flames and does this motion make a perception check again grog and tova both you guys 17 okay still not quite noticing anything but you're starting to notice that there are these small inset stone circles on the wall behind him over in this area and you watch as two of them go (stone grinding) and get pressed in by themselves into the wall like something just pressed this giant circular stone button-- separately so vax where you are the floor you hear a (click) like something releasing i need you to make a dexterity saving throw all right go for it 25 is enough the ground suddenly hinges out from under you and you leap up and jam your blades into each side of the wall and put your foot out to the side and it's almost not enough to press into the small space but you just barely catch yourself van damme-style on each side the bone demon across from you its wings flare up as the ground tumbles out from under you you see about ten feet below you a pool of molten iron that is just (burbling) it stays open swinging for a few seconds before it closes once more beneath you one way to find out that brings us to keyleth you stand up and see trinket currently trapped in the cage next to you just whining (sad bear whimpers) all right so you're doing tidal wave right up front there's a little bit of a gap there and doty is on the ground you can step on doty how wide is the tidal wave it's still going to hit somebody there's five feet between taryon and tova and-- towards me so this way okay you're choosing taryon so this way right in order for it to hit the pit fiend it's going to hit either taryon-- no because grog's far off to the side-- if it comes back this way it's just going to hit grog it's going to hit either taryon or it's going to have to hit tova and doty i need tova to make a dexterity saving throw what is it that's not going to work for a spell dc however utugash does not make the save either with a roll of a six plus eight that is a 14 so that's 4d8 bludgeoning damage go ahead and roll that okay okay as is tova correct so the water (whoosh) and the wall of fire in that one section (sputtering fire roaring back to life) unfortunately the enchantment continues to produce flames once the spell disseminates the water the nature of the spell is it perpetually conjures fire so there is a brief moment where it causes a gap and the flames pick up once more he is knocked prone he took damage are you going to move or are you going to stay where you are keyleth you do so you go back there and you can move right back around-- okay that ends keyleth's turn tova grog so you can get up and use half your movement are you under half health so you maintain control half your movement you're still in the flames currently you can take your turn and then back out of the flames if you wanted to with what type of-- your hands feel more comfortable where once was these giant bear claws you watch as mystic ice gathers around them turning into longer razors that extend from your regular claws not to hit but it does an additional 1d8 cold damage per strike that hits you do get advantage because he's prone-- that hits the third attack if you want to use your bonus-- you already used your bonus you only get two both hit roll damage add 2d8 cold damage to that as well because of your crimson rite yeah nice that's a total of 37 points of damage in two strikes do you want to back out of the flames you can get that far out of the way you back up just out of the fire look over and there's another bear chained in that place that ends your turn grog unfortunately because of both of your sizes you cannot advance into the ring he takes up too much space you're either standing right in the middle of the ring and just taking it or you're going to have to back out of it you can try if you want to correct you may that hits that hits yeah ooh all righty 22 points of damage all right you may that's five attacks in one round that hits (high-pitched) yeah he did over a hundred you're staying where you are make your dexterity saving throw 28 points of fire damage reduced to half 14 all right that ends grog's turn percival well ranged attacks against prone creatures have disadvantage naturally and you can't even see him you have no visual range you don't even know that he's prone yeah i was asking if you wanted to do that or not you move out and do not take the last bit of fire damage you take that when you end your turn in the fire how far do you back up just out of the range you step out of it you can glance to the side yeah go for it okay okay cool 23 hits (slams) up against the wall there the portcullis is currently closed as soon as he pushed through it okay 24 hits that is a 16 okay cool sure 16 does not hit unfortunately all right that ends your turn at the end of percival's turn there is a grinding sound above grog i need you to make another dexterity saving throw it gets around your upper torso and sticks partway on and your arms are (click) to the side it tears into you you take 14 points of piercing damage reduced to seven and then six points of fire damage reduced to three you are restrained yep and it's hot (sizzles) as the piercing and the fire damage hits you you are restrained the bone devil's going to fly across and it's actually going to fly over vax and land on the opposite side nope it flies up high enough to be out of your range and then drops down both claws arcing towards you with disadvantage first one's going to be 22 nice 18 with the tail it is 19 all three miss yeah one of the eyes got blasted on the side part of the skull is broken and destroyed at this point in time-- two more devil characters come through the portcullis rises as they pass through and they go into a full run into this chamber you see these red-skinned devil humanoids rush in with these long jagged spears horned crests on their head and from where their chins are there are these writhing tentacles covered in thorns and barbs that move and twist around full movement with the double dash that guy will get there this guy will get about there that's as far as they can get not fully up to anybody yet all right we have utugash stands up in the flames and looks down at taryon darrington you hear the voice echo in the center of your mind good day and good night it's going to make a full round of attacks on you so that is 30 to hit as he leans forward and takes a big chunk with his bite out of the front of your-- tries to get to the helmet and the jaw sticks under the chin that's going to be 24 points of piercing damage however you are immune to poison so you don't have to worry about his poison right now thanks to your-- so the helmet catches most of the brunt of it and one of the teeth jabs you right underneath the jaw and you can feel it pierce and begin to bleed from underneath as soon as he pulls back and shoves you aside and releases its grip as its claw strikes out from its left arm that is a 16 to hit it rolled a two to hit you just manage to duck out of the way as you say 'haha' the axe comes from the other side-- that is a 22 to hit double nines that is 28 points of slashing damage the flames that currently engulf the axe-- the axe has burst into flames he swings with it deals an additional 16 points of fire damage 6d6 and using the momentum of the axe the entire body of the pit fiend spins around the tail whipping towards you that is 20 to hit as the tail swings past that is 28 points of bludgeoning damage the inspiring leader feat utugash stays there in the center of the flames just waiting for people to come to him you don't know you can't see through the fire that brings us to the top vax you're up the guy you're fighting yeah natural 20 plus ten 30 yeah sorry time progressed as it was meant to but good call so vax this way it attacks with the tail still has disadvantage 20 just arcs and misses you as you zoom out that hits 58 nice that was towards the bone devil right that was with the sneak attack damage because-- vow of enmity was on the pit fiend you're right it was you're correct all righty cool that's your single attack that ends your turn vex you come through step through-- as you do trinket zooms into the locket leaving the cage to clank to the ground okay that's your turn next turn you can yup tary yes you guys would all be taking fear aura checks but you're immune to fear because of your heroes' feast just letting you know you only get attacks of opportunity if you move away if you stay within range it doesn't-- until-- you are stepping into the flames to do this you can get right here on the edge and not be quite in the fire unfortunately it does not work that way taryon i am so sorry it does fire and i believe it's just a miss it's a hit-or-miss-type circumstance the ram head goes careening out of the wall of fire slamming into the stone work and causing a big crack in the stone in the wall the pit fiend says i will eat your face first you're still hasted the bonus action you have from haste is for weapon attack only or you can try and run away so he'll get an attack of opportunity on you that ends taryon's turn that brings us to keyleth's turn there's one there right next to grog and one right next to doty so there and there are you gonna move in to try and get them both in the same path sunbeam it is sure roll a stealth check so it's a constitution saving throw for both of the bearded devils okay good to know that is a ten-- -- and an 18 so 6d8 radiant damage to both and they are both blinded to both of them nice as the beam (pssh) across the room it streaks down the way and both of them get engulfed as the beam of bright sunlight energy slowly diminishes their faces are seared you see smoke pouring out of their eyes as they're both reaching up to the sockets that was not so good for them they're both looking pretty rough already you don't see tary you just see a column of fire tary is currently inside the wall of fire curled in a ball all you see is a giant column of flame in the center of the room and half of doty being slowly heated up you see grog with a giant cage on his upper body wrapping around his torso you do see tova yeah hey it helps it all helps trust me it helps all right keyleth are you going to stay where you are all right keyleth stays there tova and grog you're up yes it is your rite stays on until you dismiss it i mean they're pretty warm to touch you know what actually with your claws out i would say they will do no damage to you because the cold will offset that okay yes he's about 25 feet from you you don't even know where he is you know that he's inside the fire but you don't see him because you're outside the flames all you see is a wall of fire you have to step into the fire take the fire damage grab him and pull him back you'll still take the fire damage from the wall of fire unfortunately it's probably not going to work out it's magical fire i'm sorry but the cage is nearby you are closer to the cage than you are him so if you want to grab the cage and move towards him you can do that is that what you want to do you can go ahead and make a strength check you have advantage because you are in your bear form 14 is fine that's enough sorry this would be an athletics check to lift it not strength sorry so you reach over and you grab it and the steam rises up the sides of the cage and you lift it up over your head and you're going to go and try to throw it over at this guy there so as you lift the cage go ahead and roll for just accuracy on this roll an attack add your proficiency what did you roll oh no you throw the cage and it rolls into the center of the hallway there blocking the doorway ah those ones are the worst you still have your movement and your bonus if you wanted to do-- you still have your blood maladict if you wanted to use any of it you do grog what are you doing while she is figuring this out all right go ahead and make a strength skill check yes you do 27 as you tense the metal actually (creaks) and bends out the sides and you just tear the cage off of the top of you that's your action yep you do you have your bonus action if you're still raging so you just see a column of fire you do yeah you do you turn around and he's right there currently with his eyes smoking from being seared with a sunbeam okay he's blinded so you have advantage automatically 30 points of damage as you turn around and see him there you go hi wham he's going (hisses) and hears this hi and his entire head collapses inward and you shove it down to about the height of the rest of his shoulders he just (wet collapsing noises) to the ground and just crumples and then burns into ash and just cinders left behind destroyed that's beautiful is what it is ending grog's turn percival you're up oh yeah that's right what're you going to do with your bonus correct yeah you currently do not have visual range on him you can't see him does it say for the curse that you need to be able to see the creature that's the question let me look so yeah so you just know where they are so you can curse of mutual suffering does hit utugash are you going to amplify it or not amplify it or leave it as it is go ahead and roll your d8 and take d8 damage all righty (laughs) come at me bro (laughter) perfect all righty percival you're up all righty about there sure go for it and take your attacks vax as you're looking across the room you see the bone devil (hisses) and it rears back and the wings span out it looks like he's about to leap and as it takes its jump you watch its face explode forward with dark crimson just mist as the head is blown off of its shoulders there is one creature in here that you can barely see through the side red creatures on dark red sorry 23 hits okay still standing but it's looking rough you have advantage on these attacks by the way because it's blinded yep go ahead and roll damage so after the cage goes flying over his head and clangs behind it it spins around as it hears the impact and turns back in the direction of tova even though its eyes are currently held shut from the blinding light of the sunbeam it rears back with its hooked pull arm and is about to rush towards the torso of tova knowing and being able to sense where she is right as it rears back (gunshots) two shots the second one knocking its head limply across the back of its shoulders and it tumbles to the ground unmoving is that the end of your turn percy (laughs) just getting away from everything ah ah okay perfect okay so this is on utugash's turn utugash is going to strike with a bite against taryon darrington frustratingly that's going to be-- oh it has to make a wisdom save doesn't it for that first attack that's a natural 20 better that than for the attack but after that the first attack was a 18 to hit all righty as it chomps down onto your torso this time as opposed to going for the helmet it goes for the side of the shoulder its mouth is large enough to go over your shoulder and come in both the chest and the back of the shoulder as it sinks in that is going to be 24 points of piercing damage and you're immune to poison so you don't take that you're still standing all righty right as it's clamped down on you it takes its claw and rakes across your stomach it does you're right that is a ten plus ten that is 20 okay the attack roll for that one was a 21 so for the claw raking across your torso that is going to be 21 points of slashing damage and with that taryon falls unconscious and bleeding on the ground utugash after the claws tear across part of the plate armor swings open and the claw rakes through the side of the torso leaving the wounds open and bleeding out and steaming across the heavy heated stonework of the room they do they begin to pulse at this point utugash is going to use his-- the wings take flight at this point as nothing is immediately in the circle and he's getting frustrated by this the wings pick him up in the air he's going to peek through the top of the form and look over and he sees tova and keyleth and is going to land technically on your guys' spaces this is part of his corpulent form ability i need you both to make dexterity saving throws all right you both suffer 17 points of bludgeoning damage as utugash's giant form lands on top of you you are pinned to the ground you are considered grappled and prone as utugash is currently now-- yeah well takes the same 17 points of damage from the mutual suffering so you're both prone and considered grappled you cannot move until you get out of the grapple yeah because he's basically sitting on top of you i need you to make a concentration saving throw to maintain sunbeam you do it's either ten or half of the damage so you're fine with you both pinned-- you at immediate visual perspective look the most vulnerable to utugash as you are a tiny half-elf girl as far as he's concerned he's going to use his next two attacks the axe and the tail with advantage against you because you are currently knocked prone the axe is going to be a 32 to hit 32 to hit 25 points of slashing damage so that's 23 points of slashing damage plus 23 points of fire damage so a total of 46 if you have it prepared yeah which allows you to so you take 11 points of fire damage instead so it does 34 points of damage total no you have beat half of the 34 which would be 17 so you have to beat a 17 your constitution saving throw okay then that's fine you succeed and then the tail's going to slam down onto you as well keyleth with advantage on that 16 natural 20 natural 20 this is the tail it's a nine a ten and a seven on 3d10 so that is-- 62 points of bludgeoning damage well sorry it's 20-- it was 52 points because it was a ten a nine and a seven so it would've been 26 just the dice crit is 52 plus ten 62 62 points do you have a reaction to do no not really you're just like urgh you're being sat on by the pit fiend i mean you're holding it off but his heavy hide against your pincushion-type nails is not going to do much unless you're physically attacking behind it i know and he's resistant to cold sorry vax okay go for it okay 16 does not hit no 19 does not hit either both angry strikes just hit the hide but it's too strong and the devilish scales deflecting the piercing blows okay vex you're up you can it's also sitting currently on tova and keyleth keyleth is looking pretty banged up tova's looking pretty banged up and your brother is hacking at it to no avail okay okay as you back up he does get a reaction attack of opportunity because he has a reach yeah as you back up the tail after smashing at keyleth goes (whoosh) and whips through the window towards you that's going to be a 25 to hit that is 21 points of bludgeoning damage against you the tail almost sends you off your feet almost knocking the wind out of you from the impact to your chest and stomach area but you slide and catch yourself before tumbling backward nope they are not threatening him currently they have to be threatening them to be giving that bonus (laughs) they are currently under his rump the impact from the chest blow ends up as you go to grab the arrow you're already kind of a little off-aim from the the wooziness 23 hits all right so how much damage was that total yeah okay good so the second arrow does hit and you're seeing now utugash while looming over and seemingly impervious at close view as you get a glance backing up is looking pretty hurt previously as it's now your second time battling a pit fiend you're able to see the faint cracks that you're beginning to notice generally show a lot more damage than they do on the surface so you're starting to see signs of wear which based on your previous battle leads you to believe it's actually pretty hurt that ends your turn vax and vex you can yeah okay cool that brings us to taryon i need you to roll a death saving throw you can technically so that's one failed death saving throw on tary yeah it's a bonus action to disengage yeah yeah you'd already moved your hunter's mark unfortunately but going forward you can do that now two imps that were previously invisible in the room and hitting the various buttons across the back wall at his command-- appear and both fly down swinging towards keyleth who's currently pinned underneath and are just going to begin to start attempting to bite at her or these are the stings so with advantage that is six plus five that is 11 the first one the stinger hits you it just can't pierce the armor the second one is going to go ahead and with advantage that is a 13 just can't pierce the armor little imps they're like-- (snarls) and utugash is like ugh hungry carrion wraiths that brings us to keyleth okay go ahead and roll your attack for your fire giant everyone else gets pushed out of the way so yes so tova and the imps get pushed aside as keyleth's form suddenly encompasses most of the corner of the room natural 20 you grab utugash by the throat grab the torso lift him up slam him onto the ground go ahead and roll just the basic damage for the fire elemental's attack it doesn't knock him prone but this is the flavor for the attack look for the attack for the fire giant and underneath that it says yeah just roll the damage for the greatsword the attack is the flavor of the strike how much did you roll 24 that was with the double plus seven yeah so that is 55 points of damage well it's not there yet (groaning) it's fine (laughter) tova grog it's looking really rough by the way all righty all righty so at half movement that's five ten 15 20 you can just get into combat range right there knocking vax over and killing him that hits that hits with the claws you do 2d8 and these are doubled because you did your mark so what did you roll yes so it's 13 and 11 for the actual weapon damage for the claws and then now what did you roll for the first seven together so that's 14 how do you want to do this (cheering) so keyleth in the impressive moment of slamming utugash down the grip you have on the throat is loosened suddenly as a secondary force pushes utugash out of your grip what looks to be a bowling ball of a fur-like bear form goes slamming into the torso of the devil who then falls onto the back as the bear just begins wolverine berserker barraging tearing through the chest and torso cavity of the devil drops the axe and is trying to reach up and is clawing at your back and tearing through flesh you can feel the blood but you're too focused at this point the frenzy kicking in from your transformation and as you stare down and say that into his face utugash's tongue is lolling back across the tusks and says we'll still find you and just goes limp across the ground there are two imps in the chamber but they both turn invisible as soon as this happens and they're attempting to escape as the flame wall disappears and you see taryon bleeding out on the ground next to his superheated-- okay yeah you're close enough to do so okay so how much do you give him ten so you have ten hit points and you come to consciousness i will say keyleth because technically they were in melee range with you since you pushed them out of the way as they vanish you do get one attack of opportunity across them with disadvantage yes you are with disadvantage on just one of them because you only have one reaction that still hits go ahead and roll damage don't roll damage because even if you rolled all ones it's just enough to kill it it has 13 hit points so as they both vanish and you hear the flapping of wings you just do one wide hail mary arc with your fist and just (whoosh) and (squeaking screech) one imp just gets spattered across the back of your knuckles but the other you hear (wings flapping) fly off roll an attack what's your ac the lance ricochets off your chest okay as you glance through the various openings there're a bunch of cells some are empty some contain long-dead rotting corpses the first room that you go into contains a fair amount of gold and it's just stashed-- this small stash here is about 12300 gold pieces you also find your equipment you find your maul and your armor 12300 gold so you have that at your disposal now as you're putting your armor on you open the far door on this end and as you do suddenly bursting through is a lemure (groans) comes towards you with its horrible fleshy mound just reaching out in your direction roll an intimidation check if you want to yes as you say run and you see the whole-- the lemure goes (curious grunt) it's actually just going to reach out and strike at you then the arrow strike comes right after it misses his hand slaps against the front of your armor and (slurping groan) and then roll your attack that hits go ahead and roll damage the arrow (impact noise) through its head and it just immediately falls to the ground the rest of the chambers here you find most of it is a collection of rotting meats you find various sulfurous chemicals some that you can't really by scent and texture identify okay we'll say that you have a handful of chemicals that you may be able to look into later five vials specifically utugash there's the axe that utugash had which is this very very large black metal heated axe even for your giant strength you're like (grunts) he's a very rotund pit fiend and the red scales leathery blubber as it moves around-- there wasn't much that he was carrying on him most pit fiends or at least devilish creatures of his stature don't keep his belongings hidden anywhere on himself they're visible it's roughly twice the size of any axe you've held and is too large for you to use laura and okay okay it's referred to as a black iron axe of corruption it's used primarily as a means of intimidating and scaring off lessers and keeping subordinates in line both it's a minor enchantment the enchantment of it you get the essence as you look at it the power of it was part of the presence of the pit fiend it was an inherent ability so yeah this is not considered a very powerful magical item it was only powerful in the hands of a pit fiend yeah (sizzles) no but the heat of it just naturally being in the space it steams as it goes in you haven't heard the term you weren't given a lot of information most of your presence once you were captured was just being dragged through hallways tortured chained up and then eventually purchased and brought here to be perpetually tortured by utugash until these guys found you and just gives you a big lick on the side of the face no she's a dwarf it's on par with what you ate before yeah okay oh so grog you're taking point okay grog you enter this chamber and it opens up into this candelabra area as you pass this area i need you to make a dexterity saving throw grog 15 you take a few steps and then on one of the stone slabs beneath you a glyph suddenly brightly shines with a strange pinkish-orange glow and then you guys watch as a column of somewhat translucent ethereal energy shoots up engulfing grog you suffer 21 points of psychic damage this is another one of the boiling blood chambers you saw earlier 30 okay as you scan the room you do notice on the inside of each one of these pillars is another one of the similar platforms to the one that grog triggered and the one that he triggered here there are about two in width yeah this whole area here and this area and there's one here and one here and all these can be triggered no but what you do notice-- vax you and vex and keyleth who have the highest passive perception-- you hear from the ceiling above you what sounds like multiple entities landing on the roof not in the interior no from where you are right now you've seen the different types you've seen a couple that have been imps you've seen a few that have been winged humanoid entities you didn't see any of that specifically a hatch from the ceiling in this chamber in here kicks open and about a dozen entities come dropping in some winged others like spined similar bearded devils some of them wearing the golden armor of the whisperers you've seen throughout the city it seems that the guard have been called to the assault on this stronghold okay trinket's in the necklace what's everyone else doing sure yeah okay you turn into an imp you don't create equipment so you would be an imp you'd have to put on gold armor yeah so you'd just be an imp okay so you're remaining as keyleth's half-elf form all right what's everyone else doing it opened here grog was waiting over to the side grog these entities landed near you they just kinda (rumbles) about a dozen of them just swarm into the chamber near you vax you're over here on the side as you're figuring out the traps in this area in the center so they have been kind of behind you in this area you join up with grog here okay we'll say for the purposes of the swarming of entities in this chamber are you guys all going to join you're staying with doty all right percival okay you need workshop materials to do it bone demons an erinyes enters bearded devils cambions a whole swarm comes in here a chain devil lands okay you turn into bone devil form at this point they swarm the room they have their weapons ready they see you guys standing there not making an aggressive maneuver the two bone devils that land within the chamber they seem to be wearing some sort of a sash that has a torn bottom portion of it and some sort of symbol that is holding it together over their shoulder looks around do you resist or do you surrender i will accept this as universal surrender puts his arms up and you watch as a number of these individuals begin pulling heavy chain manacles out from sacks and satchels two of them immediately charge up and begin shackling grog multiple layers of chain and manacles across your arms and legs they shackle you up and begin to spread into the next room coming to the rest of you guys they charge in and begin just throat manacle to arms to ankles each with somewhat slack chains and has a specific lead chain attached to the center of the whole ensemble they go from person to person they throw them on you though you angrily give in to it keyleth as you approach one of them turns to you and goes (speaks infernal) make a deception check with disadvantage leans in real close to you liar the wings (angry fluttering noise) behind it as it points its finger at you a bunch of the devils begin to swarm in from the sides with the various polearms and jagged weapons pointed in your direction reveal thyself shackle her twice over of everyone you and grog both get the hannibal lecter treatment as you're standing there with your spear out they all begin to swarm around you taryon they don't seem to be paying any mind they throw the manacles on you they subdue you very quickly with a swift hit to the back of your shoulders your sense of bravado is immediately crumbled they throw you to the ground and chain you up you are all then chained together and brought to your feet as one of the bone devils approaches you are found in the seeding stages of usurpation of a trusted of dispater and are sentenced to moral reassignment and delivery you are forfeit to mentiri grabs the chains tugs and you guys all begin to be pulled out and then up through the hatch in this chamber through multitudes of devilish arms they are pulling you up through the ceiling you glance over your shoulder and watch as a series of devils have now leapt onto doty and are pulling him apart and that's where we're going to take a break be back after a short break here they're going to show a few ads and then the signal boost episode that marisha just put out we'll continue our story here in just a few minutes guys see you in a moment welcome back hopefully the audio's better for some folks thank you for being patient we have a winner in the wyrmwood contest we had in the chat room alchemistkiller wins this awesome set of zebra wood dice box dice tray and the dice roller so congratulations to you buddy this'll be coming your way soon signed by the cast of critical role now diving back into where we were folks you guys are yanked out onto the streets of the iron city of dis pulled off of the roof of utugash's personal stronghold and yanked across the heated cobblestones having to keep through what strength you have standing for fear of being dragged across the extremely hot floor as you are brought through people begin to gather up on the sides of the street you begin to see other devils gathering towards the edges and every ten minutes of walking when there's a crowd gathered around some of the devils will go ahead and crack one of you in the back of the knee and give off a showing of ownership and a general sense of cheer emerges with each person that gets smacked in the back of the head or thrust down percival you get at one point hit along the side of the jaw and you feel the blood fill the side of your mouth as you wish you could rub it with your hand though the way the chains are pulling prevent you from raising your arm too high you hear the hissing and the occasional rocks being thrown from the distance as you're pulled through vex and vax go ahead and roll perception checks please okay vex as this is happening and you watch percival recoil from the impact you glance with a bit of a sneer towards the crowd and you watch amongst all these various toothy hissing devils you see one familiar red-skinned man with long-ish dark hair horns curled up and as his eyes meet yours he gives you a smile and steps back with the crowd as it closes around him bits of filth are being chucked grog one-- not quite sure what form of refuse this is but it smears and drips down the side of your face and gets stuck in your beard (laughter) make a dexterity check 17 you catch it in your mouth and it is filthy you don't even know what it is you regret the impulse immediately this goes on for about 15 minutes as you guys are pulled through you watch as nearby whisperers begin to stop and perch on the edge of buildings to watch you get the sense that what you guys have done has drawn some attention as you reach the end of this 15-minute period you're pulled down a large road and the buildings begin to grow a little thin in this area you're brought to what looks to be a very very heavy set of doors this crimson gate that is humongous 20 feet by ten feet for each side of the gate so 40 feet across it leans at an angle like a gargantuan cellar door that sits on its own in the center as you begin to approach you hear chains suddenly (metal scraping) the doors slowly open with a creaking noise as you're brought towards it they open and you can see inside it is lightless it is dark the two bone devils tugging further and with each tug the chains that connect you all choke and pull you forward you nearly stumble again as you're brought over the stairway lip and down into this darkened chamber below you are brought down a seemingly endless set of stairs the darkness only occasionally broken by the passing faintly red-glowing sconce that passes by as you're brought down you hear the various mutterings of various infernal phrases being spoken chuckled between the devils that speak in your vicinity you then come to a leveling point the stairs come to an end the light opening up in this area still dim the reddish glow that occasionally gives you a glimpse of the interior this you can only imagine would be what a prison in hell looks like the metal and stone walls are warped and misshapen in places they're almost buckling under the weight of the plane they're holding you can see what looks to be stone arms that are either carved out of the walls or have been jammed into it as part of the decor and you see giant metal hooks that occasionally eject out the side some of them with the remains of some sort of prisoner or meat that has been left to slowly rot more of those small devilish insects you encountered when you first arrived are gathering and feasting on these remnants you begin to hear various echoes of screams from some distant place within this labyrinthine series of hallways that have bounced through enough walls to the point that it's this constant ringing gasp occasionally mixed with this high-pitched whine this wailing and this sound of horrible torture it's very familiar to you tova you have no idea how long you were here before but it seems endless in hindsight it could have been days weeks months you don't recall the air itself is extremely hot stagnant and humid with sweat and has that subterranean putrescense to it the idea that mold and suffering pervade the atmosphere and as you're carted through these hallways you're turned right left forward past multiple intersections more devils pass by you see another erinyes step by with three other minions to her sides she hisses as you walk past you are brought past so many different pathways that it begins to all blend you're trying to pay attention to remember which way you came but sometimes the turns almost go so fast it causes you to lose track of where you originally started you get the essence that not only this is a massive prison but it's designed to keep anyone from finding their way back out you turn one corner as you hear a series of very high-intensity screams that cut through the relative din in the background and as you turn you see three people two humans and one male half-elf that are naked and strung up by chains in front of what looks like a large forge you see there a 12-foot-tall horned devil his wings folded up over his shoulders these giant crested horns off the front of his skull very tim curry legends-style who's currently heating this long brand in the forge as he's glaring at them and as you all walk past his eyes catch yours and he gives you a nod as he sears it in the body of the half-elf who begins to quiver and scream against the chains but he just gives you the rest of the head nod as you pass cross the door not seeing them any further you hear as you leave past the doorway you hear a voice echo from the chamber you just passed i'll see you soon enough you're brought down another twisting series of intersecting halls the smell growing more and more rancid the further in you go you see three chain devils wander past these roving jailers dragging broken bodies behind them in manacles similar to yours you see trails of blood streaking across that are slowly turning dry and thick with caked drying blood some bits turning to mist across the hot stonework of the interior of the prison a twitch of one of the legs reveals that these bodies are still living though by but an inch of their life a few errant chains that drift and drag behind them creepily caress the arm and face of taryon as you pass just across your cheek one of them scratches you with a hook at the tip your weapons have been gathered and they have been taken from you you have your armor on you still your helmet is not currently on you that's been taken off but your weapons have been taken from you because you can't hold your weapons in your chains so further still you're finally brought within this 30 foot by 20 foot room bisected by a series of thick metal bars that open into a cell a single towering chain devil sits within larger than any you've encountered the broad shoulders are almost as wide as grog's and the head is so deeply set within the neck that it almost gives a profile from shoulder to shoulder of a square and it cross-- nice laura and the chains all begin to slacken as you enter and the arms reach out almost in a graceful invitation you hear his horrible voice slither out from the mask of black metal that covers everything but his deep red burning beady eyes good string them up as the devil entourage that has pulled you through this prison brings you into the cell one by one they take your manacles and latch them onto a thick heavy metal chain as they pull it pulls your arms up over your body and your leg manacles are attached to similar rings on the ground one by one you are all placed within this chamber chained up helpless all the rest of the devils that brought you in here exit the cell and leave through the hallway leaving the chain devil to do his duty he approaches the bars as he closes the entranceway to the cell so he's on the other side of the cell from all of you you're just strung up in there and he's pressed up against the bars from the other side his hands clutching as he stares across you his eyes slowly scanning as he moves his hands down the bars the chains go limp and unfurl around parts of his arms and begin to snake and slither across the ground a dozen of them or so slowly creeping like tendrils of living entities towards all of you as he says you seem weary let's loosen your load as the chains begin to snake their way up each of your bodies grog you feel one come up your torso and under the gauntlets and begin to loosen the gauntlets on your arm underneath vex you feel as one curls up spirals around your leg and finds its way under your armor and eventually finds the buckles in the back and begins to undo them all of you find the chains are all beginning to move-- beginning to infiltrate and remove the various bits of equipment you all came into this area on a voice rings out from across the chamber in the darkness it goes krix you are needed by overseer shushot for prisoner enumeration and status at which point the chains stop and the chain devil releases his fingers tense against the bars the chains begin to slack and pull back from your bodies and retract back into the chamber you now see behind him stepping in a small green devil with long knifelike ears a series of long spines across his body similar though a thicker version of the merchant that you saw earlier on your journey here this one carrying the same sash that the bone devils that originally arrived had adorned on their chest it does actually carry a satchel on one side as the jailer pulls the chains back to his body he snarls and turns back to this barbed devil who winces and recoils as soon as the chain devil turns already taking a submissive stance after making his announcement in the chamber the chain devil i do despise such droll work turns back to all the rest of you i will return lovelies the chains retract back into his body and he walks out of the chamber past the barbed devil shoulder-checking it on the way through slips to the side as it leaves you're all still there chained up the green devil waits rubbing its shoulder comes forward sheepishly looking at all of you in silence breathing heavily rubbing its chin takes its satchel and you can see it has this hefty satchel on the side that's filled with a series of side pockets and small openings and it begins to pry them open and it begins to produce each one of your weapons and is pulling them out quickly and throwing them into a pile on the outside of the bars pulls out your packs the various things that were taken from you have all been put within this satchel and is quickly throwing them into a pile on the other side of the bars from all of you throws them all onto the ground finishes in this big mass there unspoiled unharmed now to guide you and the creature walks up to the bars and clutches the sides staring at you you seek hotis yes he is under the ceiling of iskath though iskath is not in mentiri this day you must leave this room turn right left straight straight left straight then right the iron door with the fanged grin bears the mark there lies your quarry now my debt is paid goodbye and the devil turns around and begins to run out of the chamber door with a fanged grin we'll find out we'll find out who got the right one but the devil just leaves laura and you're all still strung up your lockpick was taken with your equipment-- unless you were hiding one you would have to specify the necklace was not taken off you it was just your satchels equipment and your armor trinket emerges (sneezes) thank you trinket goes over to the edge of the bars and leans into them and is marking a claw across the ground and it's about a good foot away from the equipment and you can see that smoke begin to rise five experience to sam riegel you can see that the fur is beginning to send off smoke smoke and burn against the bars as he's leaning against them reaches up and grabs the one around your ankle and tugs and you see it begin to singe the outside of his tongue and he's pulling make a strength check 17 the chain on one of your ankles begins to bend it's not quite-- doesn't fully break but you can see that it's getting some headway make a strength check as well 15 okay between both trinket and you pulling you do manage to get one of the chains to (snapping sound) and you get one ankle free okay okay they're about maybe three and a half feet from the edge of the bars to your equipment you mean sorry there's no keys to the door no there's just a pile of-- so you thorn whip that over you catch it you rummage through the pouch that he usually keeps his equipment in you find the lockpicks that vax usually uses make an investigation check you are because you're strung up you're rummaging through the bag trying to find it you're like i know it's in here somewhere yeah you eventually get both of your arms and ankles undone you go up to your sister she's still looking through the pouch roll for vax-- for vex make a strength check you get her wrists undone grog just pulls his manacles off the ceiling the chain (snapping sound) you break them off your wrists no it's across the way okay so you go over and grab a spare from her pouch you guys begin-- we'll say over the next five minutes or so-- getting everyone undone at this point you pull-- you have the chains still dangling from your wrists the manacles still attached to your titanstone gauntlets but you're free hell chains well you haven't picked up your equipment yet you're going to try and pick the bars that lead into the next chamber okay so go for it add your proficiency bonus and your dexterity 27 you get partway into it and you feel it's moving but it's a very very difficult lock go for a roll 27 again you do so and the lock pick kind of breaks off inside go ahead and roll an attack yes it's your strength modifier right that's 18 to see if you hit so go ahead and roll damage for the purposes of this roll roll 1d4 and add your strength modifier ten double that because siege so it's 20 so with your one-fist punch between the damage you had done to the lock by messing with it and the impact of your fist the lock shatters and the door squeaks open you pull the equipment in you get your rod you get everything situated nope animal shapes you can only do beasts and the creatures that you saw the insects here are technically very very small fiends you've seen rats but they don't do well here because of the heat you've seen bats before you haven't seen bats that reside in this domain that's true i think so yeah okay this is concentration so this will get rid of your shapechange you're not quite certain but it's pushing close to an hour all of you guys turn into bats flapping yup essentially you get-- yeah the equivalent of darkvision you know where you're going all right so a bat swarm suddenly emerges into the hallway which immediately turns right and left which direction do you go okay you turn right and as you guys rush into the corner you watch as the chain devil that originally arrived in the first chamber-- right it's about 15 feet up to the ceiling and you guys come up the chain devil walks beneath and as you guys arc past him he kind of stops and looks over and watches you all go past him and he keeps walking looking very confused all right so you guys continue yes so you go forward for about 60 70 feet or so you see a couple of small imps also fly past and you guys kind of dart around and they all look curiously at these bats that are swarming past them you come to a t intersection now you turned right and then you turn left all right you all shift following vex's pathway left and as you go forward in that direction you watch as another chain devil and two barbed devils similar to the one that came in there and brought your equipment are patrolling down the hall as you guys are approaching i want everyone to roll a stealth check i assumed spell she cast she cast on everybody so everyone gets plus ten dice okay as you guys (fluttering noises) past the barbed devils just keep walking forward the chain devil stops and turns and looks over and sees you all and turns and starts walking in your direction as you guys keep flying you come to a gate that is closed it's solid there is a small opening with some bars that are about that far apart each you guys as bats press through the gate just as-- -- just as the chain devil runs up to try and grab at you as you guys charge through his arms catching the gate and you hear him start yelling and suddenly you start hearing in the distance behind where you were sounds like rapid footprints footfalls apparently people are now aware that you have escaped your cell so you guys continue rushing forward you guys come to another t section you go straight on this one all right you go straight past beneath you you can see there's another one of those blood pools that was in utugash's chamber and there are a couple of grates on each side you can see the grates are corroded with the quick glances as you go past as you continue straight forward you hear more screams from the right and left side the two hallways that you pass just kind of (screaming) echoing past and you just keep pushing forward as best as you can you hear the gate in the distance open so now you know whoever was giving chase they're now starting to pick up behind you you come up to what looks to be a right and left make an investigation check 18 you briefly glance forward as you guys sit here for a second and you begin to hear the distant sound of various infernal yells getting louder and louder something about the wall right in front of you doesn't look right vax just passes straight through it's an illusory wall (yelling) yeah tova's so confused-- as you guys are flying in this new chamber it is pitch black thankfully your vision allows you as best to see tova you start having the recurring memory of the fact that you're not sure where they're going where they're taking you but you still have people in this prison you have no idea where they are and you have no idea where you are currently you would if you weren't a bat i know i know when you're in your normal form you would as bats however it's a little more rough let me check real fast just to be safe here we go let's say swarm of bats that's basically what you guys are all together now you have echolocation so you can you know-- you have keen hearing but that's not going to help you tremendously in this circumstance so yeah there is a sinking feeling that right now either you-- going with them you might leave your friends behind just be aware as you guys push forward into this dark chamber it continues forward and then dips down into a series of stairs takes you to a secondary level below as you guys follow this down for about 45 feet it evens out again and opens up into another t-intersection laura all right you guys go ahead and turn left as you turn right around the corner there waiting you see there is a single bone devil and three flying spined devils these deep blue dark green imp-like devils with these giant spined wings and these long quills sticking out of their body as they carry these spears and you all almost-- you encounter each other at once the spined devils are up in your area and as you kind of flutter past there's no way they didn't see you okay as this is happening the bone devil stops and turns and the spine devils that get caught up in the area two of them are going to instinctively swing at you guys as you move past that is going to be-- there's the spined devil here that is an eight i think it does actually the worst possible-- a bat has an ac of 12 one hit point each of you the other one is going to swing same roll two sixes in a row (cheering) so both of them miss as you guys continue pushing forward past these-- however the full speed of a bat if i remember-- is it 30-foot speed correct the spine devils are a little faster than you guys and they're gaining on you as you move past they get their attack swings but you guys do double dash so they're behind you and now they're all starting to slowly gain as they're pushing forward and pushing forward you come to another t-intersection you go straight okay as you go straight forward it kind of curves a little bit to the right and then continues forward the spine devils are just starting to catch up to you guys and two of them go ahead and-- let's see what attacks they have here they're both going to fire tail spines at you their tail curves up behind and swings and they fire these spines forward there's three of them so one of them's going to be at grog one's going to be at vax and one's going to be at percy against grog that is a two plus four these guys can't hit anything six just zooms past you one towards vax that's cocked natural 20 (groaning) even basic damage both of your bat forms (boof) and you both fall about ten feet yeah they both hit-- spines hit you you both take-- bat's ac which is 12 so that's six-- so you take five points of damage vax to your main form and percival you take four points of damage to your main form oh plus one point of fire damage and two points of fire damage you still take one all right so the rest of you are bats both of you plummet hit the ground and the spine devils approach so now we have vax and-- vax and percival are back this way i'm going to say that these guys represent you as bats we'll say that taryon is one keyleth is two tova is three vex is four and grog is five all right so we'll use these for spine devils for now well actually they're pretty small so we'll use these so these are the spine devils right here and you see a bone devil coming up in the distance so i need everyone to roll initiative all right so that brings us to-- 25 to 20 jesus percival so 30 20 25 nice okay still good 20 to 15 all right 15 to ten all right ten to five nice so now in these forms if it looks like it-- you do but you attack as a bat yup percival you just plummeted to the ground actually both you and vax from the fall since you were 15 feet up you both took two points of bludgeoning damage and five points of bludgeoning damage vax all right it's a blood pit okay all right that ends percy's turn tova the magic keeps you-- technically you are not a dwarf you are not a blood hunter you lost the abilities of your class while you are currently a bat so currently you just have bat capabilities you could move and then hold your action if you were to change forms it's up to you kind of what percy did all right so you'll hang there all right grog okay so you'll just kind of stay over in this area all right so these three spine devils who just hit the other-- this one here is going to rush over to this side is going to fire this is going to be at tova it's going to fire its tail spine that is an eight i keep rolling sixes to hit misses no effect these two other spine devils here are going to-- there we go they're going to come forward and do a multi-attack on vax both of them are just going to pincer up this way one with its bite and one with its fork actually technically it gets to use two tail spines it's going to make a second strike at you tova that is an 11 misses still bat ac is 12 so you're actually like (whoosh) you dodge out of the way and that is a seven and a 21 21 hit you it just that's what i thought so you take five points of piercing damage all right you take two points of piercing damage the other one is going to attack you again twice as well that's a four and an 11 nope ending their turn now the bone devil is going to catch up flies in its wings expanding forward it's going to go ahead and make three attacks against you vax since you're the closest one to it that is ten 20 and 20 two twelves in a row you just (whoosh) dodging out of the way being crazy rogue evading that brings us now to keyleth yeah as an action you can change your form which is an action yeah it says here on a subsequent action you can use your actions to transform affected creatures into new forms so yeah i don't see why you couldn't who else is going to turn into bats okay all right and so you're just going to do that it's your turn you going to move okay is that your turn keyleth vex your turn you can't hold your movement you can only hold an action you can hold a dash action you have your action as a bat you can dash still if you want to disengage is an action so you could anybody can disengage as an action it's just a combat action you just can't do anything else the only thing you can do is move with your speed after that all right so you disengage okay 30 feet five ten 15 20 25 30 that's where you get which way is the right you guys moved in this way so this way okay so using your dash action-- all right so that ends vex's turn there taryon and you are off the page over that way you can yeah all right so that's-- that brings us to percy five ten 30 and you also with a double move get to there okay next up is tova you just keep going all right so you catch up with these guys here way off the map all righty grog (gibberish) all righty with that the spine devils are going to move forward that is percy oh i'm sorry it's keyleth yeah because i have one-two but you guys both transformed yep so you get swarmed by three spined devils not in this form attacks against you yep that's an 18 keyleth you take six points of slashing damage your bat form is gone you drop that you become keyleth again and you take five points of damage carried over then it's going to get its tail attack against you it's going to miss the other one's going to bite miss tail attack is going to be a 17 what's your ac so you take six points of piercing damage the last one's going to get its last two attacks on you that is a 21 and a natural one so the last attack you get is four points of slashing damage and i need you to go ahead and make three concentration checks it's got to beat ten each time yes your constitution saving throw that's enough so you maintain concentration on the spell the bone devil flies up and is now going after keyleth with all of its might nope you didn't have time three attacks that is going to be an 18 for its claw second claw that's a 27 and the sting is a 25 so all three hit you so you take nine points of slashing damage concentration check all right that is 12 points of slashing damage keyleth falls unconscious and the tail strikes you auto crit you lose two death saving throws (yelling) all of you drop form so four would be vex aw man where did my vex model go i think i may actually have left you on the other map that's okay i'll be fine for this one i'll use the erinyes for you that's fine that's you you're welcome percival vax taryon tova end of their turn keyleth it's your turn you're next in the initiative order was it the intentional roll what did you roll okay still bleeding out man losing that plane shift that would've been campaign over okay well i don't know i'm so nervous right now oh my god okay all right sam campaign resumes you guys have a spreading urgency of the entire prison of mentiri now bearing down on escaped mortal criminals without plane shift if that doesn't work you heal 27 points keyleth your movement whereabouts i'll say just instinctually you pop him out about there all right yeah all right vax it's your turn all right (gurgles) (laughter) you didn't realize until the last moment and was like oh if keyleth goes down it's been roughly an hour a little over an hour it has to be after an attack yeah so taryon you're about-- with 30-foot movement you can get within range where you can see any of the creatures okay you'll get there yeah you have these three little spine devils that are like flying imps covered in spines that are relatively small and you have one big bone devil-- that was the one that just almost killed keyleth at which one that's the bone devil all right dex save that is a 14 what's your dc so yeah go ahead and roll damage 25 points of acid damage to the bone devil so as the vial breaks across the front of its body you can see the acid burn its flesh it curls into itself you can see the smoke rising off of it as its flesh is beginning to burn and melt away nice that's your turn oh shit oh taryon all right percy you're up yep you got them the spine devils you mean okay so there's three spine devils and one bone devil so two spine devils and one bone devil yes three spine devils and one bone devil he's the dangerous-looking one all right yeah you hit so 20 damage he pushes back just that far but he hits the wall he can't get pushed back further still right there he's already up against the wall that hits roll damage you scatter one of the spine devils with one shot blasts apart go for it 29 hits okay still standing all right hits this is against the second spine devil yeah he scatters these shots are (gunshots) echoing through the hall everyone who is ever searching for anything knows exactly where to go now okay still standing but looking rough 24 yep the third spine devil's upper torso is disintegrated by the blast its wings flick off to its sides spattering part of the bone devil that was already three attacks that was three more attacks yeah you killed the second one and then shot twice to kill a third one so you're out of attacks all righty at this point you guys can hear distant yelling getting louder and louder down the hallway where you came from you hear the voices echoing and swarming and people are starting to get closer knowing where you are tova you're up there's just the one bone devil left 45 you can get about there you're about ten 15 feet from him ten feet currently it's vax the half-elf rogue guy you could yeah because you haven't had a short rest so you don't have your blood curses back yeah okay so you're just going to hold your action just in case it comes near okay sounds good grog 50 feet puts you standing over keyleth pretty much you are in melee distance you do have a point of exhaustion by the way 29 hits 24 points of damage all righty well did you double the dice right so you did the first one-- okay so the total was 34 all righty great so those are your two attacks all right that brings us to the bone devil's turn yeah he's still alive and seeing everybody rush in and help this wounded creature on the ground-- okay you sure two mutual suffering and you did your mark it's all good all right so it's going to go ahead-- actually no let me roll to see which way it goes okay yeah it's not that intelligent so intelligence check you being the immediate threat it turns attention towards you as opposed to keyleth who's currently on the ground as you're the biggest threat to it at the moment it's going to go ahead and make three strikes at you that is 16 16 17 ah finally eight eight nine (laughs) all right that is 16 points of piercing damage and no poison because you are immune all right that ends its turn and it's going to shift over flying over onto this way the coasting in the center there and getting over keyleth getting closer to the blood pool-- retaliation yes you can as a reaction you can yeah that hits 24 points of damage as it flies over you through the air you arc in the direction with your hammer and as you do it breaks its entire ribcage inward you hear the shattering of bones and it gives out this wheeze as you follow through and slam it back down where it was standing you guys hear voices now coming from the other sides as well okay there have been a handful yeah they've been the cambion the guy you met earlier with the red skin who made the deal with percival the chain devil spoke common the chain devil did all righty as you pull the scroll out and you watch the scroll burst into flame as you finish the incantation you watch as out of the blood pool rising this chain devil looking real material steps up and walks over to the bodies and sits there looking over them waiting for someone to trigger okay you start flower girling your way get this map out if we can okay so you guys continue to the right thank you and bring the last one in you guys head down this hallway for about another hundred feet hearing the shouts behind you hear conversation different languages happening they're getting a little more distant you're catching some ground here and it's going well eventually you make your way-- you guys make your way down to the end of this chamber and you see three different doors that are all closed off to the front to the right and the left as you're making your investigation check you hear what sounds like the writhing of chains and the pulling of heavy metal grinding as you begin to look and inspect the doors real fast you glance up and the entire ceiling is a sea of rolling chains all gathering and then from the ceiling bursts down in the center of the chamber-- (yelling) all right everyone roll initiative it's almost 20 feet tall and when it slams the ground it's hunched forward if it were standing upright it would scrape the ceiling a little bit under fire giant size but you watch the chains from the ceiling are still attached to it it's like the whole ceiling and upper portion of this chamber is made of chains that are feeding it 25 to 20 24 tova and what did you roll for your investigation check earlier 22 this doorway the first one you checked does not seem to have-- the symbol on it appears to be some sort of infernal symbol that you don't recognize all right 20 to 15 15 to ten taryon all right vex you're up first which one of these are you checking which one of these doors are you checking make an investigation check 23 you go and look up and this one has a symbol that looks like a half-moon that is broken and is bleeding into a pool below it it's a crescent half-moon that looks like it's broken in the middle this one and this one have been inspected so that's your movement to get up there and your action to look thoroughly and look at the symbol in the low light you have a bonus still you have nowhere to hide from you have nothing obscuring not really okay trinket appears out of your necklace yeah but you may have pulled him back in it's fine all right i'll go with it hunter's mark on the chain golem tova your turn okay sure make a perception check as you're rushing in with advantage 23 the chambers seem to have various scents that kind of mix in this area the one on the far end has this ancient dusty decay smell to it the one on the opposite side of the chamber has a weirdly iron rusty old metal scent and the doorway that you're at right now has a very strong scent of sulfur make an investigation check you knock the dust from the side and as you inspect closely hearing the chains grinding and spinning around you and occasionally you duck because you see one kind of whip across and break part of the stone and cause chunks of it to fly off you look down and you see two small eyes and one deep toothy grin well as a note just remember this it took you a while to get there because the chains that were rolling around it are entangling and wrapping around the area so you were at half movement which got you just to there i forgot to mention that earlier however the chains in the process are crushing and doing damage as you move through them six points of bludgeoning damage to you as you pull your way through the chains getting to that area all right that ends tova's turn it is now the chain golem's turn your action was to do the investigation you have your bonus if you have something to spend it with sure and bear form (sings) and bear form there is your bear form all righty so ending tova's turn it is now the golem's turn the golem has a ten-foot range on its slam it's going to do two slam attacks it's going to reach out and slam once at percy who is within its front range there after landing and keyleth who's immediately to its left a physical slam attack a giant battering-ram of heavy thick chains are going to punch out towards percival the fist swings and almost merges with the rest of the body as a second arm forms where it was and then backfists into keyleth like its form shifts with the chains that move around within its body and its form is ever-changing and shifting like a giant amoeba of moving metal the first attack towards percival that is 27 to hit all right you suffer 22 points of bludgeoning damage and against keyleth that is a 25 to hit keyleth you take 21 points of bludgeoning damage actually sanctuary is on has to make a wisdom saving throw before it can do that which it fails you take no damage (cheering) so as it goes to strike you the second fist appears and then seems to dwindle and fall to the ground and it forms again in the spot where it was you watch as multiple arms are now forming and coming out of it at different places it's going to back up as it does so its eyes shift these two red beady points of light that form its eyes kind of shift to the back of its head and now you see they're almost moving around and it's keeping a visual range of everything in the room no it was not in your combat range it had reach unfortunately that ends its turn keyleth you're up everyone but vex and trinket are in a 30-foot radius yep so 3d8 plus six go for it percy you're up next six so 23 23 points of healing so mark that in guys that's your action backing this way or this way this way if you move one more he's going to get attack of opportunity on you because you're within melee range of him right now you want to risk it or not okay okay so you back up it takes a swing at you with its chain slam that is 26 to hit you take-- 30 points of bludgeoning damage taliesin and sanctuary thank you for reminding me that is a 14 what's your dc 17 yeah spell dc 17 it goes to swing again towards you as a reaction and the magic prevents it from actually hitting its mark and the chains retract back into its body so no damage is sustained that's true all right so instead-- no that's good it'll go to tova and vax for the two attacks that he got sanctuary earlier so to vax that is a 31 so you take the 30 points of damage instead against tova that is a natural one natural one to hit you so it actually slams into the door above i'll make a strength check now the door cracks and it partially gets pushed inward somehow the chain golem actually helped you out that's interesting all right that ends its turn keyleth you're up no sorry that was keyleth's turn percy you're up you are currently just out of its range oh this way it doesn't look like it's feeding it more than just the chains are keeping it attached to the walls the mass of the chains are still in its chest it has some sort of two glowing light sources within the mass of chains that form where its head would be-- you can try it you're up next grog 32 hits okay it does not actually because it's not affected by that effect its eyes can shift throughout its body nope yeah even with its spell advantage against all those sanctuary saves it just doesn't have a very high wisdom so it just cannot make it two more go for it shot one you have two more hits nice 32 all righty last attack 14 okay 14 does not hit sorry thought that was the damage sorry yeah all right keyleth by the way as you were moving through the chains-- i forgot to mention earlier as the tangling chains around it you did suffer five points of bludgeoning damage as the chains are just swirling around and the aura and the area of its vicinity just shreds like a slow-moving grinder you're still in there grog you're up right there all right go for it roll an attack 23 hits just roll damage for your hammer 25 damage becomes 50 because of siege the door is absolutely sundered and comes off oh god as the door blows open you glance inside you can see within the walls are covered in pulse-y fleshy muscle-like substance with these long stretched tendons and pieces of sinew that all gather to the center and you see this shifting larval egg and within you can see a small humanoid figure that is swirling and writhing within it seems like it's in this perpetual state of agony screaming quietly within this weird fleshy egg sac and you can see the features of a tiger-like face and fangs writhing inside okay as you step forward the chain golem already used its reaction so it cannot you just walk forward make an attack roll damage (impact noise) it just (explosion) spattered across the ground what was once shifting is now a fine red cream as the true form of hotis partially returned is now scattered across the steaming pavement of the depths of the mentiri prison the devil is no more you are free from the curse (cheering) that was you because of the chains wrapping around you-- which by the way did five points of bludgeoning damage to you it takes you half movement to move through that space so that's five ten 15 20 25 30 so you can move two more squares all right that'll get you about there and that's as far as you can get the chains are tangling you up and preventing you from moving quickly ending grog's turn taryon okay so you step in next to her over the grate as tova vanishes in the moment and is this slight ripple in the air there is where you are tova's form vanishes invisibility lasts an hour all righty vex okay ten 15 20 25 30 35 that's as far as you can get right there make a double dash all right 25 30 that's as far as you get and you take eight points of bludgeoning damage from the chains that are whipping around you and wrapping around your legs and tying you up as you're reaching forward it's like this swamp of grinding metal that ends your turn tova you're invisible if you do any attacks you lose invisibility so either you're going with them or you're retreating into the prison for better or for worse 35 40 you get right up next to her right there she's light enough you lift her up and you make a dash action to bring her over for half speed 15 20 you get her just there within range of keyleth you take five points of bludgeoning damage reduced to half because you're in your bear form so you take two points of bludgeoning damage the golem's turn now the golem is going to make a chain prison attack yes it's going to-- let's see here it's going to get percy keyleth and taryon i need you guys to all make dexterity saving throws 20 that's exactly what you needed percy okay 17 so everyone else you guys both manage to break free percy you are restrained as the chains swirl up and wrap around your legs and torso and you find yourself bound in place keyleth your turn you're going to begin casting the spell and holding the release of it until at the start of your turn you take nine points of bludgeoning damage from the chains that are swirling around you so 2nd-level healing word 1st-level so seven plus six 13 you heal 13 and you begin casting plane shift you pull out of your side satchel the tuning fork that you have attuned to where where are you going to be casting this towards what location are you shifting towards keyleth as you begin the spell focusing on whitestone in exandria you begin to cast the incantation you see the power in her hands begins to glow but she's holding it back she's concentrating hard all right ending your turn keyleth percival what are you doing all right go ahead and make a strength check strength check 14 you can't break the chains they're too strong yeah because you get two now at this level can't break free the chains are holding you in place ending your turn grog you're up all right at the start of your turn grog you take seven points of bludgeoning damage from the swirling chains reduced to three so that's five ten 15 20 25 30 what's that 50 you get right there no taryon is right here everyone would need to shift one more in that direction or someone can plug that hole that's true you can just barely with the chains that are around you-- which by the way vax you take eight points of bludgeoning damage you can just get up to put the ring into tova's hand and that's as far as you can get you can actually 25 30 you're not quite there well you dashed with your bonus so yeah you feel for her that's your turn all right that brings us to vex well technically taryon yeah you can use your action to try and pull him over yeah you do take seven points of bludgeoning damage from the chains you pull him into the space everyone grabs hands you see tova's form appear briefly as she puts the ring on and then vanishes once more you see the rest of them grab arms together keyleth you finish the spell plane shift you can see the chain golem swelling as the chains are feeding it it's growing larger in the chambers its red eyes getting brighter and brighter as you all clasp hands together the light flashes a bright whitish-green there's a high-pitched whine just as you hear devils rushing in from across the hallway (whoosh) silence and that's where we'll pick up next week (groaning) holy shit thank you guys oh shit let's just hope tova doesn't come across another pit fiend because they can see through invisibility there are devils that can see through invisibility i'm sure you'll be fine it'll be great that was awesome guys it was
