to give you guys a heads up we've wanted to get some confirmation to you guys about the episode releases after the live show because we have a lot of people who watch the show who can't watch it live -- archives immediately however -- -- volume so you can look forward to episodes up on the geek & sundry website every monday that's the scenario so so for those of us who -- they were sent to retrieve a paladin named lady kima of vord who was on a vision quest to stop some dark evil that her deity bahamut told her was existing beneath this mountain range and needed to be squelched they managed to convince to help them as well fought their way through the tunnels past the duergar army eventually to the underground mindflayer colony of yogg voril where they found that this entity called k'varn this was then eventually revealed to be a mad beholder k'varn who had been pseudo possessed and given additional power by the horn of orcus a great and evil artifact long forgotten which had been found by this entity so they managed to make their way into the temple kill k'varn tear the horn from it's forehead however found themselves swarmed immediately by an entire colony of mind flayers heading toward the top of this temple they managed to battle and battle nearly losing a few party members and through some ingenuity escape through the top glide over the city of yogg voril through this underground chasm to a distant embankment along the beachside of this underground lake and teleport their way back to their base city of emon so they've come back to emon they've come to their keep greyskull keep and they've had an evening of rest upon waking the next morning they've managed to get some breakfast they've freed lady kima from her stone entrapment as she was turned to stone during the battle with the beholder and had a conversation based around what should or could be done about this horn of orcus evil artifact so here we will pick up again from that point so the rest of you guys have eaten your meal kima hungrily doing so all of you guys both sore and exhausted having barely seen sunlight for a little over a week and being probably the first or second good meal you've had since leaving kraghammer proper you all finish your food grog hungrily so double the size of his normal intake of delicious meats and starches tiberius has not seemed to have woken up or found his way down from his room as of yet however you guys did recently receive a rolled up piece of parchment a notification from the council of tal’dorei saying that you have been requested to the council chambers at some point this afternoon around the mid-day sun to discuss your return and the situation and conditions about it and that was all it said she's unstoned you've already had the conversation with her last week talking about the horn basically interrogating her you were playing coy with it but you -- yes grog returned with it and you guys had the conversation basically saying ‘oh it's safe don't worry it's fine’ grog at which currently has it in the bag of holding no you just said you have it somewhere safe correct turn them up a little bit oh i see yes this is the new attempt at technology with our out-of-towners yes you have received it and you've inspected it he's going to crawl under the table there you have it as a couple hours have passed -- you've just now come down after many hours of breakfast have passed it's now pushing around 1100 in the afternoon comparatively and tiberius comes storming into the main dining hall of your keep no you just stayed in your room and did it on your own scanlan is currently in the room eating breakfast yeah scanlan looks to you and thinks for a second and goes he cracks his fingers expectantly all right can you guys hear us fine just making sure feel free to chime in whenever that's our grog as our wonderful giant now filled with various forms of delicious food matter warm in his belly gives a string of various curse words in enjoyment and sits up from the table with a loud fart and you guys make your way out of greyskull keep lady kima is with you yes is there anything else you want to do or are you guys making a beeline for the palace okay anything else nuh uh got you it said around the noon day sun it's probably about 30 minutes give or take okay everyone else go with them so you guys trek your way towards the northern edge of the cloudtop district you round about the series of very nice fine marbled houses finely crafted stone this is the affluent area of emon proper it's in the secondary city wall which of course the upper echelon of merchants and those who have money are offered the secondary form of defense against the town being sieged at all give it a couple hits (vax nods) and she swings the door opens and runs forward immediately to you the first person that's there and she gives you a big hug her eyes are opened you can see how honestly eager and happy to see that everyone's here safe she turns over to give pike a big hug she makes her way around the rest of the group she turns around and takes your hands keyleth into her own and gives you a nod and a small hug goes to percy and gives you a hug goes to tiberius and gives you a big warm hug and as she turns around she sees standing behind the rest of you there's kima there in her now freshly cleaned golden armor that she polished over the evening so she doesn't smell of duergar sweat and blood anymore there's this moment where they both look at each other quietly and then allura steps forward and says and they both just run and give this big embracing bear hug she lifts kima up and there's a slow spin you can see this very very strong bond of friendship before she eventually puts kima down and takes a little bit she holds her hands for a second you can see a tear running down allura's cheek and kima sheepishly turns her eyes to the side and says what (all laugh) your assumptions dragonborn (all laugh) (laughs) and kima says then allura turns to the rest of the group and says at which point kima says and allura starts heading back into her tower and says and allura starts heading back into her tower and says so as you guys all walk into her tower you remember it untouched from your previous entry here it's a weird moment to step into a tower that you were once in as it crumbled and folded on itself to see it as if nothing had ever happened there is not you guys step into the center of the room and she's talking to herself for a moment saying she guides you all to the center of the chamber once again there's that large stone platform in the center that has a number of the inert runes carved into the stonework as you all step onto it she taps her heel against the bottom of it for a second as she does all the runes glow with a bright flash of blue and a familiar sensation as that circular platform begins to lift like an arcane elevator up the center of the tower going up one two three stories and as you're going up you're seeing certain sections of wooden library shelves set up at odd angles along the top of the arcane tower itself you can see there are small stairways that lead off into doorways that seem to almost exit into the sky you can do that go for it on allura best that you can gather she looks like she's a bit groggy having slept in recently but she seems extremely excited you've all returned and seems eager to catch up as far as what has transpired since last you met her you do hear as soon as you arrive it sounds like the whistle of a tea kettle in the distance at which point she says and she begins to walk over she lifts her hand and you see a small drift of arcane energy as her mage hand goes and lifts takes the water off of it's burner and begins to absent mindedly mage-hand various teacups out of a large cabinet above the little kitchenette area at which point everyone's looking around kima amongst the rest of you guys says allura who is now in the process of pulling chairs over and setting up a small sitting arrangement a semi-circle and says she gives a slow knowing look about the group and gives a nod like 'i acquiesce to this that's fine' at which point as you say that she does this with her fingers and all the chairs rush in underneath you guys and you're put into a sitting position as you all sit she begins to slowly mage-hand over each one of you a freshly poured cup of tea and she sits up for a second and walks over and you can see she looks back at the rest of you and brushes her hand for a second a sphere of darkness appears in the corner of the room where you can not see an entire part of the room and she sits there and hovers just a little pocket of darkness you hear some rustling you hear some rustling the sphere of darkness finishes and you see she's holding a sack of coins that you don't know where she picked them up from she steps back over to her chair sits down and says she hands it out to vex's eager palm it's very heavy with her 9 strength it sags internet there's a slight pause before the actual sound of breaking glass hits your ears as the teacup that she's holding shatters across the stonework on the floor she looks over to kima who does this with her shoulders up kima gives her a nod and says she gives a sheepish grin and a slight shrug in her armor allura looks to the ground for a moment and says at which point allura raises her hand and says as you guys make your way back down through the tower you eventually venture through the castletop district in front of the palace the guards stand there with their long red velvet cloaks and their brass breastplates they recognize both allura and you as you approach they step aside put their spears toward the steps and give you a grand entrance to the front of the palace so you're led over to the council chambers which as you enter the main circular room you're brought into the nice hardwood floors the dark forest green colored walls these long tapestries which recall various battles of history and broad mountainous landscapes showing settlers making their way across dangerous terrain you can see various weapons from different civilizations that were brought up as gifts to emon that have been mounted on the walls as presentory atmospheric decor and in the central room you can see what currently stands the entirety of the tal'dorei council in a hushed discussion the council of course has at the center across the table from you sovereign uriel tal'dorei the second himself the leader of emon and the current sovereign of all of tal'dorei this section of the continent you see him with his characteristic dark hair with greying sides cut shorter than you recall looks like he recently got a trim and some very well kept facial hair he's wearing his ceremonial robes which are the same gold and red color as the armored soldiers that greeted you at the front of the palace next to him you see lord riskell daxio the elven male who helped you guys handle the purchasing of the keep when you were awarded that at the end of your last journey he's the master of trade currently within emon you can see he has long strawberry blonde hair that is pulled into a tight ponytail to the back he wears darker clothing more for decoration than actual use his armor seems to be loose and more decorative next to him is guardian tofor brotorus which you've heard of but have not met before a female dragonborn paladin guardian tofor bratoras t-o-f-o-r bratoras her name's been mentioned before but this is the first time you guys have actually seen her in person it's a female dragonborn paladin she is adorned in full silvered platinum plate that has currently carved multiple symbols of bahamut the platinum dragon as she looks up and notices you can see she gives a hand up a symbol of greetings towards kima as kima also gives her hand up and they both touch the front of their armor in a symbolic holy way they both being followers of bahamut you immediately make that religious connection between the two of them she looks across at the rest of the group there that she doesn't seem to notice eyes meeting with tiberius this is strange you haven't seen very many dragonborn at all within emon and as soon as she meets your gaze she gives you a look of deep deep stinkeye she seems to spit the words almost and sits back in her chair the rest of the council's talking amongst themselves and hearing this slight discussion next to her there is a halfling male in a ranger-ish garb wearing what looks like some really fine chain shirt with a thick dark black cloak he is shaved bald with tattoos on one side of his face and he introduces himself he gives a slight nudge to tofor he extends his hand towards you almost like alleviating the tension at which the sovereign finishes discussion with another human which you have not met he is a built and armored individual stands probably the tallest of the entire group thick square jaw unshaven at which point he puts his hand on the sovereign's shoulder and says he sits down in his chair allura finds her side of the table and gestures the rest of you all right most faces are blank allura has her hands on the table listening intently as you say illithid you do notice that seeker asum emring the halfling immediately sits back in his chair with a look of 'oh snap' allura looks at you strangely i know at which point the table gets extremely uncomfortable suddenly as everyone steps back kima steps forward she's kept to the back at this point and says at which point the sovereign lifts a hand up to her and says at that notification you say the name orcus and you can see there's a whole energy shift in the room at which point a lot of furrowed brows drop to intense the actual air of the room seems to go still for a moment from what you can see seeker asum and tofor both grit their teeth and lean forward as you say this tofor says tofor you said orcus at which point kima steps forward and says at which point the arbiter braum steps forward arbiter braum if you think there's possibly a way to destroy this we need to discover this here we cannot allow it outside of the midst of this to some chaotic winds and whim of the world around us we have the walls of emon to keep it safe why not take it to the lyceum that was the sovereign so which individual the arbiter okay arbiter braum what'd you roll ten sure thirteen okay starting the game off strong guys i'll text it to you eleventeen a total of 17 on which individual okay arbiter braum okay i'll say in a general feel about the room but the arbiter specifically there is definitely a very quick rising in tension fear and adrenaline in the room at this conversation fear is the main thing you're getting i wouldn't say that you sense any deception you just sense that the stakes have just suddenly jumped from what they were expecting their morning to be they're trying to wrap their head around it so nothing too particular catches your shit radar as grog speaks up for the arbiter he says arbiter braum i'm not saying we leave it here i'm saying that while we have it here we have it studied bring it to the lyceum the headmaster and his entire research facility could possibly find a way to destroy it there is no finer arcane focus than that lyceum in the city they're responsible for the construction of our sky ships and the crystals that keep them elevated at which point tofor the female dragonborn sits up in her chair and says tofor regardless it should not stay here in my opinion understand the longer it resides within emon the more word will spread and more despots will be drawn to our city to claim it do you wish to have all the darkness of this land slowly swarm in on the city at which point the sovereign who's been kinda quiet this moment says at which point allura takes a moment and says at which point as she starts saying this the rest of the room shifts uncomfortably you can see tofor begins to raise her hand to protest allura shuts her down and says she looks to kima kima nods her head kima raises her maul and says at which point the sovereign speaks up and says wet willy to our little gnome bard we miss you sam at which point kima scratches her chin for a second at which point -- at which point allura stands forward and says at this point allura sits forward and to the rest of the group says at which point the group leans back for a second and kima goes shoots a dirty look a little bit to -- sure allura's saying thirteen best you can tell allura's really hard to read she keeps up her smile but she definitely has her intense face on she's deep in the moment no real gives one way or the other the rest of the group looks around and arcanist in the silence goes she glances over to the sovereign the sovereign nods then he gives a laugh and smile to raise a bit of levity in the room that nobody seems to respond to he looks to lady kima and kima says kima steps back a little bit kima i defer to the rest of you all right at which point everyone gathers the rest of their papers their parchments they're rolling up scrolls the arbiter gets up and lumbers his way out of the room the seeker asum steps up to the rest of you with a final handshake seeker he seems strangely nervous but in a weird way he's a gentle hint of fanboy he slyly winks back on his way out she's bigger than usual allura stands up and begins to leave the sovereign stands up and as he stands up the guards come out and they come to his side yes for the sake of this conversation i'm going to ask you to roll a deception check the sovereign gives you a look and says he tells you as you present it he walks by and one of his guards takes it from you and gives you a nod the rest of the council kima and allura are near you at which point kima looks at the rest of you and says she looks to allura questioning allura allura says yeah they're the only two who have stayed behind with you guys outside of the council chambers at which point-- did you wish to respond in any way at which point kima looks to you at what you just said with curious worry (laughs) at which point kima laughs to herself kima who does not have an accent and did not say it that way too many npcs in my head right now she says kima you ask this and she gives you a look of confusion and then… she already a darker complexion for a halfling but her cheeks grow noticeably ruddier she averts her gaze and says she averts her gaze and goes she still is looking away she looks away and looks to the rest of you looks to allura looks to you again and then goes she leaves the group and continues down the hallway quick steps allura chuckles to herself and steps into the place where she was and goes and allura smiles and motions towards kima you feel a gentle slap from some unknown arcane force across your cheek grog and allura gives you a stern glare anyway she begins to step up the hallway as she steps up the hallway you can see there's a light yellowish glow about her form then with a sudden flash of white light allura's just gone all right you

castletop district into the center of emon proper returning to abedar’s promenade which is the largest central section of the city where most of the merchantile itself seems to have gathered and been a serious conglomerate where all business in this city happens those who would like a quick little visual idea of the city this is emon yeah we’ll have it too anyway the castletop district is here the inner portion you guys have made your way out south to the central district and then towards abedar’s promenade which is right over here so you guys would’ve gone this way actually so you’re out to abedar’s promenade in the far eastern side of emon where you eventually find your way to the outskirts of your favorite purveyor of arcane mystical artifacts shaun gilmore himself so as you guys -- yeah shaun gilmore but you’ve always called him gilmore no one’s on a first-name basis with gilmore gilmore is gilmore except for maybe maybe vax all right so vax wills vex to wink vex do you accept this wink from your brother all right perfect there you go perfect we’ve lined it up as you walk across the main thoroughfare you make your way to the wide but single-story building that is gilmore’s glorious goods of all the various shades of brown and red and brick that makes up all these buildings gilmore’s glorious goods is presented in fine deep blue and purple fabric and a paint scheme that would look like the worst funhouse to enter worst or best depending on your opinion the entranceway is not a door but a series of hanging beads and large cloth drapes that are gently falling to be brushed aside as you enter it’s not as big as you remember or recall seemingly but as you step through the front door you remember why much like the tardis the interior of gilmore’s goods is bigger on the inside there is a magical enchantment based within this building where the interior is actually a two-story and much larger place of business immediately the smells of incense and fine perfumes assault your nose -- like a terrible medieval sephora a series of magically flickering ever-burning candles adorn sconces along the walls you can see there are glass cases set out in the center of the room there is the long wooden bar on the far end which has itself its own beaded curtain that is closed and there are three employees of gilmore’s glorious goods in their ceremonial blue and purple robes that match the exterior staring about while there a number of other possible customers that are looking about there are numerous bookshelves along the walls you can see there is next to the stairway on the far left side of this floor there is an herbalist who specializes in dried herbs and sales in that regard you haven't been to the upstairs yet in this complex but you now are standing back in the comfortable although slightly offensive to your senses interior of gilmore's glorious goods he's not currently visible he's not visible not in the main room (laughs quietly) all right all righty so on the far back side there is a very long well-crafted dark wood desk that is adorned with what looks like small alchemical components (package crinkling) with what looks like small alchemical components glass tubing and -- (package crinkling) be a little louder with those red vines i'm good thank you we're good you can see there are a number of glass containers and small corked vials -- (laughs) it's all right there are some books stacked up there is a small embedded glass case that seems to have a couple of items that are under a purplish-maroon velvet piece of material that's currently covering them there is that beaded curtain with strips of material that block the back room no not currently it is just an empty desk there is a bell as you hit the bell one of the employees who is helping somebody looks around and goes what you see is a half-elven woman with thick spectacles who is currently stepping over to try and stop you however the beaded curtain swishes open with the grandiose gesture of one slightly meaty hand stepping out in his fine gold-trimmed purple robes his longish thick black coarse hair pulled into a nice ponytail smoothly-shaved face with a slight hint of a braided goatee that dangles about three inches from his chin yeah he's handsome gilmore's a very handsome gentleman i would say he's not fit and muscular he is a handsome comfortably jovial gentleman kind of imagine him with a little more paunch but very charismatic open chest to his vest with a number of gold chains and medallions that dangle around it's almost like a wizard's track suit (all laugh) no (all laugh) he immediately looks and goes he immediately rushes to the edge and leans over the counter to give you a grandiose hug and actually lifts you off your feet much stronger than you anticipated he goes he sets you down next to him behind the counter and gives you a big hug his strong wizard arms around you a scent of what's almost like fine herbs with a hint of patchouli enters your nose he looks genuinely perturbed and embarrassed by the whole circumstance and he looks about the rest of you and says he gives you all a look over he looks over at the same half-elven woman who was trying to stop you earlier she gives a look like 'what's he going to say' no one's ever asked him this question he goes the same woman her shoulders droop so sherri looks at the rest of you as they leave and goes she adjusts her glasses she goes behind the counter for a second and ruffles through some stuff goes in the back room and comes back out with a wooden crate pretty much you hear the glass jangling inside as she moves it and sets it on the counter with a ting they all eventually come to rest she goes she looks at the price book going through as i go through my price book she pulls them out of the crate and slides them across they are thick very heavily-made glass vials with these small glass handles on the side you can see the interior the liquid itself is a reddish purple almost blood color but there's a gold sheen as you shake it in the light you can see there's a spark of divine glow to it kind of it's the worst of healing goldschlager she gives you the blank stare and goes roll a persuasion check marisha orion and fourteen she goes she brings out her arcane calculator and she pulls out the six that are there and she kinda slides them over the counter to you one tips over but she catches it leaves it there at the far end she pushes her glasses up and looks vastly unimpressed at the presentation and she goes in the back room rummages around for a minute comes out and she presents two of them they have a clear liquid that looks almost like dirty water and they’re like thin little vials she goes and she takes them -- she gives you another look of like ugh she adjusts her glasses make another persuasion roll this is my new fan dice it’s awesome thank you it’s a good thing she gives you a look and goes she leaves for a second then comes back and goes she folds it and places it in a little cubby on the side she leads you up the stairway to the second floor the second floor itself is just a series of glass cases that are leaned at an angle in these cases you can see there are different items just laid out small labels at the bottom with she leads you across she goes you can see there’s a small case that has along this purplish velvet pillow a bunch of different rings set out she goes the equivalent of a ring of protection +2 and she points over where there is a thick leather belt with like three straps across that looks highly well made with what looks like square runic carvings on the side it is 5000 gold it gives a plus two bonus to ac and saving throws it has three charges and it regains 1d3 charges per day when you fail a dexterity saving throw while wearing it you can use your reaction to expend a charge and auto-succeed on the saving throw instead good for people who have low dexterity it gives you resistance to psychic damage so anyone does damage that is psychic-based you take half damage she looks over at him for a moment and goes she goes back downstairs and comes back in a moment she presents two small boxes that contain small colored wax things you can see on the outside it has a picture of gilmore and he’s doing this and it says gilmore’s glorious colored sticks it’s one of the layers of the abyss it’s like around -- about layer 943 goes back and looks again at her magic calculator i’m an actor not -- exactly do we know how much that was worth has scanlan looked at his sheet and found what it’s worth there was the diamond also that was repaired in the mending wheel oh no we lost them redial redial magical sending stone answer your facetime vex we’ll come to it so i’m just gonna keep doing this as you were she continues on showing you through she goes she goes a second there is a big thick leather tome that’s okay and she produces this like -- (facetime noises) she produces this fine brass cap that has intricate swirling runes on it and what looks like a small set of ears that are pushed on the sides so when it fits on the head it looks almost like a smaller head on top of yours she says she pulls out this thick leather armor that has a brownish-blue trimmed hue to it and goes she takes it and shifts it for a second you can see a little bit of smoke plumes off of it smells sulfurish she goes she pulls another dark cloak off the wall this one looks like it’s made of dark fur but as she shakes it you can see these two little tendrils are on it they like wiggle about these little spiked edges to the tendrils she pulls up from this small box she opens up the top lid and you move to the side going through the armor section as well she goes -- then she goes to what looks to be a series of weapons she brings forth a very fine-looking dagger that has -- and you still have money you haven’t collected in kraghammer too there’s money you still haven’t collected in kraghammer lord nostoc greyspine you guys made a deal with him before you went down in the pits she has all the money so we’ll just keep track of what you guys spend and bring it back to vex your treasurer and she’ll be really angry that you guys spent all that money so she presents this dagger to you guys -- so she presents this dagger to you guys -- yep you did you guys spent quite a bit on the keep all right essentially on a critical hit on the attack roll -- (all cheer) yeah ten you got ten grand from allura and you currently have a floating -- yeah 25000 gold is still owed by lord nostoc greyspine as she pulls out this wooden case she pulls back the wooden top to it as she does you can see there’s a little bit of ice crystal that’s gathered along the interior of the wooden case there inside sits a short sword a relatively thick short blade but the blade itself is like a blue almost glimmering metal and there’s actually a rising frozen mist that drifts off the blade she adjusts her glasses again and she grabs the -- you can’t wear armor she starts going through her -- you pull them out of the bag of holding she takes a few and she takes her glasses off and then pulls out from a pocket this intricate-looking multi-lensed tinkering viewing device and inspects it very closely puts it away in her pocket and goes puts it away in her pocket and goes and the dragon scales themselves are about that big each they’re about the size of a peach dragons are big especially this one pulls that again looks over it make a perception roll or not that a persuasion roll timing is everything folks timing is everything that’s a keepsake for actually slaying a dragon you’re welcome to trade that it’s worth quite a bit that was the white dragon that’s the one that you got the final blow on that’s the one that you got the final blow on anyway they rolled a ten she says as you pull out the basilisk eggs you pull it out and immediately there is a stench that is emanating from these eggs that have been in your bag of holding for probably close to eight or nine months this is now the fourth time she’s looked at you with a deadpan glance and adjusted her glasses timing is everything this has now turned into the flea-market episode hey you guys guide the story it’s fun though we’ll get to that right now starts putting everything into a small layaway pile in the corner in the meantime in the meantime for their man-date we can go see some sights vax yes gilmore who has sweeped you out into the middle of abedar’s promenade takes you by the arm and begins to lead you happily up towards the erudite quarter of emon which has a secondary wall around it as well as he brings you along he talks happily and loudly about how as you guys step into the erudite quarter he’s now brought you into essentially what is an outdoor botanical garden that is just a very nice walk grass across the ground with fine well-cut bushes there is a canopy of beautiful trees that are arcane through arcane means twisted and sculpted to form this long tunnel it’s strangely romantic as gilmore begins to walk you down there’s a fountain to the side and he says he looks you deep in the eyes pats the top of your hand and goes about an hour and a half time passes before eventually there’s a loud clattering at the front of gilmore’s glorious goods where a

gold per platinum a thousand platinum one thousand six hundred platinum move the decimal point that brings it to 16000 gold pieces no it’s not 100 gold per platinum ten gold per platinum we’re getting into math in this he snaps his fingers sherri comes and presents all the items that she had currently in a little stowaway bin off to the side of the desk brings them out to the rest of you and places it on the counter gilmore immediately snaps his fingers and a contract shows up he writes up the numbers exchanged making note of his business passes it out he hands you a quill takes your coin slides you and you now have this entire batch of magical items to distribute as you see fit and from that point -- okay he goes back through his beaded exit to the back room and leaves you to the rest of
