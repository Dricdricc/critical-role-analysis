okay the bard will be in our hearts this evening and you're welcome to tweet at him angrily to make sure he makes the next session so without further ado let's go and kick into the recap so the party has initially been sent down on a mission by the arcanist allura vysoren in search of a halfling paladin who has gone missing named lady kima of vord a folk hero and a very respected individual she went on a vision quest and apparently went alone into kraghammer seeking some sort of great evil that was festering beneath the city and hasn't been seen for weeks and weeks the party was hired by her to go and try to find her whereabouts and hopefully bring her back safely since traversing and meeting individuals in kraghammer they then spearheaded into the greyspine mines where apparently these monstrosities have been burbling out time and time again over the past few weeks pushing down they had encountered umber hulks they managed to inquire some duergar which apparently there's a lot of them down here duergar being an ashy-skinned subterranean dark evil dwarf-type offshoot one of which had with it a brain-type quadruped that managed to brain spike grog and send him catatonic for a short time they wandering through the caverns discovered there was a duergar war camp across the way from-- across this large chasm that was currently being run by a general duergar alongside what appeared to be and what they've now discovered to be a mind flayer or an illithid they managed to upon looking deeper into this cavern finding hidden behind a waterfall thanks to the druid and the ranger completely stealing from the rest of the group their flying carpet made a very tenuous relationship and alignment with another mind flayer apparently cast out of his own society searching to find a way to both get revenge and find his way back into his colony of people and his name was clarota lovingly called clarence by the group probably much to his own chagrin after which they decided to go ahead and try to extract information from this duergar general and stop this war camp from preparing itself for battle and attack seemingly on kraghammer in the near future through a strange crazy plan they came up with they managed to fly undetected over via flying carpet and eagle and floating sorcerer over the entire war camp made a metal gear run into the center of their main barracks-- (all laugh) -- after which vax bisected it pretty much in one surprise round of attacks that led to a large battle in the center of this building partway through which ground began to rumble and then digging a forth from underneath a bulette a gargantuan armored burrowing creature that was hungry and very dangerous that then made the battle that much more intense a heavy blood-filled battle later involved with percy getting his hand caught and firing his gun into the gullet of the beast eventually it had its armor pulled apart and was defeated by the party the remnants of the duergar army inside of this building have been destroyed aside from a few stragglers who have laid their weapons down and the general now lies beaten on his knees before the rest of the party and that is where we pick up and begin so as you all are catching your breath breathing heavily as the adrenaline slowly leaves the system looking around this building with the large hole still glaring through the roof tiberius is waving through it the general's on the ground warhammer at his side blackened armor still kind of sizzling with the arcane energy from his temporary banishment via scanlan he sits there with this kind of gnarled brackish beard looking about the rest of you with these wild kind of white-coated eyes so you found your way in what's your purpose what do you want from me if you want blood take it it's all you're getting from me i don't know what you're talking about well she wouldn't have gotten far if she did not with my people go ahead and make an intimidation roll with advantage that's a way to start as you pull the blade to his throat he chuckles deeply against the strain your halfling lass was foolish we took her we delivered her to king murghol as a present if she lives she's probably ruined and broken deep within the dungeons of emberhold you're welcome to go for her there murghol ooh down probably i highly doubt it he spits in your direction go for it he does not appear to be lying about his interpretation of her apparently she is where he is as to where her current state is you don't know but he seems to have a very very made-up mind as to her possibility of her being alive still you can press him that information even harder of course it's kind of reminiscent of black speech from the tolkien universe that has that guttural (speaking black speech) very very deep a little bit like a whispering darkness to it as she speaks this tongue it catches a lot of you off guard you've not heard her use this tongue until this point make an intimidation check get your sheet ready you got your paper today lovely 18 he says no passages to the stronghold but there is a way in aside from the front good luck getting up in there from that point yes through the lake deep below you'll find a tunnel this tunnel will lead you to a subterranean passage straight to the stronghold make an insight no he's bullshitting through his teeth hey he seemed honest about the passage but dishonest about the-- he's basically following her lead uh-huh perhaps if i tell you will you let me live i'm essentially-- don't just leave me alive give me a chance to walk from this building on my own arms intact and i'll give you the secret entrance to emberhold itself leading you straight within the throne room correct at which point a cold clammy hand touches your shoulder and pulls you aside as-- -- a partially hooded clarota steps forward and says i'll attempt to read his surface thoughts if he tries to keep it from me i'll know as he steps forward he puts one hand in front of him and his eyes gleam with a sickly green hue you can see the general tips his head back for a second and begins twitching an eye sweat begins to bead around his brow as clarota takes another step forward tensing his hand once more his head beginning to bow forward with an intensity a force of focus towards his direction you can now see the general let me live let me go and i'll tell you this isn't necessary i'm willing to give you the information you can see a trickle of blood begin to pour out of one of his nostrils let me see and the mind flayer pushes once more into his brain you see a twitch to his face as his head kind of lolls back and rolls for a second resisting as best he can but his will is currently being beaten by the defeat of the battle the lack of his compatriot mind flayer and the sheer intensity of clarota now focused on vengeance and returning to his people the blood beings to stream not just from his nostrils but from his ears as well as clarota releases him for a second he goes he has not seen k'varn but knows a bit of his nature i cannot read it but we could press for more information k'varn was responsible for forging the alliance for centuries and generations his people and mine killed and fought it wasn't until k'varn came that we decided to work together for a common cause expansion unification dominion over this land and these mountains divided we were weak petty greedy with k'varn leading us we have purpose we have growth we could take what we'd like and i'm but one dwarf if i fall over here many more will take over where i fell i have not seen k'varn personally what i know of k'varn-- a being of immense intelligence a creature that needs not walk this earth one that does not touch the land that it traverses i know it sees all it smiles from a toothy maw and laughs laughs in the darkness protruding from its forehead one nasty gnarled black horn terrible source of its dark power that is what's beneath here insight check go ahead and make a nature check or arcana either one this'll be more for your own personal knowledge probably not but you can make one yourself all right so no natural creature you've ever heard has this type of essence to it having a single black horn it is it's an awful awful narwhal way to spoil the story liam gnashing teeth black horn very intelligent that doesn't seem to be anything from nature itself from your experience there are different entities but usually there are multiple horns singular demonic beings that would have extreme intelligence sharp teeth horns and you've had brief brushes in the past with demonic entities that seems to run in a similar vein but nothing in particular is creeping into mind it's going to be difficult for you to specifically come up with this with what little information you currently have yeah let me-- that was not the deal you leave me unspoiled on my life and i tell you the way into emberhold emberhold emberhold is the fortress of our people built to resist assault from all sides we've an army hiding about the outskirts of it kind of like an army you might have in one of yours if you think you have a chance however since i don't think that's what you carry your best bet is on the left side of the fortress there are two streams of molten rock that pour down the side the smaller of those two streams covers a secret tunnel all right he seems to be forthright and honest with his information however that'll take you through the lava that's up to you it's meant to open from the inside a trapdoor-like mechanism that spreads the actual flow from the outside well good luck i've done my side of the bargain let me free okay so his belt falls changepurse and everything he is wearing full plate black armor-- so his trousers do not plummet he picks up his warhammer unspoiled was the deal takes a couple of steps forward towards you holding the warhammer out suddenly he turns completely invisible vanishes from sight you hear (footsteps running) at this point-- before you have the opportunity-- -- he becomes visible again about 20 feet out gone down the stairs and towards the front door and he just-- go for it all right that hits it's not a sneak attack just damage you chuck your ax at him okay all right so go ahead and roll damage for both of you he is there standing in place with his arms locked like this 15 damage all righty ten damage all right there's now a significant amount of blood beginning to pool down his feet as he's standing there as he is frozen in place clarota just kinda steps up to the front of him grabs his cheeks and pulls his head in towards him as his tendrils slowly wrap around his head you can see them meet at the back of his skull and with this horrible crunching sound you see his head shudder as his limbs go limp a few moments of this horrible slurping sound-- -- and you hear this dull sickening hollow (suction) sound the tentacles release clarota releases his grip from his head and the captain falls onto his back a giant bloodied hole in the center of his skull as you're looking you can see there's that kind of weird purplish crimson around his tendrils as he kinda wipes it off with his hands and goes it's enough to sustain me a while i was getting hungry yes so you loot the body you find amongst all the duergar bodies here as you're quickly jumping around and grabbing it's hard to count the exact amount but you're looking at somewhere in the neighbourhood of about five to six hundred gold pieces you'll have to check later a series of black iron weapons none of them seem to at a quick glance have any sort of magical value the blackened plate armor on the duergar itself does radiate a magical essence as does the warhammer he was holding yeah there are a few that are wearing black plate but they're not equivalent enchanted from what is in here that would be 11 sets total because there were also sets that were on the rack at the very front an arcana check yeah there you go sir so as tiberius is looking over the equipment kind of poring through his arcane knowledge there are residual memories thoughts it's delicious and you can see there's this almost rapturous look in his face you haven't seen before for a moment clarota looks a little younger a little stronger a little more dangerous and you're put off a little bit by it but there's kind of this momentary kind of relishing in the moment and-- he speaks the truth about the path into the emberhold the smaller of the two on the left side yes oh there are plenty of soldiers still in the camp you stealthed into the barracks you can certainly try there's plates that have been broken and cracked you can try and start cleaving away at it okay you start-- it's really tough hide you know 'cause you tried to cut through before and you managed to make a few marks it takes you a few minutes you manage to get let's say about three saucer-shaped pieces of armor out of it you could definitely get more but then you start hearing bells going off laura and you don't see anything yet you just hear bells starting to go off in the city you start hearing horns big horns you start seeing torches being lit okay what's the radius on pass without a trace four miles it's all i got okay well the arrow that you have that he made it's essentially an arrow that bursts into a tanglefoot bag when it bursts it grapples whoever's there it's not like grappling an arrow 30-foot radius okay so you could just-- -- barely get tiberius in there if you-- on the platform so yeah all right so scanlan-- both gnomes get grabbed by keyleth as-- so you guys right now as you're carrying the two gnomes all of you except for grog are on the carpet correct you're flying okay so how many spells do you have left on that one left all right trinket's back on the other side trinket didn't come with you to the battle because there was nobody to get trinket across yeah i know eh you weren't here (all laugh) hopefully everyone make a stealth check with a plus ten additional modifier thanks to keyleth's spell all right so you all take off as you do you can see now probably close to 30 or 40 duergar have now begun rushing towards the barracks in the center of that main open area where that wooden platform was where scanlan originally saw a mind flayer as you rush up you hear (speaks undercommon) you hear it as undercommon screaming there above look a stream of javelins comes firing up in your direction okay okay so there's a volley of javelins and a fireball streaking past you'll be able to get ten of them in that fireball blast go ahead and roll for damage on that however for those that rolled less than 20 on stealth each of you are getting three javelins each to you so that's you two and grog what'd you roll again okay yeah so you three so three javelins against you miss you entirely percy actually one more against you keyleth that one does hit you take 14 points of piercing damage as the javelin just gleans off the side of your giant eagle torso percy that's a 21 an 18 and a 20 so you take three javelins 24 points of piercing damage yeah 24 points total as three javelins-- two strike you off the shoulders and one actually embeds itself partway into your waist and you have to pull it out and probably dug a good six seven inches in all right the three that are going towards grog-- that-- natural 20 a 17 what's your ac that one misses and the last one-- yeah two natural 20s not even joking all right so-- you take a total of 36 points of piercing damage grog yeah probably oh barbarian he is here scanlan's holding on tight as-- however as the javelins strike all you guys moments later there's a gargantuan explosion and there's a flash of reddish light from below a giant fiery blooming explosion bursts into the center of that area you can see duergar thrown left and right you manage to take out about 12 of them in that one blast you guys continue cresting over the top you can now see more and more are starting to gather the bells are going off the horns are blowing hard you can see a bunch of them are now running over to what looks like some of this siege equipment they had constructed-- marisha and which includes a few large ballistae okay you guys are coming down you basically shot up curved around-- and you're going backwards towards the barracks as you do another volley of-- another volley comes to the guys who were under-stealthed however there is one attack less each because of the duergar that you had taken out so against keyleth one hits you take 12 points of piercing damage all right a two and a one versus percy all right so keyleth's form shifts back into that of keyleth you guys are about 80 feet up at which point both scanlan and pike go into a free fall along with keyleth no you guys are about parallel you guys were moving together okay you guys are out in the middle of the open cavern there's no place to connect the bridge so you're essentially creating a giant ice-- liam and chunk right beneath them which is also now in freefall yes so as you guys try and swoop underneath as they're plummeting-- you're riding this go ahead and make an acrobatics check all right so you swoop underneath a sudden motion as you're trying to cast go ahead and roll a concentration check on this unfortunately you're falling you're like (worried noise) you're just plummeting through the air like a rock because you're in full plate armor you have to pull it out of the bag of holding and then turn into a lasso that's gonna take you a full minute so you don't have time all right guys so here's what happens in the time this has transpired you've rushed underneath with the magic carpet all of you barely managed to hold on as both pike and scanlan and keyleth all slam into the top of the-- you lost your concentration so glacial blast didn't go off thankfully that would've been really bad you guys slam onto the top of the rest of the group in there because you lost your concentration your flight spell also dissipates grog is now plummeting the carpet now has too much weight and is currently giving out it's slowing your fall but you guys are-- you're coming down at a very very fast pace at an angle over the barracks towards the back end of the war camp you can attempt to grog-- everybody at this point-- yes essentially you guys are flying beside each other the three that were falling you guys swooped underneath and caught them however it's too much weight to bear the carpet's now-- at this second you're about 60-70 feet up it's about 15 feet tall grog however goes into a full plummet you guys have just caught the rest of them you've all caught them you're crashing down go ahead and roll a concentration your constitution modifier the spell fizzles from what you can see here you're probably about 50 to 60 feet you're towards the back of it thankfully the barracks are towards the back of it so maybe about 50 to 60 feet from the full tunnel yep you guys go crashing at an angle grog is completely separate from you he was flying and lost concentration of his spell grog's like a stone off of the carpet-- go ahead and make an acrobatics check with a disadvantage because you are jumping off of a currently flimsy flying carpet to try and catch up to him go for it so what's your acrobatics check the lower of the two okay you manage to fumble out of the carpet however you are now just end-over-end falling now off of the side of the carpet on your own you're having a hard time even seeing grog now the world's just spinning and spinning and spinning you can attempt-- go ahead cast and roll concentration check what did you roll okay featherfall gets to you just in time your descent slows in that time grog has impacted so you all brace for impact the actual carpet's careening out of control you can see there's just barely the top of a building you might be able to try and skim this is going to be up to the one who's been steering this whole time go ahead and make an intelligence check yes no 24 you just managed to skim the edge which lessens your impact slightly however it does send you all into a full end-over-end topple everyone everyone make an acrobatics check grog's impacted he was falling faster than you guys were he's six hundred pounds going into straight freefall you guys had a little bit of a fall break everyone oh except for you because you're floating it's based on how you guys roll because you're the ones who are holding onto them so you got pike what'd you roll natural one okay so half-damage for you roll some fall damage here 18 points of damage he didn't have a lot of hit points left 18 points of damage to you the rest of you all take 36 points of fall damage except for grog well no no sorry you succeeded you rolled a-- 18 so you would also take half-damage so you would take 18 as well you take half that as well thanks to his roll as well right you were in full plummet you can reduce the damage slightly yeah you take 45 points of damage from the impact grog 45 points of damage and leave a small crater from the impact you and scanlan both take 36 which puts scanlan into a negative as well because he wasn't-- he was not at-- no he wasn't so you all tumble end over end come to rest yeah on the far end of it thankfully you guys can hear the bells and the horns going in the distance it looks like all the rest of the folks that were stationed here moved towards the center you managed to arc over them but they're going to be here shortly no the ballistae are on the opposite-- well the ledge is back in the other direction you guys are going towards the tunnel on the opposite side okay you guys-- and you you're kinda getting up on your knees coughing-- percy's just face-down in the ground scrapes across the side of his face scanlan's also out you guys are roughly about ten feet from each other from the impact just you were scattered and then you kind of regrouped not yet but you assume it's only a short period of time grog what you at okay okay you barely get yourself out of the crater that's gonna suck tomorrow as this is happening percy go ahead and make a death saving throw what did you roll that's a fail so mark off one fail on your death saving throw on your sheet scanlan does make his okay all right so both you guys pour healing potions that is-- those are the normal ones the common the regular healing 2d4 + 2 go ahead and roll that okay go for it that's four-- scanlan also comes to consciousness that's the cheapest one you've got 2d4 + 2 okay no that's towards the center of the camp all right so as you guys are running towards the back towards the main tunnel which you can now see it's roughly a 40- by 30-foot tunnel you go running through the buildings you see a few duergar kinda poke out from the buildings no you guys are just bolting at this point you're not even concentrating on stealth right now plus with the group-- basically a few of you would stealth and the rest of you would be left in the dust so you're just kind of all pushing for speed at this point you all manage to push towards the back of the entire war camp into this tunnel hearing behind you the distant echoing shouts of approximately 30-plus duergar heading in your direction you hear a few other ballista bolts hitting the wall above you of the stone you guys have now pushed into the tunnel okay how many can you-- three per spell and how many spell levels do you have currently right so you have one right how many spell castings did you have left two one left so you get three columns it's 30 feet wide okay everyone heals for 24 points add that up no the walls are stone pillars go straight up unfortunately it's the nature of the spell's creation okay so as you're trying to figure this out keyleth steps over-- as you guys are doing this and rushing in you're realizing there's one member of your party that you haven't had a lot of time with-- laura and -- that you didn't think about until this moment you now see kind of like floating via levitation ability about 30 feet away slowly descending towards you as you're putting up the wall of stone-- two bolts go firing towards him one whooshes overhead a second one-- (impact sound) -- through his back out the front of his chest-- -- off the shoulder you can see now-- and the bolt itself is about 4 feet long made of this long jagged pointed arrow tip clarota begins to falter and begins to hover towards you almost like trying to swim through the air in your direction he's about 20 feet from you now you can try and reach out and put your hands towards him-- okay so as you guys are running towards him instead this giant crystalline form of ice just-- -- crackles up into what looks like some sort of strange winter festival slide that would be made for children in the center of town clarota-- -- as it descends two more bolts come towards him both (whoosh whoosh) at this distance in the darkness of the cavern it's kind of hard for them to get a bead on him both just pass overhead with eyes kind of lolling clarota comes down and hits the edge of the slide and almost loses consciousness at that moment sliding through the ice you guys manage to capture grappling his arms lift him to his feet-- you all make it into the tunnel keyleth turns around raising her hands the actual blackened stonework of this tunnel shakes for a second and then a giant thick wall of natural rock closes off the entire tunnel behind you completely seals it you guys are now in complete darkness as the light hits you can hear just on the other side of the surface of the stone wall javelins other things are being shot at the stone wall-- -- but it's keeping it at bay you guys are now at the wall and behind you the tunnel continues into a passage you haven't seen yet you can certainly try a level two potion would be 4d4 + 4 okay 17 points to clarota which-- administering a potion to a mind flayer is an experience that very few in this world have probably ever or ever will experience as you kind of reach over grab his shoulder you look for where to put it and the tendrils kind of like flail about but begin to-- they as he notices what you're doing kind of relax and open up and you can now see the circular lamprey-like toothy maw of the mind flayer it's a very disturbing disgusting image with this jagged yellow teeth in a circular form you pop the cork and just pour it in as you do you see the wounds across clarota's form begin to seal the arrow is still stuck in its torso you can certainly try go ahead and make a-- this would be a medicine check it's iron it's solid iron breaking it off is not gonna work you have to pull it from the wound go for it a nine so you take your moment you view up where the puncture wound is with a little bit of grog's help you both grab the edge and you're like 'on three one two three pull' you pull through the wound not against the arrow-- -- 'cause that would just tear everything out in the process but nevertheless in doing so clarota does take an additional eight points of damage but the wound is now no longer a giant-- -- it's now able to be healed completely so clarota takes a moment and kind of grasps the wound shatters the glass at which point you now hear (impact sounds) against the stone wall he's good enough to walk with you guys well-- so you're helping him yeah clarota gets up on the carpet and-- thank you the carpet kind of drifts alongside you guys you guys are pushing backwards towards the cavern the tunnel kind of begins to pinch a little bit it gets to about a 15-foot width before it opens up again you're about a hundred feet back you can now see it opening into a-- what looks like an extension of the war camp (all groan) go ahead and make a perception check i do keep that-- i keep tabs on that for the most part we've got a few rolls and it worked fine looking inside though this camp looks like it's been abandoned it looks like it was built and then the expansion into the war camp you just escaped from seemed to be the next step like it's slowly advancing and this section of it has been in disuse as you push in towards the center of the camp you can see there's older campfires lots of the tents have like partially collapsed dust has gathered okay looking around as well you see all the equipment any pieces that would be of interest have either been taken-- either destroyed and are broken or have probably been moved into the war camp you glance through a couple of the tents looking about it's definitely been abandoned it no longer serves a purpose and anything of use has been stripped and taken this cavern is maybe about 60 feet up or so it's a little domed section and you can now see there are two exit tunnels to this section one that is kind of straight ahead a little bit to the left and one that veers off to the direct left of you so if you're looking straight from the direction you came there is one right ahead of you a little bit to the left and one that goes quickly to the left yeah do that 'cause they're both kind of left it's a joke clarota takes a moment and kind of looks at you kind of-- his breath i've not been this far up these tunnels it's too dangerous this close to the war camp i would've been killed in a second he kind of closes his eyes for a second one of these leads below one of them leads to the surface i can't recall which going to the one on the far left as you're stepping you hear a (muffled impact noise)-- -- against the distant stone wall that you put up as you head to the tunnel you don't sense any sort of temperature change but it does seem to steady off into a decline that curves to the left we shall say a general sense of this area you look and you can see in this area unlike the previous sections there are small clusters of bats on the ceiling as apparently they have an exit of some kind to the surface okay okay so as you guys are walking over there one of the bats-- -- heads down into the tunnel continues into the darkness from the echolocation which is a very strange sensation you haven't really done this before for a bat and it's a very weird experience it continues about a steady 40-degree decline that goes further and further down eventually you get to a point where the bat is out of your sphere of influence and you lose your connection to the bat no it's a decline all righty there are two tunnels yes correct yes there's one the one on the far end the one that does not appear to be a decline seems to be the widest of the two okay grog goes charging into the darkened tunnel to the very left-- the heavy footsteps of grog disappearing into the darkness-- you guys give chase as you guys catch up to grog which isn't too hard-- are you going to a full sprint though right you catch up to grog the tunnel itself is about 30 feet wide 20 feet tall and it is a slow continuously gradual decline and curve to the left like a spiral downward you guys continue for another 20 or so minutes down before it opens up into a small alcove to the right but the tunnel continues this alcove it's about 35 40 feet in and it looks like there are remnants here of a camp that was set up once similar to the war camp but once again abandoned or at least currently not in use yeah go ahead and make an investigate check all right as you guys are having this conversation vex does a quick glance over there are about four tents that are still set up there appears to be a small ring where a fire was set up and you can see kind of bits of charcoal-- -- and bits of long long long forgotten burnt meat remnants charcoal and such there you do see on one of the walls-- -- there is a similar seal of bahamut however there are four tents here-- which means-- previously you saw just one from what you saw there are four here it's an interesting change to your appearance means either been repurposed or there were more people with her or since then the tent the camp has been used by other individuals aside from her however glancing through you do notice that there are a few discarded travel bags-- -- carrying rope grappling hooks general cluster of torches about eight in total-- and as you glance about you can see in this alcove looking at the dirt itself it looks like there was a serious struggle you can start seeing drag mark-- ah well this is part of your investigation roll essentially unless you want to track to where the tracks went that's a different story that's-- it's hard to tell you see some of the footsteps and some of the drag marks while mostly worn over elements do show some of the fairer folk the duergar have a very distinct footprint or size you do see one that resembles more of like gnomish or halfling origin you see drag marks in the dirt you see other individuals looks like there were chunks of rock that have been chopped off the side of the wall that look fresh where you can see the soot that has settled into this part of the cavern is no longer visible where these scratch marks basically took off and exposed fresh rock they do and they lead down the tunnel further okay so you use your spell you seal off the tunnel with pillars you can just barely get most of the entranceway covered there's a couple of small slivers and spaces between yeah if they were all right so you guys end up making camp are you guys lighting a fire or are you keeping it dark what's your plan it's fairly warm okay fair enough what wood there is is used charcoal in the abandoned fire pit unfortunately you guys get set up fair enough a rest heals you to full you do not have-- like at this point i mean you could-- what're you trying to do i should say do you have any currently built explosives you know what i'll let you go ahead and try it with just your tinker's kit-- it's gonna be a difficult-- -- roll but go for it you add your proficiency bonus which is the tinker's kit is four 15 okay okay you manage to fasten what appears to be a black powder impact-based explosive to the tip of an arrow it's a little weighty and unwieldy it might not be the most accurate thing in the world but if it hits it's probably gonna pack a punch you very gingerly place it within your quiver it's heavy in the tip it's one of those things where you know shooting it is going to be an interesting challenge that's up to you i dunno okay all right as the evening transpires you all get your evenings of rest you guys kind of keeping watch gambling away at a certain point throughout the evening something perks up your ears you begin hearing footsteps many footsteps it sounds like anywhere between six ten more-- from above yeah up the path you guys came from yep all right leaving the rest asleep the three of you make a stealth check you do grog you do again thank you wil all right so-- you were awake too at this point you weren't resting okay then-- if you're not resting you don't get your spells back you are welcome to stay awake if you want but you just won't get your spells back you'd probably be exhausted all right so between the three of you thankfully you had two successes against one failure you manage to cover for your sister-- -- who who 'huh what what' when you wake her up you guys quietly wait-- all right so the footsteps progress through and you-- there's no light source as duergar for the most part do not require light to see in the tunnels you guys have low-light vision not dark vision no it is pitch black you just hear-- -- you just hear the footprints go by you hear them approach the outskirts of the alcove but you're asleep yes you are (all laugh) as the footsteps approach the outskirts of the alcove the rest of you sleeping soundly unaware of what's transpiring-- a few moments pass and the footprints appear to be passing past downward into the tunnel (all laugh) all right so eventually when you feel enough time has passed where those who've been resting come from their sleep spells recovered wounds are healed except for those who didn't sleep you guys maintain the same health you had previously that also puts a level of exhaustion-- so there is one level of exhaustion on both of you currently it just means any ability checks you take-- so any skills you take are at disadvantage until you get a full night's rest okay you can use-- remember you can use your hit dice to heal still before you start throwing potions around if you have a moment to rest-- yeah (sings) fifth edition before you start throwing potions around 'cause remember you're far away from civilization right now you have a very limited number of potions now to lead you through here unless you find some way to return to the surface so you all eventually come back to consciousness in this darkened alcove pitch black it is still warm slight smell of soot and dust in the air what do you guys want to do yes mm-hm it basically matched the wall as you guys went around you're not completely in there he could block off most of it there's like little spaces between-- indeed so this given the point in time that you all wake from your slumber we'll continue this in a few minutes in the meantime we're gonna go ahead and go to our intermission break see you guys back here in about 12 minutes or so all right what you got man go go awesome fantastic perfect yeah do it yes yes yes 826la guys is a charity that we've been been trying to raise money for essentially it's a los angeles-based also in san francisco and other parts of the nation it helps teach and tutor children in literacy storytelling-- it's a really great charity go ahead and look on the website 826lacom for any and all information you require on it but they are a really good cause they're good people and been a fan of their work for a long time so we are happy to help however we can and however you guys are able to help as well so see you guys in a little bit [character intros] and so we will pick it back up so as you all regain consciousness and prepare yourselves for the day ahead once again you've gone a number of days without sunlight without any vision of the sky it's a very disorienting experience for all of you who are unfamiliar with subterranean territory even though you are rested you don't feel rested there's kinks in your back from the rocky floor the best you could find yourself any sort of comfort here is from whatever you have on your back most of you sleep in your armor out of necessity and paranoia as consciousness comes to you you guys are able to try and find your way back out now that you've been sealed in no you have about a five six-inch gap between each of them you do yeah go ahead and make an athletics check actually for this i would say it's a straight strength check this is just physicality strength against the stonework all right all right so as pike-- as you go and swing at the pillar you impact with all your might and the pillar cracks at the impact you're like 'that is awesome' then you look up a few inches and notice that grog's ax is also in the same pillar you guys you take five or six minutes or so you manage to hack away enough in one of the pillars to leave enough room to squeeze through it takes a while you manage to cleave that open you all gather your things you group together and you can continue in whichever direction you wish all right as you guys-- commune (pronouncing correctly) you wanna start a commune in nature okay keeping the best essence-- -- of the scenery around you you take a moment what's the reach of that one whatcha got three miles the natural entities that you can sense in this cavern system are the few clusters of bats that exist in the back portion of the war camp that you guys just ran from that's about it i mean there are a few other strange things that you've seen that live down here but they wouldn't be anything that you would naturally sense all right you guys step back into the tunnel all of you squeezing through with the rest of your materials heading further down about 15 minutes of travel go by and the very air itself is becoming steadily warmer the smell is this combination of still water groundwater type of a scent mixed with an ever-growing kind of sulfur-type brimstone smell make an athletics check make an acrobatics check (impact sound) face down vax a slight bruise on the cheek as you go faceplanting into the stonework ahead of you clarota shuffles alongside you guys as you guys are walking you're welcome to make chatter any discussions you'd like no it was yours versus his it was a direct versus 24 versus 22 he won no it's up to the rolls man as you start to mention that now clarota kind of nods and says aye that's where the colony resides our great city amongst the ruins of jade and glass surrounded by the forest the city below yug'voril that is where the temple resides where k'varn holds the elder brain ah yes make a will saving throw (all laugh) yes okay you feel a mental slap as clarota glares at you from across the tunnel there'll be none of that in my presence i hate puns (all laugh) yes emberhold yes it is black and jagged i think yes you guys are unfamiliar with this tunnel clarota is unfamiliar with this tunnel all you know is it's going down that's better than up you guys press forward and you begin to encounter little trickles on the ceiling of orange glowing little puddles progressing further down you start seeing large clusters little pools of molten rock beginning to form under certain sections in a little ways up you begin hearing some additional footsteps to your own further down the tunnel it is here there's a sheet that has all the information you need scanlan is not happy about this stealth checks both of you all right all right so you guys vanish into the darkness best as you can tell kind of weaving between the portions of the tunnel that naturally shift and give you moments where you can hide up inside as you guys hold back you guys push ahead and you can see the little points of glowing light where these lava pools every 100 or so feet begin to appear you begin listening out and you hear these footfalls are very heavy and the gait of whoever is walking seems to be wider than that of the normal humanoid probably a good 60 70 feet you hear some muttering no looking on the ground you guys have no light source currently it's pitch black do you want to go to the nearest lava pool all right it's very very faint visual you can see there are a number of tracks up and down all different sizes this area this tunnel is traversed quite a lot listening you hear two sets of heavy footsteps and you hear what sounds like some sort of squeak sound like a (squeaks) from around the edge you can just barely make out these two lumbering humanoid shapes they begin to step towards your direction you guys back and kind of flatten yourself against the wall you can see they're now both dragging behind them this small roughshod cart with something inside it okay you pull it across (deep grumbling and laughter) okay so as he throws the leather the leather shifts form suddenly in midair into a serpent that slips onto the ground and slithers in place curling up at the approaching two monolithic entities as they begin to cross in front of you you both pull taut on the rope the immediate one falls forward tripping face-first on the ground a heavy (impact sound) you guys hear in the distance this loud thud impact sound all right you guys come rushing in let's go ahead and roll initiative i figured you were raging you guys coming in this way they are two giant ogres one is back here and one's just fallen over there and they are carrying some sort of large cart-like object i'll just say for now let's say it's about there all right so initiative order guys you do actually i'm rolling initiative so we have the order you guys are gonna have a full round of surprise on them first all right so 25 to 20 20 to 15 so vex and vax both at 15 15 to ten oh grog the ogres each one weighs nearly a ton yes grog close to that all right let's go fast here here we go all right so top of the round-- no surprise round for both of you guys first as the rest of you rush in so vex and vax you guys get a surprise round to the guy on the ground yes he's on the ground so you get advantage on your attack rolls that definitively hits 62 points of damage you leap on and entirely eviscerate the ogre you jumped onto his back slashing the back of his torso as you pull open the flesh you expose the back of the ribcage and he goes into this kind of gurgling sound as it dies immediately on the spot laura marisha and okay okay roll and make a stealth check all right the ogre is right there there is the ogre on the ground big squishy ogre it's considered rough terrain because now you have to go over this giant dead body in the middle of the-- all right your turn 22 definitely hits 25 so as you pull the arrow out it's a little wonky it's actually what you rolled it's a minus four penalty to hit with it but you still manage to hit because it's a big creature even though it's in very big darkness you-- you know in darkness you ignore partial cover you fire it it arcs slightly smacks in the side of its chest and stomach area it's this cacophonous explosion sound that rocks the immediate vicinity it takes an additional 2d8 points of explosive damage nine points and everything around it also takes the additional damage-- -- the whole radius does the cart-- the wood on the wheels had shatters and breaks it falls to one side what you see some sort of a glass container that was at the back of the cart shatters and cracks top of the round tiberius you can move if you want yeah back to here use your pointer if you need it all right tiberius you're up first all right go for it roll for the attack do you ignore partial cover i mean did you take that feat no okay so yeah so you're rolling-- okay so yeah so what did you roll to hit right yeah okay all three rays unfortunately miss-- -- due to the darkness in this room it's very hard to see other than the slight glow from the lava so you fire all three rays and you see them streak through and each one gives off just enough light from the actual flaming ray to glow to the vicinity but not the actual target you see them both streak off and slam the wall on the opposite side you add your spell modifier it's on top of your spell page good to know all three hit go ahead and roll damage there you go it's his first time casting spells guys (mouths) it's not all right okay is there a saving throw for half damage is there a saving throw on this one or is it just straight damage okay cool gotcha all right all right so you you blast the ogre with three as each explosion hits you see the rippling of its kind of grotesque flesh from the impact the third one blasting off a portion of its shoulder exposing this meaty bone and blood it gives out this horrible (roars) into the tunnel itself causing just the atmosphere to shake as bits of stone begin to rumble and fall from the ceiling all right that ends your turn still standing barely it's now its turn it steps away to that point it's just going to charge through as all it can see is the figures in the distance that's where it is at which point the cart seems to shift slightly you can see something slowly-- dark something-- -- amorphous and liquid in nature beginning to shift in the shadow no it's just this giant black liquid-- -- ooze-like creature all right so that brings us to-- scanlan scanlan i know you're out there scanlan scanlan's going to go ahead and sing a song of inspiration to-- i'd say grog just in case he needs to- yeah it's a d8 inspiration dice scanlan is then going to cast invisibility on himself as an immediate self-sustaining reaction that brings us to vex yes okay so you lightning arrow no that's just for you yeah so that hits go ahead and roll the arrow damage okay as the arrow disappears into its form-- -- the bolt of energy as you pull out the arrow and release it it sparks and you can see the blue energy kind of streaking behind the arrow it plunges into this thick black gooey mass and as it does the lightning just gets absorbed into its form it sits for a second shakes and quivers and then splits dividing into two separate smaller slimes seemingly unaffected by the damage of the lightning other than the fact that you altered its form slightly so do you wish to move all right that brings us to-- vax you're up you are yes hits 52 as you reach behind the daggers plunge into it and the ogre lumbering over doesn't have any more to its life its jaw just goes slack as it releases the last bit of air in its lungs tumbling forward piling onto his friend okay okay this direction all right go ahead and make an acrobatics check 15 okay you barely manage to catch your footing thank god you didn't roll a one that would've been very bad this ogre then plummets to the ground now piling on top of his friend so now that whole section there is considered rough terrain all right that brings us to percy there i will tell you the pool of lava right there isn't brimming really close to the surface it would take a significant impact to carve anything that would release it it's self-contained okay this one or this one okay go ahead and roll for attack-- ice shot okay 15 15 hits okay the bullet pierces his form you can see a part of its gelatinous physical structure quiver the ice explosion you see go off and just get absorbed into the gelatinous form seemingly unaffected by the additional damage that's your first shot you get two shots don't you this tunnel looks pretty at this point pretty cleanly carved out over there i mean there's parts of the rock but the explosion was more damaging to things that were fragile-- -- the stonework is pretty solid okay go for it yep damage okay gotcha both shots into it you see its form kind of quiver at the impact but it's still slowly slithering forward now comes to keyleth just barely like he's just in the cusp of 30 feet from you you can certainly try okay what's the thorn whip do what's the thorn whip do read the spell for me what type of damage is it okay gotcha all right so you hit go ahead and roll damage you rolled a 20 right oh you didn't roll yet sorry okay go ahead and roll to hit yep yeah you hit so go ahead and roll damage that still hits it doesn't move very fast it's a little easy to hit all right takes its damage gets pushed just ever so slightly into the hole as it does you can see this blackish steam and smoke begin to billow up from where it hits and it (growls) -- begins to quiver as you're kind of yanking it back with the thorn whip (growls) (all laugh) -- from the impact of the lava that's an additional 17 points of fire damage to it you do is it considered grappled then that would be the end of the attack the spell dissipates after that you've gotta do it again the next turn all right that ends your turn pike you're up okay yes so you do it at range and it creates a 20-foot radius that does this cool so there's that yeah do you wanna move-- where do you wanna go girl you're right over here it's your gold base okay one two three four that's about as close as you can get there yeah yeah you can cast it where do you want to put the radius these are all five-foot squares yeah yeah you can get these both from there okay all right so-- so you go ahead and roll the damage you're casting this as a fifth-level spell it's up to you it's up to you pike you do what you gotta do okay it gets to make a saving throw to see if it gets half damage what's-- okay what's the dc what's your spell dc at the top of your spell sheet dc should be-- 16 okay one makes its save the other doesn't so what's the total damage okay so one takes 25 one takes 13 piercing damage got it and just insects appear in the area doing that much damage does that stay or does that go away at the end of your turn what's the duration so you can keep it there if you want to it just does damage every turn to everything in that radius okay that ends your turn grog you're up all right one two three four five six seven eight that's as far as you can get currently because of the rough terrain and you have to jump over the bodies to get there nice one boom boom boom so you just go charging up overtop the ogre bodies leaping coming down with the-- hammer you said okay go for it so go ahead and roll for attack you have three attacks with this at-- are you frenzying or regular rage okay so you get two attacks 19 hits 12 also hits (all cheer) and damage are you using it two-handed 1d10 damage plus whatever the fire damage is on the weapon what did you roll yeah so three plus your proficiency modifier which is four no this is for damage so the damage would be plus your strength modifier yeah so four still so seven plus two for rage yeah so whatever the bonus is to your greataxe-- what's that so then ten points of damage then roll the fire damage as well it should say on the actual magical item so 1d6 additional fire damage all right so 15 points of damage total from the first strike go ahead and roll damage from the second one so 14 plus an additional 1d6 all right cool all right so as you come running over leaping in the air over the ogre bodies you then slam the hammer once in the side the fire catching on the metal on the black iron as it streaks through the air lighting up the cavern around you you guys see this like red arc as grog comes slamming down into the ooze first one it hits boom smacks the flames ignite and the impact you see it kind of freaks out and quivers backwards screeching sound as it does there's a splash of the black ichor that hits your shoulders-- -- and you feel it burn and bite into your torso you take ten points of acid damage you reach back not even thinking in the frenzy in your brain you feel like just seeing blood and red in your eyes as you slam down your second strike you feel the second impact once again you feel the spray of black across your body you take an additional ten points of acid damage that ends grog's turn on this turn this one pulls out of the lava-- takes an additional 2d10 from being in at the start of its turn an additional eight damage and moves up both of them flank over to grog both of them attempting to strike you from each side as you're flanked that is a 20 versus armor class and a 21 versus armor class all right both of the creatures they (oozing sound) up next to you these pseudopods kind of come billowing out slamming into you with the force of an extremely thick heavy battering ram both hit you for-- let's see here-- one hits you for 12 points of damage-- the other hits you for 14 points of damage remember you're raging so that's halved yeah however both impacts slamming into your body the leftover sludge begins to eat away and corrode the flesh upon impact you take from both sides-- non-halved because it is not slashing bludgeoning or piercing damage-- you take a total of 56 points of acid damage from both slams no from both sides 28 from each clarota moves from here up to here hey it did damage didn't it it certainly did something clarota is going to move forward and is going to attempt a-- it's kind of close-- he is going to attempt a lightning bolt against this guy here clarota did not see way back here i would recommend not arguing with the dm clarota as it released the bolt of energy it streaks past through the air it arcs into the side of the entity which then absorbs it clarota's eyes go wide for a second nervous it looks at its hands and puts them back underneath its robe as it does-- the entity divides once again into two more-- that ends its turn at this point in time now the loud ruckus has been glaring through this tunnel-- you hear (clicking sound) a pair of clacking sounds and you as soon as you look up at the ceiling and you see two large creatures clinging to the ceiling scurrying across with these strange hooked hands before both immediately leap down from the ceiling these two large armored beak-faced subterranean creatures with shells on their backs and giant hooked arms leap down from the ceiling one is going to attempt to strike with both of its hook attacks at pike this is one is moving over tiberius so against pike that is 21 and 13 all right you take 11 points of piercing damage wherever she is and the other one misses clanging against the armor the hook scrapes across metal leaving this extremely loud sound the other one goes twice against tiberius that is a 16 and a nine both miss barely getting out of the way this giant large armored creature right there take a look-- all right that ends that so top of the round tiberius you're up all right pretty heavy say probably close to 500-600 pounds it's about right there it's about 35 feet he makes a saving throw that fails entirely so the creature in front of you lifts up in the air and starts flailing about with its hooks trying to find some purchase in the ceiling you toss it over and it lands squarely into the pool of lava in the center of the tunnel you hear screeching in pain as it begins trying to find his way out okay as it's fully submerged all right that is 45 points of fire damage on it immediately as it's slowly sinking into the pool of lava tiberius just telekinesis-ed him up in the air and threw it into the lava pool the other one there okay go ahead and roll-- add your-- yeah 15 right now because of the level of darkness in the room and because of its distance from you-- you just managed to fire just out of the range of the creature it hits the wall behind him leaving the slick of ice across the stone wall behind it but unfortunately not the actual creature okay there is now an ice spike jutting out of the wall right there all right that ends your turn unless you want to move still got your move action this way now it would be the ogres but they're all dead (all cheer) sees pike in great danger sings a quick little ditty to go ahead and give an inspiration dice to pike so you get a d8 to help you with any sort of attack rolls any saving throws ability checks just attack rolls saving throws and checks scanlan is going to attempt to dominate the monster using his dominate creature spell saving throw it does not make it the creature that was harrowing pike suddenly drops its claws for a second turns away from you and starts looking back towards the oozes and grog that brings us to vex you're up the big one over here you do it's dark and you have no light source currently so you can try a shot but it's going to be at disadvantage it gives a very dull glow to the room it's enough where you can see there is something there you can even take a shot as opposed to not having any chance same possibility because you're currently blocked by this creature that's currently sinking into the lava okay no he's ten feet from it okay so you have two attacks 13 misses unfortunately that hits so the first one you fire towards it except the arrow just (whoosh) into the lava and (puff) with a slight puff of smoke on the second one if you'd like to all right so you moved the hunter's mark over he is now your quarry go ahead and roll the additional fire damage and your quarry damage 22 damage all righty the one arrow disappears the second one as you release it from the bowstring you feel the slight tingle of the arcane energy released into the arrow the arrow bursts into flame as it releases from your bow streaking and piercing the front of its hide as it's trying to claw its way out both of its claws are at the edges of the lava and it's pulling itself screeching its mouth and eyes wild with the severe pain it's feeling as it's slowly melting him from the bottom the arrow (impact sound) into its shoulder and burst into flame it's now freaking out it looks like it's having a really really rough time making its way out do you want to move or you going to stay where you are that's you there all right so right there all right there all right that ends your turn vax you're up acrobatics check you jump impact and barely land next to them it does get one swipe of attack of opportunity on you as you pass by that is going to be a 20 so as you leap off of it its hook swipes up towards you you go ahead and take 14 points of piercing damage all right i will eat this later okay all righty all right that hits what is the piercing damage from the dagger daggers are piercing so yeah thank you kindly mysterious appearance of paper towels right well it's a sneak attack because it is flanking okay got you cool all right so second dagger go ahead and-- that hits go ahead and roll damage no you'll do only one sneak attack per round eight gotcha so as you rush you leap off take the scratch in the air from the hook horror creature you land on the ground slash one with your dagger slash the other both slashes are almost simultaneous as you hit you feel your blades gain purchase in both creatures and you look down at your arms as the horrible burning sensation filters onto your hands as the splash-back you take a total of 20 points of acid damage from the melee attacks you took against the creatures 20 total yes all right that brings us to percy percy what you got okay so right there okay this one here okay hits 26 nice all right that brings us to keyleth yeah gotta eat sometime guys all right there all right so you're coming out of eagle form okay okay all right so what is the radius effect on that 15-foot cube okay so like this cube here all right cool so they both get saving throws you can do that okay neither makes their saving throw so go ahead and roll damage or whatever it does 2d8 to each what is the damage type on that okay so i'll go ahead and say it's thunder damage all right so they're pushed how long ten feet yeah so they're pushed right there got it unfortunately it's not far enough is that your turn all right pike you can yes all right it's what you do as a healer yo 4d8 plus five nice sorry no bonus action to do the item move action to cast the spell so that's your turn well done all right that brings us to grog all right so it's level two exhaustion okay okay all right so you pick up pike level two exhaustion your speed is halved so you can only move 20 feet you grab her you turn-- -- run that way right there okay so that's as far as you can get unfortunately-- -- 'cause you're double-fatigued as you run past both of those slimes-- -- flash out with pseudopods as reactions so two attacks against you that's a 22 and a 19 all right so both slam you for 24 points of bludgeoning damage you're not raged so it's not halved so 24 against you with an additional 56 points of acid damage they haven't hit him yet that was just grog running away both of them getting attacks of opportunity on him and both hitting grog falls face-first right next-- right like literally cradling-- his unconscious body is cradling the two dead ogres right now this slight sound of 'sss' as the acid is like sizzling and scarring his flesh that brings us to their turn these three oozes turn actually this one's going to move here-- -- towards pike you get an attack of opportunity on it if you like-- -- as it slips away yeah you still have roll to hit it hits 11 points of damage yeah all right cool so the one that's attacking you pike that is a-- -- 23 versus armor class all right you take 12 points of bludgeoning damage from the impact of the pseudopod with an additional 28 points of acid damage yeah so a total of 40 points of damage from the strike the other two are going to attack you that's going to be a 19 versus armor class it hits yeah okay the other one is a 14 so that misses all right so as you pull that away you-- you take half-damage from the strike all right so that's-- this was a 40 take 20 points of damage total from the bludgeoning and the acid all right that ends their turn clarota-- -- is going to step forward to there clarota reaches forward uses his own-- taking a note from tiberius uses his telekinesis spell the arcanist marks on its body flare up and as it does you can see this large creature-- -- gets lifted up and slams on top of this hook horror-- -- pushing it further into the lava and doing additional acid damage to the hook horror which-- -- which completely dissolves and melts the hook horror (all cheer) as it pushes down the ooze just touches the edge of the lava not taking full damage from the impact but just enough from the portion of it liam (jimmy stewart voice) clarence clarence -- creature in the lava both hit it's prone that deals six plus 14 eight all right the hook horror that scanlan's controlling slams its hooks down into the ooze causing the ooze to get pushed further into the lava as you see its form begin to dissipate and slowly disintegrate into the pool of lava leaving this dark cooled kind of surface element to it slowly breaking apart dissipating over the magma end of its turn it's going to try and make a saving throw against the domination effect rolls a natural 20 breaks the effect however i feel like it did its good for the turn yeah he did he took 20 points of acid damage from each strike all right that brings us to the top of the turn tiberius you're up over here mm-hm so you're going to glacial spike in the-- kancho him magically kancho arcane cheat code all right so go ahead and roll to attack that definitely hits go ahead and roll damage 20 damage all right and he's grappled correct push him shove all right all right so he does make his saving throw unfortunately so it doesn't push him into the lava but it does slam him and does a shit-ton of damage to him so looking rough just a little bit how many points do you have now okay right right all right go ahead and roll for that uh-huh makes his saving throw again unfortunately it does not push him does additional points of damage he's looking really rough you can see now this ice has encrusted around the outside of its armor and where the wounds from the impact are there's cracking shards of ice crystal jutting outward from his asshole scanlan's turn should have had your sheet scanlan scanlan's going to go ahead and for the hell of it run up and make an attack (all laugh) why not pulling out his singing sword arches in the air and begins humming to it as he walks upon-- the humming kind of adds this vibration element like a tuning fork blade as he arcs the sword down the blade swings down to where the ice has encrusted the back of its armored shell scanlan takes the blade swings it down and pierces it directly into where that ice has gathered as it does it cracks open the back of its armored shell almost peeling it open like a shrimp you can now see all its fleshy innards are exposed to the outside it's looking extremely extremely close to death it's screaming in pain kind of thrashing about now vex you're up this guy all right all right go ahead and roll for attack very nice very nice that hits you do yeah mm-hm all right with a sickening (splat) sound the ooze splatters across the floor leaving a small sizzling pool that's scarring the rock below it you can see it slowly depressing into the ground you gonna stay where you are all right that brings us to vax both daggers that hits nine hits hits none of them are sneak attack unfortunately nine and an eight gotcha both daggers splash into it you can see where they would slowly be scarred and damaged as they return to your belt you can feel there a slight bit of liquid left and you shake it off quickly but no other effect that that it looks like it's having a hard time keeping its form together it's kind of shaking and (oozing sound) as it moves still running towards pike that brings us to percy mm-hm all righty is this against the ooze all right yep the first shot hits and the ooze kind of quivers it leaves this kind of gaping hole and it begins to slowly reform itself before it can you see the other weak spot where the top of its physical form is barely wavering and it's able to keep corporeal you aim the second shot and as you fire it detonates and that portion of its upper torso-- whatever it would be-- gets flung off and splats against the wall the rest of it slowly liquefying as the rest of the slime is destroyed okay keyleth vax you mean yeah you do all right go ahead and roll for attack that hits definitely go ahead and roll damage okay how do you want to do this (all cheer) and (dragging sound) as you do it it plummets face-first into the-- -- both into the magma and the slightly still-sizzling form left over from the ooze that had melted there as you do it slams down you hear it scream underneath as its body begins to quiver the wind burst hits and the cool air rushes through the tunnel all of your guys' hair and everything gets blown back for a second you have to cover your eyes and as you look back-- (all laugh) as tiberius hits light in the tunnel you can see the-- -- hook horror which a portion of its upper torso is now encrusted into the actual cavern floor all right i ate pizza in front of you guys i don't care it was tasty thank you delicious pizza as grog you come to consciousness again-- yeah if you'd like all right so as you guys steel yourselves for a moment kind of recovering from that fateful encounter you-- to everyone everyone heals 22 points of damage all right (all laugh) you guys push forward down the tunnel-- for another 20 or so minutes bringing yourself along sore from the impact of the battle bits of your armor scarred by the way your armor-- -- what type of armor was it all right for the acidic nature of this-- look at that you wipe it off thankfully the magic enchantment protects the armor entirely grog what armor do you have just regular hide currently as you're walking you look down and notice that the armor on your torso has near-completely dissolved as it stands you have no additional armor class bonus for any armor your hide armor is gone it is completely dissolved all right so you take a moment and hand him new armor and grog this scarred nearly naked goliath form has been lumbering through this hallway-- hoo modesty grog (all laugh) so mark that for your ac okay okay here's the circumstance for you real fast before we get to that so grog the armor you had on was hide which was a dex bonus of 12 plus your dex studded leather is also the same so your ac actually goes up so what was your ac previously 18 it should now be 20 just the two of you all right well go ahead and roll an investigation check okay looking at the cart the cart is a rickety wooden thing but what was in the cart was a large glass unit a containment unit that was sealed off you can see the inside of it has slight scarring to the glass but it seems to be resistant to whatever the loose creature was contained in it along the inside of the cart you notice there are a couple of just left over chunks of flesh of different colors patches or pieces you see like part of a hand that's just in there partially decomposed to a certain extent it looks like these were either used to feed whatever the creature was in there or remnants of some other strange collection based on the best you guys can ascertain this creature was part of the experimentation-type process that the weird naga creature you fought earlier came from ogres are wearing nasty nasty tattered at this point hide armor they both carry total amongst the two of them about 24 pieces of gold if you'd like to yeah so mark that in your inventory you have some hand-sized shards of broken glass anything else you guys wish to do in this section and now it has cooled yeah okay go ahead and do that as many as you'd like take a moment you can spend any hit dice now that you need to to heal yourself just make sure to mark how many you've used all right as you guys take a moment to heal yourselves you pull yourselves back up to your feet and you tread further down this tunnel another 25-30 minutes of the slight curvature and it gets steeper and steeper until eventually it opens up into a familiar cavern to some of you you see a large waterfall pouring down from above-- you are on the outskirts of where the next tunnel opens up where there are a few small streams of lava pouring from the ceiling you look above and you can see the top of the downward cavern there's the giant lake beneath and across the way you can see the waterfall where clarota was originally discovered yes yeah so-- and i'll have more of this for you guys next week the path you guys took was essentially-- lead to this back area which i'll draw for next week and a tunnel that curved all the way around and exited right there other than the fact you've completely destroyed one of the mind flayer generals as well as the one helming the war camp above you've acquired new magical items and defeated one of the abominations that was created for the siege war i think you accomplished quite a few things though maybe not as directly as you were hoping all right so you taking the flying carpet it's a very precarious journey as the weight limit for the carpet-- you can go ahead and cast fly on your bear trinket awkwardly (bear noises) manages to swim her way down to the bottom floor as you make your way to the base of the watery lake at the bottom you can see a swish to the water and a very familiar sight briefly shows itself in the distance as you see a slick domed fish-like head protrude with a few tentacles in the distance you all instinctively step quite a distance away and it seems to withdraw back into the water nothing bestial of it this is not a natural creature clarota once again whispers to the rest of you stay at bay the aboleth is dangerous you all step back and turn now into the the tunnel that extends further into the heart of this mountain you see streams of lava pouring from the top occasionally and one central flow of molten rock tends to fill half of the cavern like a small river heading down into the base of the mountain this is very familiar to you as it's the path that your dream took you as you guys begin to step into the next lengths of your subterranean journey we'll pick that up next week thank you all so much for tuning into critical role some tense battles an intense encounter choice on you guys' part well done on that what is this congrats amy (all cheer) awesome we'll all do that thank you amy that's awesome 19 away from our next package aw boom that's apparently the path this is taking so-- yeah second week in a row so the chat room creature choice those will be an occasional thing not a weekly thing 'cause it's too difficult to keep up with that and a little too random plus that's just too many creatures to be prepared for but every few weeks or so i'm gonna throw one out there for you guys so come and watch hopefully you'll be there for one of those episodes put your friends together vote for the creature you want to see them fight and if a tpk happens not my fault
