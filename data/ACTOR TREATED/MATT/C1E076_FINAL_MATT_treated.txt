really cool to have a space to do that that's the thing too guys please send in your questions they're extremely helpful and i like the idea that we can have some great thoughts without just reading from a chat room that's scrolling at a thousand miles per hour yeah asktalksmachina thank you very much laura do you want to talk about some of the things that we have in the store i spot them every now and then in the wild and it's one of the weirdest experiences of my whole life should i say something i don't know i feel like i should like donald sutherland in the body snatchers perfect perfect

are doing the same we'll miss you guys next week but we'll be back the week after at the beginning of december for the rest of this absolute basket of chaos yeah it'll give you two weeks to build your characters great without further ado let's go and jump into tonight's episode of critical role [dramatic music] this close every single time that was kind of absurd however you were given the option as opposed to now having sold yourselves into slavery to the giant to instead do this grand favor for them apparently the past lover of this giant was killed in the streets by a pit fiend named ghurrix who occasionally wanders the slave district called the arches here in the city of brass you agreed to go find and kill this pit fiend out of vengeance for the giant and as such you would be freed from your current onus and be given the armor that is in the possession of juuraiel this giant as well so everything should be great you guys applied a seeming enchantment across the party allowing most of you to look kind of like copies of vex and vax the sexy sextuplets as you put it the kind of things you'd want to purchase made your way to the slave market called the arches with scanlan shorthalt disguised as a flame-wreathed azer a fire plane dwarf you proceeded to try and sell this party to the pit fiend ghurrix as he walked through the area after acquiring and purchasing two celestial-blooded boys who were on another slavery block that's disgusting bait and it was bait and it's worked out well so far as it got the attention of the pit fiend the pit fiend wandered to where you had set the entrance to your mansion scanlan upon some conversation seemingly were unable to convince the pit fiend to suddenly step into this unsafe spectral doorway that you had attempted to coax him into as many of you emerged into the street with pike and percy hiding within the mansion the rest of you set the stage here at the mouth of this alleyway the nearby bubbling of a lava stream just off to the right side of you keyleth hidden in the back of the alleyway decided that while this moment was still tense to use the element of surprise and attempted to feeblemind the pit fiend unfortunately it was resisted by the creature who then as an instinctive reaction summoned a friend known as an erinyes from the nine hells to join ghurrix at his side and that is where we left off we're going to bring up some boss music here seeing as how we're in the fire elemental plane i think it's important that we have some proper fire elemental plane lighting would you like to phone a friend that's not going to help to give you guys some context set-wise this is the doorway the entrance to scanlan's mansion big as the doorway you could have made back here is keyleth who had fired off the spell here we have vex and trinket who you had popped out as well as vax who had just stepped out of the portal scanlan with in front of you the two boys and grog was off here to the side here we have ghurrix himself as well as his ally companion and a number of other slavers and/or slaves that currently line the streets as part of this who are now watching as this conflict may seem to erupt here there are efreet you didn't see any around at the moment no and they are called the illuminated you don't know you can certainly ask there is an edge to a building there and part of a thoroughfare walkway i'd say probably two stories probably not however i would like to ask you all to roll initiative all righty so looking at how things stand here currently 25 to 20 24 okay yeah what's pike's roll natural one so pike is at the bottom rolling in character for her that's great great 20 to 15 hold on so grog and vax 19 percy 18 all right scanlan what did you get 13 perfect given that standpoint we are at the top of the combat round you watch as the pit fiend's wings unfurl the jaw clenches as the fangs now protruding from underneath its demonic visage it looks past all of you into the alleyway the source of the magic that seemed to affect it now its current intent the other the devilish female that stepped through the brief portal her wings unfurled floating gently off the ground holding the longsword in one hand a longbow strewn over her shoulder and some sort of strange wound rope or lasso on her belt side fully armored now looking intently as to what her next target is going to be vex you are at the top you're the top 24 okay hunter's mark all righty ghurrix correct you still have to roll to hit but then when it hits it does the damage and then the strength save is to see if it's restrained or not okay trinket rushes through trinket comes charging upward (roars) what's it say for the specific ability so yeah one of your attacks would be a bramble shot all right go for it what did you roll a natural one again bramble shot goes wide swooping past it and slamming into the building behind it you watch as the arrow explodes and a series of vines tangle outward and wrap around the side of the building all right all righty 25 hits yeah 25 damage all right you already used your bonus action to hunter's mark so he cannot all right do you wish to move okay yeah you can go ahead and dive into that little alcove there i'll put you just slightly in there and there you are you're not quite hidden but you're peeking around the side from ghurrix oh from trinket you are roughly 40 a little over 40 feet away all right no worries that's your turn keyleth you're up right next to him no he's currently standing next to this block with a slave that's in chains that it's holding the chain to and was in the middle of barking before all of a sudden it watched this summoning happen he's looking over right now and watching curiously about what's going down large watery sphere all right so we'll use this as the watery sphere we'll set it facing right there all right what's the save they have to make both of them have to make a strength saving throw all righty that is a 21 for the pit fiend what's the dc 19 so it succeeds the erinyes makes an eight she does not succeed while the sphere seems to splatter and try and encompass the pit fiend it is unaffected by the torrent of water however the winged erinyes who's floating in the air seems to be pulled into it and is now thrashing about within the water itself you conjure the sphere-- from what i can see right here no you create the sphere and they are restrained and then future turns as an action you can move it you know some bonus shit is that your turn are you going to move sure all righty all right that end your turn all right that brings us to vax you're both tied you and grog are both at the same initiative level so you both go at the same time but it's up to you who goes first that you can yes we can totally do that that you can it's how it's supposed to be man just saying your grapple can replace an attack as we said before so go ahead and make a strength athletics check correct 22 moving up you have him currently grappled travis and you currently have him grappled with your arm right now you know what sure why not yeah because currently i'd say for the purposes of the grapple because it takes you all of your strength to do so you would not be able to attack with your axe while you have him grappled that wouldn't function you have him grappled go ahead and make another athletics check he rolled a 17 plus eight so that is a 25 so no as you attempt to lift these giant devil claws jam into the side of your shoulders and as the pain hits it forces you down and you can't get enough lift his wings are just too big he's too dense you're still holding onto him all righty all right that ends grog's turn yes you are well you're right next to him back that way we'll say for the purposes of this you're back behind him okay so how far up did you fly 38 gotcha all right that ends your turn let me go look up your spell until the spell ends the creature is immune to being frightened and gains temporary hit points equal to your spellcasting ability modifier at the start of each of its turns at the start of your turn you get-- basically all righty that ends your turn percy you're up you're currently inside scanlan's mansion last thing you saw was scanlan reach out and go fucking jenga and then disappear back into the doorway you look out the door you see the two chained celestial-blooded boys standing there looking confused and frightened you see scanlan holding their chains from behind currently glancing up as vax has darted off winged and has begun throwing daggers from the air 50 feet up and behind where the pit fiend is that's what you see sure your hand is out of the doorway cool go for it okay strength ability checks 22 hits okay 15 plus four okay good 26 hits yep all righty good that hits not yet first round is going good for you guys what was it again okay good to know that ends percy's turn that brings us to the pit fiend let's see here silly grapple okay even with disadvantage that is an athletics check of 25 i need you to make an athletics check marisha and it bursts out of your grasp and takes up in the air with its giant wings you do get an attack of opportunity on it as does trinket actually it (whoosh) in the air it's actually going to stay about-- let's say about 15 feet up about there that's all he can do with his turn because of the trying to break out of the grapple how much damage is that oh what was your roll to hit okay go for it 27 that hits go ahead and roll damage 21 hits go ahead and roll i'll let you choose 13 all right trinket as he bites upward it doesn't do anywhere near the impact you think it would even for a nice solid bite it seems to be resistant to trinket's damage half damage from bears no that ends ghurrix's turn all right that brings us now to the erinyes the erinyes is going to attempt to escape that's a 17 plus four that's 21 breaks free of the sphere erinyes which can go 60 feet up is going to fly up onto the rooftop there your sphere is left there on the ground however wasted the action to try and break through all right that ends their turns the two celestial boys try and pull against the chains do you let go or do you hold them there okay they both run this way do you yell this as they start to run way okay they don't really know what the heck is going on i'm going to roll to see if they recognize that in the panic okay both roll tens they both hear you stop turn and bolt into the mansion what a dick what a dick move all right scanlan you're up 15 feet up off the ground currently you are currently about 55 feet 50 to 55 feet you can move just so you know vax you didn't get temporary hit points did you cast it on yourself or on scanlan you can't have two concentration spells up at the same time yes it is sure because you're not used to casting spells sure i'll let you what one of them is concentration because it's an action spell one action from your haste spell can only be used for a weapon attack probably that's totally fine sorry i misunderstood earlier and thought you were just casting it on scanlan no worries okay that hits boom all righty great so now it is pike's turn oh that's right keyleth do you want to take an inspiration dice keyleth would be like i like whipped cream there you go so take your inspiration dice in misunderstanding scanlan's extremely gross limerick that's your bonus action that's your movement what do you want for your action all righty interposing hand you have half cover keyleth as bigby's hand is essentially giving you some sort of armor bonus it gives her half cover target can't move through the hand's space if its strength score is less than or equal to the hand's strength score the hand's strength score is 26 it is equal so it can move through the hand hold on oh it's less or equal to so no it cannot move through the hand sorry i misread it currently if it tries to force its way through the hand it's going to hold it in place there we go all right so that finishes your turn all right now it's pike's turn yes you are for the time being pike is inside the mansion right now she watched percy step into the door frame fire a few shots out and then duck right behind it again right now all she sees is grog and trinket were attacking the pit fiend as it flew off and that's all she sees now is grog and trinket by themselves outside on the street and this watery sphere that's floating in space okay where is she going to cast it (laughs) that's more of a flavor element okay in true sarenrae fashion all right so for the purposes of that we will say that this glowing yellow-- all righty so we'll say that it's in the same space as him where you conjure it there at a fourth level so at fourth level that means its attacks do 4d8 plus five per hit if it hits now that it's landed so you cast a spell it makes a melee attack so go ahead and roll a d20 adding ten to that that hits so go ahead and roll 4d8 plus five that's all the bonus action she cannot cast any other spell unless it's second level or lower things that are helpful aid let's see there is prayer of healing let us all cross our fingers that blindspot finishes that thing they're shooting soon and she comes back to us that's not how that works you know what we'll say for the purposes of this if you want to cast aid on somebody otherwise right now you'll have to miss the turn because we have to keep this going okay up to three creatures within 30 feet their maximum hit points increase by five and scanlan technically grog pike and scanlan would all work if you wanted to do that or you could do channel divinity if you prefer that no it hasn't been seven days so she can't do it yet since the vorugal battle trinket scanlan and pike so that's five additional hit points to trinket's maximum to scanlan's maximum and to pike's okay and then pike darts back in there you go all right that ends the first round of combat next round i'll actually be able to do some things vex you're up at the top of your turn as you glance up you can see (whooshing) this hellish devil creature its presence itself quakes you to the core i need you to roll a wisdom saving throw 23 okay you manage to resist the creature's fearful aura yeah you may take the rest of your turn 30 hits go ahead and roll damage on that you vanish inside the mansion all righty all right that ends your turn keyleth top of your turn even with the hand there the creature's size is so large and voluminous by comparison to it and you see it's still trained on you i need you to make a wisdom saving throw 21 just succeeds you guys are rolling real well tonight it's frustrating me it's on par but we've only just begun continue what are you doing keyleth your water sphere is still over there all right splashes into the ground all righty earthbind there that is a strength saving throw against your dc saving throw that is a natural 20 so yeah no effect unfortunately the spell gets shrugged off it looks like we have an ashley keyleth yeah you can back away if you want to you're right behind here you see no entrance to the tower but you can tuck into this little alcove there if you want this way if you want to if you move around-- well he's 15 feet above you yeah he's a bigger creature moving beneath him there's a possibility he may be able to hit you with something if you move past him sure over there into the lava okay so there's a grasping vine over here all right it lashes out toward it 30 feet it has to make a dexterity saving throw at a 26 yeah the vine reaches out toward him and he (whiplash) out of the way and it whips into the air and withdraws back tuck in there okay as you rush underneath him heading down he has a large mace in his hand he sweeps down toward you as you go darting i'm going to actually roll a percentile dice to see if it manages to catch you at your height because you're a little over five feet tall you do the interposing hand is helping you against ranged creatures the cover doesn't really-- well let me check just to be sure it does say 'opposite side of the cover' so yeah it's a plus two to your ac as it charges underneath it would catch you as you run past that is a 26 to hit okay so as you go rushing underneath him scooting behind this wide arc he swoops downward with the mace and it clocks you in the side of the head as a burst of flame comes bursting out from the side of it as you continue to run you can already feel the blood pouring down the front of your face from the impact 18 points of bludgeoning damage plus 29 points of fire damage to the head (whack) the mace bursts into flame as soon as it begins to arc toward her as it hits her in the side you watch her stumble into the side of the alleyway the blood pouring from her face the flames burn the edges of her hair the mace is now alight angrily that end your turn keyleth keyleth you're done vax you're up actually no we'll let grog go first since you guys decided to do that i'll switch you in the order here grog first well what does it say on the boots the roof is about where she is she's about 25 feet up you would be able to get up onto the roof and probably close enough to maybe get a throwing attack on her you leap up you might actually be able to do melee on this looking at where she is she wasn't quite that high so you could actually make a melee attack i was looking at her stand for her height but that's just her-- you can yes 25 hits both hit this is going to be nasty actually hold on was it 22 yeah that's not going to matter okay so it still hits go for it all righty 37 whew that's nasty all righty so two heavy hits as you rush up using the boots you leap onto the rooftop coming down with your axe into two giant swings across the armored lady each hits her and you see sparks fly and a bit of blood begin to seep from some of the wounds definitely taking a nice little chunk out of her well and you don't have time to really ask because she hisses in your face all right that end your turn all right vax now correct okay go for it as you arc around here-- that hits okay there's not enough space technically-- so you're going to go across the way from here and scanlan you are not your heroism goes away so which direction are you going over here that's why i bought you guys laser pointers all righty so we'll say for this we'll put you right there cool all right that ends your turn percy okay so you step out of the doorway and look around-- because currently if you just poke out all you see is the street in front of you so you have to step out of the door and look around the side okay so you step out of the doorway look off to this side you have a view of him okay yeah it doesn't do damage it just brings him down oh sorry but yeah so 20 does-- ability checks versus saving throws so he rolls a 20 what's the dc okay if you haven't updated it that's your own fault all right so it succeeds the save it does not get reduced but it does take double damage so go ahead and roll for that okay okay 25 hits that is a 26 on the strength save all right cool 24 total all righty 21 hits (laughing) rolled the same 26 no he's-- 18 plus eight yeah i bought a dice to combat you percy okay 15 got it all right cool going this way this way there you go okay that ends percy's turn next up is ghurrix ghurrix who currently the issue with the hand being a problem it's frustrating-- (laughter) it's going to go ahead and make four attacks on you bite claw mace and tail okay the first one is the claw that is a 32 all righty so that is 13 points of slashing damage with the claw so half of that would be six the bite attack against you that is-- okay so 26 to hit what's the range on that 60 feet right yeah so that's fine 26 to hit go ahead and roll your d12 that'll do it so frustrating okay so as he goes in to bite you duck out of the way and it's going to grasp for your throat however the shouting scanlan causes his eyes to dart to the side and it just misses by an inch it's going to go for its tail attack now that is a natural 20 all right natural 20 (groans) i'm not even joking i'm going to take a picture 'cause that's fun that's fun oh yeah that's the one i use for my big actions oh no this is where it starts hey that was the tail right so that's 3d10 that was amazing i kind of wish i was using that on the mace but that's fine that's 46 points of bludgeoning damage sorry 44 take that back sorry 44 there you go 44 points of bludgeoning damage doesn't hit okay so that ends its turn at the moment and you know what actually-- it's going to go ahead and fly down a bit behind there you do get an attack of opportunity if you'd like yeah just reaching over toward it 16 no now the erinyes which is up against you grog let's see yep it's going to go ahead and first reach off to the side and take its rope that it has throws it out in your direction the rope suddenly sparks to life like a magical snake and begins wrapping around your body rapidly all right go ahead and make either a strength or dexterity check no effect the rope that tries to wrap around you bursts off and whips back to the side the erinyes is now going to attempt to fly back and away from you which is going to offer you an attack of opportunity grog it's going to pull its bow out its longbow while it's up in the air pull back and loose an arrow against you grog that is 21 yes all righty so you take seven points of piercing damage halved plus 14 points of poison damage which is not halved i need you to make a constitution saving throw you do so you take half that actually so you take seven points of poison damage you still need to make a constitution saving throw yeah you're fine you resist the poison effect as it pulses through your system all right it still has a little more movement so it's going to go ahead and dart over we'll say she darts down and vanishes behind this there all righty that brings us to scanlan nope she jumped up on the top of the tower okay so you're changing it from the interposing hand to a lift okay so we'll say bigby is pretty easy to lift you up how far can you move bigby in a turn yeah so it would take ten i'll say 15 feet to scoop you up so there's another 45 feet that you can rise up if you want to bigby's hand can lift you up to about there so you can see with half cover the erinyes down there and three-quarters cover from the-- it's hard to say i'd say probably anywhere between 50 60 feet the erinyes is a little closer she's maybe 35 40 feet from you you can probably aim it so it wouldn't sure you can do that you have to declare the spell and whatever the trigger is and who are you casting it on okay good to know all right pike you're up you are inside the mansion the doorway of which is right there it's this tiny little spot there you don't see any of your friends except for trinket who's across the way you occasionally hear bouts of battle outside to really see what's going on you'd have to step out of the mansion not at all as you step out you don't see either of them they are currently not visible from your perspective but she doesn't know that the downside of hiding in a mansion good news is you're defended bad news is you don't know what's going on and scanlan way up in the air above you being held by bigby's hand yeah you can move it 20 feet understood you're about 30 feet from keyleth okay there you go keyleth it is it's floating up in the air about 15 feet up in this alleyway here you don't really know where any targets are at the moment but you can still move it 20 feet if you want to you don't know where either of them are all right that's the end of pike's turn top of the round vex you're up you're still inside the mansion all right you fly out of the mansion on your broom we'll say for the purposes of this that you're pretty close to scanlan so as you swoop up to the side you can see just barely aspects of the two of them hiding behind edges of rooftops and towers so over here yes he has three-quarters cover so he has plus five to his armor class to get high enough to even see him that's going to be your full movement so you rolled a nat one first arrow arcs off in the distance 29 hits yeah even with the three-quarters cover all right 20 points of damage nice you can barely see him trinket's full movement he can get there and start trying to climb go ahead and roll an athletics check for trinket yeah for him trinket is leaving these giant claw marks on the outside of the building not quite getting there starting to break the side of the stand that's next to him actually at this point too a number of the individuals on the street that are watching as you're starting to move around people are starting to back away and leave the space these two guys disappear and start heading out of the street to get away from everything these guys all begin to move this direction to get away from it all pulling their various chained servants with them no for the most part once they realized the scope of what's going on they were like we should get out of the way ending vex's turn keyleth you're up no you have no visual on either of them you could try you saw him disappear behind the roof but you don't see him around this way okay you get your full movement there currently no view of him what you would do is you would begin casting the spell and hold your action of casting sunbeam okay and what's the trigger for it visual okay good to know that's the end of keyleth's turn grog you're up yes you can with what sounds like a mild sound of cracking thunder these two sides of his gauntlets slam causing grog's size to swell to astronomical proportions what are the limitations on the boots right and there's no limitation to the number of times it can be used gotcha cool so you could attempt to do it okay so as you jump and leap i need you to make an athletics check so you leap across the way and catch onto the side of the building there your fingers sink into the stone your titanstone gauntlets so that's your bonus action you're now holding on to the side of the building as you climb over the side you do manage to get right over (impacts) right there you see the erinyes is ducked down with the longbow drawn with an arrow looks up and sees your much larger now face grinning over the side as you grin back and then (impact) land on the opposite yes you may 21 does hit however she's going to use her reaction to parry so as you begin to do that she releases the tension on the arrow pulls her longsword out and parries the blade to the side it adds four to her ac and you miss by one the axe slides off and slams into the stonework next to her as she begins to step away from you you don't know that hits go ahead and roll damage 36 oof all righty that end your turn perfect all righty that ends your turn that brings us to vax at the beginning of your turn as you're on the edge of the roof you see the being's right there looming just out of your arm's reach i need you to make a wisdom saving throw 18 the sheer presence of this entity shakes you to the core you are considered frightened right now you cannot go toward him while he's in the line of sight to you your attacks and ability checks have disadvantage as long as he's within your line of sight you have disadvantage on all of your attacks and ability checks over here in order to still be in view of the erinyes he's still in view of you so you'd have disadvantage on the attack against the erinyes but you can go ahead and do it you don't get advantage on the attacks for hitting someone you just can sneak attack them so disadvantage streaks off and returns to your side you're landing over here you said you could probably scoot behind that way all righty great so that ends vax's turn percy you're up which way this way okay so you're going to run over this way okay good that ends your turn to get there that'd have to be a dash it's a move and dash you would have gotten onto the bridge there all right so beginning of this turn the pit fiend ghurrix is going to then its claws dug into the side of the roof (roars) dart upward wings out in an upward arc toward scanlan and vex i'm moving this away technically scanlan is there and you're back that way because you went straight up out of the entranceway right right there takes up you go ahead and get the sunbeam and you do yes so as soon as it appears up in the side there you're doing otiluke's resilient sphere otiluke's resilient sphere that is a large creature dexterity saving throw no it cannot it's okay that is a 24 the lower that was 21 so he makes it although technically because he has advantage on the saving throw and you gave him disadvantage it would've been the first roll so yeah it would've been 24 sorry so as the sphere begins to condense around him he shatters it however your sunbeam does still-- so as you watch him appear in the air you finish the spell and release the beam arcing past like a laser across the sky constitution saving throw that is 19 so he saves it it still hits he just takes half damage and isn't blinded so go ahead and roll your damage nope leaps over and flies up right between the two of you who are hovering up like this bright beacon in the sky oh that's right all righty so you go ahead and-- did you make your concentration save against that oh otiluke's was correct yeah so you're falling so you take scanlan-- no 14 points of bludgeoning damage and-- you are about to stumble into it the heat is so extreme at that point that you-- so you take 14 points of bludgeoning damage plus an additional ten points of fire damage due to proximity to heat as the lava's right at the heel of your boots right now all right so as it lands next to you-- it's going to unleash a full series of attacks against you that's a 28 with the claw attack so you suffer-- 18 points of slashing damage for the first one the bite attack is 25 this here you take 15 points of piercing damage-- sorry 15 plus eight so 23 points of piercing damage total i need you to make a constitution saving throw okay so you are now poisoned as the fangs poison your body you feel it pulsing through yourself and you suffer-- 25 points of poison damage from failing the save you see white right now as you slam onto your back and (groaning) the ringing in your ears as this is happening the tail attack is a 29 to hit that is some bad rolls actually 16 points of bludgeoning damage and the mace 25 to hit on the mace so you suffer 18 points of bludgeoning damage so mark that well you took another 18 from the mace hitting you yeah this is the last attack so 18 plus-- so you took the 18 bludgeoning damage plus an additional 15 points of fire damage with that all of a sudden you watch as the mace slams vex in the side her form goes limp arcing through the air the broom spinning off and scattering across-- so it's spinning and scattering behind you as you arc over at the impact that way-- i'm going to roll a scatter die on this that's a three you arc this way so you fall and land onto the stonework there from the fall and impact yeah so you automatically suffer one failed death saving throw from the impact pike you watch as vex crack onto the stonework there one of her legs hanging off to the side no you smack there's no bounce to this might've been worse if it had yeah kinda just crack so that's going to end the pit fiend's turn the erinyes is-- she's going to attempt to move away from you she does not want to be close to you yeah go ahead and take your attack of opportunity 24 that hits go ahead and roll damage nice darts off this way and taking the impact you see she's starting to look a little rough pulls in the side with her longbow she's going to take three shots at-- you're on the ground you just fell out of the sky and impacted she's going to take three shots at scanlan actually you're prone on the ground so you're going to be harder for her to hit three shots at keyleth that is a 28 to hit that is a 19 to hit 18 to hit all three hit okay so you suffer let's see each one of these is poisoned i need you to make a constitution saving throw by the way three technically scanlan does not yeah but scanlan also lost that because he cast it on the-- you would actually have probably lost concentration on that when you took all the damage i forgot to do that because i'm not used to you casting roll four constitution saving throws your constitution saving throw yeah we'll say you maintained it (cheering) okay so you are poisoned so you take on all three hits the first one is going to be 17 points of damage that was crazy i rolled four sevens 28 for the second hit 18 for the third hit so there you go and then the erinyes ducks behind the side there to try and gain some cover off the wall that's going to bring us to scanlan that's as far as you can get is right there the sniper can still get you with 25 movement you can't get far enough away unless you want to use your action to dash actually technically you used half your movement for prone so you can only get that far currently no you can't get that far if you want to and what are you going to do okay so scanlan's holding his turn pike what are you doing you're about roughly 50 feet from her you could yeah what's the range on mass cure wounds range of 60 feet oh in a 30 foot radius so you'd have to move you can get about there move around scanlan and you can get scanlan vex and keyleth if you wanted to all right so that's 4d8 plus five well that's the plus five okay so 31 hit points healed to scanlan keyleth and vex the aid one yeah you still have that technically you can it won't get close enough to fight but it does move a little closer sure it'll be about there yeah we'll say it's a little ways back he needs to move a little bit closer all right that ends your turn okay at this point in time as you're paying attention percy as you're around the corner looking up and seeing the fiend right there you glance over to the right at the top of the round as you watch one of the illuminated begin making its way that way it starts coasting up the side it's coasting through seeing all these things going off spells and shit you see it cruising through the air a little bit high up and is just arriving on the scene here taking in the visual perspective here as soon as it turns around the corner it looks at you looks at everything happening and its hand goes for its weapon looking at all of you surrounding it currently it appears to recognize the individual up above and you all not being from here yeah you do it sees a bunch of vexes and vaxes essentially a bunch of slaves rising up against a pit fiend is what it's seeing so top of the round vex you are prone but conscious all right so that's half your movement there you're still poisoned all right yeah so you are no longer poisoned that is your action by the way by going unconscious you lost your hunter's mark okay make a persuasion roll you toss the gems they scatter across the ground in front of this efreeti holding its weapon to the side he just snarls all right that ends your turn unless you want to move from your current position you have half your movement now so you can move 15 feet okay you move into the mansion all righty that ends vex's turn keyleth you're up okay so saving throw that would be 24 all righty well how much damage does it deal it still takes half damage 16 points of radiant damage you drop the poison when you go into your air elemental form as your bonus action the poison is cast out of your form so you're no longer poisoned yes real fast just to make sure i keep forgetting the sunbeam you had and you took a bunch of hits from the erinyes the damage you took from the erinyes i need you to roll three constitution saving throws i need to remember to do this it's a lot to remember guys my apologies damage that she took from the arrows earlier all right so in theory the sunbeam would already have gone away before-- 14 that's fine what was the damage you took from the third arrow did you write down the damage you took okay i'll say i don't think any attack did more than 26 to you-- it's my own fault for forgetting it's fine so you maintain your sunbeam we're good all righty so you turn into an air elemental do you want to move or stay where you are you can there you go that ends your turn all righty grog totally go for it right all right that hits go ahead and roll damage on that 29 points of damage the axe jams and embeds itself into the back the pit fiend is like (snarling) the voice once again emanates from its telepathic push into your respective brains in the vicinity you have angered the city guard you have no victory now i need you to roll an acrobatics check to land this you are heavy and the chain itself is going to come loose as you come down so roll an acrobatics check you swing and you land you stumble you roll and land straight into the lava okay i'm going to check one thing in here real fast there actually is as i found out later on there is a rule for lava damage i want to make sure sorry i'm looking this up now i'm going to go ahead and use a dice roller on this one this is in the plane of fire and this is the real rules for lava damage as opposed to mine made up earlier and not fully considering the complications so you suffer 63 points of fire damage grog as you are currently terminator-ing it into the lava right now so that ends your turn vax you're up over here liam yeah up to the wall (impact) dagger dagger dagger so flanking advantage first attack is a 26 she's going to pull her longsword out and parry to the side the second attack does not hit she adds a plus four to her ac okay oof nice so as you dart up around and land to the side as you jam the blade into her side she gasps out and you can feel the strange burning warmth of her blood on your hand she's not doing too well all right that ends your turn all right percy in your visual range right now you have the pit fiend up in the air you have the efreeti that just arrived that is currently assessing the situation and is not favorable in your path right now 24 hits strength save to try and-- that's a 27 okay all right make a deception check no okay as you come charging through the doorway you guys watch as percy's form disappears into the space which is immediately followed by a heavy slamming sound as the pit fiend like a keyteor drops right there on the ground right next to pike and scanlan it shouts over its shoulder call your men as it emanates from its psychic wave of telekinetic speech call your men i need aid going to unload on the beacon of divinity that stands before it that has healed-- so as it moves into the space what's the save on that again that is a 22 plus eight to his dex saving throw there he has resistance he slams onto the ground as you wave at him pike he makes his claw attack against you that is a 19 plus that's a 34 to hit so that is 20 points of slashing damage ashley it's going to attempt to bite you it's a natural 20 on the bite that's not good at all that is 40 points of piercing damage ashley and i need you to make a constitution saving throw all right so you also suffer as the poison courses through your body that is 25 points of piercing damage i'm not going to double that because technically it's not the attack it's the poison that hurt you the poison isn't critical that's a gift now it's going to swing with its tail action that is a 20 to hit well hold on you're going to cutting words roll that d12 man you earned that shit that's enough so the tail sweeps over to try and smash pike as you start singing the tail halfway through stops and it looks at you then continues the swing but that's just enough for pike to dodge out of the way as it cracks into the stonework however it then backswings with its mace toward you with its final attack pike that is a 22 to hit so you suffer 15 points of bludgeoning damage plus-- you're unconscious well that would have been an additional 24 points of fire damage so pike is poisoned and unconscious scanlan you feel the blade at your side begin to vibrate at the end of your song the mythcarver that's been sitting there it begins to shake and quiver at your side the erinyes is against you now it's its turn throws the bow to the side on the ground pulls its longsword out and is going to go three attacks against you having jammed your blade into its side first one is going to be a 19 that is a 13 last hit is a 24 that is even better that is a 25 so you take the hit for the longsword that is five plus four it's nine points of slashing damage actually sorry that would be plus more-- nine points of slashing damage plus you take 20 points of poison damage technically it's all in one strike so the whole attack would be halved nine plus 20 you take 14 points of damage there you go all right scanlan it's your turn okay as you sing pike you do not heal anything pike remains unconscious bleeding the healing does not make its way through but anyway what are you doing you don't notice this you sing to her finish your verse what are you doing all righty dominate monster wisdom saving throw so that would be 23 13 plus ten he would've had disadvantage but he has advantage against spell saves so it comes to a single roll okay which way are you going okay so as you move toward the mansion you go through to the lighted doorway it gets an attack of opportunity on you scanlan it's going to make its bite attack that is a 21 to hit all right you suffer 20 points of piercing damage i need you to make a constitution saving throw 21 you just succeed in shrugging the poison off as it bites out at you and the teeth claw against your shoulder as you run past scooting around the way to where the entrance to the mansion is you're still feeling the blade vibrating at your side it's almost like a pulse like it's trying to fight to be free so you rush around you get to this side okay there you go that ends your turn scanlan pike i need you to make a death saving throw okay so that's a failure you also take a pulse of the poison damage in your body so you fail another death saving throw the efreeti now watching you now attack and go after this fiend pulls its blade out and rushes toward you scanlan he's heading toward you halt in the name of the sultan takes its blade out and it's going to make two scimitar attacks against you scanlan actually he's not going to move toward you he's going to stay back there on top of the bridge and he's going to hurl two balls of flame at you that is going to be a 21 to hit and a ten to hit so the second one misses you and blasts in the ground next to you but the first one does-- that is 13 points of fire damage to you scanlan as the fireball blasts against your chest all righty that brings us to the top vex you see pike unconscious on the ground okay as you rush forward to cast your spell i will say make an intelligence check you see that pike's unconscious what'd you roll so yeah you have no idea that she's poisoned you just see her unconscious on the ground i mean you wouldn't know to she wouldn't have heard you she was in the mansion downside of using it as a defense mechanism you're up next keyleth no if she knew there was poison as you rush forward trinket distracting are you using your bonus action to have trinket attack so go ahead and roll the attack with trinket you rush forward and put your hands onto pike desperately trying to heal her as the energy pulses through her body no effect all you see is the wound from the bite of the fiend in her neck and you see the dark veins curling up now you know at that proximity that it's poison all right good to know yes you will keyleth your turn from this perspective you will hit him with your sunbeam you can move around this direction try and do it there so burst that way just wanted to make sure you're aware of-- all right rolled two threes in a row does not save okay so as you dart around the side of the erinyes you see her bloodied-- --begins hacking at vax right next to you you rush around your hands glow this beam of sun energy bursts out you hear the screaming echo as her body is turned to ash within her armor causing the armor to clank to the ground the rope at her side scattering to the ground as well she has been destroyed you do you've moved five feet so you still have-- yeah you can get up next to him if you want to you want to get up next to him there you could fly over and flank him this way if you wanted kind of hard to flank without stepping into the mansion unfortunately because the door is right there on the flank not really you have to be on the entire opposite side from somebody else so there's no real place you can flank here unfortunately good to know so you are puffing up real big we'll say above all right cool grog well first you take 74 points of fire damage from being in the lava at the start of your turn you can it'd be 48 you take 48 points of fire damage the pain is unbearable but you use that to fuel your anger as you climb out feeling the molten rock spilling off of your body i imagine you're going to want to move out of it you want to flank around this way or this way okay so you pull around to that side generally attack of opportunity is against the creature that's running so it'd probably be against you okay so you reach down you grab her using your full action pick her currently unconscious limp form in your arm cradling her you see the wound the blood across her you pick her up and you go running around into the door as you do the pit fiend-- he already took his attack of opportunity earlier so yeah he does not get one so you grab pike and move and disappear into the doorway with her all righty that ends your turn grog vax you're up be ready percy okay 24 hits yep as an action you touch a creature you used one to attack you could use your haste attack to hit him on the way through and that can only be used as an attack anyway because that's the nature of the haste bonus you can use your action to neutralize the poison this poison you're not quite sure you don't know the circumstance okay so the poison is removed from her that is as much as you can do you cannot see him from that side of the door the doorway is facing outward he's on the other side of the doorway that is the end of your turn pike is no longer poisoned the bulging black veins retract from her throat the shallow breath is still there though fading percy well for your bonus well no it would be your action to feed her a potion all right so feeding her just a basic all righty that is a 2d4 plus two pike is now at five hit points and conscious percy that end your turn vex is roughly 15 feet 15 feet will get you inside and get her just outside the door that's your move all righty now it is ghurrix's turn ghurrix who watched his summoned ally get thrown back to the hells through the sunbeam that blasted over the side looks over to the efreet that appears to be now on his side takes a leap up (whooshing crashing) in between scanlan and vex let's see he's real angry at both of you you've tried twice to put him in a magic sphere-- as an intelligent creature that is very very familiar with high-level mind controlling-- this is true regardless he's going to take a claw and a bite attack at you vex and then make a mace and tail against you scanlan well wait till we get to it so the claw against you is 34 with a 19 on that you take 18 points of slashing damage from the claw the bite attack-- that is a 25 to hit all right you suffer (adding) 21 points of piercing damage i need you to make a constitution saving throw well you're unconscious the spell goes away sorry the poison damage isn't what knocked her unconscious the bite hits she falls unconscious and the poison goes through her body okay you fail a death saving throw as the poison courses through your body you are now poisoned and unconscious right outside the mansion door now for you scanlan the tail attack is a 20 to hit you 33 points of bludgeoning damage as the tail spins and slams you to the side you get pushed against the wall in the corner where you've been hiding the mace is going to swing toward you that is going to be a 25 even an ambassador to the nine hells is taken aback by the sheer filthiness of this limerick go ahead and roll your d12 the mace hits you from the side that is 11 points of bludgeoning damage plus 16 points of fire damage still standing scanlan nice all right that's going to end the pit fiend's turn scanlan you're up do you pull the blade from the scabbard right the second time as you pull the blade out you can see it's glowing and it's like a tuning fork it's vibrating at the tip and the sword is wanting to guide you it's your call what do you want to do scanlan your choice entirely you get nine points all right you heal nine points okay so you used your cutting words feature so your attack's at advantage right so as you let the sword guide you you feel this energy this warmth come from the blade fill your arms and for a second you watch and feel the spirit of a hundred bards that have wielded this blade course through you you see many many foes that have fallen to its blade and those that have fallen clutching it at their side and utilizing that you unleash a flurry you actually get to attack four times all with advantage 24 hits that last one misses but the first three hit go ahead and roll damage on those 29 total okay so as the energy courses through your body the blade in your hand how do you want to do this (cheering) he only had 22 hit points left as one wing is cloven off from one side in a clean cut it turns into ash and fire on one side the other wing darts off hits the lava and turns to ash across the top of that this time as it's snarling toward you the voice in your head saying i will find you the blade (stabbing) right through its chest (gasping) its jaw hangs open as you say that its eyes go dark and the body burns into ash and dissipates make a deception check the efreeti stops his assault on you it was ready for another fireball and as you shout this it halts (grunting) it's taken pause you're not sure it believes you everything that it's seeing here probably familiar with the pit fiend and the power that it holds versus one of the illuminated you see it looking over past your shoulder you glance over and you see five more efreeti walking in the direction that it called it's taken pause though meanwhile i need you to make another death saving throw okay so you're okay for now however you still take poison damage from the poison pulsing through your system not yet there is the efreeti that is standing there and has halted his assault he's assessing the situation so that's the end of vex's turn keyleth what are you doing you're currently up where it was in your elemental form with multiple efreeti making their way down the road this way she's unconscious and poisoned and bleeding out-- you would have an action yes you do okay so you are now back to keyleth okay the poison is no longer pulsing in your veins vex all right so that being the case grog you're up yeah as you poke your head out you can see there is a singular efreet that is standing on the edge there that is flame in his hand crackling staring at scanlan but in a reserved position you see about five of them rounding the corner towards the arches scanlan is still outside scanlan's off in the corner you see him make a deception check grog the efreet standing there went from unsure if truth to they're fucking lying eyes glare back at you scanlan vax what are you doing so you're now conscious vex percy we have more efreet heading down this pathway here scanlan it's your turn pike you're after scanlan oh i did accidentally miss your turn last time in the mansion what do you want to do pike you gave her one just one you can do that you can mete it out 5th-level cure wounds onto you vex this is looking very bad this is the entire city guard now coming at you how much does that heal looking much better than you did a second ago that ends your turn pike or are you going to do anything else scanlan you're now about to be flanked by a series of efreet this whole thing's been roughly from beginning to end about two minutes yeah from a spatial positioning standpoint okay it has to make a wisdom saving throw because technically you are fighting the creature because grog made it hostile again it does get advantage on the saving throw i think it may be just an attack that's why i'm going to check yo i'm glad you're using it on enemy rolls now you can also spend a luck point when an attack roll is made against you that would've been really powerful that's cocked that is 19 what is your spell dc again you watch its eyes glaze over for a minute and the flame flickers out in its hand as it drops to the side what are you doing what are you modifying so you paint out this whole memory this whole image of watching this pit fiend caught by you guys and this illuminated efreet that this plot was uncovered the scuffle continued and you make this entire epic battle where somehow you're the most powerful creature in the universe and tore this thing asunder practically one-handed next to this efreet you instill it with the joy and the pride that it just foiled a plot against the sultan you watch as its limp self puffs up with its hands on its hips as the spell finishes taking effect rewriting its memory it looks down at you and goes you are brave small one your assistance will be remembered he puts his hand out to clasp yours it encompasses your entire elbow with a beastmaster shake as the rest of the illuminated swoop in now to catch up weapons drawn the one that you were talking to goes there is no need we have thwarted the plot the sultan is safe this slaver here and his paltry allies they helped me stop it the rest of the illuminated go piss off you're blowing-- stop blowing smoke well done the efreet that you cast on looks a little deflated no but seriously points to the ashes there on the ground and goes to join the rest of them they're giving him shit you can tell there's a rapport with them they don't fully believe his story but there doesn't appear to be any intent against you through a brief conversation with them they have no reason to consider you an enemy you've through a single series of lucky rolls and a perfect use of modify memory prevented the probably 10000-ish illuminated that were in the city let me look at the specific-- more than that you're looking at 50000 illuminated that are in the city guard it did not turn to ashes however when you grab it it is a dull cold iron mace that is too large for you to use i mean you could use it but it would be disadvantage on attacks no the rest of it's just ash the rest of it burned away into ash there is the symbol that he had yeah you would find that which is his mark of his station within the embassy nope look at the mini-- nope did you check for anything else while you're here as apparently the rest of the crowd has begun to come back and fill in the arches again okay there is her armor scattered across the top of the wall the bow is broken there is the longsword and you do see the rope still there as well as a pair of nice boots so you grab the sword you grab the boots and you grab the lasso everybody ducks inside of the mansion all right as you guys all duck into the mansion take a rest we're going to take a bathroom break here we'll be back here in a minute we have a little more story resolution to go through before i finish the episode tonight so hold off just a second and scanlan you can go ahead and get your-- this is mythcarver in its awoken form okay gather gems we are having a giveaway tonight our fantastic friends at wyrmwood are giving away this awesome magnetic dice box i believe they check in the chat room right so go ahead and check in the chat room you can go ahead and enter they'll have the instructions there we'll have the announcement of who wins this at the end of the break okay after break we'll come back with the winner of that so pay attention to the chat room enter we'll give away to one lucky winner this awesome wyrmwood dice box thank you guys we'll see you back here in a few minutes hello guys and welcome back to critical role we do have a winner in the chat room jenksone9 you are going to be winning this awesome wyrmwood dice box congratulations make sure that you talk with our mods and folks in the chat room to get your information congratulations and thank you for entering awesome so returning to the circumstance you vox machina bruised beaten and through some clutch timing-- and thank god some of you guys got initiative at the top of that round maybe we'll talk more about this on talks on tuesday because there's some shit that could have gone really wrong if you guys didn't get initiative or if you hadn't grappled him at the beginning yeah it would've been bad anyway while you guys are taking a short rest-- so you can go ahead and use as many of your hit dice to heal up if you want to on top of whatever you used your hit dice on you also heal 1d12 correct well he rolls it so sam go ahead and roll that everyone heals 12 hit points and then let me know how much you heal based on your hit dice all right percy's fully healed is anyone looking at the items you found okay boots or rope 168 on grog all righty vax is full 85 on scanlan awesome so boots or rope vex okay so i'm going to pass these over to you guys so you essentially release the rope as an action toward a creature within 20 feet and it tries to wrap it and restrain it restrained grapple just means their movement is brought to zero restrained means their movement is brought to zero attack rolls against them have advantage and attack rolls that they make have disadvantage and they have disadvantage on dexterity saving throws it's an action well grapple is different from restrained with the rope yeah you can do that you're your own moving gallows yeah probably not going to work on thordak just saying thank you pike you did yeah so as you guys finish a short rest you've taken in the circumstance you've narrowly avoided a very very bad situation with the city what do you guys want to do you're inside the mansion you still have the two slaves you acquired the servants did take the chains off of them they're both hiding in the back of the foyer as you guys are resting hi they both seem a little more relaxed than when you first spoke with them i'm kyor he's hunin thank you whatever you need maybe a year we were taken from our mother on the poorer side of therines it's in wildemount she sold us off because we're special i've changed the music for you you can see hunin who's being really quiet and basically letting kyor talk and you get the sense he's probably the more talkative of the two we have no real care or love for her for what she's done whatever the fates bring us toward i suppose we'll walk that he still seems uncomfortable and very much like what are you going to do looks over to hunin hunin looks and shakes his head this place is terrible if you know a way out please take us with you i like snow where we're from there's lots of snow okay we're both about you can see they have to think for a second you get the sense that they probably didn't have a very good education either where they came from about 15 yes the other spectral servants come and take their hands lift up and lead them toward the kitchen where they both excitedly seem to enjoy the prospect of fresh food it sloshes a bit there's enough for half a cup for one (bear noises) rubs against you he seems pretty proud (bear noises) that would've been a great bigby's hand moment so you guys have gathered your things you've gathered your two companions you still have the illusions you totally kissed your sister and then right now planted one on a flaming dark-skinned bearded fellow as you guys gather your things you make your way back out into the thoroughfare of the arches where you can see there is now a heavier patrolling guard of illuminated in the vicinity you get an elbow right to the stomach she's grown up with you she knows exactly where you are going to whisper into her ear as you guys begin to make your way backtracking to the location of juuraiel's building without incident though there are a few tense moments of you guys staying in the public eye you've watched how other people walked about the city the lack of communication from folks that don't seem to be on the upper echelon and avoiding as much of the illuminated as you can with their flaming amulets eventually you find your way back to the large slowly spiraling black-and-gold abode of juuraiel the door has the same knob on the front you knock the door is lifted and the two fire giant slaves greet you and lead you into the home there across the way on the other side of her large desk still waiting arms crossed fingers intertwined you see grinning the ever opulently dressed juuraiel waiting for you all to approach quietly with a smile on her face her eyebrows tensed and furrowed expecting either a sweet victory or word of a sweet defeat either way she wins she reaches down and plucks it it dangles she looks at it so it is done then you can see the brow unfurls ever so slightly and a look of peace washes over her face for a moment she takes the small amulet in her hand and clutches her fingers around it and closes her eyes you've done me a great service this day and you have upheld your end of the bargain for this i thank you she pulls a drawer open in the desk and plops it in slams it shut (slam) i absolve you of the ownership i have against you my servants will collect your necklaces thank you thank you very much yes my apologizes it's been a long day she reaches up and takes the armor pieces there and sets it on the edge of the desk now the deal is done get out i would recommend doing it towards the foyer door okay so you guys help her get out of her armor the fire giant's awkwardly watching from a distance as she's down to her skivvies well she doesn't have to get fully naked in here she's not naked under the armor there's padding and stuff that'd be painful as shit pinches everywhere but the plate which is about human size it's too large for pike and it gets loose when you get inside of it it's hanging off of her once you get the last piece of the armor on she looks like a child wearing her parents' clothing and then with a creaking sound all armor snaps to her form and you watch as the beautiful brass scrolling across the armor itself begins to brighten you can see bits where the scrolling glows with this pulsing almost internal fire and the rubies gleam and you see the air around her begin to distort like the air distortion over a hot flame yeah travis read it in ashley's voice you start walking up wearing the armor you just won and ask her this question both of her hands reach up over the desk because you can barely see her from your vantage point you're so small by comparison both of her hands reach over grasp the edge and she leans forward looming over you her large grinning dark skin vibrant red hair braided adorned with jewels and metallic bands of platinum she leans down it is not for you to worry about now leave me to my collection you've already taken one from me it's actually very comfortable and quite cool no (laughter) it's still pretty loud from unconsciousness yeah it's a good vestige all right so i'd say with you guys not having a guide and trying to go off memory in coasting through it'll take you a little over an hour but you do find it the establishment you now see from the other side there are three different types of languages written above the top one of them is common it says flame garden and that is the name of his jeweler's business as you guys come to the front doors which are actually open for business there are no customers in there at the moment and you see uten in the back is currently working on some sort of a crafting circumstance has a heavy
