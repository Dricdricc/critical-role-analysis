[dramatic music] we have our samurai laura and travis are in transit they'll be here as soon as they-- (thump from sam's mug) go ahead and make a religion check i guess nine honestly it's hard to tell if it's a curse the tree itself is just dead you are very well-connected with the natural essences of the world the life essence of plants and natural growth all of your interactions with the sun tree are devoid of any response it seems dead where it stands but as you continue your ritual-- anyone else have anything they want to do if you didn't write it down it's not in your inventory yeah because as you guys went through the tavern you found there was no actual water there was old ale there were still a few casks of wine stuff that was abandoned when whoever previously was the owner of this tavern either left whitestone or fell to a worse fate but there was no plain water to drink they're still technically under your seeming spell for the next few hours at least as far as i know it lasts just for an eight-hour period i'll double-check yeah it lasts for eight hours and allows you to change the appearance of-- okay stealthily it's a lot it's earth and then giant roots from a very large tree that go past you aren't at the bottom of the roots you've met the roots as you were carving through they go even deeper than where you are right now if you've already started the eight-hour process of the secondary spell you would not be able to really interrupt that to be able to continue another spell you've been doing i could say that you did that as part of your preparation for the roots that's fine that's fine it'd be a small ravine because you also don't want to-- you continue your ritual the rest of you make your way out the same window that you entered into the alleyway following percival you lead them to the back of the tavern into one of the large alleyways between this chunk of the city you find there was a grassy area most of the grass here has turned gray and brittle as it is starting to push towards the winter months and even for the daytime the temperature is pretty chilly it's probably around 50 or so degrees 55 fahrenheit for our un-american friends eventually you make your way to the nearest well that you've been to and there is a bucket there it looks like it has gathered some dust and some cobwebs you get the bucket and you let it down and eventually it finds its way into the water it's pretty deep before it hit the water you don't know if it's been just like water level or if this particular well itself is drying up but you manage to get a bucket up and you pull it up and check it and it looks clear you take the water back with you to the tavern seemingly uneventful you guys have managed to stay far enough out of sight nothing seems to caught your attention okay so keyleth you're staying behind to finish the ritual there are two temples in here there's the temple to pelor which is known as the zenith within the graveyard so the lady's chamber the temple to erathis is more central to the city and is partially a courtyard partially a half-dome amphitheater place of worship you guys make your way through the city i'll have you all roll stealth checks if you could well if you're not trying to hide then make deception checks instead if you'd like to okay okay so we have two folks staying to the shadows best they can in broad daylight in a clustered city and one child-looking pauper of a boy wandering through the city alone towards the graveyard as you guys make your way through staying off to the side jumping or running through buildings and staying off the main path you walk along the central road to the far eastern side of whitestone a few folks come out during the day some are carrying bundles of textile goods there's one guy that has a small cart and it looks like he's bringing tools and stuff either to or from a store of some kind gives you a curious look as if he hasn't seen you before but doesn't seem to-- g'day and just keeps rolling along the wheels squeaking as he pushes up the road eventually you guys make your way to the far eastern side of whitestone this is where the boundary wall that surrounds most of the city from a defensive standpoint lies there is the multiple exit points throughout this wall you dart around the outskirts of it being careful to avoid the pattern of the undead giants that are slowly stomping through the city like these hulking sentinels that walk in a perpetual pattern through the town you follow the winding path through the thick woods just on the outside of the wall of the city itself you sticking to the path in your open way or do you want to join them in the side of the forest all right so the three of you dart off into the woods skirting the outside of the road but making your way following it to the outside of the graveyard itself eventually you come to the outside of the graveyard large iron fence that marks the outside of it it's rusted from time small spikes mark the very top of it about six feet tall and the gate itself is partially open with a little bit of breeze that's blowing through very very cold breeze that blows through this part of the forest it's opening a little bit and (creak) against itself you push through the gate-- okay okay you skirt up and look inside and there's a handful of trees in little clusters here and there but for the most part this old graveyard is flat land with just stones set up throughout the older stones have very little rhyme or reason to their placement they're sporadically thrown around fresher ones tend to be more clustered with family names this definitely looks like something that was put here when the town was founded and has been slowly expanded over time and it's not uniform you do see a little ways ahead in the center of this open barren area there is a stone temple that has from what little you can see a bit of stained glass pattern to it okay percy walks up to the doors okay you-- you go to the doors of the temple the large wooden doors in them are carved this flaming wreath into the wood it looks almost like the outer ring of the classical depiction of a sun and going across the sky where you can see the waving flames licking the sides of the actual doors and it is a double door as you tug on the handle at the front it gives very little to you you give a little more of a tug on it not enough to gather attention just enough to really see if it's just stuck or if it's locked and it appears that the doors are not opening there is no lock actually there is no lock it is barred from the other side there is some heavy wooden plank that is currently set on the other side of the door so with your expertise in these sort of circumstances you know that with the proper placement of a long blade and enough strength and weight put at the right fulcrum point you can probably shimmy it off and it may take a little bit of teamwork to do so essentially if you're referring to a dimension door-- no it is not concentration you can visualize it it doesn't have to be a place you have seen yet yep okay (spoof) with a burst of dark purplish energy scanlan steps through the door leaving no mark or trace behind on the other side you hear this muffled (spoof) as he reappears on the opposite side completing his transition you appear now in the central worship hall of the zenith temple to each side of you you can see there are windows about ten foot wide stained glass windows about every ten feet around this pattern it looks like three to each side there are pews set up for the masses to come and sit and worship but a lot of the pews have been pushed off to the side set astray some have been destroyed and ruined there's a pile in the corner of a number of sundered and tattered pews there is a red carpet that marks the center that goes all the way to what looks like a raised altar on the opposite side of the room you can see that some of the stained glass further down has been shattered and broken and a little bit of sunlight creeps through you can see there is on the altar a large stone platform it's hard to see from this distance make a perception check there appears to be something on the the altar in the distance small and scattered about it but from this distance it's hard to make out the details but you hear vax muffled through the door it's about eight feet wide and about a foot-- eight feet long about a foot wide and about six inches thick a big old piece of wooden board i would say it probably weighs about 40 or 50 pounds it's wood it's porous you could touch it it gets to about your head a little higher go ahead a make a strength check athletics make this athletics (grunting) from this position it's not even budging what is it right a scimitar or falchion as a note seeming isn't concentration no you cast it and it lasts for eight hours you don't need to worry about that (laughs) we can try all right so this is going to be the three of you as a skill challenge i want all three of you to roll not athletics just a straight strength roll add your strength modifier which is exactly what happens taliesin and yeah first and foremost you take four points of slashing damage to your hand you pull back and there is a line of blood now beginning to drip off your hand you shake it amongst yourself certainly it's a blast of thunderous energy in an area it would affect living and nonliving matter yes there are windows shattered on both sides they're broken a little higher up so you could either continue to break the bottom part of the window or just attempt to leap through the hole okay so give me an acrobatics check 25 you get a running start leap off the side and parkour up between the actual-- there is an extension to the side where another room is attached on each side of the temple towards the back you leap off that wall onto the small pillar that's holding the side of the window and up through the broken portion of the stained glass landing three-point landing on the inside you almost land in one of the shattered piles of wooden pews and splinters and jagged pieces of wood sticking out of it about a foot away from you and you are like oh that was close you see scanlan across the way you see the altar to your right have both you guys make strength checks (laughs) okay with a brief burst of wind energy a shimmering form somewhat humanoid in shape but still amorphous appears (wind sounds) and begins to shove itself up against the bottom of the wooden bar make your check as well that's for you and then roll and add five for your unseen servant roll again add five the three of you one mystically summoned from a plane beyond your own cannot seem to budge this single wooden door you've defeated beholders you've slaughtered illithid underneath in the underdark deep in the belly of the planet but this door bests you this giant glimmering purple fist appears in your vicinity it grabs the bottom go ahead and roll a d20 plus eight to it with its finger just goes (ping) and it (thudding noises) the door (creak) opens up and percy stands there looking not very happy looking about the place it looks pseudo-ransacked there has been much force used in whatever destroyed these pews the glass that was broken was broken from the outside in so definitely seems like there was someone throwing a rock through or a intrusion from an outside standpoint as you walk further and look around the two rooms to the side the doors are closed there is the altar on the top and you do see there is a couple of small sacks laid to the side of the altar what looks to be some low-lit candles and there are some braziers one to each side of the altar and one against each wall all of them appear to be long dark and out go ahead and make a perception check all of you you both as you approach the far side of the temple towards the altar you notice the brazier to the right is smoldering ever so gently just a very faint glow of ember to it you step up you can see now on top of the altar there appears to be a couple of glass vials that are overturned a little liquid spilled you can see bits of broken glass across the bottom the one step that leads down from the altar's raised platform make an investigation check 13 okay looking at just the general vicinity of the altar you taste the liquid it's definitely somewhat caustic in nature you can't really determine it but just touching it to your tongue your tongue goes numb for a second and you feel a slight burn your nostrils clear out a little bit from the scent there is some random powders and such that've been brushed off you get the feeling that the way that all this was treated it wasn't so much like it was destroyed more than it was hastily packed up roll a perception check 20 okay looking about the outside of the altar you do notice that around the brazier that is slightly smoldering there is a layer of ash there gathered on the inside of the brazier and a little bit on the floor around its base if you look at the other braziers there is no ash around it most of the ash is contained the wood ash itself tends to fall it's a little heavier this seems to be a lighter shade of ash and it's more of a-- has found its way out of the brazier from just the heat and the air you lean down and you take some of the ash in your fingers and smell it it's not perfumed but you've had some experience with dealing with various burning materials this is definitely paper-based ash you do also notice underneath the brazier there is one sliver of paper that was not wholly burned go ahead and make an investigation check testing what's there i mean a lot of the material has been scattered and mixed but there are elements that resemble the black powder you've used in some of your constructs and tinkering in the past what you noticed were like some of the glass vials that were overturned looking at the pouches it looks like some of them contained phosphorus some of them contained other alchemical reagents that were used in the research but most have been emptied and it's just a residuum on the inside door on the right (creak) opens up into what was father reynal's room as the door opens you're immediately hit with terrible smell of decay and you can see shoved under the bed that first appears on the opposite side of the small room what appears to be the remains of father reynal long passed and left to fester beneath his bed you're welcome to go ahead and take a look roll an investigation check 23 looking at the body it appears that there are a series of puncture wounds rapier-based they're too long like stiletto too long to be a dagger no they are inflicted by a weapon a long thin weapon and multiple to the torso okay searching the body searching the room it looks like everything of interest has been taken from the place you find some leftover stale food you find some candles that are generally used for the purposes of worship here in the temple but anything beyond that-- all the drawers have been emptied everything has been taken by whoever was previously setting up residence in this facility you do notice that throughout the temple there are images of pelor flame-wreathed face various sun and stars that are set up but most of them have been profaned marked on shattered or covered in soot an intentional effort has been made to dampen the power of pelor in this once-holy place none that are untouched but there are some that could possibly be cleaned a couple of small medallions that are hanging up in the room where the father lays okay make a perception check all right as you walk back into the main temple-- all right your ears catch a faint distant sound like a strong wind pushing through a mountain pass this low mournful wail-type sound no wind is moving there is a stillness to the air as you guys take in this sense this sound gets louder and louder at which point the air itself gets colder and colder as you nervously exhale you can see your breath becoming visible in the air around you as you all look at each other you stepping back into what shadows there are as it is a very open temple as it's a temple of sun-- you find what tiny little alcove you can of shadow it's not going to offer a lot of protection once you move but for now you seem to be out of the circumstance okay yeah you guys both vanish holding your place on top of the altar and as that moaning tends to grow louder and louder you can see this shimmer at the doors that are open on the opposite side of the room it looks like a woman a form of a woman but translucent in nature drifting in giving off the horrible (raspy groan) sound as it drifts in and you see it looking around and the features are gaunt as it gets closer it looks elven by racial nature but the eyes are just these sunken faintly glowing sockets the hair wild and matted and floating behind it its hands reaching out and as it gets partway through the temple it looks like it's seeking something and its eyes fall directly on you two let's go ahead and-- off to the side there you guys are on the altar there i built the whole city because i didn't know where you guys were going to go so first and foremost let's go ahead and roll initiative you'll get a surprise round all right all right well first and foremost before anything happens this entity as it notices your presence it begins to transform and its image becomes more horrifying as you pull your dagger out i need all of you guys to roll a wisdom saving throw (laughs) nice 17 scanlan with advantage unfortunately you are considered frightened by this entity it scares the crap out of you marisha and ah then never mind you feel it shake your form for a second its horrible visual presence for a second freaks you out but then you remember the knowledge that your friends are here and you have to serve a purpose and you shake off-- pull them up and get ready all right well you go first technically it's not a surprise round because the creature can sense life and saw them before it happens so it wasn't ambushed but you do get to go first and you do get to go before it in the use of surprise i didn't mean to use it in the surprise round fashion these entities can detect living creatures up to five miles away if you get to it first you still have advantage because it doesn't see you you're still hidden from it that hits this would yes it is not surprised okay hits for double dice not doubled modifier okay 13 good to know awesome so out of the shadows (whoosh) three daggers strike this wailing ghost entity each dagger it punctures and you see it reacts from the impact as there's a flash of magical energy with each hit the daggers then tumble out of its form and then blink back to your belt side it looks like it definitely did some damage to it but it's-- it would actually yes so minus four damage to this other guy wait so you threw wooden stakes at it as two of the attacks okay so the first dagger hits yeah the two other stakes pass through its form without any other impact the one dagger does return to you but the two stakes just clatter in the distance and the creature seems unharmed by those two yeah sorry so that ends that point the creature now swoops up to the center of you three and gives out this horrible (roar) this wailing scream that bursts out in the air you feel like the wind push you back and all of you feel like for a moment you're staring at your own death i need all three of you guys to roll constitution saving throws nope okay both of you guys you feel this chilling burst of spiritual energy blast through your soul and you each take 14 points of psychic damage percy however as you look at it it seems like this blast actually forces the soul from your body momentarily you immediately drop to zero hit points and are unconscious so with that you see percy eyes roll back and then collapse onto the floor like a pile of cold bones out percy it's your turn go ahead and make a death saving throw 11 okay scanlan it's your turn you still have bigby's hand by the way on concentration let's see how long that lasts actually let me see how long it lasts just to be safe up to a minute so probably would have faded by now sorry what are you doing scanlan okay so you release a bolt of lightning energy right in its direction go ahead and roll damage for that you don't have to hit for lightning bolt it just hits everything in front of it and you have to try and avoid it what's the dc it is a free action to pull it out so you instinctively-- hand cone cast the spell-- out the bolt goes 19 okay does not make its saving throw 34 points of damage the lightning blasts through her not impactful as you think it might be this entity because it is in an ethereal state is not as effectively hit by such magics however it does take damage okay scanlan you move back healing word all right so healing word is 1d4 plus-- healing word will be-- so seven hit points you're conscious but you're still on the ground face down loosely fallen over the stuff on the altar correct so scanlan your turn's done vax you're up okay you're in this room currently hits hits all right all righty both daggers hitting it you see its form being impacted by each dagger hit it still continues to come forward toward the two of you is that the end of your movement over here that far i think so all right that ends your turn the creature now is going to drift up to the unconscious form or the now-conscious form of percy it's going to swipe at you with its corrupting touch since you're prone it has advantage on the attack that'll be 20 to hit what's your ac 18 okay as its hand reaches down and passes through as you just come to consciousness and you start getting yourself up you look up and feel this cold sensation as its hand reaches through your back and seems to almost grasp your spine your whole body lurches from the impact you take 12 points of necrotic damage no he has to fail his death saves that ends its turn well no actually it's going to start moving now it's going to drift through the rest of its movement this direction that ends its turn go ahead and make your death saving throw all righty that ends your turn scanlan you're up (laughing) okay all righty all right bigby's hand with a clenched fist deals an additional 2d8 damage so if you're going to punch it it does an additional 2d8 damage what are you going to do okay i see so it does no damage but it does force its movement okay and i'll say because you did it at a higher level it's an additional five feet of movement on that so as the hand shoves toward the creature-- the forceful hand it doesn't no there's grasping hand and the clenched fist do damage okay so you bitch-slap it physically hard clenched fist go ahead and make a spell attack go ahead and roll a d20 add your spell attack modifier 14 plus nine that hits go ahead and roll damage that's 6d8 force damage because you cast it at 6th level 24 yeah as that happens the fist clenches and (wham) bitch-slaps the back of the wailing ghost creature as it does you hear it scream out in pain (screech) as its spectral form is scattered across the air and dissipates you toss yourself up a couple times so it's 4d4 plus four if you guys are taking a short rest-- yep you got it okay go ahead and make a perception check looking over the altar it appears to be smooth solid stone nothing catches your attention you check the other room this is a small kitchen essentially for whoever was running here would make small meals or things to delineate during worship and/or just cook for its own meals when the father was keeping-- it does not appear to have been used you can make an investigation check to gather an idea of how long it's been there sam i'm going to look around as well and food and stuff okay you get the feeling that the last time this was used was a little under a week ago you find a couple of loaves of stale bread some dried meats salted dry meats like some jerky-ish type things things that are meant to last a while there is produce here but the produce has long wilted and gone to rot it's hard to really tell you're not too familiar with lifestyles of different individuals whoever left the notes and whoever was dabbling with the vicinity does have a tendency towards sciences and alchemy in ways that seemingly can blend and overlap with your specialty that's the best you can ascertain based on the information given okay and it gives a horrible screeching sound as you carve into this well-polished stone surface that's used predominantly for worship or when it was given about five ten minutes in you manage to scrape a design into it that is visually distinct against the smooth surface and does match the design best to your ability that percy-- okay okay you finish your carving seemingly without recurring incident yeah you guys make your way out of the temple back into the center of the graveyard the sun is beginning to set the reds and purples of the night sky are starting to creep in as it just begins to crest on the far western side of the mountain range surrounding the valley it's been spotty cloudy-- bits and pieces there is heavy cloud cover that seems to be pushing through it brings colder weather it looks like when you first got there there was some snowfall that happened before you arrived you've had a few days of sun but i'd say about half the day is cloud cover and this far north too all right you guys-- okay takes you a little time because they're amongst a bunch of other broken wooden scraps-- okay you find some splintered wood you guys make your way back into the town i'd like you all to make a stealth or a deception check if you prefer 13 okay all right as you guys are making your way back towards the tavern there is a small group of whitestone villagers walking and having a conversation not heated but there is a sense of desperate conversation amongst them and standing with them you can see there's an older gentleman mostly bald long scraggly gray hair that falls past his shoulders a little bit hunched he's wearing dark leathers and a cloak that's over one shoulder and drags the ground behind him and they're talking to him and he's growling to himself and the best you can make out is there's an argument about farming shipments and the inability to make dates and requirements he shouts back to the remainder says listen it is beyond my control this is what has been decreed by sir kerrion that is how it'll be if you cannot provide then taxes will be pulled if you cannot pay then there are far worse things we can take now be on your way and steps away from the group looks over and sees a little boy and this in the shadows skulking individual you there you new around here i don't recognize you and two of the guards step forward what's your name make a deception check then make yourself useful maybe you can make up for some of these lost crops that these bags of shite keep saying they can't do i don't give a shit move on boy he grumbles and keeps on walking the guards give you a look one of them spits at your foot keeps walking on eventually they drift aside you continue your path back to the tavern where the rest of you are waiting the sun has now set night has taken the sky and keyleth is on the verge of completing her ritual okay as you're keeping watch you notice occasionally there will be one of the zombie giants that will lumber through the center of town there's a very specific pattern that they tend to follow and you do notice a couple of other guards that you didn't notice during the day begin to show up they're humanoid they're armored they sneak around they're humanoid but their movement is unnatural not very much light at all there's very low-lit points at certain crossroads that've been left up for general visibility for those who have to travel at night but you gather most people just do not travel at night here in whitestone keyleth-- you finally complete your ritual sweat pouring down your brow you have your hand on the roots-- okay roll a d20 and add your wisdom modifier i would say no because this isn't a saving throw and because what you're attempting to do is essentially convert a highly damaging spell into a non-damaging circumstance at the end of an eight-hour endurance match with a ritual this is going to be a difficult attempt so go ahead and roll a d20 add your wisdom modifier you complete the ritual and release the healing energy of your plant growth spell as you release it you begin to concentrate on the sun ray and you begin to see throughout the pieces of earth around seeds quickly begin to germinate and small little bits of ivy greenery begin to pierce out from parts of the earth in your immediate vicinity as this affects a large radius there does not appear to be any sort of immediate reaction by the tree you begin to pull back and concentrate on the spell you release the sunbeam forward in the frustration of the lack of reaction from the tree and the desperation to make sure some effect happens you release the full force of the beam as opposed to the prequel aspect and you burst into some of the roots blasting some of them apart and beginning to set flame to part of the under of the tree you guys hear this (explosion) you put out the flames and you notice where the fire had burned aspects of the wood there is the black char marks across the roots where the flames touched and the area surrounding the root is a little more of a vibrant brown color almost like a little hint of life seemed to have seeped into the root it expands for a moment and you can see a little bit of life return to that localized section of the tree as you do there's still these bits of ivy greenery this long-embedded seeds through years and years and generations of earth layering in here these long-dormant seeds are starting to come to life and spring through the earth around you the expansion of the healthier portion of the root begins to spread and then stop spreading and you begin to notice all the greenery begins to immediately wither and crumple and turn to ash and you watch as the vibrant aspect of the roots slowly drain from the bottom up like something is pulling the life force out of the roots you take the holy oil and place it along the roots and it soaks into the dry and in some cases now charred aspects of the roots you wait a moment and the oil seems to almost burn off and evaporate make a perception check the pattern of decay that followed your initial attempt at reviving this vicinity all had a very distinct downward motion of draining there was something about the ground something beneath the tree and where you are that is seemingly taking the life force of the surroundings at this point all the life force was very quickly drained what's the radius on that okay so you take your time and you begin to focus and it expands as you do focusing on vampiric presence you feel a fair amount of presence above below and further north and smattered throughout the city you get the sensation at this point in time that there is much more beyond just lord briarwood that have come to be a creature of the night in this city okay make an intelligence check yeah just a straight intelligence check 14 incorporating this organic organ keeping it from rotting is already going to be a feat in order to incorporate any of its natural charge essence is going to require your workshop doing that on the go is too intricate i mean it may be functional it's definitely possible to use what you extracted from the behir to be a way to charge your diplomacy but that is something that you'll have to do in a controlled space when you have everything at your disposal it's a very delicate process to even attempt it okay you all take an evening's rest as you guys take your watches and go to sleep in the cold interior and it is a cold interior of the tavern as the night comes through this is your first time really staying the night in the center of whitestone even though you slept in the forest in the boughs of the trees itself the temperature grows far colder here and even with the warm interior the windows frost over and you find yourselves having to huddle or build some sort of small fire to even keep a semblance of comfort to rest you all eventually go to sleep throughout your various times i would like everyone to make a wisdom saving throw with advantage because you're still affected by the heroes' feast okay all of you wake the next morning rested as best as can be percy your entire evening was wracked with nightmare after nightmare imagery you wish to not recall whispers and voices familiar unfamiliar seeing yourself pulled from your physical self into the heart of this banshee then wrest from death barely cackling in the distance i want you to go ahead and mark on your sheet one point of corruption as you wake up you find yourself wracked by those nightmares a sense of nervousness comes to you and there's a tremor to your voice now that's uncontrollable at times of silence you find yourself impulsively clearing your throat and with that we're going to take a five-minute break all right guys keep this to a stringent five-minute break so we can get to as much as we can before the show's up tonight so we'll see you

that pop in and out check it out if you're around on tuesday it's a lot of fun all righty so let's kick back into this so a rough morning's rest come to fruition percy seems a little worse for wear after the evening's sleep it's a whole business opportunity that was missed seeming has ended yes trinket is now a bear and not a donkey you're a little boy jovial boy without a yo-yo (laughs) you now have two crazy eyes the majesty of bardic illusion going to beyond the horizon all righty you guys step out into the day's sun today is fairly overcast clouds have taken the sky and there is a bit of a light mist that is falling not quite rain but not quite drizzle but just a mist in the air it's a cold day the ground and most of the walkways and roads are a little damp due to the moisture in the air not muddy just a little bit of a packed wetness to it as you head over towards beyond the horizon and that lies more in the northwestern quadrant of the city a little ways around the street from one of the noble houses so you keep a wide berth you come to the row of shops that bookended it before and you go to the curiosity shop to find that the building itself is partially collapsed and ruined the door is torn off the hinges and left to the side part of the ceiling is fallen in do you wander into the building you guys are still on the outside-- the whole building is still standing it just looks like the front entrance is caved in and the doors were pulled off okay looking about the inside most of the furniture has been broken or taken you can see a bunch of shelves set up as this was once a curiosity shop empty anything of worth has long been taken a large scattering of broken glass and a peppering of stains dark ruddy stains across the hardwood floors you can see spattered in places occasional rat seems to crawl out in the distance a little (rat squeaking) sound but there is no other sign of life within the interior go ahead and make an investigation check wisdom check not saving throw 13 eight okay you take a while pushing through some of the rubble checking behind the main desk if you will as to where most purchases would have taken place the place is cleared out and looks like it's covered in enough dust to have been left here for the better part of six months to a year glancing about you find what looks to be a small cellar door that opens up in the floor in one of the back rooms you open it up there's a small ladder not even a staircase a ladder that leads down in there it's a small room about ten foot by ten foot that room is also entirely cleaned out okay so you skirt back towards the the crossroad the nearest crossroad that heads northward to the very very far northwest section of whitestone there you come to this noble house which has a nice bronzed fence around the outside of it probably about seven feet tall with these intricate spears affixed to the top almost in a fleur-de-lis type pattern but looks sharp enough to keep anyone from trying to leap over the front gate is currently chained off with a lock on it there is a lawn but the lawn itself appears to be frost-crusted from the evening's moisture and cold temperature what grass is there is very gray and dull and currently crisp with a white frost dew is a slight hill and you do see the building itself it's a very nice building it's a deep brown a lot of it appears to be like natural stained wood from the local forest surrounding whitestone with highlights of deep green and black there does not appear to be any immediate sign of life from the inside but there does appear to be a light coming from the inside so even at this point in the day it can be dark on the interior you can see a little bit of light coming from one of the doors it's just a gate currently he is not actually he's quite cold and clammy right now in this particular area there is nobody on the street you passed a few folks a lot of them seem to be traveling southward the alcove is a little further east it's probably about a 15-minute walk the other temple that one is about a ten-minute walk south of here it's closer to the southwestern side of the city the skulking humanoids you saw last night that were wandering the streets none of them visible you do take in that far down the road to the east of you there is a large shape looming around the corner in a shadow stretching across the road and you hear the distant (muffled stomping noise) not yet it looks like it's coming around a corner at the bend of the road a ways to the east currently no it's coming around the bend all right you guys dart southward across the road ducking into the alleys of the southern portion of the road getting out of the visual range of the zombie giant that is making its way down the road across your path heading southward you dart through the back alleys and keeping free of the main central visual areas of the city you eventually make your way to the corner that houses the lady's chamber and as you guys see it-- if you're keeping an eye out for that yes in some of the alleyway you do pass a couple that are holding some what looks like either scavenged groceries or some sort of food they have keeping close to themselves you can indeed all right as they're both walking by keeping the hush they see you guys step in the same alley they stop for a second looking you over give a nod make a deception check you both stop and the man gives her a look like he's trying to usher her along pulling her arm and she goes no honey it's just a child walks up and leans forward and says if you're looking for sir kerrion you'll find him in the extravagant abode to the southeast of the city no and gives you a side look for a second and says you don't want to go find the countess there if you're looking for sir kerrion you go to the southeast look for the brick building that's where he stays near the farming area south of us you're not from here are you well just do what he says don't question all right then perhaps you could do that quickly she blushes for a second goes like you stay safe and brushes the hair out of your eyes for a second and pinches your cheek a little bit and there's a look of sadness in her eyes almost like what horrible fate befalls this child if he's not careful she rushes back to the side of the man with her and see it's fine good luck and they both dart off down the alley again on broadway literally all right so you make your way southward to probably what's the second largest road intersection in this city away from the sun tree square you can now see the temple to erathis here and it is a large stone half dome amphitheater set up where it's built outward to face the actual crossroads and there is a courtyard built around it a small stone wall about three feet tall that encapsulates this area there is a couple of trees but there isn't a lot of grass most of it's just stonework-- erathis being the goddess of civilization you know it has an interesting duality and disrespect to melora and all unbridled nature things that are controlled and civilized are definitely her realm of expertise but as you approach like most of the grass here it's pretty desolate and dead winter is definitely making its way to this part of the city you do notice that surrounding it there is dried ivy and just a general feeling of solemn desperation and sadness there are a few people scattered throughout sitting on benches sitting in quiet contemplation some of them are clutching small holy symbols and doing a prayer to themselves while rocking in the bench you do see within the dome there is a group of about four people that are all sitting looking up to a man an older man with a thick white mustache and receding white hair his gray robes he's wearing look weathered you recognize him while you haven't had too much interaction not being much of a pious man in any form of religion from your history but you do know keeper yennen is the head priest of erathis here and is currently giving the tail-end of a small sermon to those here hearing him he speaks words of comfort talking of through these dark days we must bind together as a community we have to ensure that our livelihood and our existence is kept and we look out for our fellow man there is solace in the friendships and bonds we keep here and best not to upset those that wish to keep us down erathis looks over us there will be a time in which our salvation will come and he goes into this very rallying speech and trying to lift the spirits of those around four yeah there's four around him in the amphitheater there are probably another ten or so scattered about the various ground surrounding it just doing their own private prayer yennen from your previous experience and what you've heard is a very-- can be a bit arrogant in his worship but not in a way that is considered dangerous or impactful to when the de rolo families were in rule he does good for the people kind of a tool at times but he practices well and he keeps the people's spirits up for those who worship on occasion but mostly just his personality nothing he's done personally he's not a bad person by any means he's just you know yeah strong-willed in his ideas you would have no basis of comparison you would be the only one that has it seems like it's winding down he finishes the discussion about the bonds of community speaks about this city sprang up from nothing but has a greater destiny to itself if not here at whitestone one day we will all go past these boundaries these borders and create our own cities there is hope for this and then begins to go into a couple of familiar prayers tailored specifically to the erathis way of thinking and then finishes and everyone looks up bows their heads for a second and begin to stand up and walk away from the amphitheater as he turns around and begins to clear off one of the back benches for him to sit on okay you walk up to him he sits down can i help you i can say this if history has taught me anything our people are a resilient bunch there has been much death opposition to all the free peoples of these lands and yet they persevered and surmounted these odds i think though to some degree a prison this town may have become perhaps we ourselves cannot see the distant ends it's easy to misinterpret the means of those that would oppress us but we can't go too long before the world at large can see the atrocities committed the terrible entities that walk these streets i look forward to a day in which there can be a beacon of outside hope from the inside i fear many wills have been torn asunder i'm sorry forgive my manners welcome to the lady's chamber you are unfamiliar to me and he looks out at you guys standing at the peripheral of the amphitheater travelers i fear the cold winter is looming an ill omen takes this city friends you may stay to give worship if you will then i recommend you continue on your way there is little here but dying tradition interesting you speak in strange confidence for a traveler signs of what i might ask yeah as you're walking away you hear his voice call out after wait what does this mean he pulls the parchment forward revealing the symbol of the top of the de rolo family crest go ahead and make a persuasion check give you advantage on this nods his head slowly looks back at the sheet looks back at you with a discerning look oh not at all you look like a dirty peasant right now takes it and hastily closes it and folds it and puts it in the pouch steps back over and gathers some of his loose tea leaves-- he was making himself some tea-- and looks about shiftily calls over one of the other worshipers and begins talking with them as you guys walk away yeah approximately i mean there are plenty of houses that currently don't show signs of life and with that rainfall begins to hit upon the city-- the ground immediately becomes thick with mud and sludge as you begin making your way through the city to the eastern side you do it as you walk along you do some of the mud shifts behind you it can be a little conspicuous if you're not careful all right the alcove is a little ways north it would take some time you're pushing at like 1030 in the morning at this point around 11am are you going straight to the supposed homestead of kerrion stonefell all right you bee-line it you're all getting cold from the wet rain that is now soaked through your clothes you make your way and this home is a deep red brick in construction this house was not here when you lived here it looks like what house was here has been demolished and rebuilt with sturdy masonry it's a two-story building there appear to be two guards currently set outside two regular leather-armor looking more thugs than guards but they're just both keeping under the overhang at the front porch to keep dry and grimacing at the weather there is a gate around it this gate is more for purpose than visual presentation it's a black iron nasty jagged rusty-looking gate not too dissimilar to the one that surrounded the graveyard it's about a 20-foot walk from the gate entrance to the front step of the actual building itself how do you want to approach this all right each holy oil is essentially three-- mark that off from one of your holy oils you have one of three uses of that and that that arrow does have a holy oil essence i mean it's overcast but it's getting closer to noon even though you can't see the sun and it is dark clouds overhead it is still a general universal storm light darkened daylight no it looks like it's probably going to be here for most of the day at the very least okay perception checks all around all right i will say above 20s you guys notice there is a cellar door outside the building that descends beneath it there's no indicator as to whether or not it's attached to the house or if it's just an exterior cellar that you can enter from the outside you do also see there are a number of windows around the household that are all currently closed that lead into the interior you're uncertain if they're locked or open there's a little bit of light from the inside like candlelight or lantern light the darkened exterior has made most of the sunlight that would warm a building or light it up from the inside has been cut off by the rainstorm so there is a necessity for internal lighting no but you do notice that one of the windows to the far back side of the building where most of the light's coming from-- occasionally the light does seem to shift or a shadow moves past it there's movement within that room nearish that window not from this 25 to 30-foot distance from the building and you guys trying to be inconspicuous there is the gate the gate and what looks to be a few rocks and a couple small trees that are on the actual grounds of the house surrounding it which one the cellar door is out in the open buttressed against the back of the house it's up against the ground on the side it has two doors that open up and lead into the cellar below from where you're standing no you're going to be hardpressed to get across without being in sight of somebody if someone were nearby you're on the outside of a fence they're currently not in visual range of you they're guarding the front of the building you guys moved around back so you don't see the two guards currently on the opposite side of the house it is poky yes it's not super sharp poky but there's iron rods yeah if you rolled poorly it's going to deal some damage they're currently on the opposite side of the building if you guys are looking at the back they're in the front of the building guarding the front door correct your donkey's still there beside you you're more than welcome to go ahead and make a strength check so you cast heat metal on the bars and a certain area of this gate begins to glow with a dull orange to become a brighter orange and portions of it going whitish-hot in places the rain by the way is puffing against it and evaporating as it impacts the now-heated metal 23 okay you reach over and grab it your hands smoking on the-- use the pain use the pain and pull down the bars you get a large portion of the gate to actually bend downward into an arc causing the whole gate to fold inward on that side making it much easier for anyone to pass through however you do suffer nine points of fire damage from the burn and your hands are currently scalded okay so it's 1d4 plus six she's rolling it so the scarring stays for a bit you do smell the burning flesh but there's no lasting wounds on your hands so everyone make a stealth check no everyone gets plus ten to their stealth you have disadvantage on the stealth check though yes plus ten to your stealth roll all righty you guys all keeping low and quickly darting across the grass field you make your way pattering across the somewhat slick grass the rain is a little warmer than the frost that kept the grounds frozen as the morning came to so it's a little slick but you make your way to the back of the building you're still loosely out in the open in a weird way so you don't want to be out in the open for a long period of time this isn't a safe place you're currently apparently made it to this side of the building unnoticed but you don't want to stay here very long because you are visible to anyone who's on either side of the gate exterior it is locked it does gives resistance 27 you reach over without even looking you grab the lock you're familiar with this kind of lock (clicking) you take the lock off the chain the chains fall loose against the opposite side of the or the inside of the door you pull it open it's dark inside you can see the dry stone steps that lead down below the building as rain starts darkening them with drops that are hitting them okay make a perception check 19 listening to the inside the smell's a little musty like a cellar you'd expect but a little bit of dust and untouched earth there's nothing down there no movement no sound you all drop in darting into-- which is good because you notice around the corner one of the giants is turning the corner you all dive inside close the cellar doors bringing you to the interior you hear the pattering of rain across the wooden doors of the cellar you made your way down underneath and it is pitch black there is no light source down here okay a little bit of flame causes enough candlelight to see the surface and it is a wine cellar okay so with an instant of will all of a sudden flames burst around-- [no audio] make a perception check your sister assures you she heard-- rogues are pretty cool so you put your ear up to it and listen carefully and you hear pacing footsteps creaking against wood no more than maybe four feet away from you one person stops and then moves again then moves again almost like there's pacing and you hear low voices it's a conversation there's two voices you hear one voice very muffled but it seems to be similar to the voice of the gentleman that came across you guys on the street that actually briefly talked to percy the day before the balding guy with the long stringy gray hair the other voice you don't recognize and it's too muffled for you to make out anything about four feet from you not over the cellar but off a ways to it you're not certain where this doorway leads to the level of muffling you can hear through the floor leads you to believe that they're not directly above you what's this for advantage on constitution checks those are different from saving throws but it does give him 2d6 temporary hit points but those do not stack with the current temporary hit points you have constitution would not be of much benefit to you (creak) it gives 33 you move it up without a sound dart up catch yourself and lower it down carefully dark interior you use your flametongue dagger to look inside you are inside of a closet of some kind a ten by five closet there are coats and outfits around you you can push them aside this looks to be like a small storage room that has been repurposed as a closet of some kind easily enough as you put your ear to the door they are talking immediately on the other side of this door you are a room adjacent to it you do manage to pocket from a few of the coats about 47 gold pieces in total you make out conversation it seems to be between a voice you don't recognize and the gentleman earlier you met basically saying with everything that's going on now it's honestly very frustrating that these people wouldn't do their share of the bargain i myself i've been doing my best to keep them in order but at this point in time i think we need to do another show of strength in order to keep them working as hard as we have been another voice calms him down and says don't worry don't worry keep it under control at the very least we should have to be ready prepared if what lady briarwood says we should be having visitors any day now and i would hate to be caught flat-footed so we're going to go ahead and gather our arms going to make sure that we outfit the place the best we can traps alarms whatever is necessary to make sure that we are not caught off-guard (laughter) you guys came at just about the right time okay the conversation continues the older gentleman begins talking about i don't like the idea of there being any sort of conflict on our home turf i wish they would just meet them out head them off cut them off at the head why did we invite them in here that seems to be a dangerous circumstance stealth checks all around all righty you all slowly make your way up there's not enough room for all of you inside this room this storage space grog you go up you push open the door into the next room and it is a-- for lack of a better term a music room there's a few couches around there's a piano set up yeah you guys are opening a door to a room next to-- the wall you were listening to is the room next to you this opens up into a room adjacent so as you push out into the room it's dark in here the only light that's coming in is from the nearby window a little bit of sun's coming through from the rainstorm you can still hear the rain pattering on the window and the second floor above you there is no sound from the rain hitting the roof from this distance not particularly it's mostly decorative few vases some books on the shelf there is a door that is partially open that leads into hallway a hallway that seems to connect the two rooms yeah the door is the opposite of the window and the room that you're in is adjacent to the room that the voices are coming from the closet is in between the two yes out door hallway and then the room where the speaking is coming from yeah all right all right so take a d10 inspiration die so the three of you move on ahead the rest of you-- trinket is unable to climb all right the three of you stand at the double doors you moved around to the hallway is there a change to this arrangement that you would like you currently have grog vax and keyleth at the front and three of you in the back all right so there you are i'll put you on the side of the door there you hear the voices from the other side of the door conversing and talking back and forth scanlan percy what's the plan (impact noise) the door swings open both of them slamming into the sides of these two bookcases immediately you see behind the desk here and standing in the center you see the older gentleman in these long robes immediately spin his head and see essentially a troupe of armed villagers peasants dirty faces come rushing in all fucked up eyes and all rushing into the room they both turn looking completely caught off-guard by this you do also see in the room there are a few guards that are just waiting off to the side there's a couch area there's a fireplace you guys get a surprise round so let's go ahead and roll initiative to get the order of things here all right so 25 to 20 all right 20 to 15 so scanlan is 16 15 to ten ten to five is that everyone that's everyone yeah all righty first surprise round from all of you guys catching them off-guard up first is percy over here okay the guards you can see are wearing dark studded leather armor no cloaks both have rapiers or stilettos daggers on their sides they look at the sudden intrusion and begin going for their weapons you caught them off guard 22 does hit all righty all righty does the repair take an action okay so you're fine it does not break cool that's your turn one shot off the blast rings out as you fire the pepperbox it misfires and you quickly throw one of your tools in the air catch it and with one swift movement you unblock the passageway click it back up into its place out of the corner of your eye you turn and for the first time in five years you see standing behind the desk sir kerrion stonefell visually nearly the same as the last day you saw except maybe a bit of white on the sides of the hair armored with a nice set of relatively ornate leather armor blue hues and blacks the hair itself is this tousled brown there's a boyish charisma to him if he wasn't such an asshole and the moment you see him there's this boiling rage from within just to have that moment of sight there's a look of complete confusion as he has no idea who any of you are you look like paupers that literally burst into his office that ends your turn percy grog you're up all righty all righty minus five to hit what did you roll that definitely misses as you swing in (nervous yell) just ducks out of the way and even though he's older he reacted pretty quickly your weapon slams into the ground splintering some of the wood you peel back for a second attack 23 does hit plus ten damage 27 points of damage ooh so as he ducks out of the way you bring up the hammer a second time and (whack) smack him right square in the chest (grunts) the wind escapes him for a moment and the flames lick across the front of his chest he catches himself on the table between the sofa and chair behind him gets back on his feet looks to you for a second and pulls out two short swords i don't know who you are but you're going to regret this grog looks like an oafish butcher tubby on the sides an oldish middle-aged looking man scruffy beard scanlan does his best on that one whatever other visual you want to-- huge potbelly grog that ends your turn all right in theory it is a surprise round so you may have had advantage on that first strike so go ahead and roll it roll damage again we'll say this is an additional third strike in reaction to him pulling his blades out (wham) the hammer slams him a second time and he almost drops his weapons the actual end table he's resting on shatters beneath him and he (grunts) has to get back up onto his feet looking genuinely fearful now that ends your turn scanlan you're up correct best you can tell they're both in studded leather armor they don't look like guards like armored they look like thugs that are essentially there to watch about how far in that guy there that guy there all right you're going to attempt to dominate person what's the dc on that wisdom he rolled a 17 that's a fail he is currently dominated by scanlan good to know so as he pulls his heavy crossbow out loads it and aims it towards you looks over his shoulder for a second and trains it on his boss sir kerrion looking confused by this whole circumstance that ends your turn all right keyleth vax and vex take your surprise rounds now well it's two additional attacks against the one arrow so you'd get four attacks in one round essentially which guy there's two bad guys in there sir kerrion all right go for it 28 hits correct that was one of them you fire it it splits into three along the way and you roll for each attack on each arrow no 18 unfortunately does not hit either and you still get a fourth attack with your second-- so the first arrow does an additional lightning damage you haven't used your bonus action so yes you can two eyes going all-- 29 does hit yes okay gotcha so your arrows split two of them embedding into the actual desk itself and exploding with a burst of electricity a third one strikes him in the chest and you can see it stick in the armor and (boof) jolt him for a second he backs up a little bit catching himself on the edge of the desk as the final arrow comes and strikes him in the shoulder he cuts off the shaft of the arrow as it hits (grunts) out of anger and frustration this little boy do you want to move at all you would've had to move into the room to do that shot because you were outside in the hallway you were in the hallway when that happened so i'd say you'd have to be in the room to shoot them where would you want to be right there in the door best you can tell it looks like a very high quality studded leather yeah yeah you can do that you guys are the last ones to go as a thing of note a storm cloud appears in the shape of a cylinder that is ten feet tall with a 60-foot radius centered on a point you can see in the air the room won't fit it unfortunately it says if you're in a room that can't accommodate the cloud it can't appear if you want to consider your next move vax can go right there go for it just the dice no the sneak attack damage as well but just the modifiers don't get doubled surprise rounds yep 81 points of damage in one round of combat as you land on the desk your daggers bypass the armor and they find their way through the top of the armor and sink past the clavicles into the deep portion of the chest he (choking noise) from the impact and you hear him choke and blood splatters up from his throat he reaches up and grabs your hands and lifts them off out of the wound you see a gout of blood pour from the wound as you reach back and stab him a third time with the dagger as you catch yourself on the desk he reaches up and kicks you forcing you to get back on your feet with your daggers at the ready the blood's beginning to pour it's not a mortal wound but it's looking really bad for him he's not on death's door but that definitely took him down a few pegs (laughs) he looks at you and growls draws two rapiers from his side yeah make an insight check 27 nothing yet has given away any sort of essence of that he doesn't look particularly pale he definitely looks wounded and unhappy sure after the first hit-- right okay i'm usually under the impression that after the first hit they're no longer surprised they know you're there that's true i'll allow it yeah okay so yeah he's not happy really not happy okay all right that ends your turn keyleth what are you doing you are now filling up the entirety of the double-door frame right now at your size you can't quite get to him unfortunately you can try and move around this way maybe you will probably take an attack of opportunity from this guy but you can try and move around what's your movement yeah you can do that you move around and you get over there it's not flanking no yeah it's not flanking per se i mean you're adjacent to him you'd have to be on opposite sides to flank okay so you move into that guy there yeah this little peasant girl just went (growls) that'll hit he rolled a 12 he's knocked prone how much damage was it six points of piercing damage he's knocked prone (impact sound) falls on the ground what attack was it was it bite no all right is that your turn all right that ends the surprise round now we're at the top again percy you're up the one over here all righty 21 hits 21 points of damage all right (gunshot sound) you fire there's a burst of flame that gouts out the side of the pepperbox (impact sound) blasting into the chest of the guard off to the side he's thrown against the wall from the sheer force of it reaches down and grabs his chest and looks at it and you can see there's this red crimson across his hand as you've actually blown a piece of his leather armor open and you can see the wound in his chest there's a little bit of blood trickling out of his mouth and he looks angry at you 17 hits 21 points of damage nice (gunshot) you blast him this time on the other side of the shoulder you can see now this armor is now torn open exposing the wound here and his arm's now hanging to one side he's (grunts) he's looking in severe pain and barely hanging on at this point 20 to hit it hits eight points of damage all right this is the final one as he's looking at himself he's like (pained noises) angrily looks at you picks his crossbow up and aims it at you before he gets a chance to you aim your third shot (gunshot) firing hitting him right in the center of the head (impact noise) blasting out part of his face his body spins and then he falls over into the plant in the corner slumped over it there okay 26 hits plus an additional d6 points of damage for that so as you go around and fire from the barrel the shot fires out and as you recoil you guys for those who are noticing off to the side this dark smoke's beginning to slowly pour out of percy's body out of his eyes and his ears and the hand on the gun there's black smoke beginning to emit from his body and beginning to envelop the gun arm for those who are paying attention which right now would be pretty much just scanlan and vex okay damn with the additional d6 by the way with the additional d6 all dice rolled double then add the modifier okay (gunshot) the first blast hits and you can see the cloak is blown off the shoulder and set aflame and actually burns to cinders in the corner sir kerrion looks down and is like (grunts) and is looking very very curiously the second shot rings out (gunshot) and at this point now the smoke is wreathing your entire arm the gun isn't even visible it's just this giant column of smoke (gunshot) the second shot rings out this time hitting him in the side of the neck and the shoulder blowing a chunk off of it so part of the bone is now sticking out it's like (noise of pain) he reaches back with his arm and is like with the rapier up clutching it for a second and leans over and looks back over and is (pained panting) ripley to drop the spell you can do it on your turn all right so so that finishes percy's turn it is now sir kerrion stonefell's turn kerrion's going to use a bonus action to use second wind and that was with the head shot you said and deals damage right okay sir kerrion is going to in the circumstance is going to move this way just to hide alongside vax and since you're on top-- his both rapiers out and you just jammed your daggers in is going to do a flurry of four strikes against you with disadvantage on all the attacks yeah 16 the first attack all right rolled a one on the second that is a 21 on the third attack and no that's a 14 on the fourth attack that disadvantage just-- swinging wide gets one hit on you that is eight points of piercing damage against you that finishes sir kerrion sir kerrion is now going to-- he's actually going to take a step back towards the wall you get an attack of opportunity all right that hits all righty steps back and slams his fist against the wall (thudding) so that ends kerrion's turn grog you're up okay go for it yeah 24 hits 24 hits are you going into a frenzied rage all righty gotcha (whack) is this with the fire damage as well from the hammer yeah so the hammer strikes across the back the broadside of his shoulders and back (grunts) looks up at you and looks over at sir kerrion being annihilated behind the desk and is trying to nervously gauge his circumstance second strike smacks him upside his body and he's like (panting) and he's trying to take in the surroundings and figure out a plan all right are you going to stay where you are it is now master vouk's turn you have not heard his name yet but it's his turn he's going to use a-- okay he's going to use a bonus action to disengage from you he's going to back away just one step that way use his action to-- actually instead he's not going to use bonus action to disengage he's going to use a bonus action to use misty step vanishes reappears over by the wall uses the action to cast a level three invisibility on both him and sir kerrion stonefell so they are both considered invisible at the moment not from that unfortunately it's an immediate teleport so he just vanishes from in front of you we'll say for the purposes of this they are both currently invisible and that's going to end-- correct his turn hasn't come up yet now it becomes scanlan's turn okay stinking cloud appears what's the radius on that i think it's a 20-foot radius isn't it okay cool so you just filled this entire hallway you can keep it localized to that area you'll just be in your own cloud you stop just short of the door and fill this whole area with a stinking cloud okay so stinking cloud is not yet up okay so next round you are up next you take your d10 inspiration confused but accept the inspiration a chuckle in the middle of a hearty battle is always worth a little inspiration you step into the room at that point you trigger your action to release the stinking cloud you want to stay there you're just outside of the radius what are you doing vex surprise round and they're lowest on the initiative count okay which one i will say you don't really have visual on him from that position now you can see yeah okay go for it you have advantage on the attack roll because he is prone 27 hits all righty okay if it's ten feet he's not there it'd just be keyleth and sir kerrion makes it 21 actually exactly okay 19 as it snaps and it bursts the electricity shockwaves out he shakes and on the ground takes in the effect the blast seems to-- is it half damage if they make the save no it's to anybody within radius okay so roll 1d8 okay so one damage to you and one damage to sir kerrion you see a spark of energy around the invisible form as it wavers in place all right that ends your turn vax all right was that the last thing you wanted to do with your turn i think if you attack him that was more of the burst in the vicinity all right at disadvantage on all the attacks why do you get advantage disadvantage on weapon strikes because he's invisible yeah you're swinging in the area and you can't get blades to find any of his physical person you're striking and arcing across the wooden wall behind him causing these giant gashes all right that ends your turn unless you want to stay where you are right there you probably would've had to move up there to attack him oh you're just throwing the daggers right okay so you're just throwing the daggers from the desk okay that ends your turn now keyleth drop your wolf form okay yeah so both of their forms all of a sudden are outlined by this sparking purple halo that shows you directly where they are all right so that's your turn you going to move anywhere okay okay as you back up an invisible form that just got revealed swings out at you with a rapier an attack of opportunity at disadvantage on the attack he has advantage on her because he's-- although-- you can see him that's true faerie fire kind of made this weird indeed just a minute folks lot of overlapping effects here because everyone has magic yeah it doesn't benefit from invisible it's at disadvantage it has disadvantage on the attack that is-- and 15 yeah so (whoosh) as you back up all right that ends your turn now this guard gets up (grunts) gets his crossbow aims it up and looking around the room aims it this would be-- seeing his friend turn on his boss briefly after you shouted that song at him is going to turn the crossbow on you yes that's going to be a 16 to hit 17 all right so as it comes towards you you just duck out of the way and it passes and snags into the wall behind you (arrow landing sound) no hit the thug is then going to drop the crossbow on the ground and rushing up pull out a mace that was hanging from the side of its belt and engage you right there this guy is going to attempt to make two attacks against master vouk strono has advantage on them because faerie fire that hits and two attacks with a mace that is 18 yeah hits with both (whack whack) with the mace both times that guy no he's attacking the guy that's invisible (laughter) yeah 19 yeah he does not make it still under control that ends the thugs' turn top of the round percy you're up sir kerrion okay it does not benefit from invisibility and you have advantage yes you do vox machina broken (laughter) 16 to hit misses 20 does hit 15 (gunshot) you see one blast hits the wall and causes part of the wood to splinter outward the second shot impacts the partially invisible form you can see a splash of blood across the desk in front partially spattering across vax and one of his guards so percy how do you want to do this this is against sir kerrion percy currently visible at your disposal sir kerrion you have enough of a shot to finish him off the smoke is pushing you vengeance vengeance vengeance repeatedly echoing in the back of your mind how do you want to do this okay you pull the mask down the bird-beaked element to the mask now wreathed in smoke resembling very closely the entity that made the original bargain with you with that the little bit of wreathed magical energy you can barely make out an expression of horror on the face before the resounding blast sound rocks the room the actual bullet itself a trail of black smoke behind it as it impacts the front of sir kerrion's face the entirety of his head caving inward as the back splatters across the scarred wooden wall behind him the body slumps to the ground immediately you guys all glance over at percy you don't even see percy you just see a humanoid entity made of black swirling smoke energy with the peaked beak of his mask poking through can you move a faerie fire i think when you use it it just stays where it was could be wrong but i'm pretty sure that's how it works from there it's 20 foot no not from where you placed it right on him unfortunately that's okay yeah no it just happens once with that you recoil from it and the voice echoes in the back of your head going yes you drop it (impact sound) okay okay that's your turn sir kerrion is gone annihilated that brings us to grog right there okay so you move up to him (whoosh) swinging the hammer wide 15 just hits 23 hits okay so as you rush up you can see it's pulled out its mace and is swinging it in a wide arc towards vax as soon as you rush up it looks to you out of the corner of the eye drops the mace and before the mace can hit the ground your hammer actually swings around hits the mace and then both your hammer and the mace slam into the side of his head pushing him down onto the desk stunned blood spatters across the wood as he's (gasping) twitching on the table already done and you swing the hammer lift it up (impact sound) like gallagher performance the head just (explosion noise) (groaning) vouk is currently looking very-- yeah he's vouk-ed all right is going to cast haste on himself and is going to run dropping invisibility and leaping through that window the guard gets an attack of opportunity and keyleth does the guard has advantage a three no the guard misses with a mace no this would be with your staff you just (whack) 13 damage all righty as you smack him at that point-- it brings him exactly to zero (cheering) all right that ends his turn (laughs) wow man surprise rounds man you guys are nasty all right scanlan you're up yeah i mean you can cancel it but otherwise he's just-- yeah you can tell him you can't tell him to attack himself technically stinking cloud is a concentration spell so if you were to maintain concentration on that you would lose your domination so it's your call which one do you want to maintain okay so the stinking cloud fades from the hallway i believe it is spells like that usually are if it's to maintain-- this is where that circlet would come in handy you will be able to shortly it's all right he's used it pretty well a couple of times cool good to know that ends your turn is anyone going to take any specific actions okay while you guys all do that the guard leaves the room you hear a few whispers in the hallway a conversation with a person unseen the conversation fades and the guard walks back seemingly job done also is going to make a wisdom saving throw that is a 17 he remains dominated you guys now-- for the moment the threat seems to have subsided at the moment you're still in the house and there's still apparently things in the house whether it'd be guards or other individuals in the house that are on edge as they heard a series of gunshots ring out screams and other sorts of cacophony the fact that this is even right now being handled is a very lucky series of rolls on his part so you're going through sir kerrion's body he has two rapiers so it's like holding a stiletto he has a potion of greater healing on him never got round to actually using it okay as you finish gashing the name out on the side of the metal and start breathing you can see the name itself begin to glow with a slight dull purple glow and burn away from the metal leaving just the scratch marks from his body you have two rapiers regular rapiers studded leather armor that is enchanted with a plus one bonus and that potion of greater healing so you can mark those down okay going through the desk go ahead and make an investigation check yeah you find wax seals you find parchment you find pocket change about six or seven gold pieces just left in there on himself though on his actual person on sir kerrion's body you find about 320 gold pieces as his own personal fund looking through the desk you find mentions of the bridge plan to move between the two continents to go across the channel to wildmount basically plans the discussion a lot of what they were planning to do with emon you also find a small notebook that just has some hand notes of his okay so mark that down he's currently-- he's got to zero hit points he's bleeding out which he does not he's still dominated doesn't make his save all right he seems momentarily confused before the blow of the-- are you hitting him with the blade or pommel yeah he was unconscious and he was making his death saving throws i was treating him for that circumstance when you go straight to zero like that you know-- okay 32 he is (impact noise) from barely damaged to nothing he goes immediately unconscious in the corner face down in the middle of a bookcase okay (gasps chokes) (muffled moaning) (muffled murmur) (affirmative grunt) (sounds uncertain) (affirmative grunt) (sounds ambiguous) (negative grunt) (sounds ambiguous) (sounds sad) (affirmative grunting) (eager affirmative grunting) okay suddenly he goes (muffled panic noises) (whimpers) (grunts in agreement) (gasping for breath) please don't kill me i can show you a secret entrance into the castle i know a way in i don't think so they've closed it off if you can find a way through they won't expect it there is one yes yes in the forest look i can bring you to their project room under the castle what they're working on please don't kill me they've been-- they've been working on something it's hard to describe i've only been there once it's beyond my interests but it is part of the reason they even took this place aye she's powerful i'll give you that she scares me more than the two of them it's more difficult than expected aye it's under the castle it's under the city all the caverns are there i can show you how to get there i've been there they've taken me stuff grows it's how we do the farming i don't know maybe it has something to do with what they're doing under the castle it's an excavation or they're building something i don't know the details of it comparatively i'm just a peasant to them i work with-- well i worked with kerrion five years yes yes i was part of the incursion he hears the crinkling of paper (scared fast breathing) no he looks down at his bound arms and legs it's right-- he spits and puts a little droplet it's loosely in the area of the western side of the mountain that the castle is built on roughly around the entrance where you escaped when you and cassandra left whitestone five years before no i can show you-- i can show you where their project is the tunnels you need me not often they don't need to kerrion does the work for them did the work for them lady briarwood does she's the one who made them she's strong with necromancy she is there isn't even a slow scuffle you just reach in and (wet ripping noise pained scream) you immediately jam the cloth back in the cloth begins to slowly soak with blood you hold almost a pound of muscle a now motionless tongue in your hand bloody at its base these tears are running down his face (muffled sobbing and coughing) you pull the cloth out (pained cry and choking sounds) (noises of pain) he starts screaming in pain as you're burning what into his head the symbol of the de rolo family he looks over at the body of sir kerrion which is still slumped against the wall he falls out into the rain (boof) falling on his side (whimpers) he's being rained on and he's trying to struggle with his bindings okay then he gets to his feet and starts running are you leaving sir kerrion's body are you leaving sir kerrion's body to burn with the house he threw one of them out flying out the window that you just shattered you fly up the rain is coming down on you it's a little hard to fly you get up to the top of the roof you transform into yourself again all righty okay as you guys head back down to the cellar you guys all head back down to the cellar you throw them both out the window including the body of sir kerrion (boof) out into the yard you head back down into the cellar okay it will take you a few minutes you now see as you're finishing the symbol vouk running to the front of the building and you hear the voices of two guards going master vouk what happened tell us unbind him yes sir and the two guards at the front of the building are talking with him you finish the symbol okay you're on the roof so you don't see them but you know they're off to the side of the roof so you can roll it off the roof down to them they both freak out and react and seem to get into a defensive position they start arming themselves and you hear crossbow bolts being set into place you guys make your ways back down through the cellar where trinket's waiting patiently (bear grunts) you guys come out of the cellar now catch keyleth you guys are now out in the open still during the day rain pouring down the barracks are attached to the castle stealth check real fast guys if you want to quickly yeah stealth checks yeah sure enough both guards rush around the corner you guys have already leapt over the fence however they see the fence the fence is bent and they go rushing toward that direction you guys have already disappeared into the various alleyways making your way back towards the inn in the center of town okay they're giving chase they're hearing the sounds of your footsteps a little but eventually their sounds fade you do hear in the distance a bell start going off you start seeing people emerging from their homes hearing the bell and you would know this this would be a warning bell for whenever a fire breaks out in the city you see smoke beginning to rise up even through the rainstorm the fire is fighting the rain but the smoke is black and it's starting to fade you gather the building itself did not catch fire enough to burn into rubble due to the rain but you've probably left a very visible mark on the roof people begin to gather from the outside and you see folks running past the alley as you make your way back to the tavern that you currently have as your base of operations you all make your way in safely from the rain take a deep breath and come to understand that you've definitely started the motion of whatever it is you're intending to do we'll see how it plays out in the near future we'll call the session there for the night yeah sure very very cool and well
