get a comic con booster seat it'll be good hello everyone can i just say how happy i am that this many people came out to join us on the godawful early 1030am on a saturday at comic con that's amazing (cheering) glad you guys could be here for this we're vox machina we've never done anything the right way (laughter) i know all right so we've been working on this for a little bit but we finally get to announce that we're making a critical role comic book (cheering) it's okay we had a bunch of artists thrown at us but we wanted to pick somebody from the community where you've seen their incredible work the one we kept coming to is an artist named olivia samson in the critical role art community and she has agreed to be the artist for the first six-issue run we have a couple examples here we can show you here's some of the early lineart that she's done it takes place in stillben in the surrounding k'tawl swamp we have a couple pages where we can show the progression of some of the early art design and coloring over on the next page there we go show some of the later-- no this is just a couple pages don't worry then we go to the next one one of the early color layouts there yeah that's the one then we move onto the actual character art layouts that she had done for some of the designs and then the final example of what the final color and art's going to look like in the book we're excited to give you guys this first look that information is to come soon i understand we will have that information official to you as soon as possible i guarantee you at least you'll see something in your hands by the end of the year (victor voice) i apologize if it's been at all difficult to have made a fool of myself in a public venue however i am happy to sell any sort of black powder to you if you come by my place hi andi (ominous voice) it's a shame he has to die that was a fun one only because it took two and a half years for me to have happen and then it hit and then it lasted a year which may have been a little long but you can't guide the length of the narrative in d&d the conclave arc definitely was a fun one (cheering) (gasping) lucy right but if you could choose what would it be oh kima as a wolverine (cheering) in older editions yeah that is an aasimar that's the two boys that you met-- perfect the frog guys spoiler we're replacing sam with george takei is that when he retires from adventuring (grog voice) i'm good plenty of things to do in canon the titanstone pasties do have tassels that's our next book release is vox machina's guide to travel awesome thank you so much awesome thank you so much what are your characters grateful for i can't answer in 500 voices at once it'd be very lovecraftian if i did that all of a sudden you heard 500 voices come out all of your minds shatter together as one hi kristina oh it's on now the god of naps and free time good to see you again we're you know shows are a big undertaking and trying to get the logistics worked out are always difficult both within locations and scheduling everything we'd definitely like to do more live shows so if we manage to put something together for that in the future we will be happy to announce it and eagerly throw it in your face ooh that's a neck-and-neck battle between final fantasy vi and chrono trigger (cheering) yeah it was 16-bit you got a laura song oh my god vox machina in star trek would be so horrible (laughter) i'm not going to dungeon master your holodeck experiences guys i'm sorry i got close enough with an audiobook once and that was weird in its own right that was an awesome question vax if you are that intrigued alter self she can use at will (laughter) vaxdoesntpoop next question right i take a lot of inspiration from elements of that vecna story because vecna's such an intrinsic villain to d&d lore to change him too much would be upsetting to me and a lot of you guys as well there is a lot of expectation there so i want to make him unique to this campaign in this world because he's definitely not the exact same character there are elements of that that are classic lore that are pulled into this that may be revealed in the future especially now that we're releasing campaign guides and this has become a world now that we can bring to you guys to play in i have to be careful to not pull in too much of the very licensed d&d lore otherwise we would have to reskin everything and you all are like oh wait which one's which oh no i'm trying to keep that to a minimum but if you know a lot about vecna-- then don't tell them anything don't listen to her the characters will die before you get artwork done yeah oh way back then oh man sorry what am i supposed to do at level 16 some clown scared a family things get a little heavy in the later levels but we'll get back to the carefree feeling probably in the next campaign for me i guess what i miss a little bit is the anonymity to go into the dealers' hall but other than that i wouldn't change anything this is amazing this is amazing well now i can't do that costume thanks brian for me surprised that people want to play there and everything's been reactionary creating the campaign guide was reactionary that wasn't our idea green ronin came to us they were like you want to do a campaign guide okay so we're amazed that people have interest in them timed scenarios d&d is a lot of planning and arguing and trying to figure things out and there's game time versus planning time and i love a scenario where i can tell the players well you have this much time to do both go it ups the intensity so i love me my hourglasses definitely thank you (mccree voice) it's about 34 minutes till it's high noon (cheering) i am so conscious of what time it is at all times now (laughter) yeah i've mentioned a little bit i think but the next campaign i'm planning to be roughly 20 or so years beyond the end of this campaign and it's going to be in a different continent and there's a possibility depending on which characters and npcs survive this final arc they'll be existing somewhere in the world next question yeah seriously calm down taco bells definitely after an intense session like driving scratch the knee you want taco bell (mopey voice) yes okay why did you ever get the thought it was me going oh done for the week it's me going i'm sorry it's what the story did you want to talk about people that prod though travis every given moment turns to me and goes so what's this item do you don't know and he'll go ugh
