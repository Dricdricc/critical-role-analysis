implore people to do whatever you can to donate and help those who are currently recovering in the relief effort in the areas that were heavily hit by this earthquake having lived through a number of earthquakes in my youth it's a very scary and very dangerous thing and nothing on the scale of what they're undergoing there so if you have the opportunity we want to promote unicef and oxfam m√©xico

ahead and dive in to tonight's episode of critical role [dramatic music] as he reaches out and his fingers touch the side of your face you feel the muscles tighten and the skin begin to reform as he pulls away there's still a little bit of reddish rash or irritation of fresh skin but the scarring seems to have subsided and your face is intact that's up to you guys all right so you guys are continuing up the staircase marching order all right trinket is in your necklace or out now trinket is out and being stealthy perfect as you continue up the stone stairway you said you were looking for traps i figured slow moving up the steps as you slowly are looking for-- okay go for it okay you continue up the staircase the steps being wider than the previous ones you've seen before eventually you pass through the carved tunnel of a cave-in up the steps the next chamber reveals itself naught but 25 feet upwards it opens up you find yourselves standing within a small building ruin but the walls have fallen around you you can see the bare structure around you elements of the base floor rubble and broken slate you see around you what must have been a once-colossal courtyard or a commons for the dwarven city of thomara with varying levels and paths and platforms holding rare types of now petrified leafless trees scattered amongst this thoroughfare climbing up dozens of feet like frozen bolts of lightning forever reaching in vain you see dead-littered paths weaving between stout multi-leveled buildings of thomara make corpses that have been torn apart and are twitching shifting on their own the occasional hand pulling its way across whatever bits and pieces of undead here remain they are not functional they have been so sundered through the ages or other sort of confrontation and yet are cursed to forever twitch and wander your eyes as they focus in on this interior you glance to the opposite side you see the ghost of this past beauty of the city surrounding you is now currently defiled on a mass scale over half of this 300-foot-wide cavern appears to have collapsed or is currently crushed under an invading mass of black earth and rock unlike the rest of the titan's interior the familiar smell of wet earth and ancient decay is now mixed with another familiar scent of cold ash and iron dust the smell of the shadowfell at this distance you can see the rough shape of three carved archways at the base of this inverted mass of earth that curves down and collapses half of this cavern about 40 or so feet apart you can see at each of these entrances there are some figures some shapes they are too far from you at the moment hundreds of feet away from you to make any sort of clear vision but you see a few bits of torchlight in the distance and shifting shadows near those entrances currently you guys are emerging from underneath in this small rubble there is no light in here the only bit of light you can see is some of that bio-luminescent fungus that you had in that previous tunnel and the torchlight across the way it's a wide space as the cavern opens in this large dome-like interior path loosely kidney bean shaped or a wide oval half of it is currently crushed and occupied by this darker mass of shadowfell earth that's the roots of the city crushing down into this chamber where the titan ends and thomara begins would be this particular threshold well the sphere is back in the tunnel with you you can concentrate on it and bring it with you and it moves at a very slow speed okay cool so what's your intelligence modifier again three so you can move it 15 feet a round it's slower than any of you as you make your way up the tunnels this hovering ball of dense death and destruction is (humming) humming ominously simon three makes its way it does give off vibration and a noise to it you do hear the subtle hum about 80 or so feet it's very faint sound okay so you put on a robe and scanlan puts on a robe all right make a perception check perception check okay between the both of you focusing in the still silence you can hear very faint distant muttering of conversation briefly on the left archway but around you aside from the small skittering of an occasional hand that is crawling its way forward you don't see any full-bodied undead in fact in comparison to the chamber you'd exited more than an hour ago which had hundreds and hundreds of wandering undead this is mostly vacant of anything that isn't directly at those archways they're about 150 or so feet they're right at the center part of where the chamber would be where the earth of thar amphala's current resting place begins austin powers it the ball is about two feet in diameter it continues until it's out of sight so it starts digging and burrowing-- as soon as you send it downward at an angle it hits the floor and begins carving its own path tunneling lower and lower-- at this point i'd say it's about 70 feet it begins to slowly come back in your direction sourcing it would be upwards at an angle from where you see the base of thar amphala it's in that direction at an upward angle you get the sense that this is near the edge of the city other than the very faint bio-luminescence left by the little patches of dull orange here and there that give you a sense of the overall scope and enclosure of the chamber no other light source there's no opening make a perception check the left archway you see two torches being held by two human-sized figures humanoid hoods are down but you can't see at this distance anything beyond the size they appear to be surrounded by five or more dwarf-size skeletons that are shambling in unison around them in one uniform movement as they pace around the opening to the archway the middle archway you see another humanoid figure but armored you can see the sharp edges of plated shoulders and a helmet and a few other skeletal figures wandering around but one at the very very edge of the one torch that it holds you see one large hulking figure about ten or so feet tall but you only see the very edge you don't actually see the rest of the body all you see is the edge of the shoulder or the beginning of the side and then there's the right archway you can see three small-ish-looking humanoid figures two that are very hunched on hands and legs have a humanoid silhouette on the head and shoulders but they're down on the ground almost like a dog between the two of them there is one humanoid figure that's still hunched slightly but still standing upright hooded and cloaked as you watch them for a moment you see they do move a little bit glancing around the area keeping a watch but they appear to be stationed there with a minor patrol in the vicinity for the most part they are about 40 feet from each other as there is a curve the right and the left archway probably have a hard time seeing each other the middle one has a view of each occasionally they'll interface they converse a bit between the two of them but for the most part they're definitely keeping a look out they're very vigilant and looking out into the empty space before them okay that would probably help make a perception check so this is the central figure in the armor it's wearing similar armor not to the knight you had encountered with vecna more the blackened armored knight that you had battled at the ziggurat on marquet when you first encountered delilah briarwood and you found the pathway into the shadowfell well no you murdered that one but it's similar set of armor yes it's 15 it's tied to the item what's the ring say you can scry outside of it but you cannot scry into it with your spell okay hold on you back up into the hallway to find a space that isn't immediately visible and begin to build the circle of incantation the rest of you keep watch in case anything begins to make its way toward the entrance as you complete the ritual your vision expands and you feel your essence being pulled up through the earth and rock changing from gray and brown to black and dead until eventually for a brief instant you see a burst of the city of thar amphala matching precisely your memory of the inner sanctum of the city in an instant there's a rush of momentum and energy and you see footsteps you see before you the death knight that you had previously encountered in the struggle is stepping up these dark ruddy stone steps one two three you can hear the echo surround you in this slightly curving staircase you do not unfortunately you see a very vague image of a room that's disappearing behind him as it curves around where you can see two other armored figures similar to the one that's in the center archway that are standing watch in that chamber they vanish as he curves around and you watch as he steps up step-step-step currently it's a windowless stairway that curves yeah you see a sudden swelling of greenish-blue light as he reaches the apex of this staircase you now see the top of the tower exposed where three large hooked stone spires curve inward to a familiar top of the tower out of the corner of your eye you see-- the sky itself from this perspective has this weird sickly blue-green tint to it and as you try and focus beyond the proximity of the knight you get a glimmer of some shape currently gliding in the air above then a voice says no and-- knowing as you've cast the spell before a creature that can see invisible objects sees the sensor as a luminous orb about the size of your fist creatures that can see invisible can see the source of a scry spell not necessarily but they can see that something is scrying on the space as soon as you kick back you're like shit that's probably what it was make a perception check it's real dark and you have to travel deeper into the actual cavern space to try and see any other tunnels no it encompasses the entire opposite side of this this was at one point a 250- to 300-foot-long cavern but half of it is entirely occupied by the base of thar amphala they're about 140 or so feet it's dark and there are a number of dwarven buildings in various levels of disrepair and collapsing 140 150 feet roll an investigation check this is which one odell is the one that ran off viskorad yes turn back and tell that viskorad found sneaky prey i might have mis-said it at the moment i was on painkillers viscon i think is the name of an island elsewhere (laughter) he's human okay so hide in plain sight and camouflage hide in plain sight is the camouflage you're referring to camouflage you can really only do on yourself sure you can arnold-schwarzenegger-in-predator this for other folks i'll say make a wisdom check to see how well you manage to mask the terrain nearby a check it looks like unfortunately the shale and broken rock in this vicinity it's hard to find anything that would actually help hide them beyond their natural stealth roll so you're going have to rely on your pass without a trace the only person going forward is you advantage on charisma checks note you have freedom of movement how long does it last is it an hour so you have freedom of movement for an hour everyone else who's not going forward make a stealth check please you go back and watch previous episodes and liam's not there it's really weird i love it perfect pike keyleth wow that's some pretty solid rolls guys you all stay as quiet as possible moving along the exterior of vex's ability to move forward you move forward slowly while keeping scanlan in sight you slowly begin to move forward with simon three humming slowly in front of you interesting character choice you guys are quietly stepping through and you hear his footfalls echoing and immediately you see some of the torches shift and there's some talk and some whispering back and forth and a small shout you watch as some of the skeletal entities at two of the entrances shift and look in that direction and begin to shamble slowly the two torch-bearers on the right begin to move forward as the armored figure in the center watches on arms crossed what are you doing you have three archways that's the middle one make a deception check with advantage deception the shambling skeletons to the left of you you can hear the scraping and clacking sound as their bones rattle and shift across the stone floor pieces of rock being pushed as their feet drag across the stone dwarven walkways the two torch-bearing cloaked figures you can see approaching and they're talking amongst themselves one of them is currently holding some sort of a holy symbol in their hand and they're starting to glow a bit they're glaring forward the armored figure with the arms crossed puts a hand out like this they both look over and stop and hold in place the armored figure steps forward you can hear the armored footfalls across the stone the rot behemoth which you now see emerging behind rot behemoth the entities you saw patrolling thar amphala and two of them stormed into sprigg's house begins to follow behind him every minute or two you have the vibrating footfall of the titan and a few of the rocks fall and tumble from the ceiling and a bit of dust begins to get knocked free from the high-up ceiling of the cavern the armored figure approaches gets within about 15 feet of you and stops you see no face this is magneto-style there's space for the eyes and the mouth but it's too shadowed for you to make any features out it's this dark void you can see the hooked spiked shoulders and the horns built to come out of the sides of the helmet arms still crossed before what did you say there's a pregnant pause a stillness that causes the back of your neck to grow warm the nerves begin to creep up the back of your spine instinctually your eyes begin to glance at the two other archways as you see shapes shifting the armored figure gives a subtle chuckle very well lead us to this find the head retracts slightly confused and a bit worried he takes one step onto the back foot almost like it's not sure if it should be close to you or not it raises its hand back towards the two other torch-bearing cloaked figures and goes vislal take the orb one of the hooded figures steps forward and takes a moment and concentrates the orb jolts towards him immediately and he yelps he's going to try again okay with a second try you can see the sweat on his brow as he begins to step backward like i'm not really good with this are you relinquishing your control over it so then he focuses for a moment and the orb-- you can feel the slight bit of will that you had imposed over it has pulled back the orb begins to push forward slowly in his direction of choice you can see a smile come across his hairless older face he nudges the other figure which you can see is a female half-orc who looks heavily scarred across the chin and the side of the neck and they're both missing the corresponding eye they both begin to move forward and slowly push the orb past you the vibration you hear getting louder in your guys' direction as the armored figure begins to follow suit behind the rot behemoth begins to follow and the armored knight goes keep watch the skeletons begin to move backward with the rot behemoth now you have the heavy footfalls of the large looming rot behemoth in the center walkway and a handful of skeletons for that approach blockading that as the knight with the two other hooded figures begin to make their way towards the entrance where you guys rose up so they begin to walk forward and slowly make their way towards the staircase that you guys emerged from you guys part a bit move around the sides okay you guys keep as quiet as you possibly can there's a brief moment pike where your arm is on the side of one of the stone walls and a piece of rock snaps and breaks to the ground one of the figures with the hood back stops for a second and goes to look just as one of the titan footfalls impacts and the whole area shakes sending other rocks tumbling around it seems to be just enough to distract they continue walking forward you hear the hum of the orb as it slowly makes its way past you faint hint of a doppler you watch them descend into the ruins that you emerged from down into the tunnel currently you still have the cluster of eight skeletons on the left one there are four skeletons and the rot behemoth in the middle and on the right you still have one humanoid figure flanked by two hunched humanoid figures there are eight skeletons on the left path four skeletons and the rot behemoth in the center and then one humanoid figure with two crouched humanoid figures on the right they're about 40 or 50 feet from each other around a curved outcropping from your perspective it's around this the center can see both the right and left probably can't see each other too well it's dark and there's a vanishing point around the curve where the far ends can't make eye contact they can both see the middle yeah they're about 12 feet wide and about ten feet tall and when i say they're arches--there's simple stone placed and then built around to maintain an arch but they've been fairly recently constructed and it's more like the very basic beginnings of a mine shaft it looks like these tunnels were carved probably once thar amphala arrived above the titan so they're not extremely stable but they're stable enough for passage in and out he went with the orb the middle make a deception check with advantage still 25 the rot behemoth glances at you you see its large metal cage-like helmet that guards its sunken head that rests squarely in the center of its chest at this point the smell emanating from it is this awful combination of rot and long-putrid milk you can see no face behind the mask just glowing red coals for eyes as it watches you as you pass it doesn't make any motion you can see it seems to curve upward it's not stairs it looks like the interior of this was made with a sphere of annihilation like someone had taken a while-- because there's no dirt there's no mounds of dirt around it it looks like someone had been carefully carving this path you get the sense this sphere has been a utility object since they arrived you have no idea where she is well they have to follow you you walk about three feet past the behemoth and stop it slowly turns towards you probably both (laughter) just charisma bonus charisma modifier okay that's all you're going to leave it at 23 anything you do to assist will reveal you from stealth oh yeah roll a d12 and add that to your 23 eight onto that so a 31 there's another long pause generally an entity like this is tethered to the will of one creature in most circumstances it would not take any orders from anybody outside of it but somehow your words get it to consider in its simplistic undead mind that if its master is in danger then obviously the master would want help somehow your force of words circumvent the tethered command and the behemoth begins to hulkingly make its way with the four other skeletons walking with the skittering of the skeletons away towards where its master disappeared yeah it's natural earth and stone as natural as the shadowfell's slate and rock is it's unworked for the most part tunnel one the one with the eight skeletons-- oh that one with you guys having to keep at the 60-foot radius with scanlan it's about 80 or so feet behind you so you create a stone over that entrance yeah they've all been in there for about two minutes at this point sure are you going for the three humanoids so you're waiting for them you hold off you talk you guys move over stealthily they don't seem to notice your approach just the two of you you see there's one hooded figure hood up holding a torch with one hand but the torch is up above so the shadow cast you're not really able to make out any features or so you can see the faint side of an older female face that's all you can make out and you see two shadow ghasts the creatures that you saw leaping from rooftop to rooftop in thar amphala and one of them you captured briefly at sprigg's house they're both on chained necklace-like chokers being held in the other hand of this individual like dogs roll an attack both of you guys 30 awesome why is my music not working 30 definitely hits for you vax all hit all righty there you go 46 damage so the humanoid figure in the center holding the torch all you see is them drop back to the ground as the chains clank to the ground the torch clatters and you see the light shift and flicker the two shadow ghasts immediately look in your direction then the wall of stone goes over and covers the top and you start catching up to the rest of the group grog pike you're running to catch up with vex and vax you're making the second strike go ahead this is against which shadow ghast the left or right you don't know all right that hits what'd you roll vax to hit all righty then you are shooting that hits no because at this point they've already been made aware yeah that's enough second shot destroys most of the upper body of the shadow ghast on the left the loud gunshots going off in the cavern echoes and you see the skeletons beginning to shift from the other hallway toward the direction the gunshots came from as you guys are rushing up you manage to catch up to the rest of them as the final shadow ghast (snarls) and it only sees currently the two of you it's going to run forward and it's going to move here even at its full distance it gets right up next to you but it's not going to be able to attack unfortunately it uses its full movement and runs toward you with an unnatural speed and it leaps and lands on you with its claws grabbing your chest and you begin to fall back and start to catch yourself go ahead and make your attacks the rest of you manage to catch up to the group everyone else running up to the center tunnel as you guys approach you hit the tunnel and begin to move inside as eight skeletons begin to curve around the corner no currently she's still being assaulted by a shadow ghast perfect you're stabbing at the guy that's got her that'll do it actually as you repeatedly jab your dagger into the back of it its tongue is lashing out and its claws are trying to sink into her armor can't seem to find any purchase on her flesh the horrible smell of its breath is on you as you watch as dark blood spatters out of its mouth on you as it's being stabbed to death on top of you the weight pushes you onto your back and you crumple onto the ground as it goes limp you have to shove it off of you as you guys are getting up to do this action the rest of you made it up to the tunnel and you can see as the eight skeletons begin to turn around the corner and begin hacking at the slowest who's there which is going to be pike so pike you get four skeletons that are able to attack you at this entrance way 13 misses misses misses they all miss they're scratching at your armor you guys run past the skeletons all right so you guys all continue to run in as you guys run past pike four attacks of opportunity on you from the ones that were attacking you 15 no no 17 no what's your armor class 19 it rolled naturally plus four equals 23 one has managed to finally get to you it swings up with its shortsword at you and you take eight points of piercing damage one of the skeletal shortswords strikes across the back of your armor it glides off and catches you in the edge of the ear and you're like (yelps) but you guys continue to run into this are you running with them as you're shouting this to skeletons you glance off over the back of your shoulder and you see a bit of torchlight emerge as a black orb burns through a stone wall make an investigation check you put your hand through to find a specific place-- 13 maybe all right go ahead and roll 24 that hits go ahead and roll damage 1d4 with the gauntlets then add your strength modifier all right as you slam your fist into the wall part of it breaks and cracks and you can see earth begin to fall and filter in and it's not enough to take it down you can hear multiple skeleton voices and you see a bunch of them rushing up the hallway at you okay both of you guys take fire throw your second punch all hit travis 12 24 okay so you're grabbing pike by the back of the armor and you guys are rushing it is starting to collapse and fall behind you at that moment you feel the low sub-vibration of another titan footfall at that point it sends the rest of this cavern into a more rapid collapse as you can hear the cracking sound of the rocks behind you grog make a dexterity saving throw you guys are probably a little bit higher up than him 17 as you're moving forward and you're rushing some of the rocks begin to slam into you both you and pike suffer seven points of bludgeoning damage the impact of rocks-- make an athletics check yeah the rocks begin to collapse around you and they begin to pin your body but the physical strength you have manages to break through and you are not held in the collapsing tunnel beginning to push forward you all begin to rush slowly the sound of the collapsing tunnel subsides as you begin to glance upward and see the color of green-blue light approaching make a perception check it sounds like the crumbling noises have begun to subside and all you can hear now is the slow resting and easing to existing loose rubble and rock the slow clattering behind you you guys can slow down you're about 15 feet from the surface at this point you reach out and your hand passes through nothing you peek up past the edge the sky above you glows a sickly teal color as the darkened storm above is obscured by the crackle of the arcane barrier that encases the city glancing at the size of the barrier and the points of origin you can see that only the inner portion of thar amphala is here the inner wall and everything within the outer regions were left in the shadowfell when it was transported peppered shifting shapes of winged black clusters of creatures scan the sky above dozens and dozens of gloomstalkers seeking any sight of intruders across the enclosed atmosphere of this arcane dome in the distance you can see the terrible spire of entropis standing once more a web-like network of greenish energy fork like veins across the exterior to hold the structure firm a muffled boom is heard you glance up and see from the outside of this dome an explosion burst across the magical barrier harmless then dissipates squinting hard you can make out obscured shapes of wyvern riders swarming and circling the outside of the barrier well you traveled with wyvern riders you don't know how many there are but do note that you did travel with wyvern riders tossing occasional weapons that bounce off and shatter with sparks across this barrier nothing is coming through and they're trying to find a weak point somewhere of what is encasing this currently no help to you in your circumstance you see a massive skyship hovering far above that's unable to do anything and is staying far enough out of reach to not unfortunately fall you catch a flashing glance of a huge winged beast streak across the top of the barrier a glittering brass dragon an arcing blast of arcane energy fires from the barrier striking j'mon sa ord who briefly jolts from the impact but barely changes course to curve away and out of sight as your vision now begins to focus down to the city around you you can see the mostly intact buildings you recall from your last jaunt through thar amphala the interior of the city is less war-damaged from past history frays here you stand and here's where we're going to take a break we'll return here in a few minutes we have a video at the break to get you guys ready for the wyrmwood giveaway once again help out with the earthquake recovery in mexico if you can and we'll see you guys in a few minutes [break] you guys are maybe 150 feet or so from the edge so you're toward the side of the city the tower is in the very center so it's maybe half a mile from you it's not half a mile half a mile is ridiculous no it's maybe 400 feet from you if you were to look out at it from an overhead circle view from the center you're a little ways near the edge yeah you're about 150 feet from the edge at this point looking up you see about three or four that are maybe 70 or 80 feet above you but they're doing passes they're not being stationary and they're constantly circling through as you glance up and look and nudge away you can see their yellow eyes piercing from their black lightless form their wings as they expand and shift you can see that faint glance the beams of their vision scanning across the rooftops they're all very intent on seeing what's going through the city make a perception check 29 okay couple things one as you glance through the streets you can see now why the top chamber of thomara was so bereft of undead they've all been moved topside you see glancing through the bits of street that you have in visual range maybe 35 to 40 dwarven undead that are wandering through open spaces mixing with the various soldiers from battles long past when thar amphala still existed in the shadowfell you've encountered those undead already you also glance around past the gloomstalkers as you're keeping an eye as you're scanning through the crowds you see something different larger flying through the skies on the opposite end of the dome it appears winged with a tail but porous like a tattered sail or a ladder a skeletal beast of long neck and tail makes a baneful circle over the city with burning green-blue eyes it's kind of dragon-shaped it appears to be skeletal there is no flesh with what little bit of look you can see you can see the light behind the dome is-- not bleached-white bone but yellowish off-white bone with various shades of rot to it it's coasting around and you get one view of it as it begins to spin you get a faint distant glance at it you only see one but it is apparently also making its path over the city with the rest of the gloomstalkers it does have stretched bits of broken leftover flesh and leather that are tattered in places have you scryed before all right so as you glance into this crystalline sphere your vision begins to go dark at the edges tunnel vision begins to slowly swell and take your view your breath quickens it's a really uncomfortable and unfamiliar feeling but as your vision goes tunnel into the sphere the coloration and the diffraction of the little bit of light and vision you have in this tunnel go cloudy and blur the tunnel vision withdraws it gets darker and darker and you can see before you a hilt of some sort of black blade it's beautiful and hooked in places it's surrounded by muck it's surrounded by what you get a sense of but there's no open space around it it is in some thick molasses-like silt it's the same color there's no light in the vicinity you can sense it's there but you do sense that the earth around it is not super hard there is a dampness when i say silt-- it seems to be submerged somewhere (laughter) so you see it before you but because it's seemingly buried in this area of damp rock and silt you have no other idea of where it is as much as the scry spell can employ yes okay within a thousand feet of you okay in a brief instant you close your eyes recite the incantation snap your fingers as you do from behind your closed lids you immediately feel this draw this sense this direction it is not moving it is stationary it is-- no it's within a thousand miles let me see sense the direction so you know the direction of it at all times you don't know quite how far from you it is you sense it's lateral and down from where you are deeper toward the city but at a downward angle the direction you're going but down do consider once you do find it the sword cannot earthglide with you yeah probably the spell only lasts for up to ten minutes by the way so you've got to move quick you still have to whisper in the earring unfortunately it's already been used okay as you cast the spell you close your eyes and snap your fingers it can't find anything unfortunately you have to have seen the object for the spell to have an effect this was so much dnd right there all the dnd everyone who's ever played dnd is right now going yep i've been there all right so what's the plan all right so this lasts up to two hours concentration and you can move a 40-foot space to create a tunnel every ten minutes okay then keyleth vex you feel a very faint vibration in the ground what are you doing guys all right so you guys all emerge out into the open light-- make a perception check no just the ones who are looking okay the two of you glance off as you're emerging your exiting point looks to be a hole in the middle of a street that has been dug down from this point you can see there's a nearby building maybe 20 feet from you that is a two-story building that is partially collapsed but still mostly intact yeah there's a gloomstalker at any given point in time within a hundred feet of you they're all keeping a net of movement around you hear rocks beginning to emerge-- no because when you cast locate object that stopped okay mark that off so as you guys all emerge topside rushing this 20 feet distance i need you all to make stealth checks grog you make it with advantage you're still visible-- using what spell level sorry i misheard i thought you only had a 9th-level spell slot left pike was being carried his roll was dependent on both of them so as you guys dart through the open light the first time you've seen light since arriving in this titan the sky outside is super dark most of the light here is actually emanating from the barrier it's creating its own false twilight sense over this entire city as you rush into the room you all dart into the nearby doorway there's a half-ajar door that's broken and you push through being careful not to slam into it or to break it and cause any noise but you all rush into this chamber immediately the smell wafts of old decay and glancing around you can see long-dried bits of flesh or nondescript innards that have long withered and turned to partial dust you all come into the shadow of the chamber and take a minute to breathe you hear the distant sound (screeching flapping crunch) you hear one perch on one of the buildings about one block down (screeching flapping) and continue off it does not appear that you are currently being stalked or noticed if i recall correctly the entrance is only visible to people that you signify okay it is visible but only creatures you designate can enter that's the difference so it is a faint shimmer make an investigation check okay you go to help him most of the furniture in here is destroyed and withered you go upstairs and there is a double-door cabinet a cupboard i can't wait to take you to universal all right so you cast the mansion in the cupboard the shimmering purple hue the familiar vision of the door of scanlan's magnificent mansion arrives who's going and who's staying pike grog percy and scanlan staying the three of you going to transfer to a gate stone no you have to activate it and hold it on one side but it brings you to wherever the gate stone is okay you pocket it you sense you maybe have three more minutes on your spell by the way vex okay the rest of you head into the mansion quietly okay good to know so as you all vanish in the mansion you are outside of the need to utilize the radial portion of the ring the three of you with the spell quickly waning you begin to make your way outdoors i need another stealth check from you three what did you get so as you guys rush outward into the open way you begin to head across the thoroughfare following vex who's currently leading the charge and you can sense it down below at this point based on the trajectory of it make an intelligence check yeah roll plus your intelligence modifier 12 okay you're not sure of the distance based on the angle but you know it's getting closer so you guys begin darting from building to building keyleth is straggling a bit behind and ends up stubbing her toe and instinctually lets out a yelp sound at which point you hear a distant shriek okay thankfully because there is an old ancient cobblestone walkway here with loose stone but portions of it have been destroyed and broken and you can find loose earth easy enough and you can dart in you scrooge mcduck dive into the stone as you guys dart off to the side and you watch as two gloomstalkers land where she was (screeching) and begin to scan over and look through and they're walking forward on their large hefty muscular hind legs walking past where you guys are hiding off to the side they stop and then turn around and one of them scans past and you both barely duck out of the way they both take off one after the other and as such you don't have to make a stealth check you're down below and you follow their footsteps underneath you guys continue on your current stealth run you get forward about another 150 or so feet do you want to keep going or do you want to cast there's a handful most of the city has been long abandoned right okay so you duck into a small alleyway you guys are keeping out of view and waiting for the swarms of undead in the street and as you come around the corner you immediately see about 12 or 13 zombies clattering past as you're waiting for them to pass by eventually they get quieter and quieter you take a minute and you cast the spell locate object and it's a much steeper angle now you're getting much closer to it so do you want to keep going roll another stealth check both of you actually because we've gone partway through not that i have to worry about vax yeah because you still have pass without a trace from underneath okay the two of you making your way through ducking between streets and passages eventually you get to a point where you sense and almost-- you're fine you get about another 85 100 or so feet and it's nearly directly below you you're about halfway between the edge of the wall and where entropis the tower is okay so you swim down okay and you're feeling through earth make an investigation check with disadvantage because you are currently blind in the earth you can glide through it but you can't see through the earth give it a shot that's not how it works what did you roll five okay you swim around for about a minute or so and you're finding nothing so yeah you're swimming around in there you're not finding anything you don't know the distance just direction you failed your intelligence check so you're not quite able to consider the changing angle for distance make an intelligence check okay you don't know much about how etherealness works or what the effects are you don't know if it will help or hinder you're not entirely certain what the effects will do okay as the oil slathers around you your vision of the world becomes dark gray and colorless it's very similar to when frodo puts the ring on there's a flickering sense and the world itself seems to be immersed in shadow and not quite there you watch as all the skeletons that are swarming through the streets and your brother all become translucent and almost not there like these ghostly visions of them the ground's hard you ignore objects and effects that aren't on the ethereal plane actually no this is a point of order here ignores all objects and effects that aren't on the ethereal plane this is complicated so here's the thing here's technically what happens as the oil begins to be pressed along your body you begin to look around and notice as your vision goes gray and everything begins to fade everything begins to fade as in on the ethereal plane thar amphala this interpretation of this space is not at this location let's see here this is getting really wonky allowing you to move through objects you perceive-- no that's true it's not there on the ethereal plane it's only on this plane i'm sorry this got really confusing welcome to dnd thar amphala there is no version of it on the ethereal plane however which means that currently you can pass through the ground yes my apologies the ethereal plane overlaps this one it layers it in a similar way that the shadowfell does which-- as you dissipate in the ethereal plane-- so as you vanish into the space a little whisper curls into your ear vax'ildan ah there you are i've been looking all over for you and your friends welcome and that's it but they don't hear you because they're not in the same plane with the earrings no she doesn't no okay make another check let's see here you can move up or down you glide through the ground okay was that with disadvantage okay you're still floundering around you have vax dart off and vex has vanished okay so are you darting back okay are you going to stealth your movement speed at double movement would be 60 with the double dash you're moving 30 feet per round because when you're moving through the ethereal plane through solid objects and matter it does slow you to half speed you can't see her you can't sense her but you do sense the sword you sense the direction still because locate object is still in effect and you're drifting down down down about a hundred feet 150 feet and then as you head down to that point you suddenly emerge and you can see a small cavern maybe ten feet in diameter looks like there's a bit of rubble looks like there may have been a path that led to here that long crumbled and was either intentionally collapsed or naturally collapsed by the movement of the titan and as you come into this ten-foot little cavern space half of the floor is coated in this brackish green fluid and the other half is solid rock okay it then takes you at a slight angle down into the liquid and now you can see the tunnel continues downward there's a small basin that changes shape as you go down into this murky greenish fluid down where there's no light it is normally pitch black here but the etherealness allows you to take a little bit of the space in looking around you can see that there is a thick residue that is gathered along the edges and there at the bottom you can sense though you cannot see it because it is actually a few inches beneath the muck you assume the sword correct this is going to be an interesting question how long does it last on the oil i feel like it lasts for an hour let me double check let's see all right make another check yep yep 13 okay you begin to eventually find a tunnel that appears to be completely packed with collapsed loose rock and earth it's been long collapsed seems to be at an angle yeah takes you a little bit eventually your spell dissipates well no the spell lasts for up to ten minutes vax what have you been doing how far have you traveled from the building you're about 120 feet maybe as you're waiting there paralyzed the voice creeps in once again but where are all your friends why are you alone (chuckles) you eventually break through the edge and come into the same small cavern that she encountered and you can see the dark green fluid there nothing since she took the oil yeah okay so what do you do keyleth it looks like a cavern filled partially with fluid still on entropis vax you begin to hear loud wings flapping louder and louder outside and above a different sound than the wings of a gloomstalker so are you moving stealthily or are you bolting all right vax okay as you're stealthing moving along you can glance over or keep focusing forward all right you keep going you move move you can hear the wings you can hear this horrible raspy sounds like a whetstone being slid across steel slowed down with bass it's this (croaks) okay eventually you find your way back to the household seemingly not directly followed but you hear the wings are circling more localized to where this house is keyleth what are you doing yeah it's a little syrupy but it definitely splashes it looks brown green sludgy it doesn't look like the typical acid you've encountered but it looks like a liquid you take two points of acid damage it is a caustic liquid okay so you dive into the liquid okay you coast along the outside and you can sense that you're traveling on the outskirts of this descending tunnel where the acidic liquid is encased and eventually it rounds out make an investigation check no because you know what you're looking for okay you reach out and you grab forth and you feel a few things that you grab and as you sense them you poke your head through which in the process of doing you do suffer six points of acid damage and your hands find bones and glancing through a little bit into the space you can see the entire bottom of this basin is bones probably a good four to five feet of stacked bones this has been used as a means of disposing of unwanted things four points of acid damage and you're finding nothing but rummaging through yeah you can on the bottom of it or another side what do you want to do go for it make another investigation check you take ten points of acid damage make another check if you want to you suffer eight points of acid damage and you reach through and your hand finally hits something hard and cold within the silt it's stuck in the muck but there's something there that is not like the rest of the bone it feels metal make a strength check okay you take seven points of acid damage as you reach out and you grab and you can now glance through and see this is the hilt of a blade and it's stuck in the muck you yank it free you pull it out of the muck and it's free at this point you're surrounded by skeletal bones and you feel the fingers pulling at you and tearing and you look around you as a wall of these corpses these broken corpses all begin to grasp at you-- you can't pull this into the rock with you it's metal it doesn't come into the rock it doesn't earthglide with you so you have to glide up with your hand out make another strength check to see if you can break the grapple of the undead hands that are now grabbing and trying to hold you there at the bottom of the basin no 21 you do manage to break free you suffer another five points of acid damage and begin to earthglide your way up you get about halfway up and suffer another nine points of acid damage and you eventually emerge from the top as you suffer another seven points of acid damage and manage to earthglide you watch as all of a sudden the water separates and bursts and you watch as her earth elemental form emerges its hand coming up through the water clutching a blackened blade (laughing) cosmic bear it's been about 30 minutes as the cold sense of worry comes over you you clutch the necklace and there's a flash as you watch trinket's form burst from the necklace gray and shaded and you see as trinket pops out of nowhere by the way between the two of you you guys are pretty crammed into here to not be in the acid right now you're both like (grunts) (confused bear noises) he's sniffing around you can how long can you hold your form yeah so you're here for a while okay so you guys sit and wait carefully thinking contemplating over the next 30 minutes or so eventually you begin to watch as vex'ahlia's form begins to emerge once more into this plane trinket is licking your face intensely it's what you saw yeah (cheering) marisha and it might take you a little while but you can find your way back okay you concentrate for a minute as the stone's energy fills you you flash and all of a sudden you're standing over the other stone-- yeah you know where it is okay you grab the stones and go in the mansion as you make your way slowly in that direction you hear a little voice whisper in your ear it's not going to help you (laughter) eventually you slowly make your way to the building and as you emerge from the inside you can hear the loud flapping of wings nearby jumping from rooftop to rooftop all right you dart into the mansion you guys watch as keyleth's elemental form bursts into the mansion space with the rest of you there's a moment with a faint whining high-pitched sound and this sudden thrust there's a sudden thrust of vacuum as the mansion around you dissipates and you're all plopped onto the ground outside of the cupboard where across crawled upward partway into the building you see a skeletal dragon standing there its claws jammed into the inside its wings open and you see standing on the back of the dragon finger forward-- i know finger forward finishing the dispel magic she had cast delilah briarwood with behind her darkened armor arms around sylas grinning as she goes oh glad you could make it no wait as soon as you gather she's going to attempt to counterspell (chuckles) so plane shift is 7th-level right okay good to know so where are you plane shifting to feywild okay that's a natural eight as she attempts to counter the spell even at a higher level it fizzles unable to break through and all of you as you watch her hand extend and sylas about to dismount-- (whoosh) (yelling) you guys all plop down your feet hitting the somewhat wet grassy ground of the swamp where you-- you said the pools where you first emerged last time yeah where the nymph was you guys all land in these pools looking around you can see the darkened wood over you the sound of crickets and nearby insects fill the air and for the first time in a long time though your blood pumping would not tell you a stillness and a peace in the vicinity around you make a perception check all right glance about your vicinity you see nothing that has noticed your presence or seems to be of interest to you at the moment as you concentrate on the cold metal of the weapon a different but still familiar sense creeps in i get the sense this isn't the first time i also sense we have a similar goal the lich must die the lich yes (laughter) oh no so are you inspecting it or are you attuning to it yeah he's talking to his weapon you have all seen this before and it's as disconcerting now as it was last time his secrets his followers all of it must topple you will be my instrument just wield me spill blood for me bring me to the undying king and cut his throat with my blade that's all i ask that's all i need it's still currently embedded in its scabbard you hear the sword go it's been so long make a charisma saving throw 12 okay oh man we'll say for the purposes of this that the attunement is successful all right you suffer 38 points of psychic damage your vision goes cloudy you guys watch as his skin color goes from his general stone gray to a more pale white you watch as his physical body becomes more gaunt the jowls sink in slightly and his eyes turn a little red around the iris your vision goes a bit dark and the sword goes blood i need blood give me blood i'm so hungry you find yourself standing up with the blade out in front of you make two attacks against vax vax he's the closest one not at the moment no he's not familiar with your capabilities yet it's a longsword so roll 1d8 second strike you dodge both blows as grog goes and swings at you twice with the longsword who's closer to grog right now between the two of you two attacks on vex please what was it roll 1d8 add your strength modifier so you take ten points of slashing damage as the blade arcs across the front of your sister you see a spray of blood make a second attack roll another d8 nine damage as she reels back from the first strike the second one cuts across the shoulder and clavicle area down the arm as another spray of blood hits you pull back and watch as the blade is now currently drenched in vex's blood there you go as the second attack comes to a halt you guys are watching him carve into vex the blood on the edge of the blade seeps into it and your tunnel vision subsides and you take a breath you hear this audible (sigh) from the blade as you have control of yourself once more okay make an attack add your strength modifier so she (crack) hits you in the jaw it goes (quiet punch) it all came full circle it's the episode title there the sword is a dick there's a long pause before it thinks i've not taken a name but the one that's been given but in honor of my last master just call me kas i make no promises take me to the lich are you taking the scabbard to the undying king's innards very well you take 1d4 points of damage it seeps into the dark almost pitch-black metal you hear the inhale of the blade as it takes in the blood and seems to devour it just a note this conversation is strange since you're staring at grog and his eyes are burning a little red the visual change is still that way he's still muscular all the skin is pulled taut against the bone so what's the plan that's true you didn't sure i'll allow it i'm so excited this is vox machina by the way (laughter and applause) it's not too bad as you suddenly hear a voice behind you vex and you turn to look and artagan is right there behind you i'll keep it a secret best i can best i can he stands there before you his yellowish-green attire with the high collar and his wild orangish hair framing his face like a lion's mane his pale elfin fey complexion smiles as he puts the hands together well show me a good time (nervous laughter) he doesn't flinch well that is considered good manners definitely how have you been what's going on (yelling and laughter) define the request please weird time is fun when you go back (chuckles) are you telling me that you would stumble into this space unannounced summon me here under the pretense of a good time and then request me to bend the very essence of time passage between my plane and yours now we're talking i could help more or less well you all dress very differently than the last time we met you're doing well for yourselves then that's quaint that's fun tell you what i'll help you under two conditions one should you go back and defeat this wannabe god thing you speak of and all is well and you're heroes and you have all of this influence and money and everything's grand we can discuss maybe creating a doorway for me that allows passage i'll come visit and see what strangeness your world seems to have whenever i'd like oh i'm sure i can figure out a way but i'm sure if you succeed that won't be a problem and if you fail well then i guess the deal's off anyway second i wish to strangle you until death (laughter) i wish to put my hands on your throat until you expire if you say you're unkillable well that's a new experience entirely i'm afraid it doesn't work that way but i could give the mere passage of an hour day for an hour i think it's a fair trade yes sure day for an hour 24 hours are yours to do as you like he actually laughs at this and goes i think the process will be enjoyable enough it's a pulse stone a pulse stone laura and it's meant to distract undead it just does that's up to you i'm just altering the time flow do you not have a means of returning you found your way here i'm concentrating on the passage of time that's a large enough endeavor in itself take your preference i'm just happy to have friends if you must and he winks and for a second you see his form shimmer and you see the small satyr image for a moment before it restores to his grand visage a long time ago make an intelligence check just the intelligence modifier well it was restored via spell as part of the actual effect yeah you have no idea who he is things rearrange every eon or so and the ley lines that guide the paths shift and i haven't been able to get back since i don't know i haven't tried it sure make a deception check sorry an insight check lying about which one you have no idea he's slippery he's mercurial fair enough i think it would spoil the moment anyway i don't know where this came from yeah slow a hint i wouldn't dream of trying little one don't worry welcome to my world okay pike have you left as well you believe this you really believe you're going to come back if you die fair play to the immortals and he takes your throat and begins to squeeze his eyes locked in and he keeps watching you laura and he locks in yeah without making any other noise continues to apply pressure eventually your vision begins to go dark this is so weird i know it was a fascination with something different and new and you said cannot die and that immediately piqued his interest even the nicest of fey are weird and have their dark sides yeah you watch over the next minute or so as he strangles the life out of vax this is so fucked up i know limp in his grasp garmelie eventually pulls one hand back still holds him now his feet are dangling and goes like satisfying but not what i thought it would be at which point you watch as the body and flesh of vax begins to burn to ashes out of the armor and the armor falls to the ground in pieces of course it's yours as you guys are swimming the water breaks and you see the still dry hair as it emerges from the pool of garmelie though he is now undressed in the water as well ah so that's one deal done where do you wish to rest while i'm here yes of course please and he points over and you look back to where you were on the edge of the pool and you can see there's a bunch of stumps that weren't there before that seem to have elongated into chairs and couches and bits of furniture thank you one day we can play oh do about yourselves you seem disturbed by my presence yes i am familiar with the werewolves that now roam these lands yes no not at the moment i have an idea where they might be i know when they're not near me sounds interesting i don't know i mean that'd be great but i can't once you have the door i'd be happy to join you depends how long you can build a doorway i suppose most likely no offense to any of you if you're carpenters well take your time rest food is prepared you can go amongst yourselves i'll be here splashing away and he splashes into the water plenty of food on these small stools here and there okay is there anything you guys wish to accomplish in this time or do you want to take time to wait to see if your friend returns (questioning bear noise) yes what's a wyvern (spits) (laughter) you've got time to think we'll say for the purposes of the time you have been waiting hours pass you're not sure how much time has passed you've plotted you've thought you've napped you've contemplated this weird bubble of time that now exists this brief respite but where it leads you is unique and strange as you all begin to question and wonder is he going to come back does he come back here last time you saw him he arrived with you in the feywild but you carried the ashes with you then as soon as these doubts begin to emerge you turn at the sound of a footfall and around the corner hand on the side of a tree you see for the second time in this grove a nude vax'ildan and that's where we'll end tonight's game because it is past 11 man a lot of weird shit happened that game i'm sorry it made sense for him in the moment it was a weird dark shade of the fey you don't see but that's the fun of it how much can you trust any fey man i'm sorry the etherealness went bottoms-up it was probably an eventuality (laughs) i'll see what i can do taliesin and but anyway thank you guys we're going to get some rest thank you guys for going with us through this very interesting episode yeah we'll return next week and i think we'll have a special guest next week yeah
