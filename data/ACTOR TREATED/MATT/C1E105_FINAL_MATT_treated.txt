is a terrible idea anyway without further ado i think that concludes our announcements and as such let us dive into tonight's episode of critical role [dramatic music] you're looking at the series of the sun tree cousins one of which you've met scattered amongst this glade surrounding the central citadel you have the guards behind you the large planetar and deva entities that stand there armored in their golden plate after ushering you out are standing guard standing a full ten feet taller than you practically the wings slightly bent the large planar entity kneels down hello make a perception check hard to tell you didn't pay a lot of attention i imagine the same way you came in across elysium there are two deities that call it home the dawnfather and the everlight he looks very closely and you get sense that part of its nature is scanning through you it's getting a sense and a read of you as an individual and it says no one you need to worry about stands up and then takes two steps back (heavy footfalls) into place and looks straight ahead still looks out doesn't respond to remind you of what happened last time there was talking about possibly or at least there was the trammel the prime trammels that were used previously to seal the chained oblivion tharizdun and that the orchestrator the designer of those was ioun the knowing goddess ioun however has sealed herself away being a wounded god long recovering and the only information that pelor has of where she hid herself the key essentially is not an object but a person you're seeking an individual of which you were given a solar light map of a single small home in a forest ravine not far from a place that you've noticed was near the pools of wittebak which is in the cliffkeep mountains well the divine gate is a known existing entity it's essentially a large gate that prevents the gods from returning to the prime material plane cliffkeep mountains go across a lot of the northern side of tal'dorei from what you're familiar with like we're talking kraghammer to gatshadow to the jorenn village there's a lot of things it's like a big horizontal mountain range that caps the top part of the continent fort daxio or kraghammer probably terrah or the pools of wittebak those are the two that are closest terrah's not your home the home away from home yes oh where you did yes it seemed to be hundreds of miles northwest of vasselheim you didn't sense any movement but you knew the general direction and distance correct yes laura that's okay i remember what it does and if you decide to use it-- i won't tell you you tell me you want to use it all right so what would you like to do to terrah all righty no you didn't sense any effects from that fruit at the moment no you didn't nothing really caught you up to speed in that there are no fruit-bearing trees directly near you the sun trees are around you further in they do yes all righty bringing up my notes on terrah since that's where you're going you weren't given any indication as to how many you needed all right so as you complete your spell keyleth you step through the base of the nearest tree possibly the same one you spoke with earlier if you want to be a dick about it all right you aggressively stampede through the center of this one tree and emerge on the other side from one of the surrounding trees on the terrah village there are a number of these pseudo-petrified or dried-out large-trunk trees that seem to have slowly died off from the heavy tectonic shifts and small quakes that happen in this area that have made a lot of the land unable to support large forms of plant life or at least the trees that used to exist here so you step out and emerge from the exterior of the village as it domes down into this small crater that you recall seeing before where most of the village inhabits the central portion and the village is there before you the shard things there wasn't really a name for them more than they're small pieces of essence of the deity no in a sense that it's a small source of power of some kind but what you saw there was maybe about that large on the platform what she has is bead size comparable to each so you stand outside of terrah what are you doing based on when you left it would still be probably-- well you were over in vasselheim which means it's getting dark actually i'd say with the way the sun has passed through the sky now you've just gotten past dusk there's still light in the sky but it's going from oranges to purples to dark blues on the horizon and you can see hints of firelight torchlight and candlelight from within the actual city below you can sense him he is from your current location thousands of miles from you yeah very heavy west-northwest direction from you currently all right so as you walk down into the village a number of the guardians step out quickly seeing an approaching party however recognizing keyleth and her station immediately turn into an escort that leads you to the center portion of the village quickly enough they go and retrieve pa'tice you see the elderly form of the leader you've met before step out the graying hair the weathered dark skin tones the long greens and brown leathers that drape off showing hints of the knees and lower feet the large walking staff that he carries at his side as he approaches and the headdress that seems to be a combination of thick twines and shale shards that have been woven in steps forward keyleth an unexpected visit most definitely kaitiaki we have food yes you are guests of terrah please we will provide whatever you require come provide them a meal and he puts his hand out and they run off quickly and quick as that you guys make your way down it's a modest meal but it's a meal nonetheless mostly hunted creatures of the local mountainside some dried beets and root (laughs) pa'tice who's sat down with you says quickly we have been made aware via the other ashari that there is some danger possibly coming we are awaiting word of what to do other than keep ourselves in a defensive position we have to guard the rift of course but should there be a call to action we'll do what we can i'm unfamiliar with this vecna but whatever you plan please be careful we are quite good at assembling makeshift and temporary lodging the rock is our friend if you will of course of course not a worry have you asked pyrah for aid as well well good they're closer but we're happy to help if we can we're happy to help where are you off to what brings you towards the pools of wittebak it is a series of poisoned wells and hulking stupid giants yes it was once they're geothermic large puddles across the mountainside various minerals being lifted up from the deep waters beneath the mountain heated bubbling boiling steaming but the giants moved in hundreds of years ago stomped around and ended up filling the entire subterranean gnomish city of wittebak with fumes and poison killed most of them and the rest fled to kraghammer best to avoid we have our own business to deal with and it's 100 miles from here it's not much of an issue well some are toxic some are not but since the giants moved in and ruptured some of the natural formations some of them have grown toxic or acidic yes if they are they're foolish the dumbest hill giants easy to outsmart difficult to outrun they'll eat anything even small little gnomes i know of the name we're not the most devoted people i can't imagine i'd have any information you wouldn't my apologies yes enjoy your meal and he gets up and walks away you do recall the map that was shown to you by the dawnfather pelor it was adjacent to the pools not actually in the pools of wittebak it was within a forest and was a home lodging is provided for you they have a number of various guest tents and small buildings that provide you with space not the highest of quality of places you've slept in probably and if you wanted to provide your mansion instead you're welcome to but ample food quiet sleep it's a comfortable evening's rest you all find yourselves through the evening as you sleep and having this being the first time many of you have slept in terrah it takes you a while there is just a general low hum or vibration to the ground that you sleep on you get the sense it's probably proximity to the rift but there is this slow perpetual (rumbling) it's like a weird low rumble like a heavy bass sound that never seems to dissipate that you hadn't noticed until you were trying to quietly sleep but it's not off-putting and within ten or 15 minutes it actually almost helps to lull you to rest you all come to in the morning gather your supplies and are preparing for the next leg of your journey what do you wish to do you may all right any other attunements anyone wishes to-- all right to acid boom you may they're lodging made from large pieces of shale and rock jammed into a somewhat triangular pattern to form an earth yurt if you will (laughs) keyleth darts off in the distance and the two of you are left within the tent okay (laughs) his skin is colder than a warm body yes (very slow heartbeat) yeah he bleeds and it's a pretty open wound you watch as the wound slowly seals itself up got your shoes back keyleth returns with some coffee the rest of you come to consciousness and the morning sun is now blaring down over the cliffkeep it's a strangely clear sky for the north while a lot of it is relatively cold usually you're used to seeing the snow- capped mountaintops-- oh you found it there you go so bringing it back in guys yes at some point so what do you guys want to do so you're traversing via your wind walk pike taps you on the shoulder and is like i'll teach you that later curse you blindspot that's up to you guys so preparations being done you gather your materials keyleth completes the wind walk spell and you all feel yourselves grow slightly lighter on your toes you concentrate over the minute transformation you turn into your mist forms and take off in what direction okay well you have terrah locked down the pools of wittebak would not be on your specific map that you acquired earlier you can ask around within terrah within a brief time and figure it out somewhere between 100 and 120 miles and he points in a specific direction you mark the sun's traveling and where certain landmarks are it's an eastward direction from where you are that's weird i'm putting points in my nature skill or survival i guess anyway too many editions in my head (laughs) as you all take off into the morning sky you begin to rocket over and you're hitting jets of wind that are beginning to find their way over the mountain ranges and you get blown a little off-course but you maintain concentration as best you can in that direction who is leading this venture you knew of it yeah right okay cool i need you to go ahead and make a survival check actually for this i'm gonna say-- yeah because it would be tracking in the wilderness so survival it's mountains technically then yeah roll again okay that'll do it your speed is tremendous when in this form so what would have been an extended trek on foot over a series of days it takes you mere hours to eventually get to a point where you crest one heavy peak on the opposite side you can see down the cliffside the edge reaches a slight precipice and there you can see what looks to be for a mile or so a cluster of dozens and dozens of pools of water of different sizes all jammed together in a geothermic cluster where you can see bright greens that move to a deep orange-maroon at the edges from the various mineral deposits that have collected over hundreds and hundreds of years you can see large columns of smoke and steam of different chemical colors rising out of various large pools and at a glance down you can see a number of shapes a number of hulking humanoid shapes somewhere in the neighborhood of 40 to 50 or so scattered at different pools moving in small clusters or gangs some of them are jumping in cannonballing and swimming through the actual pools some of them are lounging around and lying some of them appear to be returning dragging things from the nearby forest on the eastern side of the bank essentially for a few hundred years you get the sense that the pools of wittebak have been a hill giant water park you can see these large mounds of mud and scrap wood and things that have been built into these large hill giant domiciles onto the side of the mountain not far from the pools it's become a definite hill giant wandering zone so do you guys continue over the pools down towards the nearby forest ridge all righty you come to the forest ridge and you can see it's not thick forest the ravine comes down off the precipice where the pools are you get a few hundred-- i'd say actually more than that a thousand or more feet away from that precipice before plants even begin to grow it looks like whatever toxic chemicals have burbled up in some of these pools have made a lot of the ground there unable to give any forest life or sustain any large trees as soon as the forest begins it's a dense little pocket maybe a mile and a half two miles across that's what you've got what do you guys want to do if you guys begin to do a loop-over who's doing a quick pass over the patch of forest all right make a perception check okay glancing over you don't see any major glades or clearings there doesn't appear to be any sign of bastions of civilization or any sort of logging going on there's no areas where trees have been cut or cleared it's a featureless forest top from what you can see you can go down into the forest if you'd like all right who's going into the forest then so with pike following suit you guys all swoop down through the boughs of the trees and into the center of the forest itself within there it's not a super thick canopy it's not as heavy as the feywild or some of the recent forests that cluster around vasselheim there are breaks in the canopy where you can see the sunbeams come through from the morning sun that's rising up higher and higher in the sky as you've traveled the mist has burned away in this area so it's a nice warm forest glancing about there is a lot of life in here you can see signs of squirrels you rush by what was a family of wolverine-like creatures that are rustling by as soon as the wind scoots in and your mist forms come rocketing past they all scatter and run off into the shadows there's a lot of forest ground here to cover for you to really super track with advantage you'd have to go into human form i'd give you a regular roll if you want to try and track in your mist form i'd say make an investigation check 27 begin coasting through tree after tree through small tiny bits of clearing that immediately come into large clusters of trunks and knotted branches that all merge and cluster at different intersections after about 20 or so minutes of this trying to do a large spiral around the forest inward out of the corner of your eye vex'ahlia you glance over and see a quick glimpse of something that appears to be more structured you look back and rush over and there you see amongst the trees what appears to be a humble-looking two-story home you see a small balcony built on the second floor that goes over one of the larger rooms in the bottom floor it's not huge by any means and is hidden by a lot of the local brush and trees there can't get a lot more detail at this distance though you take your form okay so all of you land and follow vex you all take a minute to go back to your physical forms you glance over and there it is standing before you it's very shaded in this part of the forest you can see a little bit of what looks to be interior light very faint make a perception check it would be a little small for you grog but you could walk in it proportionally it looks maybe like it was built for a little bit of a smaller person that is investigation 18 okay so you guys begin to slowly-- okay so what's the marching order from this current glance no you guys are behind a tree at a distance currently no but you're keeping an eye out who's leading the charge we have scanlan and vex'ahlia is trinket within your necklace for this okay trinket is out alongside you grog as you get across this small walkway towards the front as you're walking with a big smile vex'ahlia something catches your eye on the ground right before her and you watch as she steps forward you reach out and grab her wrist and hold her back before she steps down there is a large rusted iron bear trap that is open that you almost stepped right into trinket walks up to it (growling) (bear spitting) it's not very-- it's more of a power drool if you will you can walk around that one and you begin to see what looks to be seven other ones that are clustered around you begin to walk around yeah you would actually as you step around one you can see at the front door there is a welcome mat that says welcome as you're approaching it you can see the welcome mat there's just something a little off about it like it's raised higher than the ground should be are you stopping her from doing that yes you walk over you look and you watch there's a small cord that is hidden amongst the brush that runs from underneath the mat through a small ring that goes up from the house then up a branch or vine so it's hidden amongst them you look straight up about 40 feet you see a nice solid thick trunk that is just (creaking) right above the door so knowing this you walk over and grab the cord looking to see where the leverage is you motion to grog to come over and hold it you find another piece of heavy stone that is by the wall to the side with grog's help you snip it bring it over and tie it onto the edge of this piece of the stonework like a small pole that was placed at the base of the house it holds the weight of this suspended trunk and it no longer triggers based on the step make an investigation check 18 it does not appear to be trapped per se it does appear to be locked which as a note the door at full height is about at the shoulders of most of you you recognize this this is definitely a homestead built on the scale for probably halfling or gnome it's still pretty big for a gnomish home meaning it's a little more spacious headroom you'd probably be able to stand in comfortably except for you grog you're probably a little hunched okay there is an awkward pause darin if you want to go ahead onto the stage please (cheering) you weren't supposed to tell them so you hear amongst your business for the day out of nowhere (knocking) on the door okay you hear (clicking) what sounds like six or seven different locks unlock on the door as it slowly swings open and before them what do they see you watch as two tiny red claws come around the corner as these tiny impish wings unfurl you watch as a tiny imp releases from the edge of the doorframe (wings beating) get out (door slamming) and slams the door you hear muffling argument through the door as the voice goes i'll stay where i damn please you gave me permission to stay if anyone is going to leave you're going to leave sounds like a lot more fun than having to deal with you on a daily basis you son of a-- the door creaks open once more sorry (door closing) make a performance check it's been a long time since you've heard music let alone one that scratches an old memory of childhood it's nice you see the imp in the back going ugh stop that racket i can but it'll cause your ears to bleed it sounds like this (screeching) you're such a liar the imp (poof) vanishes before you sure you watch as this large gray-skinned mountain of a man crawls his way in you could duck-walk through if you really wanted to this is worse than gandalf in bag end all fours is probably the most comfortable means of transport through the house but you walk in and immediately you watch as your new gnomish friend is going around and quickly disabling small things putting small keys and tying off strings and wires you saw that were set up around portions of the room this place is a hoarder's den you see shelves and shelves of books and papers and scrolls and stacks of them you see on bits of furniture and chairs more stacks of books and sacks and satchels and quills and inkwells some spilled and left and dried long ago this place is very lived-in very chaotic and very unique make an investigation check okay you do see there's one portion of the floor that he keeps avoiding instinctually that catches your attention you're like why does he keep walking around that the imp just appears across the room and just goes good one that was-- i am so sorry pike goes why could i just touch your hand for a second is that okay just to see if we can help your day probably not pike goes please she grabs your hand and concentrates for a second you watch as the holy symbol flares for a moment and the warmth passes through her arms into your hand and it feels nice it's like holding a freshly heated cup of tea and as the spell completes and she pulls back that's all thank you right okay okay ugh just one moment what what code would you wish goliath grab good luck o huh i'll tell you what i've got your back make an arcana check roll a d20 and add your arcana skill modifier to it 15 you don't recognize what he's holding in his hands but you immediately see the leather casing around it and your essence being able to read certain elements of magic-- it does appear to be a powerful enchantment whatever he has procured from the bag it was all me unfortunately no no why because he asked me oh it's not our home my master died trying to get in here on one of the traps and now i call this my home so you're showing him the residuum piece all right so this is a sliver of what looks like green glass it's finely polished about that thick that long you've read about this you've read that condensed residuum is very susceptible to enchantment and/or the focusing of short-term magic spells it's expensive it's lauded it's hard to find you watch as it darts out of your hand and wisps up maybe two feet ahead of him and slowly rotates above him as he inspects it (demonic cackling) only if it bothers you ioun's champion she's a heinous bitch who got what's coming to her 800 years ago (flapping wings) what right all right you guys can hear all of this we'll stick with the device i've got your back you will (cackling) go get her tiger no up into the corner (hissing) turns invisible you hear the tiniest little demonic fart by your ear you go over and start walking towards the edge of the nearest bookcase and all of you at once-- everyone but sprigg actually-- suddenly hear a voice come through filling your mind filling your consciousness filling your ears sourceless delivered to your consciousness directly thank you for showing me where he is and that's where we're going to take a break all right we'll be in just a minute we'll be back here in a few minutes guys for the twitch giveaway we have this awesome peruvian walnut dice tray leather interior it's very nice it's the same type that i have actually back here which is nice giving it away for somebody in the twitch chat so run on over and the code for the evening is sprigg s-p-r-i g-g double g so pay attention in the chat when it's time to go ahead and enter sprigg into the chat and one lucky winner will be announced when we get back here see you guys in a few minutes [break] last we left off you all almost all of you heard a singular familiar voice the low gravelly undead voice of the whispered one fills your minds saying thank you for showing me where he is in that moment where you all pause in place you hear a series of simultaneous sounds (arrows firing) as a number of heavy crossbow bolts from nearby windows all fire simultaneously at sprigg no you do not this is a surprise round so that first one is a 24 what's your armor class okay so you take 23 points of piercing damage that's 17 that misses you it strikes your shoulder and glances off one bolt sinks into your chest and you look down and you see it's this big long heavy metal bolt and it's jutting out from the side of where your shoulder and pec is another one rushes by and glances off your other shoulder the third one-- that hits that's a 25 that's 23 points of piercing damage that one actually misses a six and a one it slams into one of the nearby books right behind you barely moving past your cheek fifth one that is a 19 exactly so you take 24 points of damage they're all sneak attack and that is 20 another one that one's going to be 26 points of piercing damage you guys watch as all these bolts (arrows firing and impacting) into sprigg's body and sprigg falls back unconscious on the side of the room i'm going to bring out a map now moving the top floor off sprigg is currently unconscious on the ground there percival was there talking trinket is off to the side the imp is not currently visible pike would be over on the side here keyleth vax where would you guys see yourselves right now actually tell me where you would be i think that's what i'm trying to ask as i chuck you onto the ground yeah comes back in a day later all right cool so you're there holding that scanlan where would you be all right so i'll put you right there next to the scroll in the ground yes actually i can do that none of you know this except for you which is actually why i'm not going to show you you know how to avoid it but nobody else knows where it is the front door is right there you watch as one that was up in the stairs vanishes up top he fired and then ducked up there i need everyone to roll initiative yes including you even though you're on the ground 25 to 20 oh wow so we have percy we have grog and vax okay 20 to 15 yes actually okay yeah okay all righty anybody else all right so top of the combat round the surprise round is done you watch sprigg fall to the ground bolts sticking out of the side of the neck the shoulder and the body unconscious now beginning to pool blood underneath where he's bleeding out and you glance around and you see a series of shaded figures in the windows that all dart out of the way percy you're up first which for the purposes of this i will place the upstairs over here so as you dart up percival you run up the stairway there where the one guy you saw was standing yeah he ducked out of the way and there's also one figure that you recognize from the shadowfell earlier you see one of the ghastly creatures that was darting through the ruins leaping from from rooftop to rooftop its skin is grayish and long its limbs lanky its fingers curled into claws and this long tongue dangling from his jaws it's getting ready to run down the stairs as you charge him and it goes (growls) okay then all righty so what's the saving throw on that one okay so you have to roll first to see if you hit it 18 yeah that definitely hits it hits and you watch as you pull the sphere out and chuck it in the direction of the creature pulls its claws back slams into its chest and then unravels it falls to the ground prone unable to move right there in the middle of the floor was that your action there doing that you spent your action-- not really you load up diplomacy good that's your turn percy grog you're up yes you may he fell right there on the ground currently bleeding out you rage-run just past percival and you see there's one creature bound on the ground and there's another guy who's there with his crossbow he's trying to reload who sees percival and is getting ready to pull it up as you leap in front go for it roll for a double attack 32 hits second attack hits go ahead and roll damage for both 25 damage on the first hit nice with your hammer two hands whack right across the side of its head you see the jaw unhinge from the side as he pulls back it's hanging loosely there and the second hit you clock right in the side of the temple and it nearly goes unconscious and picks itself up again gets its crossbow ready it's still holding it's not down yet but it's hurt badly you can see now up close you can see these figures they're dressed in very very tight black leathers cloaks enshrouding their body the hood is still up but you've knocked it back there you see a human male in his late 40s early 50s the head shaved completely bald a tattoo of black tendrils around the left eye and the left eye is missing from the socket that's your turn all right grog's done vax you're up there's also a window here a window here and a window here just so you guys know and a window here if you wanted you're on the balcony now looking right about here make a perception check 19 plus 14 yeah you do see them and you glance down you can see they're hiding amongst bushes and they're specifically stealthed but you're keen of eye enough to see where they're placed 27 okay you're not sure if they see you or not right now you are currently up here so you glance off and you can barely see one that's over the edge of the roof right there that's the only one you can see so you barely see the edge of one there sharpshooter i'd say yeah you can you can hit both if you want 28 he does not see you so you have advantage on that if you want to roll again pike did 11 typical pike 60 points of damage as you chuck the dagger like right towards where the center of the shoulderblades connect in the back he (groans) and you watch as the crossbow that he had drops to the ground and he crumples over on top of it but he slowly starts getting to his feet out of the bushes he looks really hurt but he's still standing and you appear right next to him there you have attack-attack as a paladin 30 hits that is a seven no four plus three so the second dagger you shiv him in the side and he (groans) goes to spin with the heavy crossbow and try and pull away and as soon as the poison through him he goes (gurgles) and you can see blood vomit down the front of his chest his eyes roll back and he twinges and falls to the ground yeah and he's hidden but he's like (scared heavy breathing) okay he's trying to see that you're not being seen okay all righty you hit him and you stand there you're right in front of him now all righty that ends your go as you appear over on the other side you realize that over in the clearing there there is another one of the robed figures this one clutching a long black smooth staff that crooks over in the front that looks like a hand holding an eye you guys don't know that yet just him ending your turn vax that guy on the ground is going to try and break free that is a 17 dc 20 it struggles on the ground and can't seem to break free of the current magic manacles that hold it in place another one of these darts through the window leaps across the way right in front of sprigg and you being right there scanlan goes (angry hissing) and lashes out at you makes two claw strikes at you first one is 16 to hit all right you suffer eight points of slashing damage and i need you make a constitution saving throw 16 okay no it is not magical but you feel this pulse of some sort of necrotic disease hit your system and you just manage to shrug it off (relieved cheering) that is 30 points of slashing damage on the second hit make another saving throw please 17 the second strike hits you and you feel as the side of your torso gets torn out of the side the blood splatters onto sprigg who's already bloodied and now there's gnome blood on gnome blood as you reach for your side however it does not take effect you manage to shrug off yeah that ends the shadow ghast's turn sprigg i need you to make a death saving throw please roll a d20 liam and okay so you're okay for now you're stabilizing you're not bleeding out yet mark a success on your death saving throws there scanlan what are you doing actually before he even does that what are you doing on your turn that roll wouldn't matter because he may heal you before you come up don't worry about it so how much does he heal you heal 13 hit points that roll doesn't matter you hear this echoing song in the back of your head the second song today you've heard from your childhood you come to consciousness you wake up and look around you and you can see him singing to you as this giant horrible necrotic creature is looming right in front of you you have metal bolts sticking out of your chest and an old sensation you haven't felt in a long time courses through your body which is the need to survive it's both of your turns at the same time what are you going to do so what are you doing there's bookcases here bookcase there there's books strewn and clustered in these corners okay currently there's a bunch of books up here on a shelf you can pull them down on him if you'd like so from the ground you yank a bunch of heavy tomes off of this large shelf that goes flying towards this creature i'm going to make this a dexterity saving throw for it what's the dc on the telekinesis ring i'll pull it up here real fast looking up magical items really fast i have it here oh it's for the spell telekinesis that's right what's your spell dc 17 no that's a failure so for this go ahead and roll 3d6 the guy failed he didn't dodge out of the way he's like (confused snarling book impacts) and gets pummeled from behind by a bunch of tomes books and random glass baubles that were on the shelf that shatter against the back of its head then add your intelligence modifier 17 nice 17 points of damage to that one as you slam it in the back of the head (impacts) and it doubles over and (snarling) its long tongue slashing around you're still on the ground and it's over you is there anything else you want to do on your turn you hear nothing that is an action to do that so if you have a bonus action spell you could do that i believe that's an action to cast unfortunately you can do that next round the attack was your one action you can stand on your feet if you'd like to got it that ends your turn now these guys go again this guy's going to move in this guy is still standing and is going to drop the crossbow and pull out his shortsword is going to go ahead and attack you grog first that is 13 and a 27 you take five plus four that's nine points of slashing damage reduced to five yeah round down so it's four struck twice missed both both of these guys are going to fire at-- one of them's going to fire at sprigg on this end because it's their goal here with disadvantage that is a 16 what's your ac again 19 yeah it darts over you it misses it hits the side of the wall the other guy's going to strike again with disadvantage that's a 14 and you see the other guy pulling back with a crossbow and fire you roll out of the way and it (arrow vibrating) into the wooden flooring right next to you no that one is going to attack you vax because you're right there in front of it that's going to be a 13 does not hit second strike another 13 both of its shortsword attacks you duck out of the way and dodge moving around very quickly all righty those two right there one of them is going to because it saw that you got up scanlan they're going to fire two bolts directly at you that is a 16 to hit okay and the second one is a 24 you are currently in base-to-base with one of their companions so they both get sneak attack on you 19 points of piercing damage from the first hit 24 points of piercing damage from the second hit and then they both duck around the side here they both we'll say they vanish from sight you're not quite sure where they are right now those two also duck out of sight not quite sure where they are either that ends their go now the guy in the back right there who noticed vax show up is going to after you slaughter one of the guys and stab the other one is going to angrily go ahead and use blight on you can you go ahead an make a constitution saving throw please all righty that does half the damage 21 points of necrotic damage to you and is going to-- four five six all righty that ends his turn vex you're up over this way or this way you know what yes because he was not stealthing you watch as he darts by and you would have a shot yeah all righty look at that no but trinket can attack whatever's in your area too 31 that hits no (counting) 50 to get up to the top there so at your double speed you'd be at 60 threw the dagger and threw the dagger you're fine it still works out you're on deck keyleth just so you know the first arrow hits him in the stomach doubles forward and pulls back now glancing over saw you rush up and couldn't get out in time and now is going to try and back up as you're taking the second shot rolls a natural 17 literally strength save minus one strength modifier (cheering) you do yeah you can do that you have advantage on the attack remember because he's restrained yeah that hits 24 nice the second arrow hits right in the throat and you can see it doesn't hit anything vital but you can see blood's starting to pour out it's one of those things that if he were to pull it out it would probably be very bad but he's leaving it in right now he's looking pretty rough yeah all righty that ends your turn keyleth your turn okay step away from the window against the wall there you push the table back a bit book almost falls off the top what's trinket doing up to scanlan or the guy who's there okay that's true that ends your turn trinket goes (roars) right in front of the creature keyleth what are you doing okay so around the building where so you have right here all right okay because you didn't see vax outside you saw vax run upstairs how many squares is it ten right these two here get caught in it as well as vax and that guy there if she's doing a perimeter no she doesn't see the magician doesn't know where it is the magician the prestige which means it's either half or nothing her dc which is 21 right dexterity saving throw yeah you take no damage you duck out of the fire storm just in time for it to (raging fire) oh bravo to dwarven forge man true good torches you have in there 39 damage this guy incinerates he screams and burns he manages to dodge partway out but even the partial damage burns him and he (screams) you see him run off into the forest ten or so steps on fire like a stun man shot in a movie before he (impact) on the ground and smolders there in the distance those guys take it what was the amount again they're both on fire your free action combat wild shape makes it a bonus action as opposed to an action that's the difference does that end your turn all right so as keyleth's turn ends it comes to pike's the entire exterior perimeter of this part of the house is on fire flames are now starting to catch it is dry wood the entire building is made from wood of the forest so your home is now in flames in order to do the perimeter it's not a blazing inferno but it's starting to catch flames are starting to lick up the sides fire storm's a dangerous spell it's vox machina's mo man pike is going to rush forward and is also going to attempt to healing word you at level two it's a heal fountain on you that is six plus five that's 11 hit points you heal where do you dimension door over here you guys approached this direction so you're there make a perception check scanlan okay you don't see the two hidden fellows over here you see something large and hulking moving through the forest this direction at a quick glance no you guys have pulled out of that house you're still on the ground and all of a sudden your body physically shifts and you're looking up at the trees you glance around and you can see the back of your house you can hear the frantic fray going on you see the necromancer who's currently covered in brambles and held in place you see a couple of guys on fire on the side screaming on the side of the house and your house starting to catch fire that's okay pike on her turn is going to-- because it's a single target she's going to cast a level five guiding bolt because that's what pike does so ranged spell attack against that guy 11 plus-- yeah that hits that's a 21 so that is 8d6 radiant damage nice 19 no this guy right there in the room so after she heals sprigg and sprigg vanishes she grabs her holy symbol and goes chill out and shoots this giant flashing beam of divine energy that slams into it you watch as a lot of its flesh burns away from the impact it's still standing but it's a shining beacon the next attack against it has advantage and then pike's going to back up with you vex towards the back where the bookcase is and goes you smell something you now hear simultaneously (slow thudding) and watch as the side wall and the back wall explode inward as splinters of wood and stone (crashing) comes from this wall here-- two familiar hulking entities come barrelling into the chamber remember those giant things you saw walking through the shadowfell that you barely avoided with the mask who has the censer not on you right now you don't carry a fucking giant smoking censer with you they burst through (roaring) this big yell echoes through their metal masks it sounds like this horrible-- imagine a giant vocal scream that's peaking on the audio level against a tinny metallic speaker essentially this one's going to go after keyleth this one's going to make two swipes at trinket because trinket's right there as they barrel through part of the roof breaks guys up top percy and grog you feel the ground buckle a little bit below you and you drop about two or three inches as the building is starting to lose its physical frame that's one's going to go ahead and do two slam attacks against keyleth that's 23 to hit and that's a 29 to hit that's 20 points of bludgeoning damage from the first hit and the second one is 30 points of bludgeoning damage (two slams) and it slams you the second fist actually pins you up against the wall there and you feel ribs crack inside your chest and now-- they're both down low in this hulking mass they're almost wider than they are any other dimension with how they're crouched down and the thickness of their body they're taking up almost the entirety of the room right now yes for the second one correct the other one's going to slam twice into trinket giant fists that's going to be a 28 and a 22 that is five plus six 11 points of bludgeoning damage to trinket halved correct and 22 points of bludgeoning damage halved that ends their go we're at the top of the round percy you're upstairs you see currently down below-- make a perception check actually you wouldn't even see them from your perspective right it's blocking your vision from this side you do see scanlan you see sprigg who is currently conscious you see this necromancer who is currently held with brambles and you see two streaking flames and hear screams on this side of the building right there it looks more like a drop yes you do that hits oh don't worry he drops the staff because there's not much left of his head when you hit the arm the staff's clutching but you slam it and it hits the side of the head and causes the right side of the face to explode against the tree the brambles still clutching as it falls limp to the ground and they crush the body into a small rock of flesh you just barely see them they have three-quarters cover but you have sharpshooter the one right furthest on the side there yeah that hits goodbye necromancer how much was that sorry okay all right he's still standing (bullet impact yelps) he starts looking up to see where the shot came from as the giant bullet wound through the torso and out the back of the shoulder was clean through you hear him breathing gasping for breath (gasping) that hits yeah go ahead and roll damage he falls to the ground face first the second shot hits him in the chest he just goes down crumples his body begins to smolder that ends percival's turn grog you're up you hear downstairs the (heavy thudding) there's the guy in front of you who's like (angry breathing) what are you going to do you can and your head goes into the roof (thudding) the floor gives out as your head (crashing) into the ceiling (creaking crashing) it falls out from under you you come falling down on top of this guy rubble falls around keyleth i need you to make a dexterity saving throw i need trinket to make a dexterity saving throw the other shadow ghast fails trinket you and the shadow ghast all take 22 points of bludgeoning damage as the roof caves in over on top large part of the upper floor now falls and this guy stumbles and is now prone there he also takes damage you take 22 points of bludgeoning damage from falling through the wreckage trinket's is halved yes that kills him the shadow ghast right here yeah he's like huh (crashing) gets rained on with rubble broken splintered wood and stone his part of the ceiling didn't fully collapse he's just out of the way he's dangling off the edge right now as he shakes it's making its way towards the hole the whole ceiling didn't collapse just the area right below no they're not giants they're considered undead big targets hits 25 with the first hit (whack) 22 damage on the second hit (whacks) you're hitting him laying on its back it has these metal spikes jamming out of its flesh you can see portions of other creatures that it had slain that have been jammed on these spikes and rotted away on its armor so as you're hitting it you're knocking away parts of partially decomposed creatures that previously fell in battle to one of these creatures as you're slamming into it you can see it's just rippling partially decayed muscle that seems to be unnaturally strengthened by whatever necrotic energy keeps it stitched together and alive it's a thick sack of hit points is that your turn are you doing anything else okay and that's the end of your turn okay end of grog's turn vax you're up you heard all this go on and now the whole building is starting to catch fire right there i will say at proximity to the flames that are starting to catch you do take three points of fire damage you threw the dagger at the big guy go ahead and roll an attack it's not flanking but you get to add sneak attack modifier yeah that hits so you appear next to it and you appear next to it as the dagger sinks into its torso you watch as its chest muscles and the iron cage-like armor around it seems to swallow the dagger as it goes inside you watch as some of the muscles all of a sudden (squelch) fall off of its body like whatever energy's holding it together is untethered and this weird fleshy stitched-together creature is starting to fall apart it's looking pretty hurt well that's your first attack so you have your second attack attack-attack okay well we have dagger dagger dagger now we have attack attack attack attack attack attack as our next t-shirt (laughter) 17 with the additional-- right well but you said you dumped divine smite into that you did the additional damage for it being undead okay so that was how much total 17 17 will do it actually so as you rush in with the second dagger you jam up into the same space where it's falling apart and you hear this dull (shockwave sound) on the inside as the divine energy radiates from the strike and its body (slurping) sloughs off of the bones and around your arm it slowly falls around your arm like old gelatin and (slurping) slips into the ground covering the floor around you (singing) epic-level dnd 19 okay you didn't add your modifier to the third strike right that's okay no worries you hit with the two final strikes they blast into it you watch as some of the armor gets thrown off its body it takes a little hit but the other creature looks like it's largely all right that finishes vax's turn shadow ghast what's the dc on the sphere again is it 20 19 he can't escape from this freaking sphere the shadow ghast is up on the second floor going (growling) manners man all right scanlan and sprigg what do you guys want to do yeah actually make a perception check yep d20 and then add your perception modifier a 17 okay you glance over and you see two guys who are hiding amongst the bushes on the side there no depending on the spell's range depending on what you want to do that we can do it's a fun one so bringing up tasha's here looking at the range there we go it's a 30-feet range so you want to get up and get a little closer probably all right so that's half your movement and you can move two more spaces you can hit one guy so one guy of these two you can select that one there all righty make a saving throw a wisdom save that is a ten your spell dc is a 17 you watch as the guy there who has his crossbow out and sees you get up spins around has this giant heavy crossbow the bolt very recognizable because you still have three of them in your body aims it towards you and then suddenly (maniacal laughter) and drops the crossbow to the ground and doubles over laughing falling to the ground and is now kicking and laughing like a hyena right now unable to do anything (maniacal laughter) all right is that your turn all right you haven't actually you do see this guy's on fire right now who is still around yeah and you can see that hulking figure come running through and you hear the (explosion) through the back of the building the log is right up in this area okay you watch as three missiles fire out of the wand and slam into the bits of rope up top as they explode it's enough of an impact to cause it as opposed to fall straight down just spin and fall i'm going to go ahead and roll a dice to see which direction it's going to land from its front point so we'll say inward would be one two three four five six that's a six so it plummets down hits the ceiling scrapes off and slams down onto him he's going to try and make a dexterity saving throw that is a seven plus four nope that's an 11 go ahead and roll 4d8 please i think so oh no sorry he's over here this guy's on fire from her earlier 16 points of damage to him it's not enough to kill him but it slams on him and then falls over you see as both of his flaming hands on the ground going (groans) he's currently restrained underneath it right there and on fire all right you going to stay where you are there's a window here window here this one has flames in front of it this one's available okay four five that's as far as you can move there you see the guy on the ground who's laughing in front of you all righty so you get an inspiration die you get a d12 that you can use on any sort of skill you don't have to use it right now but whenever you use a skill check or an ability check you can add that to it if you want to there you go all right so now it's the assassin's turn keyleth how much fire damage does it do when they're on fire is it d10 thought so all right he takes eight fire damage under a log he's going to try and break free from restraint nope that is a 14 he cannot move that giant tree that's currently crushing him on the ground he tries to reach out for his crossbow and aim it out towards sprigg with one hand because it's still loaded but he has super disadvantage on this strike it is now sure i'll do all three all right eight 12 12 i made him roll super disadvantage what does this remind me of like a terrible old sci-fi movie where the bad guy's on the ground with the gun trying to aim it at the hero with his final shot and the hero just walks up and steps on the gun you (whoosh) sidestep the bolt as it fires nothing on you the crossbow drops (grunting) (crying) on fire all righty that ends his turn this guy back here is going to go ahead and since you're the one who has his friend writhing on the ground is going to go ahead and try to shoot you with his crossbow you do see him although he's unaware of that so he thinks it's a sneak attack shot that is a 14 i know seriously they come in large numbers so yeah this one just (impact sound) hits the tree to your left his aim's off exactly and he goes ahead and darts behind this building there vanishing you do he reveals himself when he fires so you watched him come out of the bushes and (whoosh) fire and then duck around the side of the building the guy on the ground is going to try and save against your spell that is a 13 plus zero nope he's still laughing he's just on the ground (laughing) tears in his eyes now that's the end of the assassins' turn necro's dead vex you're up take minus five and do additional damage okay 17 is exactly his armor class okay 27 so that's your first strike (arrow shot) first one just (impact sound) hits in the side and you see the bolt of energy arc out and the flames burn up the arrow by the way the wall behind you is starting to get really warm there's a guy on the ground there yeah so you've got to step over him as you move past he does get a swing with his shortsword at you oh wow that's a 25 i think so so you take nine points of slashing damage just like (pain sound) as you're walking past i realized he had disadvantage but i rolled another 18 so it's fine okay 25 hits because of the sharpshooter all right 39 last time so go ahead and take a swing at it you're up next keyleth all right so the second arrow slams into him it's still holding firm it's taking the hits and you see parts of its body are starting to spill black liquid out of the wounds and (growls) its red eyes still beaming out from behind the metal mask in front of its face its arm swings back and tears some of the ceiling beams out with it it's looking pretty rickety right now so that ends your turn keyleth you're up okay you technically entered the space of the guy who's on the ground becoming a fire elemental which lights him on fire (screams) (whoosh) so occupying his space from this side we'll say she can catch you guys on fire i'll double-check that real fast you know what it can move through a space as narrow as one inch wide so i'll say yes you can maneuver through only if you want to can you set things on fire go for it he is now in flames 21 yeah 16 just misses that hits that's what you needed he's looking pretty hurt as you slam him with both of your flaming hands and claw across his body where the flame hits you see it (hissing) singes through the flesh and drags charred remains of where the muscle once was where you dragged your claws through the body's starting to shake as it's holding its form together actually you know what vax would have avoided it because vax is in the spot where it was but vax knew where it was so vax would have probably gone over it wait you wouldn't have because when you threw the dagger-- it's not a big deal thank you for pointing that out you guys glance upward as you hear a (deep swoosh) and up above you in the hole in the ceiling where there once was nothing but air you see hovering above you a giant beholder just appear (guttural moan) all of its eyestalks curling around it thank you for that so that finishes your turn keyleth pike's turn pike sees this-- no you were so angry-- it's in the hole above you don't quite see where that hole was at the moment you backed away so much blind rage look guys that's what we're doing so anyway pike does actually make an insight check and says it's not real don't worry about it fixed (laughter) pike however is going to go ahead and make another guiding bolt at the large guy there that's going to be a 20 that hits that's going to be 4d6 14 points of radiant damage which will do it so you watch as pike blasts it in the face with the guiding bolt as it hits the mask gets thrown off and where the head was beneath it you see this empty black void with two red burning coals for eyes that blink out as soon as the mask is removed and the whole body crumples to the ground and turns into a horrible thick black-purple ichor the beholder is still upstairs staying in place going (hoarse screaming) (laughter) that ends pike's turn they're both dead that brings us back percival it's your turn there's the one guy on the ground there one's laughing we'll say for the purposes of this for the time most everything there is not much of a threat at this point so systematically the guy on the ground who's hidden by the tree you can just-- you throw him (thud) he lands make an athletics check sorry acrobatics check no it's not a saving throw you can't do that i'll say for the purposes of this-- right i know but spider climb boots only helps you if you keep on the surface so as you leap you manage to land on your feet but the flames do catch you a bit so you take six points of fire damage as you start to burn for the purposes of time on this one the guy who's currently under the log just burns to death there under the log pinned he's trying to reach for his crossbow but he's only fired the one bolt that was loaded in it the guy on the ground is still laughing as you approach him yeah there's quite a few heavier rocks on the ground (splat) a horrible sickening crack sound it slams into the head you lift it up the laughing has stopped but he's still moving and you can see the face is broken the nose is smashed to the side and it's just blood he's starting to try and get back up do you let him get up he gets up (grunting) okay we'll say for the purposes of this he runs off in the distance (footsteps yelp) and falls to the ground no longer moving he's on the ground on fire now going (frantic gasps) patting out the fire he spends his action putting the fire out now and is like (frantic gasps) he's like (scream impact) just smashed on the ground red watermelon the building is standing mostly the whole front of it is blackened the flames are gone most of the interior is destroyed you have two giant holes in the back most of the upper ceiling is ruined the house is in shambles a lot of them have been destroyed some of the ones on the back wall have been burned some of them have been burned by people in flames or made of flame or general black ichor that spilled out the house is pretty wrecked make an investigation check 27 okay you start glancing through you find some history books you find some that relate to local history you see some books that relate to various types of creatures some animals and beasts many that are encyclopedias of various rivers and it's scattered everywhere it's just universal knowledge of pretty much anything he can get his hands on so some of it seems less useful than others but you hand-pick a few out that you think percy would like you get the sense that's not how this works the staff you see it's a carved eye it's made of wood and paint it's ornamental it's mainly used as a focus technically acts as a plus-one staff you walk into your destroyed abode managing to sidestep all the bear traps along the way you've walked the path many times and you know it and i'm actually surprised none of you walked into any of them you knew where most of them were but none of you wandered out far enough into the open to do that they're all inside you can see your giant friend of course that you were talking to as you walked in is twice the size he was earlier previously where you had to hunch you're now having to almost belly crawl inside the house so if you stand in that space you're fine and in the last minute or so has not been able to break free but is still trying after the first failed save okay pike casts cure wounds on you as well and you heal 18 no you do not pike i can certainly try do you have any items of her iconography yeah actually you just reach over and find one of the undamaged books i don't know if i can talk to her i'm not but i can help you pray i don't know if it'll be enough grog can you help me clear some of the floor please pike takes you over to the center of the room and tells you kneel with me now take this book and close your eyes and apologize for everything you said about ioun (huffs licking) licks the side of your face you sit there in silence with your eyes closed concentrating holding the book before you doesn't seem to be an answer just silence in the darkness nothing everyone wants to look at him-- still turned away nothing nothing responds as you have your eyes closed you hear this soft chuckle in the far corner of the room (cackles) really praying are you do i look the kind of guy that would help i think you're right it's no longer your prison it's not mine either (flapping) flies out the window while you've been talking by the way and the silence has been sad taking in the slight emotional cut that not getting a response and putting yourself on that limb means nothing the rest of you notice his torso is glowing bright blue yeah pike looks at you and takes your hands and opens your arms and motions to your chest and the book in your hand you pull aside you glance down and you can see there's this soft bluish glow that's emanating from your torso strange no it did that's canon okay you glance through it the book is a simple book talking about the construction of barricades and it looks like it was less the contents of the book and more just the image of the book itself okay make a perception check when you took the book from him and handed him another book there was a very faint vibration to his body as you pulled it from him and gave it back to him which you haven't noticed but there's a physical vibration to him okay you feel them and you feel this very faint vibration to his body when you pull out the fork and you hold it you recall that whenever you cast the spell plane shift there was a faint vibration to the specific fork when you cast the spell sam and all right the rest of you gathered hands for this all right trinket (roars) into the necklace there is a sudden (sucking noise) a shuddering of power energy around you as you feel the vibration out of sprigg's hand emanate throughout the entire loop you guys have created throughout your grasp the familiar bright light flashes before you and you feel your body being pulled through at incredible speeds through darkness there the familiar racing of the divine gate (fast travel noise) as you pass through one of its many portholes then adrift by now you've-- the times you've passed through the gate you've passed through it a handful of times since now adrift still holding hands but the circle's beginning to turn into an oval you can all glance around and see each other did you miss your destination did you overshoot what's next (whoosh) another white flash and suddenly you're at a destination you glance around and you're standing within a small chamber it resembles a decadent bathhouse but with no water nor occupants it's empty there are marble pillars stretching to a domed ceiling about 60 feet above you all silk-draped cloths drift and hang at odd angles throughout the ceiling glowing points of magical light latched within iron cages dangle at the edges of these pillars about 15 feet up that give the faint glow to an otherwise darkened room there are walls on each side of this chamber about 30 or 40 feet from you and one arched hallway across from you that leads to the only other chamber you've seen sprigg is still holding your hand as you guys walk forward towards the singular hallway you go through the domed arch and the hallway extends on featureless smooth grey marble like a solid punch that seemed to have carved out whatever this material was it extends for 100 feet 150 feet and even though there's very very faint light and many of you can see through darkvision there is a darkness about 60 feet from you that seems to consume what you can see you can only see so far beyond that radius and you're not quite sure where that oppressive shadow is coming from the air is chilled but not uncomfortably so you can hear the distant sound of pinched winds whining through small spaces a familiar sound from the many times you've spent underground through caverns that had some openings that allowed air to streak through to the surface a few steps more and suddenly the hallway opens into a second chamber into a library if you could even call it that bookshelves that stretch upward for seemingly hundreds of feet before flickering lights fell from your vision you do not see where they stop these columns of just tomes and cases and scrolls and parchments stacking as in tablets and any form of recorded information seem to just be infinite in front of you to two sides of this road and upward they seem to stretch in almost every direction the walls to the side of you you see columns ahead of you and they tend to wind and curl like a labyrinth made of bookcases to no end it's very escher-esque in how the further up you look they tend to curve and shift and bend around each other your eyes now attuned to the realms beyond mortality you catch glimpses of shifting wind gathering books and turning pages spirits of the library though sparse as they may be from this entry point organizing reading and learning from whatever words are within you begin to almost get vertigo trying to contemplate the strange and overwhelming construction of such a wondrous place an endless sea of stories spectral custodians keeping the tales of each other and the history of exandria past present and binding the pages to tell what will eventually be the present currently the future okay you begin to take the first-- there are no words on any of the spines okay you pick it's ironic you do this because the book is in celestial you do it's ironic that you did that (chuckles) glancing through it appears to be describing a birth describing a tunnel then a light then a cry it seems to be an older man surrounded by his family-- you glance through this book begins very similarly to the last one this one actually ends with what appears to be a horseback riding accident 115 pages in you get to a page that seems to talk about the sorrow of a lost romance and trying to deal coping at a young adult age they are currently all the ones you've picked up are in celestial make a religion check you grab a tome and pull it forth and as you read through the story it's an unfamiliar one what are the rest of you guys doing while percival is running around like a kid make a perception check glancing about none of the spines have anything written on them so you have to start pulling a few books out and opening them you open it up it's not in a language you understand it's a labyrinth of bookshelves there's a path forward between two or three ahead of you but then it comes to an end where it splits off in two directions like i said they travel up infinitely so you're not quite sure which way leads where sprigg is actually-- there's a very faint blue glow in him that never really faded since your arrival no noticeable change make a perception check no discernible difference it's a natural one it's an auto-fail you can make an investigation check to begin to wander around and try to find your way scanlan seems to walk with purpose into one of the random rows okay all right anyone else do anything okay percy's following scanlan okay trinket (bear grunt) looks confused and starts looking up falls onto his back yes they are you try and yell and it's making no sound it is just absolute quiet what are the rest of you guys doing grog grog what are you doing yeah pike comes over no there aren't she goes do you

stone you hear some footfalls as vax and keyleth catch up to you guys an echoing voice billows out from the right side of your troupe a creaky warm matronly voice that surrounds and almost welcomes you with the intonation of a grandmother it says nothing is forever percival you glance off to the right and you can see there's a break in the bookcase to your right you see the shelves have stopped ahead in this direction to reveal a circular common area within the library where the ground domes downward into an 80-foot-wide concave pit of cushions and tables all standing at odd angles alongside this pit but never sliding gravity seems to shift depending on where the dome stands these tables hold teacups and writing implements and various other décor and things that involve binding and writing none of them slipping all of them affixed to the table as the dome slowly comes to a central rest long spiraling streams of silver blue and gray silk descend from the supposed ceiling that is beyond your sight and they come down like drifting silks that push past as you enter the area sitting 40 feet from you in the center of the dome no larger than a normal person is an older woman with long wavy silver hair her olive skin is somewhat weathered and wrinkled around her almond eyes but the warmth of her smile and her vibrant purple irises put you at ease immediately her blue and white robes tumble out from her form in tendrils of parchment that snake through the pillows like roots she smiles as you turn and see her i felt that you would find me and that's where we'll end tonight's
