all right then good morning and welcome everyone to this year's critical role panel (cheering) it has begun can you imagine what would happen if you played a game not on the stream and came in like man that was a crazy adventure anyway sam shows up with a new character as an introduction to the panel who here doesn't know what critical role is raise your hand (cheering) it's a weekly stream where us and a couple of other voice actors play dungeons & dragons i'm just trying to make sure yeah that light is in our face anyway we play dungeons & dragons we're voice actors we're huge nerds and we're here at gencon for the first time (cheering) something like two and a half three years ago yeah i think it worked out okay (moans) i get to be a grizzly bear on the internet it's the weirdest shit ever do you want to make this a q&a general discussion hangout that sounds fun yeah you want to start yeah so for that one person if you're not busy saturday at 8 pm there's a way-too-big theater that we're playing dungeons & dragons in that is not at all intimidating for us we were sent photos of the sheer volume of chairs in that place for us to roll dice and mess around travis is going to be naked yes oh it's your brother just jump off or have gilmore push you audience massive rough exodus audience y'all feel real dumb when pokemon x-y-gold-ruby comes out next year with a charzord curiously small audience that's really really cool so your question yeah vox machina's ability to formulate a plan and then succeed in executing it have not changed they've always failed and yet somehow succeeded in the end but yeah other than a difference in small talk and probably the-- no sam's always been as weird as he is not much has changed beyond that it's been nice how things have changed or not changed from doing private games to the stream i do miss the morning d&d mimosas a little bit we're never going to get that back we've got to bring that back that's not true when ashley went down pre-stream there was some emotion in that sequence i'm so glad we're past that next question audience love you too audience some of those cameras follow me back to my office they can watch me tear my hair out trying to create interesting stories for you guys we'd have to put pants on audience we'll see where it goes the popularity has been unexpected but at the same time we want to make sure that if there's going to be anything that comes out of this that it's on-brand and doesn't feel like it's capitalizing on the show and is more a natural expansion of it so we'll see we definitely don't want to jump out of the gate and be like you guys like this well try the new breakfast cereal vox machi-nums (cheering) there's a guy who was on craigslist once that always ends well actually i think the black powder merchant encounter is the best example you can have of fantasy craigslist in a d&d setting that's usually par for the course which is a guy going want to buy a couch come and take a couch i have never had an npc be forcefully dragged by a community into other games victor has been pulled into stuff yes anytime please come buy things learn from my mistakes i love that keyleth doesn't quite know that he's missing limbs because she can probably fix it you've never met him in game yeah and percy doesn't know you haven't it's a 6th- or 7th-level spell so you lose a finger-- you still have to be alive for it to work although i will say i do love the idea of grog normally proportioned with one tiny baby arm growing out (laughter) (evil laughter) i like you what would you guys want to come back as if you have any idea it's a way to get experience just work your way to level four man it's really not that complicated when you get into it the choices are broad yes and that can be a little intimidating but once you make those choices especially when you pick a class that maybe has a little more limited scope with spell choices like the sorcerer or bard or something like that it's not that bad if you're a wizard then yeah you've got to be ready to have that encyclopedia at your disposal yeah wizards have the book because they can be like all right what am i learning today everyone else in the party goes ugh another round of bacon i guess there's a percy that's awesome audience as long as you bring in the butt flap you're fine audience right what he'll do is he'll sketch up an idea whether it be an actual small drawing or just the idea behind what he wants to create and the effect that he wants and he'll bring that to me via email or personal discussion i'll think about it and i'll think in terms of what could be balanced for his level and what kind of things he can do without it being a way-too-good ability for his class beyond what's normally capable for the most part tinkering is about utility and helpful things not to really strengthen the class the one exception was bad news and that was the one thing that i worked with him that he spent his entire six-month time jump working on where everyone else was having side adventures and doing story stuff he's like i spent six months in my workshop trying to make this i spent all my money on it and it still might fail on the rolls he managed to succeed once he gets the concept i'll go ahead and think out many times scaling it back to what is balanced and i'll write up what i think it should do then i'll give him a series of costs and checks he has to make for it if it's more of a giant powerful strength-based tinkering ability where he has to manipulate a lot of heavy metals it'll be more of a strength-based tinkering check where you take the tinkering bonus and the strength modifier if it's tinier more intricate clockwork-style it's more of a dexterity-based tinkering check you change whatever ability modifier applies to that roll based on the kind of task that it is the dc i decide essentially based on how intricate and how good the final product is supposed to be and how good his rolls are if it's a progressive series of rolls if he keeps failing rolls that final and third dc check i'll make pretty damn high so he still has a chance to succeed but it gets smaller and smaller the more he fails the progressive attempts it's relatively fluid it's based case-to-case because honestly the tinkering rules are kind of vague but they're intentionally vague by the system so you can do what i do and create your own way of letting them occur i think it's a cool system 5th edition has done they've given you the tools to figure out in some cases however you want to try and make it function which i like audience good good the point when travis just glazes over that's really cool audience being concise it's one of the things that comes with experience as well you may have an extremely elaborate write-up for certain circumstances it's also the presentation aspect of it too i've gone into a few backstory diatribes with you guys exposition on certain npcs because you would ask the right questions and you can still keep your attention as long as you say it with conviction it's the difference between going (monotone) and then the gods created the land and then there was the place that happened and the people went 'yay' and going (forcefully) and then the gods created the land and the people went 'yay' as long as you're engaged with the eye contact and confidence it'll generally keep people engaged more often a kind of oratory speech foundation half of it's not even what you say it's just how you say it and being concise with the details when you finish writing up a description of a new location go back through it again and be like how can i eliminate a few of these sentences how can i use different adjectives and by the way thesauruscom is your friend both to learn new cool vocabulary words but as a way to truncate the ideas you're trying to get across travis marisha and truncate truncate's a word it's a good word audience take a moment to go through what you've put down and find ways to condense it a little tighter and when you do say it to your party conviction audience and steven wins audience it was the whole plan a few more reps go go go as a dungeon master it helps to instill the idea that by the way guys if one of you does poorly that's going to mess up all of you so you want this guy to succeed because it only helps all of you it's kind of your job as a dungeon master to help sculpt a story that promotes unity in the group as well it's fun at certain times to instill tension in the group it's likely to happen naturally but because it happens naturally sometimes you have to try and facilitate that idea of everyone working together as friends and supporting each other so try your best and at least in the earlier parts of the campaign to not try and pit players against each other because it can breed unfortunate emotions when they're comfortable in their space been playing for a while and they all have built out the core that's when you can tweak it here and there for those cool story moments but you still want to facilitate as the head storyteller that-- as a master if you will to make sure that to succeed and continue friendship is the answer (laughter) hello audience it's awesome i've only seen the exhibition hall peripherally but even glancing through i'm like i should have brought another piece of luggage man after this hopefully i have this three-hour pack where i'll be like-- and i apologize in advance if you see me wandering and you approach me and i'm like no i'm fine it's nothing against you it's just that i have very short periods of time to actually enjoy the exhibition hall and i really literally just wanted to buy everything (laughter) sorry what was that audience what inspired you to make your individual characters yeah i think that was an early omen i think you tried druid in fourth edition and you hated it i guarantee you that if keyleth goes away or the campaign finishes you're going to make a character that's-- to answer your question for me i was inspired to be a dungeon master from having a really bad dungeon master my first six months of playing i loved the game i could see the potential for it-- the potential for storytelling-- and the guy who was running was just really really really hard to enjoy it wasn't about the story more than it was let's go kill things and also i have my own character who's in second edition a paladin but i'm also going to want to take the samurai fighter kit because i'm the dm and i'm allowed to do that so he's a samurai paladin dual-wielding magical katanas and also he's got his griffon mount and his holy sword and his holy quest was he woke up and this guy went here so yeah it was very-- it was a pain in the ass and to walk away was like no go i'm going to run my own game so then my whole inspiration-- i was driven to do it because i couldn't take bad examples of it and then i was just fumbling in the dark for years going i guess this is how it works this is how most of us did it when there wasn't examples of it you newer folk have such an easier time of it you were creating a void in a vacuum wow i sound really old and crotchety now oh you youngsters you don't know what it was like we had to do reverse math for ac and thac0 we'll assume you appreciate you skipped that area because i know that was pretty quick and that's basically my inspiration audience oh no way that was you (laughter and applause) i'd like to tell gilmore to open shop further east don't stand there try stillben that's a nice time of year i'd tell kima to maybe be more of a second-wave fighter-- let everyone else go in first i know man she's got an awesome set of abilities i'm always excited to use and i'm like well never mind one day kima and beholders is not a good setup man she's got a thing with eyes now it's hate fear anyone catches eye contact she's like-- good question thank you there's sam with his blue poo i got sunglasses next question we've got a long line and not a lot of time audience that's a good one that's a really good one but something with aretha franklin probably hell yeah respect man it would be awesome if (singing) r-e-s-p-e-c-t audience sorry what was the question audience are you sure man audience very nice they're actually metal that's awesome that's a 15 that's not bad audience that's awesome wow that's awesome okay so what animal would your character be and what character do you want to voice-over like an animal yeah actually as far as me as a dungeon master i would be an eagle but you know me as a person would probably go mongoose or owl but not creepy barn owls with little beady eyes and the big round face we're talking great horned with an angry eyebrow that's the barn owl i like that one too but they're like-- good question audience thank you for continuing to bring the stories that you create for other people that's fantastic seriously something to take the edge off definitely doesn't hurt it's always going to be nerve-wracking that first game to an extent it's still nerve-wracking today still get those little butterflies in your stomach you just learn through experience to harness that going forward what helps is to know that all the players are there to support you especially if you create the right group of people that are in the right mindset they're all excited for the prospect of living in the space that you create for them be confident in the knowledge that they want to have the same good time that you want them to have as well music helps soundtracks are great not just for mood and setting but it also makes you feel like the silence isn't being driven by you if it's just you talking and then nothing that for some reason is more intimidating for me as a storyteller having some soundtracks or music in the background already helps bolster your mood as you start weaving that little tale and listen listen as a dungeon master because even though the pressure is on you in theory to run the game a lot of your job is reactionary and listening to what the players do and say and act as and bringing the recourse of the world reacting to that experience when i say it's collaborative storytelling it really is collaborative yeah you're the dungeon master but all of you are creating together so as long as you go in the mindset that they're putting as much into this as you are-- though you may have most of the preparation-- and you listen to what they're doing you'll find yourself a little more confident in that knowledge as you go forward i hope some of that helps there are many things you can try i'm sure there are other communities out there that can give even more elaborate responses but off the top of my head those are some things no worries good luck (applause) audience most satisfying moment for each of your characters i still can't believe that i was watching that battle unfold going oh laura i don't want to spoil too much just in case people are behind but there is a location in the world that i spent a lot of time fleshing out and designing with a lot of characters and structure and then in one fell swoop just tearing it down very weirdly cathartic it's like spending hours building a sand castle then just jumping on it it's weirdly human i made this hah audience i've larped a little bit in vampire the masquerade i didn't come in with a great experience unfortunately because i came into a very well-run long-running group of like 40 people in simi valley and la i got thrown into the middle of a direct political struggle as a very important political figure with no idea about how any of the political structure works everyone turned to me and was like you are the prince's new friend tell me how the-- and i was like i don't know what's going on sure that guy it was a little stressful as far as fantasy larping i haven't done it yet i know one of these days i will i'm scared to do it because i know i'll enjoy it far too much and i have so little free time as it is it's going to be one of those things where i'm like what else can i give up to make this happen sure i don't need to eat but i will probably get too into it if i did audience that's true yeah i tricked you guys into larping i ran a 1920s-style cthulhu-based birthday party and wrote everyone character stories and they all came in costume and once everyone arrived in-character spent the next four hours solving puzzles and wandering the house discovering ways to get the story-- yeah it turned into a mexican standoff yuri pulled out his tommy gun prop that he brought in a-- yeah he was a secret enforcer who showed up with a giant violin case and was like i'm the musician (laughter) the answer is devoured by the argument you guys did awesome good question audience so you start with cruella de vil which leads into a confrontation with gaston which then goes to the ultra-villain ursula who you think is the main villain until you defeat her and the mountain explodes and chernobog arises (laughter) you're awesome audience i know that's how i know you're awesome (laughter) audience i know it's okay because i don't drink at the games because i'm not allowed to i'm the dungeon master for me-- a lot of it stems from a theatre background and there's something about just being on stage that the nerves are there you learn to harness that energy in a way they never really go away i think you'll all agree even getting up for-- all of us have been doing stage for years and years and years and you at e3 going on to talk about gears like how nervous was that it never goes away and so the best thing you can do is do your best to harness that energy and turn it into excitement there's no real trick to it besides for some people alcohol i guess but just learning-- (laughter) wizards of the coast gave us a bunch of packages of gifts that we're going to give out to people at the live show (cheering) yeah and for those of you with your questions i do have a panel at 300 this afternoon video game voiceover you're welcome to come and bring any left over critical role questions as well that i'm capable of answering it's just me at 1230
