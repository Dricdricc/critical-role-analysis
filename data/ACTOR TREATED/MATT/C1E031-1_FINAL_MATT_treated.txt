certain roles i loved him in i absolutely adored him in the 21 jump street movies that's enough of our silly talk let's go ahead and dive into the chaos that is the current circumstance keep in mind the culmination of leading into halloween with this story arc and now going and starting a rebellion in whitestone on the fifth of november has been a very delightful unintentional coordination here so that's pretty cool so to get you guys up to speed with the circumstance that has happened those especially that are tuning in for the first time a couple known as the briarwoods that took over the city of whitestone five years before murdering most of the ruling family of percy-- other than himself escaping-- have recently been doing political discussions with the home city of emon vox machina our troop of intrepid adventurers upon discovering this battled them at emon they fled to whitestone and the party has then gone after to seek to destroy them and free the town the once-home to percival in the process it appears that there have been a number of warnings set and the entire town has been long held under this dark ominous rule that they have kept at bay apparently they have found notes of previous failed rebellions and things that die here don't seem to stay dead a number of zombified giants are wandering the city as these giant lurching sentinels and apparently a number of the cutthroats that helped the briarwoods come to power in this town have now been given titles and land here and are now called the new nobles by the locals during this process you guys managed to sneak into the town began setting out word of coming rebellion and that percival de rolo has returned and the briarwoods' time is numbered upon meeting the previous chancellor to your father of the town archibald you guys came to an understanding and he was going to reach out to all of his contacts and let them know that the rebellion is happening you guys then set out to set a two-pronged attack against two of the remaining new nobles in the town most of the party going to seek the outside of count-- what's his name travis and duke vedmeyer was the one that scanlan went to and then tylieri is the one that the rest of you wandered outside now as the rain pours down into the city midday scanlan decided to open from a polymorph spell as a fly to the top of the front doorstep of vedmeyer's home then proceeding to un-polymorph and re-polymorph into a triceratops of which i have your statistics here for your triceratops form if you want to come get that so that's your triceratops form after becoming a triceratops you squashed the front guard that was there you slammed through the front of the building destroying the front door and we cut to the other group who is stealthing through the rain at which point the okay was given to grog whether intentionally or not grog then charged to the front door of tylieri's estate and the rest of you prepared for impact and that was where we left off in the center of this chaos so without further ado sam i know take a look say for the sake of this for now we'll go through your circumstance as they are separate so scanlan you are-- i did not have a triceratops but i did have a stegosaurus it's the same size i'm sorry bloodspike behemoth i'm sorry you know what they're not around to argue i'm sure please bring them my way as you slam your way into the front of duke vedmeyer's estate pieces of wood blasting outward scattering among the center of the foyer you see before you a rising staircase that divides into two separate staircases that curl around to the second level you also notice that the entire interior is currently filled with guards all seemingly prepared and almost expecting your arrival you also see at the top duke vedmeyer himself a large hairless grey-skinned goliath wielding a giant two-handed sword armored with a breastplate vedmeyer he's a goliath yeah correct as far as you know no and at first glance based on the fact that he is wearing heavy breastplate and is wielding a giant two-handed sword you get the feeling he is probably not as heavily inclined towards the arcane arts as others you have encountered currently no currently all you see are a series of whitestone guards in uniform armor all with heavy crossbows currently nocked and as you come blasting through the door they are already arranged in what appears to be a waiting pattern should anything try and charge its way into the house in fact roll initiative yep there are doors on each side that are currently locked and other than that no they are closed currently and they appear to be-- there's a giant wooden beam crossed over the front of each then there's the outside which leads to the exterior to the raining outside of the household and the stairs that go up roll initiative okay apparently not you made a very loud noise when you turned into a triceratops and tore through the front of the household all right so scanlan is up first if you go to zero hit points in animal form you go back to your regular full health and any damage that carries over just goes to your regular health at that point you guys aren't there scanlan what are you doing what are you doing yeah you have initiative man you did he's the only one that's within technically what's your speed 40 you would get right up to vedmeyer if you were to charge what do you want to do over here it's about 35 feet okay he goes blasting through the doors we are going to find out yeah go ahead and roll a strength check roll a d20 and add your strength modifier of the triceratops form you running slam your head in through the horns protruding and tearing through the wood the doors break inward but the doors don't fully blast inward the door is in bad shape it won't take much more power to blast through it's now your worst nemesis you could try and pull back out you manage to pull out without an issue the doors are mostly beaten inward it will take but a small impact to blast through next turn if you wanted to that would have been your action that's your turn just right there this guy moves up over the railing with his heavy crossbow and aims this way these guys all shift to this side with their crossbows over here this guy's going to move to this point so he can get a view of you and vedmeyer is going to move down here and get his sword ready grinning as he holds his sword up he puts his hand up and goes aim fire a bunch of crossbow bolts get loosed at once (shh shh) through the middle of the room what's your armor class as the triceratops 11 that misses that's a 13 misses natural one that's going to be a 14 hits 18 hits 24 hits that was six one more that's a 22 so i have four that actually hit you with the crossbow bolts that's eight piercing damage 13 piercing damage 21 25 34 points of piercing damage from this volley nope all right that brings us back to the top of the initiative round and you're up you are not he is above you on the railing i'm sorry this is a balcony up top so he's actually aiming down and firing at you all right then roll another strength check 23 not a problem you burst through so what you see in here as you blast through it's a dining room with a central dining room table two small tables in the far corners there is a ten-foot window across the way it appears to be a normal dining room set that is your movement yeah i'd say at this point it is so damaged that it doesn't take much effort to push through so you can manage to push through as part of your movement nope you guys aren't there what do you want to do scanlan correct okay good to know holding an action the next turn will be vedmeyer holds up there he is going to wait there he's actually going to dash and just get up right next to where the doors are burst open he can hear you right around the corner the rest of these guys are going to dash in there there there this guy is going to just try and jump down let's see if he makes his acrobatics he does not with his armor he leaps off the edge and manages to damage his ankle and is currently prone on the ground that ends their turn back at the top are you still holding your action on your turn now it's back to you you heard a bunch of footsteps coming in yeah you can drop it in a moment the triceratops shrinks down to gnomish form now in this partially destroyed dining room area what are you doing the echoing voice you hear in the back of your mind as you imagine this is what keyleth would be saying right now okay all right 20-foot radius sphere i'd say you could affect all of them yeah all of them in this big ol' stinking cloud radius not a worry this whole area fills up with gas all right all of a sudden the entire foyer just fills up with this greenish noxious cloud of poisonous gas let's see they have to make a constitution save what's the dc is this through your hand cone (laughing) 19 jesus christ okay nope nope nope nope natural 20 he's fine 19 he's fine 18 nope nope double nope because he's on the ground fuck that guy vedmeyer rolls a one (cheering) vedmeyer himself kind of backs against the wall and (groans) just tries to get it to leave the area but it's just this thick cloud it's slowly moving away yeah they are in a bad place right now okay and you still have movement you have only moved five feet so far yeah you only moved five feet so far so you still have 20 feet of movement all right do an acrobatics to see how cool it was yes 11 you (grunts) you slide only because you partially destroyed it as a triceratops (ssss) but in your head it looked pretty cool thank god none of your allies were around to actually witness it but you heard the theme music yeah you're right by the window yeah okay your turn ends vedmeyer is just-- you can see his eyes are filling up with liquid he does make his saving throw he coughs (coughs) manages to clear the air around him you can see the cloud slowly moving back this way away from where it was cast that finishes his turn however he is no longer affected by the stinking cloud you can see as the cloud slowly moves past him and his face comes through his pupil-less angry goliath eyes are staring at you from across the room to where the doors are open you see him grit his teeth and (growls) you can hear his teeth scratching across themselves in anger and fury the rest of them are going to go these two guys are going to move forward they both come running in putting another bolt into their crossbows (clicking) pulling it back real fast pulling up their heavy crossbows and firing at you that is going to be a 24 and an 18 so you take 12 points of piercing damage from the first bolt and five points of piercing damage from the second as both (zoomf zoomf) bolts one hits you in the shoulder and ricochets off not doing much damage the other one slams and actually embeds itself into your thigh about an inch into it it's piercing and sticking out the other side mostly caught armor but you can feel it definitely got a chunk of flesh in the process that ends their turn the rest of these guys now are going to try and make their saving throw fail fail fail no success on him actually he rolled a 19 a success on a natural 19 fail fail well no actually these three succeed the rest of them are still down so i'll say that these guys here are all down and he's still up these two are still down okay that ends their turn you're up that is a hell of a lightning bolt line right there it's about six feet across no it's a big long table you have a very wide line of individuals right there all ready to snatch you the door is right here so you're by the window so if you wanted to move over here then you would have line of sight on pretty much everybody okay you duck under the table i'm going to say make a deception roll to try and successfully feint them from their direction it's kind of hard especially because there's a table and chairs up against it and part of it has been crushed by a triceratops that was previously here so you grab your head oh no do a very elaborate dive under the table a little strange dull thud of arcane energy as you bamf up to the ceiling all right is that your turn you are now up on the rooftop there's rain pouring down you are immediately soaked from the heavy storm that's now coming into whitestone just you up there yeah okay easy enough to do because it will take a round for anyone to recover from that anyway because you have to use your action both turns so as you are waiting up there you cast invisibility on yourself and wait check your equipment poison the house there you go that'll work i know you guys are rocking it you do you're checking your pockets you find the potion you look down and you notice even through the storm you can see in the distance there's the dark shape of a giant lumbering zombie guard making its way down to this part of the town what are you doing yeah make a perception check two this is a pretty solid roof with apparently no entry point at any points the craftsmanship is flawless okay you pull up (boink) pull the cork off (glug glug) as you feel the fluid find its way down your esophagus it warms it like a fine whiskey would but the warmth just grows and grows to the point where it's almost too hot but it never quite reaches a point where it's painful but you feel as if this need to belch is burbling within your stomach and at any given point in time you could let that belch fly forward where you came in yeah you just come running across the rooftop it's a little bit of up and down as the topography happens and as you're running you start hearing voices shouting out in the street you make your way over to the top of the roof above okay as you (grunts) let the belch out it comes out in a large spray of orange yellow and red flames that immediately burst beneath the overhang which-- you are no longer unfortunately when you do an attack of some kind the invisibility is released so this gnome appears soaking wet over the edge of the roof and then releases this gout of fire that blankets the front of the building catching flames on all the portions of the front part of the second and parts of the first story including the top of the entryway that you had already smashed through as a triceratops which exposed a lot of dried wood it immediately bursts into flame as you complete that breath and you inhale for a second you hear voices now starting to shout from the inside of the house (muffled shouting) you can't really make out the noises but it sounds like there's panic now starting to hit from the inside and you see a few guards start rushing out into the street to try and look at where the source of the flames came from they both look up and see you these are guards who were inside the house that as soon as the fire came shooting down and burned the house they rush out look up grab their crossbows and aim them up towards you that's a 17 and a 13 he does actually 17 does not hit that's a good point you would have half- cover from looking over the rooftop you only have a little bit of your hands and your face showing so both go (pshew pshew) firing off into the rainstorm no but it's easier for you to find it it's a lot less to cover so both bolts (shoosh) streak past you into the sky they angrily reach down and duck back inside the building with the rest of their movement to get out of the range of now what appears to be a flame-throwing gnome so that's their go what are you going to do it does progressively give you a breath for a short time yeah specifically-- oh no (laughter) you have three different exhales of this it lasts for an hour or until you exhale three times it's a bonus action to do it so you could also do something else and breathe fire yep okay so you run over your full movement will get you about halfway across at a dash we'll get your other action there and you'll have your bonus action left over you manage to slide across the roof grab the edge reach over and (blows air) just unleash on the opposite side this side because the angle the rain is coming at is getting a little bit of water but there is still a number of dry wood exposed by the immediate overhang that it does manage to catch and the flames are beginning to burn up and collect on the sides because it is superheated flame both sides of the house now appear to be on fire looking over your shoulder you can see now there is a pillar of black smoke rising up from the front of the building you do see on the opposite side a hatch (click bam) slam open and you see a giant meaty goliath hand (boof)-- now stepping out into the rain you see the goliath duke vedmeyer step up (doosh) with his two-handed sword all right it's your turn the hatch is actually halfway it's in the middle of the roof it's actually met from the second story from one of the rooms or one of the closets so it's about 25 feet from either the front or the back side it's right in the center of the house whatcha got scanlan whatcha got scanlan showing down in the rain it's charisma okay all right the roof is indeed wet i'm aware (laughs) oh this will be interesting okay so you create the hand next to him and as he starts stepping forward towards you with his sword at the ready there's a shimmer in the air as a giant kind of vaguely purplish arcane hand all of a sudden appears he looks confused for a second and rears back to try and attack it as the hand pulls back comes rushing forward towards him i want you to go ahead and make a strength check with the hand the strength is plus eight so add eight to this roll (laughs) natural one (cheering) i've rolled so many ones today this is ridiculous all right the hand pushes him five feet plus the number of feet equal to five times your spellcasting modifier yeah okay as the hand shoves him he goes pushed off to this side seems to be holding against it but the hand eventually scoops him up and actually gets him off of his feet and shot-puts him off the roof he plummets backward off the side of the roof and you wait a second to hear a (boof) across the way that's full damage there (mutters) okay he takes 34 points of falling damage and is knocked prone so you're now standing alone on the rooftop your bigby hand there next to you a little trickle of fire curling at the corner of your mouth from your final dragon's breath when you decide to use it what are you going to do yeah you're about 25 feet from it it's where you got him okay as you reach over you look down and there is a ladder that leads up to the front and there are two guards that are currently making their way up to the roof they look up and see you and their eyes go wide within their helmets and as you release the flames all you see is their faces go ah just engulfing the entire tunnel roll 4d6 marisha and yes there you go they both fail their dc 13 dexterity saving throws because i can't roll tonight 15 okay they both take 15 points of fire damage and the entirety of that space has now burst into flames you pull back because the heat is intense backdraft-style as you're at the top they don't burn off but you feel they might be a little singed you'd have to give it a few days to recover and you hear screaming down inside the tunnel and both of them are currently dealing with the fact that they're on fire so that's your movement that's your bonus action you still have an action yes let me double-check on that actually i don't know if it can but we'll find out dimension door no dimension door cannot polymorph nope do you want to try what are you doing not really no unseen servant is like a barely-there small-level air elemental that would be this way this way or this way because he fell off that side the flames are now licking up both sides of the house so you have to go this way yeah the full length of it at full dash it will get you there and there and you still have about a good 20 more feet to get so that's your turn there the two guards that were back that way are now no longer on fire they have gotten to the roof and put themselves out they both look very very angry at the current circumstance they step out of the hatch both places the hatch is still on fire there are still flames but they got out (panting) they're out in the rain now the rain's putting out and dousing the flame that's on them they both look over and see you running away they pull their hand crossbows at the ready they were already ready to fire that's a 24 and a 26 okay they both hit they had 24 and 26 that is seven points of piercing damage and 12 points of piercing damage so 19 total all righty they both reach over and grab bolts out of their sides and start preparing for another series of shots both catch you in the side one you can feel a few inches into your shoulder and it's making the joint stick and the pain is starting to really burn on the left side of your body but you're okay now it's your turn go ahead and roll a d20 and add your charisma modifier to it yeah 20 you trust-fall off your eyes somewhat closed and letting it happen and in the moment that you expect ground to meet you with a heavy hard smack of reality a soft cushion of arcane energy catches you as these spiritual purplish fingers curl around and gently bring you to the ground oh that was just the fall and you land there he's way over this way so you're outside of the house now you're in a small alley between-- well not an alley you're on the side of the house and there's a big grassy area around it and there's the fence that surrounds the whole it's an action to use its ability so it was your action to catch you as part of it to do anything with bigby's hand oh it's a bonus action yeah so you've been moving it along with you as you go yeah okay so you're going to start running over this way all right as you run you get over to the front of the gate that is closed off it's a little bit too tight for you to squeeze through how do you plan to get over the gate okay make an athletics or acrobatics check to try and get over the gate 16 okay is that acrobatics or athletics athletics so you run you jump up (ching) grab onto the metal bars to start just pulling yourself up over the top land on your feet and you're now right near where the street is and you can see to your right it's open towards the direction of where the rest of the party is to the left you can see now coming through the rain about a hundred feet from you a giant hulking zombie giant that's stomping towards you as you notice that you see a number of figures come swarming out of the two buildings to the side of it and immediately start attacking the zombie giant travis and okay so you just cloak yourself and watch from the shadows off to the side as you are there for a little bit keeping your eye out for the next couple of minutes you can see the house is now completely engulfed in flames the rain try as it might-- the roof itself is not catching yet but you can see now fire is licking out of every single window and glass is steadily breaking over time (crash crash) the guards have all escaped out and you can see the guards and vedmeyer are now storming across the entire grounds he's giving orders left and right and they're all out searching for you in the nearby vicinity of the home looking across the way you can see the zombie giant is now currently reaching down and swapping down you can get a closer view they look like some of the normal inhabitants here are wearing makeshift armor weapons that they have and they are now rising up and attempting to take down this zombie giant you watch as it reaches out it slams and smashes one to the ground leaving him lifeless while another two leap up on the back of the zombie giant and are stabbing it with spears and you see it (moaning) it gives out this roar it's hard to tell from this distance which side is getting any ground but it is currently held up by this group of about ten individuals that are attacking it at once you just going to stay there and wait it out okay we'll use that to hop over to the other party a short rest is about half an hour to 40 minutes of waiting so you might want to find a place that isn't quite so intense to do this you can try and sneak into one of the nearby homes and do it maybe okay so you would not be able to rest unfortunately it's not a very restful situation right now to gather yourself okay i approve of this greatly all righty the rest of you guys who have all been slinking out the back you just knocked a guard out trinket came with you grog right that's right percy vex you guys are all back this way the back of the building you can see what looks to be one door to a back room grog as you come slamming up with trinket behind you (thudding footsteps) up to the front of the building you see the front doors are there before you yeah yeah okay make a strength check yes you didn't all right it is very important at this moment trinket's hit points right now are what 56 trinket should have four more hit points yeah all righty 26 you rush forward with your foot (boom) it's sparta the front of that door as it just (crash) cracks open trinket coming up behind you the doors open you can see now before you there is a single staircase that curves up to a second floor there is a large vase right at the base of it right there there's a couple of tables by it and it goes to the right and left do you enter the premises or are you staying right at the door it's up to you all right grog you push your way in trinket following behind you right there immediately you see the upper banister right over the railing also similar to what scanlan encountered has guards completely within this area at the ready crossbows pulled in wait there is tylieri all waiting crossbows at the ready the doors slam open you guys rush in for a second there's nothing immediately within your range and you look up and see an entire array of guards all trained upon you and trinket a voice behind them goes loose (fshh) (chuckles) what's your armor class yep this is just-- because of the speed everything goes he gets there before anybody no worries all right that is-- ooh that is 27 to hit that is 15 to hit no third one that is 16 to hit nope that is a 21 to hit 26 to hit that's a 22 to hit 14 to hit 20 to hit then three more 22 to hit 12 to hit and ten to hit yeah matt and six crossbow bolts come at you that's eight points of piercing damage don't halve them yet we'll add them all up and then we'll halve that so eight plus 13 21 plus eight again 29 plus another nine 38 plus another 11 so 49 and then another 12 so 61 so you take half that which would be 31 points of piercing damage on you in one volley of crossbow bolts at you (shoosh) you protected trinket and the rage did descend it a little bit the pain as all these bolts are now sticking out of your chest you look like this front-quilled porcupine you just take the pain and grin for a second you have that iron-y taste of blood reach the back of your throat from the immediate impact and it just further intensifies your rage i'm going to have everyone here roll initiative because you're all acting simultaneously at this point all righty 25 to 20 trinket goes when you go 23 all right we have vax at the top 20 to 15 all right all right 15 to ten ten to five what did you get oh no sorry you're not to be fair i asked 25 to 20 (laughs) that's my own fault that's okay by the way guys both scanlan and percy leveled up this last time so we have at the top of this combat round percy am i i'd better not be that was weird i don't know what happened there anyway battle's still up there is a door right here at the back of the building that you can see but the door is currently closed okay you rush to the door you go to try it (clicking) the door is locked you're going to hold your action okay that's fine next up is vax all right you go ahead and you rush over (whoosh) pull out your lockpicks rain's still pouring down you have your hood up the water's dripping past your face as you're trying to concentrate you get the tools in it's not a very complicated lock (click creak) you push it open leading you guys into the interior of what looks like a kitchen 25 as you look inside it's a cold kitchen it hasn't been in use for a while the fire's up there's a little bit of a slab in the corner where most of the preparations are done there's a few cabinets that are up it's dark there's no lantern there's a door immediately to your left and there's across the way is an archway opening there's no actual door there it's just a walkway that leads into the next room yes yep as you glance through you can see what appears to be there appears to be a hallway there's a hallway that goes across the way there's a door at the end of the hallway and two doors to the right and left of this hallway right here oh over here you go over there and you try it (click) it opens up opens up into what appears to be a storage room series of barrels small grain sacks in the far corner it appears that most of the dry storage for the kitchen is kept in this room okay move you forward to do that you move in you do okay you stay behind him as you move in the door this one here (shhh) you slide that one open it appears to be a bathtub in there it's a rather nice powder room and bathroom you can try i'll say for this round you can go ahead and open that look inside for a second go for this just really quick checking back and forth this one this door actually it does not appear to open at a push no you've already done your move yes you guys are on the base floor right that's your go so bringing us to count tylieri's turn count tylieri who is currently looking over the banister he kind of steps forward here for a second grog this works for you because you look up and see all the guards there tylieri walks up this rotund-looking slimy individual thinning hair very pale skin a little bit of facial hair that has never really seemed to grow fully in but he tries to groom the best he can oh much better he's wearing fine clothing he's got rings encrusting his fingers but he walks with a deftness to the edge of this stairway and looks over and says interesting i figured there'd be more of you (laughs) of which you see him leap up onto the ceiling (pshh) stick to it and begin to (skittering noise) scatter across yep yep he jumps up and spider-crawls across the ceiling and then drops down yeah with deft acrobatic feats he leaps across drops and lands right in front of you you can see now in his face as slovenly as it is there is a look of deathly hunger in his eyes and fangs bared from under his lips he is now going to make two melee attacks against you that's a natural 20 with the claw and the other one's going to be a 15 i don't think it's going to hit so he now has these long claws in his hand the first one (whoosh) it catches you off guard from the sheer weird assault that he's brought to you (laughs) you take 16 points of slashing damage (whoosh) from the first arc and he goes up with the second hand and this time you (grunt) pull out of the way his hand manages to knock some of the bolts free that were jammed in your chest half of 16 correct because you're raging so eight on that one that's his go and he just grins at you with this hissing sound licking his fanged lips that ends his turn that brings us to grog you're up okay war hammer (fwoosh) bursts into flames your eyes all of a sudden go into an intense glare as you rear up and go into your frenzied rage make your attacks do it 24 hits on the first strike you only have advantage on the first attack yeah the first one's a reckless strike hits as well all three hit that's with the minus five right because of great weapon master it would be minus five to each attack all right so the last one was 15 last one misses but the first two do hit 21 points of damage that's with the fire right yeah third one misses so 41 points of damage to him with the first two (whack whack) the impacts slamming into him you can see his body get pushed back with each impact he's still taking it and grinning at you but he's also seemingly surprised by the ferocity of the strikes is that your turn are you going to move okay he's going to use one of his legendary actions to at the end of your turn reach out and attack you again that's going to be a 23 to hit instead of attacking he's going to grapple you so his claw goes up and actually (fwoosh) reaches into your throat and you can feel the claws digging into the flesh it's a very very firm grip and he has you right where he wants you that's that action there all right that brings us to the guards the guards all reload their crossbow bolts move in these three now see the bear in the back and they're going to fire on trinket these seven are all going to fire on grog now that he's held there so the three against trinket that's going to be a 16 that's going to be a 20 and a 22 so trinket takes six points of piercing damage and 11 points of piercing damage total of 17 points of damage to trinket as two bolts (shink shink) one of them bounces off the armor one actually sticks and trinket (growls) but it's not enough to really cause much of a worry the other seven against you grog natural 20 natural one that's not going to hit that's a natural five 18 natural one that's a 19 that hits a 19 naturally so it's 27 one more that's 18 to hit oh these all have advantage on you because you did a reckless attack so the one that would have missed is a natural 20 that does hit natural 20 again i'm rolling for all the ones that would have missed yeah reckless attack they all hit you three of which are crits first crit is 19 points of piercing damage the second crit is going to be nine points of piercing damage last one is going to be another nine points of piercing damage actually that would be 15 total because that was a crit so the three crits are out of the way 15 on the last one yeah and so those are the three crits there you go so that's that and the next ones are 11 another 11 ten and seven so you take another 39 points of piercing damage after that one of them yeah okay so we'll say you reduce one of the crits from 16 the first one take 15 points off that because i think one of the crits was 15 we'll say you used it on that one that's 39 points of piercing damage reduced by half that will put you at 18 we'll say you take 18 points of piercing damage from those four non-crits so yeah that ends the guards' volley that brings us to vex you're up yes and trinket both okay are you going to dash because you can move you can double move using your action to move if you want yeah unless you want to use your action to yell out for trinket to attack in which case you can give trinket a round of combat okay correct yep correct okay so he's going to move this way and then cannonball forward okay trinket moves off to the side (thudding footsteps) gets a couple of running starts and then rolls into a roly-poly style forward all right so make one attack against him your attack bonus for trinket yes plus eight just for the attack 15 does not hit unfortunately so trinket rolls past he dodges out of the way gets an attack of opportunity on him because he wasn't hit as part of the attack that's a 27 to hit trinket takes seven plus three ten points of slashing damage as he streaks by seeing the bear coming at him too soon and managing to both pull out of the way and use that to his advantage technically yes he's just grappling with one hand and just dodges out of the way moves over and slashes with the other hand i know you man it's okay (laughter) okay i'll let you do that because this is your full round to do that usually you would choose to cannonball-- but because you aren't part of this combat fray and you're giving all of your round to him i'll let you do it sure trinket comes out of the roll turns around (roars) and strikes with the claw swiping-- oh bite him okay that hits 11 points of damage as trinket latches onto the back of his shoulder (growls) and pulls and tugs at him trying to get him loose from grog's grip not strong enough to do so but he nevertheless takes the damage and (snarls) hisses back at the bear clutched onto his shoulder cool that ends your turn keyleth you're up at this point make a perception check it's a heavy storm 12 currently in the storm you're just not able to really make up any visual in the distance right now no you do not know if there is any fire going on or any signal at this point over here yeah there's a window there window there window there oh back here this side there are no other windows it is completely closed off nope there's just the one entry there that everyone else went in through this is a storage closet that was already checked by vax who walked past it you don't no no one's moved all the way in to see and it's not very well-lit in there currently no because you guys approached from that side you saw windows but it was fairly dark you saw a little bit of light moving through some of the windows on the second story but nothing down here that really caught your attention not yet there is a door at the end of this hallway but nobody's gotten to try it yet you could push past your party and continue to move down the hallway if you want what are you going to do you came inside not going to retcon it i'm just saying you can't get halfway in there and be like wait this didn't happen the one across the way okay you push past everyone you push on the door it opens up and reveals a long dining room a big thick dining room table a double window across the way this is the house's dining room there are two double doors across the way that lead into what you think is the foyer in which grog and trinket currently stormed through and you can hear muffled through the door in the distance the sound of combat and impact and people shouting to each other i'll say you can get that far and you can just crest and look out the window if you want to from this point you've already checked once you're just getting in there you won't be able to really see from here that brings us to the top percy you're up you make a little bit of a calling noise you hear nothing back you fear you might be just out of range for it okay you can get to there you're just at the edge of it do you want to try and knock it open you can try to you reach out (creak) it opens up and you can see now a light comes pouring through from the foyer and you can hear much louder now the sound of combat and grog chuckling and swings and impacts you can see a couple of crossbow bolts go (boof) and scatter across the ground correct what are you doing what are you doing do your thing percy do your thing what are you doing okay where do you want to get on this side right there okay so you just swing around (fwwwt) to the inside you look up and immediately you see this curved banister and a whole row of guards up top with heavy crossbows in the center you can see some blur as grog trinket and some individual are in the middle of this tussle the individual currently has grog grasped by the throat which one right there okay okay so you swing around the corner and look up at the one guard as you concentrate for a second bringing your gun up your eyes begin to go black again the smoke pouring out from the corner of it smoke begins to pour out of the midsection of the guard who looks confused for a second and it swirls around him as part of the hex that has him marked as you release your next three blasts okay ten misses first shot just (ricochet noise) goes wide blasting a chunk out of the upstairs hallway 11 also goes wide this time (ricochet noise) blasting part of the banister in front the guard dodges out of the way as the wood splinters past him that's the percy we know (laughs) all dice gets doubled and then you add the modifier not the modifier no correct double the die it's faster 42 points of damage and four of that was fire damage okay as you look up (doosh) the first two shots fire and go wide the third one (explosion noise) just explodes and in a blast of black smoke the guard's head is no longer across his shoulders (cheering) ability checks so the smoke (whoosh) pours off the body and coalesces around the next guard to his right all right that ends your turn vax do an acrobatics check you (shhht) slide to there at double movement slide will give you movement yeah you can get next to him okay so right there okay yeah you can get up there correct more daggers whatcha doing 19 hits hits all three hit go ahead and roll damage sneak attack on the first one seven okay gotcha so you (fwoosh) dart in a blur of darkness you come swinging up you can see tylieri is currently grasping grog out of the corner of his eye just sees the movement and looks over curiously as the blade is immediately in his side (pained scream) and now you can see the jowls shake from the impact of the dagger blow and he looks down angrily at you fangs bared as the two other attacks hit his side at the end of your turn he uses two of his legendary actions-- i know to look at you reach up with the throat that he's grasped and sink his fangs directly into your throat grog not in this moment you have a big neck very big neck and a very tiny collar (laughs) that will be a 20 to hit all righty so you take nine points of piercing damage that is halved yeah so say five round up however you do take 14 points of necrotic damage that is not reduced but your maximum hit points are now reduced by 14 as you feel that same similar cold feeling as the life blood's being drained out of your body and you see his eyes cresting at you with this wild glare that ends your turn vax it is now his turn yeah now he's taking his turn he's now going to go ahead and make another bite attack on you again as he pulls back and reaches his forearm and grabs the other side of your throat going for the other side of the jugular that's a natural one though (cheering) however he does have advantage on you because you used your reckless strike it was a one on the first attack yeah it's until your next turn attacks against you get advantage i'll read it for you right now it's a cool ability when you're not the only tank in the room yeah but attack rolls against you have advantage until your next turn doing so gives you advantage on melee weapon attack rolls using strength during this turn so yes i apologize it does give you advantage on all of your attacks i misread that that's okay yeah it's fine but going forward good to know so it does give you advantage on all of your attacks it's the first attack is the one that confused me on the way it was worded sorry folks i know better now but for that i say the one stands as retribution for me forgetting the rule (cheering) he pulls away releases you-- no doesn't release you as he's holding you there he's going to go ahead and make a claw strike across your face two and oh that'll be a 19 he does hit okay you take eight points of slashing damage reduced to four because of your rage that ends his turn grog you're up now you're still grappled yeah okay so you use your action to try and break the grapple so athletics roll of yeah you (boof) just shove him off without a problem you still have your bonus action to strike if you like not as a bonus action unfortunately it's an action to do that one strike yeah 21 does hit yeah 22 damage all right (whack) and you're watching as he does all these actions you see his body begin to reform and the wounds beginning to heal themselves in the vampiric manner but as soon as that wound begins to sew up you take your hammer and (boof) slam it into him again reopening and you can see now parts of his muscles are exposed a deep purplish color this very unnatural interior to his flesh you can see it burn as the flames cauterize the edges of the wound awesome does that finish your turn do you want to move at all trinket is currently flanking the guy okay that brings us to the guards' turn they all reload their crossbows these four are now going to make shots at you percy these three are going to take shots-- all five of these guys are going to take shots at grog now they're trying to take you down so they can move onto the next target so four shots on you percy that is 20 18 20 and 11 okay so you take from three heavy crossbow bolts at you seven 19 32 points of piercing damage all three bolts stick into your chest they're big long thick heavy crossbow bolts one of them gleans off your shoulder and catches the edge of the wall but the other two have actually sunk into your torso and are sticking out of you the other five against you grog since you did not do reckless strike last time they are not with advantage that is 19 12 oh that's a 25 that is a 19 last one is a 24 yep that's 11 plus seven 18 plus eight 25 plus 13 so 39 18 18 points of piercing damage again bolts are sticking out of your body all over you almost have additional armor from the number of bolts that are on your body but you're still standing there frothing at the mouth angry just like come at me that ends the guards' turn they all reload their bolts and pull their crossbows up vex you're up with a dash you can yeah unfortunately no okay go ahead two attacks from trinket oh yeah that hits him laura and all right so damage on the first strike the dice doubles yeah so a total of 23 damage all right 24 damage how does trinket want to do this (cheering) okay so as trinket reaches down (whoosh) arcing both claws across his back tylieri is dropped to his hands and knees looks up as trinket then puts his jaws down over the head and lifts up as you see the flesh begin to tear on his body he screams out in pain as the body (fluttering sound) turns to mist the mist is there yeah there's a clump of mist where he once was there's still some thick purplish congealed blood in his mouth but the vampire's form has been forced to mist at zero hit points all right that brings us to keyleth acrobatics check it's not a huge difficulty 17 yeah you jump up (shh) slide across land across the bonus there is that it takes only one block of movement to get across that's five foot there no you just see grog vax and trinket in the center of this foyer with a big cloud of mist near trinket and grog and an entire array of guards with heavy crossbows trained down on the three of them in this ambush pit i would say make an intelligence check yeah 17 okay i'd say given the circumstance right now just rushing in and seeing mist there and people with things you have no idea that's a vampire you have no reason to believe that's a vampire you just know that right now there is-- i'm just being honest here you walk in the room and there's a little bit of mist on the ground and there's a bunch of guards up there it looks like there's a threat of a bunch of guards in the room (laughs) grog in the middle of a frenzied rage would not have that-- keyleth take your turn no more metagaming take your turn what do you want to do it only makes sense i'm just saying that you wouldn't know that that little bit of mist on the ground there is a vampire there's no way that keyleth would know that based on the way you-- yeah you just missed it it's just a mist and there's black smoke around one of the guards up there okay all righty let's see (laughs) this should actually be pretty interesting all right all right so you put a wind wall up (fwoosh) in this area you can see the mist dissipates for a second and holds its place however this wind wall is now currently held up in this area that's your action here right at this area okay so there's just wind rushing up around you can see the tapestries on the walls are flickering around there's a little bit of crackling through you're right at the cusp of the distance on these communicators scanlan you hear bits and pieces at this point in time right now you're-- you're hearing crackling in your ear but you're still on the roof doing the chaos so you haven't heard anything really coming through at this point you're going to stay right there yeah you're trust-falling off the roof okay just concentrating on the wind wall that brings us up to percy go for it 15 just misses it hits the armor and it (ricochet noise) ricochets off the wind wall itself is not a full circle it's just a semi-circle it's currently overlapped with it yeah 22 to hit hits all righty and you have your third attack that hits as well 13 total okay so (doosh) the last two blasts hit him and you can see he almost gets thrown off his feet from the impact there's now blood trickling out from under his helmet from where one of the blasts got his chin one into his chest he's still standing up barely and he's still confused by this smoke that's swirling around him are you going to stay where you are right there up the stairs okay just ominously stepping up the stairway i like it that brings us to vax okay he's up above the banister so you probably have to-- no the idea is the banister rides up and there's a wall along it and then they're all up on the second floor here looking down at this you could leap up make an acrobatics check to leap up and over the banister yeah you jump grab it flip over land on the balcony next to the guy enveloped in smoke go for it no it's part of your movement 22 hits first two hit all right as you rush up the guard looking at you confused the smoke swirling around him (stabbing sounds) as the first two daggers stab in the second one actually finds between his ribs up to where his heart is and you see him gasp for a second as he crumples beneath your grip and you slide the blade out as he crumples to the ground (laughs) that is the dead button all right that ends your turn tylieri-- all right the mist pushes past he's going to use some action to move however as part of that then trinket is also in the wind wall as well just as a note so trinket will be taking bludgeoning damage for being within it so just as a heads-up in fact right now have trinket make a strength saving throw okay trinket takes 3d8 bludgeoning damage go ahead and roll 3d8 yeah i thought you were capturing him inside i didn't realize you had it actually on him and so having the wind wall on him to prevent him from moving would also have trinket in it yeah all right so that will make it actually more here so tylieri cannot break through tylieri stays there in mist form being caught in the whirlwind grog you're up yep all right yeah you can get up to there and you're just within reach to get one guy over the banister probably that hits more attacks all of them that was just your movement your barbarian 40 feet of crazy movement yep 12 does not hit (laughs) the first two hit all right 17 damage nice all right so (whack) the hammer comes streaking down slamming into the guard there his crossbow shatters from the impact and the flames begin to lick up the front of his body the second slam smacks him again this time you hear the armor ring out from the metal-on-metal impact he kind of shakes from it the third time you're just in the middle of this series of swinging and he backs up and you end up smashing the banister instead of him the hammer cracking part of the ground on the second floor he looks pretty messed up from that series of attacks all right that ends your turn grog it's now the guards' turn this guard's going to move over here they're all like oh god these three here are going to attempt to fire on trinket through the wind wall these two are going to fire at you grog and these two are going to longsword you they pull out their longswords this one's going to turn with his crossbow and fire at you vax so first is the attack at you with the crossbow that is a 20 you take-- ooh that's a ten-- 13 points of piercing damage as the bolt strikes you right in the chest cracking your sternum a little bit you're like (groans) that's going to suck you feel the scraping of the bone as it impacts the two with the longswords against you grog that is 18 that is a 12 both of the blades come at you one of them actually hits your shoulder but it just sticks an inch into the flesh and you just flex and the blade pops out the second one swings out and you duck your head out of the way and it (whoosh) goes long and you just grin through the anger that's awesome then these two are going to fire crossbows at you grog that is going to be a 15 and a 23 another ten 13 points of piercing damage half that to seven yeah and then now the three aiming at trinket they all have disadvantage i believe nothing can shoot through it at all at all yeah they automatically miss they all three fire through all bolts just (shhh) get scattered across the room wind wall that's awesome 50 feet long 15 feet high so it doesn't go all the way to the ceiling in fact it gets just a little bit past the second floor so it's about the height of the guys on the second platform that ends their turn vex you're up okay he goes to the front door all right interesting okay yeah which at this short distance is not a lot of strength to get the lob but if you're shooting up this way the wind wall itself only really encompasses the bottom of the foyer so if you go up the stairs a little bit you will be able to get these guys here yeah yeah you're going to hit all of them yep they should have a saving throw i believe right everyone make a dexterity saving throw or at least you two one guy makes the saving throw you all succeed one of the villains makes it and they both make it is it half-damage right that's what i'm saying this guy made it these two didn't are you doing it from this perspective these will go through the wind wall so the wind wall itself will prevent it from getting to either this guy will probably be hit actually he fails so yeah these guys are unaffected because the wind wall prevents the barrage from that point so just go ahead and roll damage correct 16 damage all right so it's half that for saves right all right so eight damage four damage okay (laughs) they're all pretty standard there's one dude over here that appears to be commanding them okay you hunter's mark him all righty he is hunter's marked all righty by the way the guy that grog had slammed the barrage (arrow impact) riddles him with arrows and he falls over and is like (gasps) and crumples to the ground the last bit of health that he had vex that's the end of your turn keyleth you're up all right and then what are you doing okay be warned treading thin ice with metagaming with your dm going forward but yes you have now heard it from percy i know that's fine this counts it's fine you heard percy say vampire taliesin and okay okay yeah that will be considered direct sunlight as you release the wind wall the mist immediately begins to push its way this way out of the room however you catch it your eyes glow and as you release your hand forward a blast of pure sun energy shoots forth from your hands you see it burning the back wall like a big thick laser and as the mist tries to escape you catch up to it and you hear this faint echoing screeching cry as the mist immediately is evaporated on impact (explosion noise) you can fill a pocket with ash if you like all righty percy you're up there you go sure 1d8 it's a plus-one rapier so it's 1d8 plus your dexterity modifier plus one so it would be plus seven for you right there all right one two three four five at that height you're going to have to leap up onto the second floor to get to him yeah so go ahead and make an acrobatics check if you want okay so there walk up the stairs go for it hits hits okay go ahead and roll damage so there you go so your third attack is to reload okay 16 all righty (gunshot) he is blasted out of place you can see there's a gaping hole across where one of his lungs was located and he (groans) crumples to the ground into a pile all righty you use a bonus action to re-curse him by the way that's right you do technically you used the bonus action this turn to put it onto him from the last turn you're probably going to do it on your next turn anyway so we'll just leave it there it's fine but keep that in mind as this is a new ability gesundheit laura and all right vax you're up yep 14 misses you are flanking him though you have advantage on the attack that hits i was like where's that that's the whole point of this (explosion noise) yeah the daggers cut through his midsection and you see where the armor plating itself was exposed from the first strike the last one you just jam up into his torso taking out any major organs (groans) he falls over (thudding) down the stairs past you percy you let him tumble by as he slides to a stop at the very bottom of the stairs okay vex stops him in place face-down there's a smear of his blood across the steps this once-nice fine wood is now completely coated in crimson (laughs) okay grog you're up yeah there are five nervous-looking guards right now that ends your turn it is now the guards' turn they all they look to each other and their one leader goes like men run they all rush and leap off the balcony try and catch themselves there okay three of them land fine and begin bolting forward two of them fall one of them (cracking noise) breaks his ankle and falls to the ground going (scream) the other one slams into his hip on the ground and falls prone these guys are prone these three continue to move forward to there they're going for a full dash against one of them he can only take one reaction per turn they all rush out all righty 27 hits go ahead and roll damage 11 points of damage across that guy okay trinket reaches out and strikes across one of the guys the guy you hunter's marked who takes the claw across the side of his head and you hear him yell out in pain (scream) as he makes it out into the rain hurt but not taken down he continues to run past and they all dart outside into the rainstorm (laughs) okay grog okay make an athletics check for the jump i'll give you advantage on this because you're raging and it's reckless and it's just funnier travis and 24 yeah you leap in the air (whoosh) like slow-motion (whoosh explosion) down on top go ahead and roll three attacks on him roll damage on those 29 on the first one okay so as you come down the hammer blow slams into his torso his actual metal armor crinks inward and he goes (screams) gasping in pain as you've now jammed his own ribs into his internal organs as you pull the hammer up with a sludgy sucking sound you see him look at you with this look of no and the hammer comes down again this time on top of his head which gallagher watermelon just (boosh) across the floor of this done you look over at his friend who is like (gasps) trying to back up with his broken ankle with your third attack he's within your range with advantage roll advantage just in case it's a critical okay there you go that hits even if you don't need the advantage it's nice to roll a second time in case because there's a chance of a natural 20 30 points of damage on him (whack) this one you actually bring down onto his other leg that leg snaps he's on his back and he's trying to pull away from you right on the knee (crack) it snaps underneath and he screams out in pain as the hammer pulls back you can see where the bone is jutting out you've actually taken off the lower half of his leg from the sheer bludgeoning force and he's now bleeding out onto the ground a little bit not as much as he would be because the flame cauterized the impact from the hammer he is in a really really bad place all righty vex you're up they're just out the front of the doors (giggles) timing is everything yeah that would hit all three all right you pull out your arrow you aim it close you can see the rain pouring down and they're all running out into the storm you're like storm that's interesting and you release against the guy you've hunter's marked yeah that'll hit yep okay this guy fails what's the dc on it it should be at the top of your spell sheet 15 okay second guy fails guy who's hunter's marked does succeed so he takes half damage on it okay the guy that trinket swiped just screams (pained scream) as you can see the electricity charging through him and the wet rain that hit him has caused it to even give more-- did he okay then i'll give you that so the guy who is hunter's marked ends up destroyed the electricity bouncing through his armor he goes (moan) and falls to the ground and crumples over the other two guys get jolted and almost knocked off their feet they're both looking really really rough and they both look at each other (panting) and just keep running with what little strength they have left you still have a second attack don't you go for it oh he's not going anywhere no it's a bonus action to cast it (zoomf) next arrow nocked 19 hits go ahead and roll damage 13 points of damage (zoomf) that guy is through the back of the head (zoomf groan) and just slides through the mud for another two feet make an intimidation check liam and watching his friend fall and slide in the mud he stops where he stands and looks over his shoulder slowly turning around shaking okay next up is keyleth are you going to do anything he's currently standing about ten feet outside in the rain just (shaky breathing) actually no there is no window to the front here it's just a wall you're going to sunbeam (laughs) okay what level is sunbeam what level is sunbeam how many 6th-level spells per day can you cast oh that's right you can do it for up to a minute good call all right so constitution save on him (laughs) no do damage 12 as he's standing in the rain shaking and looking at his friend and looking at you keyleth steps into frame and goes (boom) and before he can go wait and there's just this scattering of ash that was once was his body his armor is left intact and just tumbles to the ground in this pile you see smoke sizzling off the now-heated armor there's no sign of his physical body anymore just a smattering of mud that the ash has now mixed with in the rain outside melt with prejudice okay now as you guys are all gathering around we'll say from a roleplaying standpoint as there is no real immediate threat to you there is one guard left who has currently one broken ankle and one missing lower half of his left leg on the ground looking at you all hyperventilating and trying to back away like (panting) make a perception check 17 you can see a little bit of a dark stream in the distance you can't tell if it's a nearby chimney or if it is the symbol of scanlan the rainstorm does make it a little hard to see at this point and through the adrenaline pumping in your system and the fact that you just disintegrated two individuals in a short period of time you're also wrestling with the morality of that and dealing with what you just did so your concentration doesn't enable you to notice anything yet okay (panting) what do you want he looks around at the rest of the group sees you walk up the stairs (panting) they're in the bloody castle where else would they be i don't know i don't know they spend equal parts in both as far as i know no all of us who were here we were waiting for you the black smoke you mean oh yeah the black smoke is slowly trailing behind you with each step you take it licks the back of your boots go ahead and make an intimidation check with advantage because he has-- sam and he's bleeding out right now wait no he's not bleeding out he's bleeding but it's a trickle because of the cauterization 21 he gives you a look and says look we've all been working for the briarwoods they mean well they have big plans i know that i don't know the details of it they don't tell us but we're keeping guard on them we were supposed to stop this insurrection these people we rounded up folks we were given basic descriptions and we hung people against the sun tree as a warning we hoped it wouldn't come to any sort of conflict that you would take that as a means that you weren't supposed to be here but then we all saw what happened what happened to sir kerrion and his house and that meant that you were here and that you meant business so tylieri and vedmeyer we waited for a signal and we heard that you were planning an attack so we set up guards here and prepared and sure enough you showed up which let us know that our contacts are good and we thought that would be enough we didn't realize you'd be walking in with whatever the fuck this thing is i don't even know what you are and he looks genuinely frightened at the fact that you with all of these bolts sticking out of your body are still grinning above him nothing should have survived that ambush yeah as a warning (extended choking sounds) with a wet gurgle the life expires from his body a pool beginning to form on the tile below him yes (laughs) you begin
