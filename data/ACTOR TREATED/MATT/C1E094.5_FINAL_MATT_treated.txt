it's very weird from this perspective yeah you look about the same size to me we just lost jeff sessions as a fan sorry jeff oh no i don't know how do you do it liam yeah she showed up as dhalsim to a weigh-in it was like the best thing ever it was amazing like a very accurate outfit yeah when we did the charity drive where we played mansions of madness about a month or so ago one of the things that i said off-the-cuff was that if we got a certain point a certain donation list i'd do a two-hour hangout q and a and then brian foster said that if we make even more he'll do it in a silk robe well we hit both those goals we finally scheduled it i know yeah yeah you get to talk to him about that today (laughs) oh i ordered one it's awful it's going to be great it's red it's bright red it's heinous but next tuesday from 4 to 6pm here on the twitch channel it's going to be a date with me and the chat for two hours i'm going to have wine and a nice robe and it's going to be kind of like-- yeah we're going to figure that out i'm hoping to do that what was the christopher walken character with the wine i'm hoping it's something like that it's kind of what i'm going for but anyway during that time also i'm going to finally make up on those promises even on an older charity where i'm going to work with the chat to create an npc for critical role and create a possible future encounter (sings) you should not watch that at all you guys are banned from it or i'll kill your character (laughter) and then talks at 7pm yeah so it's going to be a nice little transition p-a-i-z-ocom oh yeah dude dude those structures are legit and just sold them in a box in the store like the whole internet explosion in media d&d yeah got more coming yeah you going to be here a while you know this is my first chance to actually do this to you and i keep getting completely swarmed by everyone else so it's good not from me no i had a good one fuck them they can die it's great (laughter) you're doing good keep going (sings) crit role babies it's time to play some shit you were butters stotch it'll be me so i don't get a chance to play (laughter) we'll just go through your imdb and just pick the right time okay try and garrote it what age is this about okay so yeah glasses nearing a mullet and it looks like a hawaiian shirt it's more like a bowling shirt with a cool-looking anime dragon on it yeah that's straight up yeah that's about as accurate as you'll ever get oh travis i'm still inside the flower huh what i don't like this nightmare (laughter) sure so i'm taking my glasses off i'm like okay so-- what i can't (laughter) oh jeez (yells) they do it she got a ten that's a 19 that was the coolest thing i ever did at this age guys i'm glad you were here to witness it what okay that's the coolest thing to happen to me at this age this was not a good age actually i really don't-- that's skinless that's skinless you spent far too long roleplaying as grog and it's starting to rub off onto him yeah i didn't have friends i helped people with homework and then they said thank you i did say that yeah that's why i said no she's supposed to live a long time guys scary creature animal sound-- can i search around i want to see if there's anything that could be possibly used as a weapon what an obnoxious annoying kid yeah totally what if everybody else we've ever known was turned into a tree and we're in a jungle pulling their fingers off i'm going to grab taliesin and wield him as a weapon yeah i don't until everyone else starts-- i immediately drop taliesin and rush over to make sure she's okay just like when i was 12 i can't do anything right as he starts running can i use friends to try and ask him to not leave okay so i'm going to go ahead-- actually i don't have time since he's going to bolt instead i'm just going to go ahead and use a persuasion check i'll try and persuade him so i say travis don't go please you leave now we all die we need you now's the time to become the man you eventually will be this would be my persuasion-- it's really up to you if he wants to resist it then yeah sure 23 oh natural 20 that's crazy i'm sitting in taliesin's seat i just realized ooh a 19 22 you still have your action and your bonus actually as a monk you should be able to use-- at level one-- that's true oh i'm sorry yeah you can still use an action if you wanted to go into your dodge action which any attacks against you-- i'm helping out anyone can use their action to make a dodge action so instead of attacking you basically just get really defensive and then attacks against you have disadvantage i'm going to move ahead and start getting closer to back up marisha but i'm going to move a little bit behind her because she's tougher than i am and that one that's kind of off to the right that one right there i look over as i approach and be like hey cat have you seen the kind of shit she can do oh look your friend over there he went ahead and fell down already he was twice as big as you you're going to die in a second fool i was going to use vicious mockery on that guy so let's see has to make a wisdom saving throw it's not on my sheet but that would be with the math there-- proficiency bonus of plus two plus my charisma which is three so the dc would be 13 that's okay that happens i'm like mocking cats is a bad idea save me can i use the rest of my movement to stand directly behind marisha this is absolutely brilliant ooh you're rolling good tonight roll disadvantage because he said it (laughter) that's okay she rolled higher on the second one see what's the first one in case you kill it the first hit behind her i go nice second one i go no ooh that's right well there's the one still next to her all right you know what i'm going to go ahead and say don't worry baby i'll take care of you in about ten years or right now we'll do that now healing word bonus action so you heal five hit points thanks i look over at the cat as she's saying this the cat is in front of her going (snarling noise) okay we're dead i'm going to walk up and try and do what she did try and kick at it i move up base to base right against her shoulder and just (screams) screaming probably think i'm going to hurt myself more than the creature trying and that is a four i'm proud of myself because that looks just like it does when i practice it when i'm home alone when i turn around and see this tiny bowl haircut blond kid from the omen just glowing marisha who are we fighting i don't know who we're fighting anymore okay sweat just pouring down his face we are straight-up the kids from it right now by the way which me being two feet away (splashing noise) that's still pretty cool he spent a long time trying to keep away from old guys in the woods so he knows how to track them well tracking would be survival because you're awesome trying to clean my perpetually fogging glasses because of the humid weather the guy was pretty old if we keep going we can probably catch up to him because he's probably not very fast that's all i got is this the future we're looking at i start getting a nosebleed well if there's any building in this vicinity that lasts through time it's the bob's big boy yeah (whispering) that's so cool what you look all right i'm pretty spent right now we're all going to die i follow marisha because she's the biggest what so even-- (laughs) so do i know what this is okay me as matt mercer even at 12 matt mercer-- (laughs) oh great that's great four so you guys know in stranger things that the big monster they keep talking about gremlins can go in the water yeah there's no good answer here i can't tell you my initiative's four go i'm too scared in fact if we weren't halfway in the ocean you would see the soak marks on the front of my jeans yeah (screams) it's what you rolled you've been hoarding cocoa puffs okay so being both a bard and being a kid that both as an adult and in that age spent a lot of free time alone reading monster manuals and cryptozoology books can i possibly see if i recognize any sort of nature to this creature any sort of religious context to it or any idea where it may have come from okay seeing as how ashley already seems to be the one that's on the right track i'm going to begin to step towards the water using a bonus action i'm going to go ahead and give her bardic inspiration and be like ashley continue to prove your savagery (laughter) chew deep and revel in the insanity as this day we prove our mettle against the force of darkness yes yeah my glasses right are now are like every classic anime teacher it's just too fogged where you can't see the eyes it's just a straight white glare i step out of the water towards this entity and say oh great demogorgon deity from upon the abyss who brings its hordes to the shoreline we are but humble servants prostrate before you granting you the power we have to offer as we ourselves traverse across many worlds we have much gifts to grant you and follow you to the ends of this plane not so great seven you got this ashley which is the echo we hear in our minds we don't hear out loud as she's nothing but a hairy smear giant arm tentacle arm you're wearing her like a scarecrow she's puppeteering you like a skeksis you're a henson puppet well i've spent the entirety of the last six seconds just staring at the place on the ground where marisha was crushed so i haven't really been paying attention loosely paying attention to ashley rummaging through her remains and then wearing them like a wintertime jacket but my fists are clenched they're shaking the tears are streaming down my face and whatever plan we had is out the window and i just rush towards the demogorgon screaming (screams) and i'm going to thunderwave him so he needs to make a constitution saving throw i don't fucking care about sam right now i just want to hurt this thing constitution i'm just like tears down my face just (screaming) you made it he succeeds that is 13 13 thunder damage as my bonus action on my turn i now realise that i accidentally hit sam and i'm like sam we have to end this now let's do this and you get an inspiration die d6 she takes the nope action (laughter) yeah on the ropes man on the ropes you can add your inspiration dice if you want oh you probably shouldn't you should hold off on that save it for the next-- oh wait well dex or strength would be plus two you're not proficient with it so plus two to whatever you rolled she has that much control all right staring this thing down my eyes-- i can't see anything because the water so i rip the glasses off the front of my face and throw them behind me on the beach and staring up at it i say i know everything about you i've seen your pictures i've read every single aspect of your existence and here's the fun part when it all comes down to it you're just a figment of some fat guy's imagination vicious mockery nice that's-- well it makes a wisdom saving throw well my dc is 13 yeah yeah that's a sensitive place ten you fall just in time to see this floating taliesin go (wind whooshing) that would suck so bad that'll kill you all righty probably oh what chat will get it [break] congrats (cheering) jump right in motherfucker i just sam and inspire bill beemer now this has become her nightmare as this is happening i walk up to neil i'm like by the way i know we've met a number of times but i just wanna tell you it's a great pleasure to finally have an opportunity to work with you (laughter) is it general t-pose or a-t-pose okay t-pose guys wait the federation is crumbling you know that everyone on this ship knows it you can't stop the inevitable cass well what's it gonna be cass all right t-pose the federation is crumbling you know that everyone on this ship knows it you can't stop the inevitable cass yeah it is i love that it has the volume tape and everything it's so good i feel like you have to give him that after this now 18 aw buddy yeah yeah just looking around at the ground these things are made of cables are there loose slack cables that were once attached to the cameras okay i'm gonna move slightly around and towards the consoles a bit grabbing whatever looks to be longest most slack non-attached wire-- and i'm gonna grab it and throw it up over the scaffolding that holds the various mocap cameras there grab the other side and look back to marisha and be like help me pull this onto it and start backing up towards her the rest of my movement holding the cables that are wrapped around the scaffolding trying to pull the scaffolding onto it yeah no this is a familiar duality here i have a plan what are you-- okay as you do that i'm like i told you to-- my dick's in the wind here somebody help me yeah the cables have wrapped around the scaffolding that holds the mocap cameras and trying to pull it down onto the large imc to pin it you still have your bardic inspiration yeah it's not focus-fire to be fair he wrote this so well if it's like the hardcover cast stuff then yeah that could actually be substantial yes well i used all my spells in the previous battles yeah okay well that changes things well first i'm gonna go ahead and say it's all right ashley you've spent a lot of time in this volume before you're still the queen of it so i'll give you a healing word with my bonus action and that's a five you heal five and i'm gonna go ahead so the leg that broke off i'm gonna go ahead and rush over to pick it up and like a giant metal baseball bat swing back and try and hit back at it with its own leg so it's like (yells) not very good with it is this at disadvantage i'm not proficient-- all right so we'll say-- that's a 19 natural two for strength that is a two plus two four damage trying to hit one of the other legs yeah yeah i'm not going for the core i'm just going for its means of attack at the end of my turn i shout just 'cause i'm really curious let's not kill it yet but definitely disable it on the snitch well on your snitch yeah that's an actual natural 20 the led light that's always in our face fill out your 1089 before you go 'cause when it moved back it was not in melee range-- i like it cool velcro bodysuits don't offer a lot of armor class protection okay is that me right next to the-- right there okay if i can take two steps to get right up to the edge of where it emerged from the floor and glance inside what do i see below yeah i'm going to if i can move along-- move from your perspective this way two more squares and then jump across that little bit of the gap that's there no right there's where i wanna stand and i'm gonna go ahead and use thunderwave in front of me to try and blast them back and do damage as i rush forward i jump across the way and go (hesitant noises) and i realize that we probably have a pa system set up and i grab the microphone on the edge of the head thing and just go (screams) as loud as i can into the microphone thinking that they probably have a feedback set up in the cameras so that's a constitution saving throw for both of them 13 okay so that would be ten points of thunder damage or half on a successful save so they're not pushed but they take five points of thunder damage each i'll use my last five feet of movement to try and then move alongside of the crack away from the currently still standing there creature yeah that is a crack so i'd say just one away from the crack you got this your movement's 30 didn't liam just get-- that's what it was when you said travis help you were straight-up neo trinity help the great nda in the sky the draw's too strong for the crafty room i hope it's like a resident evil movie-style just laser hallway and you just walk through and-- yep none of us know we all just one by one plow through how much damage did she take did she take any damage or is she good good awesome all right seeing all this going down-- i'm going to-- she's got that one i'm going to make 30 feet towards taliesin while shouting out liam are you okay i'm going to as i look over at taliesin facing off with the creature i'm like you're adorable and you've got this you've adorably got this i'm giving you an insipiration die a d6 and i'm going to dash up towards the ramp in the back corner just to see what remains of liam okay like he has a few minutes left to live or no it's fucking chef boyardee okay yeah okay all right well that's definitely the end of my turn all righty bye everyone wow ha i've absorbed his power for the evening (cackles) you've got this travis taliesin earlier she used hers in the last battle seeing liam shredded seeing them fumble with this thing i take a full movement in the direction of the larger creature there yeah and i go hey computer stop all the downloading you've been vague and not helpful to any of us that makes you a bad computer that's my vicious mockery yeah i'm angry it's been completely unhelpful even if it is liam you've got lcd screens at your disposal and you're giving us vague hints no fuck that noise make a wisdom saving throw 13 i cannot do anything there's nothing it does nothing to it i see no reaction my gusto fails and i go help computer (laughter) actually no at the end of my turn i turn back to taliesin and go yeah but seriously do something come on you worked with spielberg asshole i give you my last inspiration die the crack in the hole demogorgon left an impact on her man i feel like if we would have had a good sponsor tonight it would have been backblaze a fantastic service for backing up your information this is some lawnmower man shit well i see everyone else booking in that direction and most of the danger on the other side of the room is gone so i'm going to go ahead and continue that way as well full movement and as that's happening and as taliesin's facing off against the one standing camera i'm going to be like hey by the way the rest of your equipment was shitty i guess that means you are too vicious mockery see if something will fail a saving throw yay (singing) it takes four psychic damage in a shower of sparks as taliesin's on the other side of the camera i just say sometimes you've just got to remind them that's my turn you guys i think we lost travis yeah get behind sam that's true we still have battery packs don't we let's keep going maybe after a minute (heavy breathing) does anyone have some water i hate pe for very specific reasons i know i was working on it when i ended up here to be fair it's making me feel a lot better about spending time doing that okay let's go okay riegels first does there appear to be any other exit in the room or is it just the chamber that we've entered now i walk up next to sam and put my hand on the glass and just say liam we missed you too but did you do all this yeah i put my hand on the glass of the cylinder i'm looking towards his face on the side no in the glass i know it's on the wall but i'm focusing on the cylinder okay my hand still on the glass column i say liam how do you spell farmhouse (laughter) but perhaps this mistake can be corrected if you're able to focus hard enough to tear through time and space are you able to send us back to a time before you were taken yeah it's still our liam no there has to be a way there has to be an alternative if you can alter time paths if you can actually tear us from different realities does it only work forward can you send us backward as well if you're the lynchpin in this do you have the ability to send us back to the time you had pulled us from originally then try at least if you haven't calculated that but you're able to tear through time could you try and send us back we could still close the lynchpin no we do not strike that's what i'm trying well if he-- here's the thing unplugging him or destroying him here as far as we understand may not have an effect on a time loop circumstance or at least it's not going to change reality from where it was he's bending and destroying the fabric or is able to pull us across realities that ability still stands i want to implore once more and i step forward to the cylinder putting both hands on it and trying to wherever the currently-wandering gaze of liam is in there i put both hands up my red hawaiian shirt soaked with sweat mist in the air and probably dampened a bit with tears across my lapel i look up and try to meet the gaze and say trust us if you're better to have known us send us back where we can know you again and fix this before it happens laura family just about crewmember 1 all right take are you ready crewmember 2 all right ready to go live crewmember 1 all right denise count them in liam let no one tell you you're talented or special holy shit i can't believe you maintained that voice for that long that was amazing and let this be a point of inspiration for any of you burgeoning dms out there that's exactly the point you are always frightened to death to do it but you have to pull the trigger and jump in anyway because magic happens i love you man that was amazing thank you
