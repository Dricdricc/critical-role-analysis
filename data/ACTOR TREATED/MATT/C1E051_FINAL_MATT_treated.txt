the western one the western gate the western gate the western gate (laughing) right right i'll let him know and he just leaves doesn't even touch the door he just bolts out the back (laughing) okay you gonna hold off that is 83 damage to them and if i look at the sheets here nope just pushes them okay that's and then that does 14 points of damage landing on the other ones it's awful looking down there would be terrible right now that hits let's go ahead and roll damage on that one uh that's 13 points of piercing damage 13 points of piercing damage uh yeah i'll say the next time i hit a creature with a ranged weapon i rolled a 27 yeah so right now you're aiming at them all in the hole from your perspective they're gonna have three-quarters cover so that-- i just need to hit the one that's closest to the top right what's your total roll on that 27 27 yeah even with the three-quarters cover that'll still hit okay so go ahead and roll damage on that is everyone still standing by the way no both the ones that were standing got pushed into the hole by gun blasts from behind shoved into the large open chasm beneath them 26 damage oh i'm dead that's when i roll a natural one that would be when i do it brilliant 29 hits 29 yep okay good one all right okay yeah usually your bonus action you've already used your turn to hold your action but as he goes forward the dagger sinks right into his sternum and he kind of (grunts) and still using his momentum goes forward as you're dragging it it's gonna go two strikes against you uh 13 make an intimidation check (laughing) i mean the area where they are as you glance back yeah there doesn't appear to be any current set whoever was set to go to that side of the gate to check it out-- (sneezes) sorry what did you get it's pretty quick it's pretty easy it would be like an action what do you want to do i'd like to use my mace which i'll allow because he's not defending anything it's just like a bonus action i say go for it advantage on the attack ok 16 16 hits because it is a melee against a currently paralyzed individual it is considered a critical hit nice 18 so double the dice and then add the bonus on top of it 23 23 nice so as you pull the whip out with one hand you crack the mace right into the face of the halfling to the point where you hit and you have to kind of like get the elbow lift to pull it free (laughter) face is kinda caving a little bit ninja scroll style and he's kind of like twitching still conscious no that's awful make it unconscious so you get 20 that hits go ahead and roll damage and it's a critical hit one d8 so it's two d8 plus three it's one d6 sonic damage which is also doubled do i roll twice or do i just-- not double this you roll- twice you roll two d8 the sonic damage okay 21 points of damage as you fumble the blade and cover your eyes as you pull back the blade the slight humming sound (hums) the blade actually kind of vibrates in place and as you thrust forward it goes through like butter with a heated blade you know you think you missed then you open and peek through your eyes and see that you went straight though his face (laughter) like you hit nothing the face the skull you can if you want to i'll check the elf yeah where the noise came from as the elf who continues to walk forward with you is back you good hmm (laughter) i got a two oh no (laughter) you've used dimension door twice now today that's the third as you guys are bickering go backwards away from them 34'ed up all right and you backed around the way they step in and begin to kind of split up a little bit you come back around and you can head back to the thoroughfare and continue to follow or find them up on the roof what are you going to do i'm going to follow so i can try to see grog but stay hidden so you're going to head back onto the road and duck between alleyways on your own okay so you can do that way kind of essentially tracking back around as they entered and pass them as they're spreading out into the alleyways most of you guys are up on the roof now and keyleth you just kind of watch them as they move past and eventually just kind of (imitates wind) behind them where do you want to go what they've moved past you yeah they did not notice make a perception check all righty so laura and yes they are you guys are watching this happen yep pretty much (laughter) all right so where are you guys right now you're watching this happen from a distant rooftop right at the edge right so you are currently in elemental form kind i kind of attempt to actually get on the roof over there if you want to it's going to be this isn't a mist form this is your air elemental form or yeah air elemental form but i can move through things right so you want to just glide into like part of the stonework over here or so whereabouts are you guys at this moment just give me some inclination keyleth is over there keeping relatively hidden as an air elemental i need you to make a stealth check as part of that see if you're noticed natural 20 that i like figure out where you're hiding are we coming from behind there or from this side so you'll be kind of up in this-- over there there is i'm going to put this off to the side there if you'd like to maneuver in this area as well for those who want to be on this side who wants to be up there with vex all right you as kevdak takes on a large form the blood ax swelling with his size gets into a combat position and he says show me what you've learned strongjaw you're going first you beat him on initiative go for it all right so that's your action on that so what's the dc on that one and what's the save yeah okay so as you glare how do you go about this glare what do you do to intimidate him i go into a rage and with my flaming war hammer i grab the end of the hammer and let it cook my flesh for a minute and then i smack myself on the chest and rip out the biggest bellow i have as you do kevdak goes to take a step forward takes the single step hesitates seems to just hold his ground eyeing you down and seemingly not expecting this ferocity all righty that's your action and your bonus are you going to move or are you going to stay where you are there are no openings in the ring right okay technically the rage is the bonus action but you can shout that for free yeah that's fine all right so for kevdak's turn kevdak kind of realizing that he can't he's not able to really move closer at this moment kind of steps to the side here guarding kind of waiting yeah he's going to go ahead and take a bonus action to go into his own rage i just had to try and make it work at least once you're up grog raging i'll go into a frenzied rage and i charge headlong into kevdak with my firebrand war hammer he's backed up against the edge of one of the openings but if you want to go from here but there's large point-ies behind him right what's the range on that but i believe that ends your turn unless you want to move nope no moving make a stealth check how are you getting down are you climbing down via acrobatics so make a stealth and acrobatics check 29 for stealth and 25 for acrobatics okay you manage to make it to the ground kind of jumping off the side parkouring down grabbing the next ledge leaping down that's your turn okay anybody else doing anything until we come back in the next round sure you come to the door and the door itself is not locked you kind of just push on the side of the door everyone's attention is so focused on the center all right so that brings it to the top of the round grog you're up feeling the impact of those hits and remembering our first encounter i drop the firebrand war hammer i rush kevdak and i want to try and rip away the blood ax okay you rush up and drop the hammer grab and you're face to face it's right at your feet you reach up and grab with your fingers just barely wrapped around this ax's shaft right now at the size that it's swollen and you pull against him i want you to go ahead and make a strength check yeah versus his strength which he gets advantage on 17 natural 20 why don't you make an athletics check yes you do because of the rage 19 19 well 22 he puts the ax to one hand reaches down with his large mitt grabs you and lifts you up and pushes you onto one of the spears behind you you can feel it actually pierce out the front of your chest (group groans) about six inches your feet are still on the ground and you can feel yourself there but there is an element of being pinned there you take 12 points of piercing damage reduced to six this is nothing to a barbarian simple piercing whatever however you are technically considered this would be grappled you're unable to move until you manage to break this you can still attack from this position if you wanted to but you have to be able to try and spend an action to get free so that's going to be the one attack and then as your pinned he's going to come up with the blood ax and swing down that's going to be a 23 against you blood ax comes down and slams right into the front of your chest the sternum area even with the weight of it you bring your hands up and grab the edge of it and manage to stop some of the force but it still digs into the front of your chest you take 19 points of slashing damage reduced to 9 i release trinket inside the house that i'm in what are you doing i release trinket quietly inside the house and tell him to keep quiet don't follow me okay anyone else do anything else yeah would that be at disadvantage okay so using an action to break free yeah 23 there's not a lot of ground to pull yourself off of the weight so instead with your feet on the ground you reach forward and grab the front of his blood ax again and pull forward and as you do you feel the back of this wooden spear snap off and it's still just embedded in your chest poking out the front but you are now free you still have your bonus action i would like to use great weapon master and i have advantage on this because he used reckless it faded it only lasts for ten minutes 23 okay so you shift around that way okay with his turn now he spins around to face you he's going to go ahead and attempt his first attack on you as a disarming attack with advantage on that because just going with this attack every round that's going to be a 30 with rage is it strength ability checks and saving throws advantage on strength check and strength saving throws 13 no no no 16 all righty so you take from the actual blow 21 points of slashing damage reduced to ten and five necrotic i'm going to use my stone's endurance it's already on your side actually he disarmed you no not my arms no we're taking photos i'm leaving this here for next week so we can have this up and ready for us to jump back in if you guys want to keep going we can go to midnight on it's up to you but it's a thursday night yeah that's rough where are you at hit points wise 133 i've got four (laughter) not really where does the other totem shine in damage dealing probably frenzy's all about damage and that's what grog's playing anyway guys we'll pick this up next week at whatever this is about to be and i have no idea what this is about to be with cameras and stuff though we'll have cameras and stuff here yeah hopefully functional cameras
