tonight's episode leading up to where we are currently in the story vox machina having spent a period of time battling with the chroma conclave a collection of evil and allied chromatic dragons that terrorized the tal'dorei countryside have acquired artifacts called the vestiges of divergence after traversing the planes and locations to gather allies they made war on the current occupying armies of thordak the cinder king in the center of the capital city of emon managed to eke out a victory destroying thordak and apparently go into battle with a dragon they'd made an alliance with known as raishan the diseased deceiver a member of the conclave with which they had a very tenuous agreement to work together after being nearly killed by raishan as she flew the coop essentially you managed to collect the remaining armies of the city made sure everyone was okay you ran into an old friend from westruun kerrek who had brought a number of his able-bodied warriors with him to aid in this battle you then made your way to whitestone with kerrek to ascertain the location of raishan the diseased deceiver of which apparently she had absconded to what's called the island of viskon it used to belong to a necromancer and then briefly became the lair of thordak the cinder king before his original attack on tal'dorei roughly 16 years ago you then gathered your weapons your armor and your reserve strength and with a couple of allies traversed through teleportation all the way to this island managed to battle your way through a deep dungeon that once this necromancer called home going past traps and chasms filled with undead and gravity reversed through magical means you made your way into a small tunnel just past this area into what seemed to split into two sides behind that what appeared to be the necromancer's sanctum some sort of necrotic laboratory where you discovered there within two of the eggs of thordak's lair that were taken by raishan the corpse of thordak folded in the corner and apparently raishan's female human form currently poring through books and rummaging through what currently appears to be the relatively untouched necropolis chamber so last we left off the two twins had snuck ahead to take a look and take in the information of this vicinity while the rest of the party began to slowly approach from behind as the rest of the party is coming behind i would like everybody else to make a stealth check please i don't believe you cast it did you you've lost concentration since then great she has disadvantage because of her armor roll again well no she put on the elven boots didn't she that's right so yeah roll again four one step 30 you guys are still on the same stealth roll as last time you're fine grog 13 trinket's still in your necklace he is all right so as you guys turn the corner on the right side of this hallway you saw this laboratory filled with bookshelves chains candelabras on the walls a large door across the back wall there are two pillars in the center of the room that are strewn with various magical engravings you see this bunch of books scattered across the ground pulled out of the bookcase and there's one that's opened against this book-holding platform you see two cages in the back of each corner that seem to contain some sort of slumped corpse or body of some kind it's hard to see in the low light of this room because the only light you're getting is from the candelabras in the space there you see the woman with long dark green hair silverish pale skin robes piercing eyes of yellow and emerald as the rest of your party catches up from behind you with the ever-so-subtle sounds of metallic footfalls and plated armor against plated armor the female figure seems unfazed by it and just continues to turn a page and grab another book takes a book and reads a passage of it and throws it off in the corner there's a pause before the female figure stops and still facing away begins to speak out into the air of the room well you certainly proved quicker than i anticipated but i unfortunately have business here and i would kindly ask you all to leave the conclave has served its purpose as you have served yours we have nothing more to discuss turns another page of the book and continues facing away sure make a perception check okay glancing about even with your low-light vision the halls here are roughly 20 to 25 feet wide and about as much in height as well 25 to 30 feet tall carved arches you don't see any other alcoves or hidden spaces it appears to be just this figure in this room amongst the rotting corpse of thordak and the two eggs tossed to the side right correct okay so as you hear these words echoing through the hallway around you the rest of the group the tension rising you watch as just through a quick glance each ally in the room their bodies just instinctually tighten their muscles getting ready for anything at this point in time you close your eyes and focus on the presence around you you do not sense anything no celestials no fiends no undead they're still this far back nobody has-- this is where you guys stopped upon the discussion happening so the twins are still up ahead the rest of the party is halfway through this unit here the actual chasm ends over on this side here and this is the entranceway with the fountain you had discovered that's about as close to middle as she can get right now what's the range on beacon of hope 30 feet all right so that would get that would be everybody everybody is currently under the effect of beacon of hope is it a perpetual radius of her or does it affect each person at the time of casting okay yes that's correct all of you guys have this effect on you as long as she maintains concentration so keep tabs on maximum healing and wisdom saves and death saves okay in the time it's taken you guys to deliberate and discuss this and the long awkward pause that's transpired after raishan said the previous thing she did her voice picks up once again and says whereabouts is your brass pet no response you can get there right there yeah there all righty i did actually i discovered thordak's original intent before the soul anchor drove him insane and he lost sight of his purpose well it appears that it holds the same answer that i've been seeking as well so in a word yes perhaps still facing away you see the shoulders shift with a chuckle i would not dare touch such a piece it is far too dangerous the soul gem is destroyed it is of no use to me around this way okay have trinket roll a stealth check if you could being a big bear to how far okay currently you are in a space to get three people in your area you could either move forward with them or if you wish to push forward on your own you are currently not visible okay kima is going to follow along with grog and trinket allura feels the lack of magical force on this side is going to follow up behind you guys as well even with her hood up she gives you a glance like-- well of course i am that's part of the reason scanlan the dog hops out i'll use this badger for the time being i couldn't find an actual dog figure it still works fine okay all right at this point the air itself is still very still and the closer you get to this as you approach the smell of decay is as overwhelming as it was in the chasm that you crossed before raishan continues to speak and says you may also come to notice a curiosity about this island that explains a lot of the legends around it sadly the pressures of time left me forgetting until i arrived which has limited my options i had only used the glyph once before years ago but it is as it is so i ask you once again we made a deal you rescinded on that deal and punishment was required you survive only by my grace and your stubborn need to cling to your insignificant lives regardless i have what i sought now and i offer you this opportunity to leave freely decline and you choose your resting place here away from your loved ones to be forgotten and join the undying dregs of a long-passed madman's fancy you bump into the shoulders-- okay so you step out of the shadows okay you would be about there kima sneaks up behind you trinket follows up behind there and allura stays just to one side there good i'm glad i could enlighten and inspire in these final moments you know nothing about me child nothing she turns around for the first time to meet your eyes and you can see the gleam of bright sickly yellow and dark deep emerald green for pupils as she turns with a slight smile just curling across her porcelain skin you've had my attention since you entered this place you aren't the subtlest of adventurers so what is it you've come here to speak on your enlightenment and die or do we wish to maintain the agreement we had go our own separate ways-- the dog looks around no that makes us even then does it not okay the book that she currently had in her hands closes in her grasp as her eyes don't flicker or shift or blink from your connection she looks to you with her chin raised a bit you act as though the laws of the anthill affect the foot that crushes it you speak words of importance but i've seen laws and people come and go change die turn to dust and rise again people kill neighbor families die from the inside and out you see i'm diseased but look upon you you insignificant creatures you do more to your own people than i've done in an entire lifetime you are truly not intending to leave me be are you well that is such an unfortunate disposition on your part interestingly enough-- and she thumbs a couple of pages in the next book closes it and throws it to the side my needs do happen to call for a handful of powerful magic-users and there are proper tools within these caverns to keep you in line so we shall call your foolishness kismet very well okay what do you do so as you guys are casting the spell and she's saying this raishan responds with i shall relish closing the final chapter on your brief pitiful tales and beginning a fresh new chapter of my own as you guys both mark the spell has no effect takes no root in the space you maintain concentration but nothing was marked there is nothing there physical what are you doing aside from rolling initiative which i think probably would be a good thing to do right now so let's go ahead and roll initiative now correct (laughs) so folks initiative tracking going down now we have 25 to 20 25 24 21 22 all right 20 to 15 pike got eight keyleth what did you get kerrek just dex bonus correct okay so we have all righty so top of the round currently vax what are you doing you see nothing now you just see the apparently not-physically-there humanoid form of raishan still standing on the opposite side two eggs here and the corpse over here okay sure okay sure the eggs have not taken a turn in the combat yet vax'ildan the egg assassin that hits (trailer voice) prepare to be scrambled 18 hits 14 okay first two these eggs are caught unaware succeeds with a natural 17 i mean it still takes the full sneak attack damage and it is not poisoned a total of so as you rush past and careening around the corner throwing these three daggers out to the side the first one just smacks into the side and the egg which had already been previously damaged structure-wise by a somewhat resistant but still impactful burst of druidic magic energy in the previous conflict the first dagger cuts through like a hot knife through butter out the side of the egg you watch as the shell on the other side just scatters causing this splatter of some sort of thick liquid against the wall the other two daggers one just careens off to the side the second one that does impact continues and causes the egg to actually crack and fold in on itself causing it to leak out the side of the shell as it collapses in on itself somewhat so that egg there i will mark as currently--destroyed there you go that one is destroyed all right does that end your turn okay next up is vex make a perception check 30 glancing around you in the current space that is definitively an illusion and in fact the way it shimmers-- and you look at the books that it was using and messing with while you were keeping more of an eye on the area you notice now that the books that she dropped just vanished it was all part of the illusion definitely not there but you don't see anything around you that resembles a hidden or stealthed dragon-sized creature what else would you like to do with your turn right here attack it so you're holding your attack action in case something moves okay cool percival still on this back wall here okay that hits all righty the first shot hits you see the front of the egg spider-crack inward like how you shot in the thordak battle but the egg still holds firm as you begin loading for your next shot you watch as part of the egg begins to crack outward like something's pushing out from the inside of the egg 16 to hit with its armor that probably won't hit unfortunately the bullet ricochets off the outside of the hardened eggshell and just (ricochet sound) you destroyed the egg you threw them all simultaneously at a single egg sure buddy go for it do it ricochets off again with the second shot you tear the top half of the egg off as it goes splattering to the side of it you can watch as what looks to be some sort of a very very young primordial dragon like the ones that you had yanked out of the eggs before that was trying to pull its way out of the egg slumps lifelessly over the side of the egg you destroyed that's awful you've used all your action and your bonus action what are you looking for this center wall here this would be an investigation check 23 glancing over across the way best you can tell the wall appears to be solid and is an actual natural barrier in the cavern so that ends your turn at the end of percy's turn the human figure across the way with the dark green hair gives a deep bow and then vanishes from the field the dog turns around and faces this direction and starts barking you just hear (heavy footsteps) and then suddenly (flapping wings) there's suddenly a torrent of wind blowing within the area as something is disturbing the air quite heavily so that's that that's going to be the end of raishan's turn yeah you all of a sudden hear the mastiff barking over and over again in this direction but you don't see anything a little bit scanlan it's your turn this is vex that's pike you can take your d12 inspiration all righty all right so yeah 20-foot radius so you create this area here and obscures it so currently this whole tunnel is just filled with fog you have no vision beyond the outside of it right where you are it may all right that ends your turn scanlan all right grog your turn okay you get right up to it yeah yeah you can hold it with two hands if you'd like yeah all right roll for it sure you didn't need it but go for it natural 20 (all laugh) how do you want to do this grog as you leap in the air using the momentum of your leap you smash the dwarven thrower down onto the already partially-destroyed skull of thordak's corpse the skull immediately caving inward with the force of the blow as it hits and curves inward it releases this sudden burst of heavy ash into your face that fills your lungs and burns your eyes and you cough as you pull back you try and wedge the hammer out and as you do you can see there is actual molten rock still dripping off the outside of the hammer any sort of general normal unenchanted metal would probably be slightly bowing or melting in the presence of such heat it looks like even in its dead state after a day of rest thordak's corpse still maintained some sort of internal volcanic life as it slowly subsided but the skull is destroyed you see bits of the upper palate just scattered like bone chunks across the stonework of the floor stopping at the outside of one of the cages thordak's head is thoroughly destroyed but you're welcome to if you'd like okay how far can you leap all right go for it all right so you (leaping sound) not as far as you'd like but that egg is staring you down there is an unmoving baby dragon corpse that is-- you've got a date with your hammer go for it (all laugh) yeah advantage all your attacks are reckless man that hits go ahead and roll damage yeah plus an additional d8 because you threw it it's part of the enchantment of the hammer 26 total the currently-lifeless limp corpse of this nearly-hatched primordial dragon-- whatever this new entity was through the merger of the power of the soul anchor in the fire elemental plane and thordak the ancient red dragon this remaining dragonkin-- is turned into red oatmeal against the table and the stone wall behind it well done grog you're good all right at the end of your turn-- let's see here scanlan you feel a strange warm sensation in your chest-- also at the end of your turn grog or as soon as your turn ends you hear this (undead inhale) strange sucking breath-like sound (laughing) make a perception check five you are talking fervently at your hammer please-- that'll do it the time you're focusing on the hammer you aren't paying attention to your surroundings until you just see the shadows coalescing closer to you than you expect and by the time you look up you watch as two black smoked wraith-like entities that had slowly pulled themselves out of the two cages on the sides have shifted beside and lashed out at you 19 to hit they have advantage against you i forgot so 19 and the other hit is two and a 22 so both hit you all righty you suffer 21 points of necrotic damage from the first hit and 20 points of necrotic damage so a total of 41 points of necrotic damage i need you to make two constitution saving throws you have advantage on wisdom this is a constitution save hero's feast isn't constitution it's wisdom you're at minus two to everything and the second hit all right so your maximum hit points are also reduced by 41 as both of the wraiths drain the life force out of you their claws rake through your body like it's nothing and as they pull back you feel the breath sucked from your lungs and you instinctually cough for a second almost stumbling to one knee as both the wraiths chuckle at the side of your face all righty kerr you watched this happen over here as well as seeing the fog cloud suddenly fill the opposite side of the cavern and for a brief moment you're-- you feel like you're a little bit out of your element but you click in and your combat sense kicks in what do you want to do yeah you have five ten 15 20 25 you can get right-- you can go 30 and get right next to both of them if you'd like up to you doesn't matter go for it 25 hits go ahead and roll damage this-- in your time and you've come across quite a few undead creatures based on what you've walked through in this endeavor you-- while he did not see it you watched these things rise out of the pile of corpses that are jammed at the bottom of each of these small cages you have a pretty good sense that these are undead right divine smite all righty so that is 2d8-- undead so plus 3d8 to your attack damage ooh so as you rush in-- from your perspective keyleth you watch as this flash of light and from thin air you watch armored kerrek just streak down with his glowing-headed warhammer and slamming the side of this wraith-like entity as it hits you watch as the creature turns the radiant energy just consuming part of its torso in the blast and it shrieks out in pain as the radiant energy tends to burn the side of its undead form with a secondary flash as the divine energy bursts outward that-- you watched the wraith go from eager and smooth to looking like it's shimmering in place and its form is starting to shake and hold itself present same one all right go for it on the first strike you would've yes 17 still hits go for it so weapon damage plus 3d8 29 yeah it's actually the ability of the weapon okay so nice as the second strike using the momentum of the first swing you pull back and backhand it right in the face as it cuts clean through with no resistance the wraith seems to scatter and the shadow reforms in the space it was but barely it's like-- you're watching as part of it is flickering and bits of shadow are dripping and disappearing into the stonework behind and its original kind of chuckling evil hungry visage is now this fearful oh shit look on its spectral skeletal face that got weird really terrible that ends kerrek's turn-- yeah they're still in effect you have three things you could attune to and so-- while the ring is no longer invisible and-- that's out for a while but the cloak is still in effect and your hammer is still in effect yeah yeah well in this circumstance since you're no longer since you are visible for the foreseeable future it won't make any difference but if you were invisible the invisibility would take over they'd have disadvantage against attacking you anyway but they'd have to know where you were to even try and make an attack is how it would work okay so ending kerr's turn pike feels-- a warm sensation within her chest a familiar one let's see here so that's kima's turn kima's currently seeing these wraith- like entities start rushing into the room one two three four five she-- -- movement-wise can't quite get all the way up to where they are now but she gets her hammer at the ready and kima's going to go ahead and let's see she's going to go ahead and cast crusader's mantle on herself crusader's mantle is the ability while she maintains concentration on it-- actually you know what no i take that back she's going to cast aura of vitality which means she can use her bonus action to heal an ally within 30 feet for 2d6 damage um so she casts that on herself she's going to-- seeing you damaged grog-- -- she's going to use her bonus action to attempt to heal you 2d6 however your maximum hit points have been lowered so it has no effect on you and she realizes this as she reaches out and grog this bit of divine energy streaks from her hand hits you and seems to just peter out on impact shit and she steels herself with her weapon getting ready for the next round of onslaught finishing kima's turn it is now allura's turn okay yes you can't really see from your perspective this far away for the sake of paying attention go ahead and make a perception check 11 it's hard to tell in the low light from the candelabra it does look like from the view here there's at least two corpses in one of the cages like a pile there's one that's slumped forward but you can see more than two legs all right so for allura's turn she is going to-- --walk away from this area kima's got this she steps over to this side knowing that with the dog barking off to the side that's definitely a sign that the dragon's coming from this direction she pulls her hood back and she will cast-- she's actually going to hold her action she's going to begin casting-- what would be a good one for this one she's going to begin casting disintegrate once something attempts to move by she's going to hold that as an action all right that brings us to pike's turn she's putting it where there all righty radiant sword appears in the center of the air right behind you yeah here okay so it's now a very bright-- -- area here now in the center of the hallway all righty that ends pike's turn keyleth you're up this wall here other way go for it 21 okay you can see the fog cloud there is a heavy swirling in the cloud looks like the fog which is stationary because the magical effect of the spell creates it within a vicinity the fog itself is (whooshing noises) and occasionally you see what looks to be almost a big gust rapidly right at the outskirts of it okay as you step out of the way coming towards the fog cloud you focus it and you begin to bring your fingers across to deliver the incantation of faerie fire and you watch a sudden slow blue spark of energy from inside the fog cloud just within so it's like a little firework in a cloud and when it happens your spell fizzles at the tip of your fingers that brings us to the top of the round-- vax you're up correct there are two of them flanking him currently this one all right he attacked one one is untouched one is flickering okay 31 hits same one the damaged one yeah you can roll damage yeah it screams as its shadowed form is sent to join the rest of the shadows in the room unmoving cold and without life or undeath go for it 18 hits vex you're up next by the way also hits 18 damage eight damage eight damage for the second one without the attack modifier right so you don't add your dex you don't add your dex bonus for the offhand attack okay okay so both of the daggers after destroying the one slam into it and the magical effect of them manages to cause the form to shimmer slightly with the impact as the daggers pass through and then vanish on the opposite side of the room returning to your side the creature seems to have taken a few hits but it's still strong and still swirling around grog as grog's trying to find a way to get a bead on it so he can smack it with the hammer right there cool all right vex you're up make a perception check you can see within the fog as difficult as it is a winged form swirling in there so you can make your attacks it's still at a disadvantage because it's invisible but you can actually attack her right now yes okay okay before you do that you still have hunter's mark up it's concentration you can technically yeah it's still up it's concentration you just have to choose another target use your bonus action to shift it over eventually once you have a bead on where she is yes so now you can take your attack go for it rolling with disadvantage right 26 uh 26 hits yeah it hits all right so go ahead and roll damage and then let me know what the saving throw is all right well first a concentration check she succeeds yeah okay and then what's the-- that is a nine she is you hear a (growl and impact) (all yell and cheer) okay go for it invisible gives you disadvantage but because she is currently restrained that gives you advantage so it's just a straight roll that hits what's the total damage 18 okay she maintains concentration so for the purposes of the spell roll 5d8 yep 18 you fire the arrow but you still hear thrashing about it does not seem to be-- all right that ends-- duck around this corner here that's as far as you can get right there there yeah like mite all right cool that ends your turn percy you're up you're over here watching the egg off in the distance and you watch her fire a couple arrows and then rush around the corner and you hear the slam into the ground though you can see the fog moving around and there's thrashing if you wanted to try and attack something you'd have to roll a perception check okay go for it 25 you can just make out the outline of a form thrashing within the fog cloud so yes i would allow you to take attacks with disadvantage okay (laughs) okay okay all right 21 vanishes into the mist does not seem to have made an impact 29 does hit that's with disadvantage oh gotcha then yeah that does hit okay then right so you would've had so it would've been just a straight attack good call thank you just roll damage and then pump 6d6 lightning damage from your cloak into the hit okay okay nice that's a total of 54 points of damage she still makes her save for her maintaining concentration dragons have really high constitution dragons have high constitution it's plus 14 modifier you can move from where you were no that's as far as you can go unfortunately yeah all right as you finish your turn you watch as the fog shifts and you hear (footsteps) and a voice retorts out not as down and not as vulnerable as you think backs up into the fog you just barely see scanlan as it steps away this form vanish into-- well you said you were holding your action for something that's right that's right so you watch the figure back away into the fog ever-so-slightly going (soft chanting) hm well she can't move anywhere because she's restrained correct she can't move she's still restrained for the item what does it say is it a saving throw at the end of the turn or is it has to use an action to break free i know but i haven't looked at it in a while okay cool so so yes okay that's fine she still rolled poorly for that one as the face pulls back into the mist you feel this shaking within the room as the ceilings of the cavern begin to shift and form into what appear to be small rifts you hear the sound of rocketing stone and flame being pulled from a realm or plane beyond the material-- one two actually it would be two three four all of you yep everybody got hit so i need everybody go ahead and make a dexterity saving throw please who kima kima has her own aura thankfully she's a paladin as well so it's ten feet you guys are not close enough to affect each other no so you do not get to receive each other's bonus unfortunately all right so scanlan (laughs) eight okay you suffer that's 118 points of damage (incredulous laughter) it's 20d6 fire damage and 20d6 bludgeoning damage and half as much on half so yeah so that's 118 points-- you do he's a hardy little gnome man percy 18 you suffer 118 points of damage still suffer it no no the only thing she dispelled was a single specific effect which was the hero's feast you have to pick a singular effect yeah and raishan is well aware that you guys prepare with a hero's feast keyleth 24 you suffer 59 points of damage 59 points oof kima is already down unconscious sorry allura is down kima is still up kerrek she never saw something come through so that-- not so much six kerrek you suffer 118 points of damage kerrek is unconscious all right next up is-- so zero damage to vax 22 you suffer 59 points of damage the dc is 22 for the spell yes what's it say for cabal so trinket takes so trinket failed the save trinket would actually take 85 points of damage yes he was he was over here no he'd have to be pretty far to be further than 100 feet from you grog 11 you take 118 points of damage you know what i believe you do yes so you actually suffer the same eighty-- 85 pike takes 118 points of damage right so that's true so she takes 87 points of damage yes it does which it's a ninth-level spell the cloak holds six charges however as you absorb the spell the cloak flares out and actually grows an additional six inches in length the inside begins to sparkle with electric energy as it pulls one of the meteors into the cloak itself it arcs inward and vanishes into the side it bursts behind you and the damage is taken but the cloak now is shimmering with a very vibrant but continuous spark of arcane energy pass this over please the damage is still halved yeah so you took a total of 59 points of damage it's a full paragraph descriptor of it on the actual item yes you do all right now raishan trying-- so by the way i don't think it's possible for you to have spells up to even make the concentration saving throw on this because of the sheer amount of damage you took make a concentration saving throw percy yeah kima lost hers pike-- roll a constitution saving throw for pike yeah so your-- your hex is gone you didn't take any damage so you're fine you haven't tagged her with it yet but you've still got it up what was pike's saving throw all right so yeah her spell is gone as well and vex i need you to make your concentration saving throw constitution lose your hunter's mark as well all righty and raishan's going to make a strength saving throw-- that is a 19 so she is no longer restrained oh the dog got hit as the impact hits you and you're like-- it won't even matter the dog takes enough damage to immediately revert back to the onyx figure that it was but the impact sends it careening through the room like a pinball (explosion) all righty so ending raishan's turn scanlan you're up kerrek is way back here so he's about 100 feet from you yes roughly allura's down and everyone around you is pretty-- allura is right over here so yeah you can see allura kerrek everyone else seems to still be standing the one wraith that was there yes actually that wraith was destroyed thank you for the reminder the other one just got destroyed by the meteor swarm yeah it is just-- the room already had old carnage on it now it has new carnage it looks kind of like the butcher in diablo i when you get to his room and it's just covered all right so scanlan what are you doing okay you'll have to get a little closer if you're doing-- is it 30 or 60 feet for your-- 30 so you'll have to be a little closer okay as you pull back-- yeah high five you with the claw raishan takes an attack of opportunity on you her invisible form right at the edge of that fog cloud oh that is a 15 that's up to you that's your reaction roll a d12 that reduces it to 13 so you hear this voice go wait who (all laugh) okay (singing) you were only waiting to get up and cast a spell yes you roll for that d4 plus six all right she is at ten hit points conscious allura now (gasps) oh dear (nervous laugh) you do correct yeah it was right at the cusp of the fog kind of yeah if you want to what're you doing okay right at the outside of the radius where the dragon is yeah but it's right it's right at the cusp of where you saw the dragon's form moving okay and so at level six so for that-- and you're using the punching all righty so go ahead and roll a d20 adding your spell attack modifier 13 no that misses it's still a roll it's fine so the fist-- whoosh-- into the fog just manages to move past the form does not actually hit the side of it does not hit balls either but bigby's fist is up and around all right that ends your turn yeah that's still around when it comes to pike's turn pike can still do that good looking out that's going to be the end of your turn raishan is going to use two legendary actions to-- four per turn is going to go ahead and cast disintegrate at pike i'm taking a picture of it right now i'm checking to make sure this is how the spell works this is going to be really funny don't blind me i'm trying to help oh has to make a dexterity saving throw so that roll wouldn't matter i rolled a one but it doesn't matter because it's not an attack dexterity saving throw on pike please total 14 that's not enough uh you know what actually allura is conscious on the ground allura is going to attempt to counterspell that that is a sixth-level spell 'cause allura's going to try and get that out at the last minute so okay fourth or higher dc equals 10 plus the spell level allura's spell modifier is five so-- that is an eight that's not enough she rolled an eight plus five that's not enough to counter the spell okay so that goes to pike suffers so that's 72 points of force damage pike as the beam hits her you watch her flesh begin to turn to dust as the fingers begin to disperse as a burst of flame from the armor flares outward bringing her back to her feet at whatever the effect of the armor is so she gets up i had forgotten she had that so she's on her feet no she's not dust okay that brings us to-- grog you're up she's not-- i'm acting like she would i know she's also the cleric that's exactly what raishan would do grog you're up this one over here okay that's as far as you can get there so go ahead and roll your athletics check to leap yeah that's fine so you can leap 20 feet yeah mr badger you're gone you are scattered all righty well you have to roll a perception check to see if you can see the invisible form in there just pointing (all laugh) okay i'll say between that roll and the bigby's hand pointing at where the dragon is i'll let you make your attacks but they're at disadvantage yes you can nope the hammer just disappears into the fog and returns back to your grasp that does hit 18 points of damage yeah plus the-- 20 okay constitution saving throw yeah makes the concentration one are you frenzied or not yeah frenzied rage so make your bonus attack strike now yeah it has to maintain concentration on greater invisibility every time it takes damage that's true and that would be a 19 still makes it yeah it needs to make more damage 28 damage oh that does hit yeah 22 saving throw yeah it succeeds so it maintains invisibility all right ending your turn grog all right at the end of your turn grog she's going to use her other two legendary actions here to go ahead and cast cone of cold so that's everybody there i need scanlan vex pike vax grog and keyleth and allura to all make constitution saving throws constitution yes keyleth 13 you take 42 points of cold damage 42 that's the full damage vax 16 you take 42 points of cold damage vex 12 you take 42 points of cold damage you are as well what'd you roll 42 points of cold damage pike takes 42 points of cold damage so pike is unconscious who else is unconscious you are unconscious bigby's hand is gone allura is unconscious again so allura's unconscious vex you still up allura's down again yeah she got hit pike's down all right that is all of her legendary actions this turn ending grog's turn all righty that brings us to kerrek i need you to go ahead and roll a death saving throw unfortunately the spell that did that faded just a straight d20 so that's one fail so you've failed one death saving throw all right so kima as it's now kima's turn sees you on the ground convulsing from the blast of the impact the giant crater in the ground where the meteors struck and hearing these blasts of arcane energy around the other side she has practically no vision of what's happening right now all she sees is you down and grog run off and she says c'mon my bearded friend runs up and is going to go ahead and hit you with lay on hands for let's see for kima she can do up to-- she's going to give you 30 hit points as you come to consciousness you see the scarred halfling paladin in her golden armor and half-cocked grin come on we still have work to do puts her hand down to try and lift you up we'll say for the sake of the fun of it bonus action pulls you to your feet all righty that ends kima's turn allura has to make a death saving throw with a seven that is a failure she loses a death saving throw that brings us to pike pike i need to make roll a death saving throw pike fails a death saving throw keyleth it's your turn when it gets to your turn you do there is a spell for that it's called wish you going to try and draw a card that's my girl that is the water fountain (all laugh) over here all righty sure so you send fire sneaking all through there-- i'll say for the purposes of the fog spell versus a seventh-level fire spell and the item the fog cloud is just burned off it is done it is gone all right so roll that 7d10 fire damage saving throw that is a failed save she will use her first legendary resistance to ignore that 7d10 fire damage yeah she rested she got 'em all back you guys rested a whole night to get your shit back so did she it's like enemies can do that too don't forget your staff's ability-- yep so you get to reroll it yeah 34 damage 17 points of fire damage so yeah it succeeds no other than the mention of the name caused the sound of growling in the distance why won't you all just stay down and die with dignity all righty is that the end of your turn keyleth are you going to move forward pike is right there next to you yeah all right healing word not at all level one level two what do you do d4 plus six nine so pike heals nine hit points and is conscious all right bringing us back up to the top vax you're up correct well it's attack disengage or dash i think it should say on the card pike is conscious there you go you're conscious oh god all right cloud's gone it got burned off in the firestorm okay you slam into the physical form okay all righty okay back up how far this way okay yes and as you back up-- yeah disengage yeah so you'll be like over here okay all right that ends your turn vex you're up okay healing her-- all right mm-hm so you're going to move over here and hide okay so go ahead and roll a stealth check go for it it's 2d4 plus two all right percy you're up stealth check yes i mean just where she was previously standing okay disadvantage on all these strikes because she is invisible that's as far as you can get unfortunately is this with disadvantage or did you use the grit point you did all right all right roll some damage um yeah adding that to a crit is a little intense i'd say no correct the benefit is you can choose to apply it after the hit the downside is you can't add it to the crit so you never waste it all righty so 24 38 that's 38 points to that first hit she's going to make a concentration check it's true fails the concentration check on the invisibility is going to spend another legendary resistance to succeed it she's spent two correct she maintained concentration no you do are you doing another grit point to cancel it all right 27 hits all righty okay all righty natural 20 on the save so she saves concentration it's maintained no great okay gotcha that ends your turn percy all righty it is now raishan's turn let's see here uh hm raishan is fed up with this whole down-then-up down-then-up yo-yoing raishan scanlan as you're on the ground just getting your bearings back to consciousness you watch as your head is across the ground the rocks kind of (impact sound) and something seems to hit the ground right next to you raishan's going to do a full round of just physical attacks on you you are prone so attack rolls on you have advantage within five feet which is good because the first attack was a one and an 18 plus so the first hit which is its bite hits you for 13 plus eight-- round before well your turn's next so you have used it no you're right it was it has been since the last time so yeah it was an 18 to hit for raishan you don't know he utters with a weak breath on the floor of the necromancer's sanctum go ahead and roll a d12 please so it's 18 minus six is a 12 (all cheer) there's two more claw attacks so that's 21 to hit so with that you take 4d6 plus eight yeah you're unconscious and the final claw attack has advantage which hits you and it's a crit so you lose two death saving throws right there and the impact seems to be coming from this area here yeah getting hit on the ground getting mangled by something that's not currently there and then (whooshing sounds) the wind kicks up as something seems to shift the air you can feel it move in this direction with that yeah i can just make it through without an attack of opportunity-- you sense it not far enough from you to be able to attack something with an attack of opportunity that ends raishan's turn scanlan death saving throw and with that the breath escapes scanlan's lungs the smile across his face as life leaves his form he died as he lived hard or after a bad joke with piss all over him all right that ends scanlan's turn grog you're up roll a perception check you're not entirely certain you just saw something (whoosh) through the air in this vicinity okay roll with disadvantage sure yep she has a higher ac because she's technically heavily obscured 27 27 just hits you got lucky and just flung it out in the middle of nowhere because of the ac bonus of her being heavily obscured so yeah go ahead and roll damage you can see the hammer impact somewhere and you watch it somewhere right up here like right above you 23 damage okay maintains concentration hammer comes back sure with that your hammer grows in size as well you can i mean you're still at disadvantage on the attacks but you're going reckless so it's all just straight hits on both with reckless oh right yeah misses past breaks into the rock and stone off the wall that hits 25 damage she fails her saving throw concentration no she wants to maintain that spell so that's her last legendary resistance but she maintains concentration on the invisibility so that was 25 yeah i got it so that's the end of your turn grog okay you can move if you'd like you just threw it's all you did something hits your head as you get about there all right that ends your turn grog at the hm yeah at the end of your turn it's going to go ahead and-- it's too close now yeah just we're done (laughs) ah subdual damage back in the day i know she's not going to use that ability yet instead is going to oh everyone's kind of moving around her okay you know is going to use two legendary actions to use a wing attack so the wings start beating furiously in the air i need vax kima grog and vex to make a dexterity saving throw wow allura actually made it that is a shitty roll all right so 27 so you take no damage vex one you take 13 points of bludgeoning damage and you are knocked prone allura succeeds and takes no damage grog what'd you roll 17 grog you also you take 13 points of bludgeoning damage and you're knocked prone yes 13 yep and the dragon moves half its flying speed yeah just moves away at-- people who are not prone yes so vax you get to make an attack of opportunity with disadvantage okay your vow of enmity gives it advantage though doesn't it your vow of enmity 31 hits yeah 25 points of damage yeah maintains concentration and pulls away no she hasn't moved past you nope all right that ends that turn kerrek you're up yeah you're hearing all the impacts the slashing the battle on this side you can yeah as an action so you can do twice your movement correct yeah 30 would just get around the corner here so you're holding your action in case something shows up that you can hit right there okay okay all right that ends kerrek's turn let's see here kima sees you doing this and is going to go ahead and back you up right there sorry percy spiderclimb makes you so easy to knock over kima on her turn is going to use aura of vitality again on herself and utilizing that as a bonus action is going to heal you for 2d6 kerrek so-- oh not bad 11 hit points all righty that ends kima's turn allura allura who is barely conscious with 15 hit points is going to get to her feet perception check natural 20 and is going to-- no not third-level she's going to go ahead and cast a fifth-level dispel magic which would-- yeah it's just dispelled and with that finally revealed on the field further over just appears right in front of your face percival (menacing growl wing-sounds) and then allura using the rest of her movement is going to here here here and then actually misty step over here next to keyleth to get out of the area (breathing hard) keyleth you have to finish this that's going to end allura's turn pike is up she would just get to his side yeah all right so go ahead and roll a d20 and add her wisdom modifier he died twice the dc is 12 yeah so d20 plus five nine okay so the revivify fails reaches out and doesn't hit you're still dead you're not permanently dead but you cannot be revived for the remainder of this battle you can only use a ritual to return and the dc does go up to a 13 currently you get-- pike touches and releases the energy of the spell into scanlan's body and you feel the necrotic essence of this necromancer's sanctum the very dark nature of this place is preventing the connection between the spirit and the body of scanlan at the moment the spell having no effect pike still has a bonus action if she'd like okay sacred flame is an action needs to be a bonus action unfortunately she can do a healing word level two all right so 2d4 plus five 11 all righty so that heals her up all right that ends pike's turn keyleth you're up you can see her there yes yes all righty and it is an intelligence saving throw-- four plus four rolled a four she has an intelligence modifier of four and it is not one of her saving throws her intelligence and charisma become one cannot cast spells cannot activate magical items yeah yeah at the end of every 30 days she can repeat the saving throw (cheers and yelling) as you reach out you watch as the tendrils of nature's energy begin to spill out of the cracks in the vicinity you watch as raishan chuckles one of the tendrils lashes out and wraps around the throat and as they wrap and begin to strengthen around the neck pouring into the cracks of the flesh where the disease currently holds her throat her brow begins to sink the jaw hangs open and slobber begins to drip from her jaw as raishan just as opposed to speaking now does a guttural (heavy breaths and growling) okay so is that the end of your turn you still have a bonus action right and technically ten more feet of movement all these spells cannot use them now i didn't the dragon did you can only do up to second level because you cast an eighth-level it's a healing word bonus action all right 2d4 plus six that brings us to the top vax you're up except for at the end of your turn actually going to go ahead and use a legendary action to do a tail attack against you percy a reaction yeah i mean that is 23 to hit okay you take 21 points of bludgeoning damage all right now what are you doing vax go for it no on each attack you can do smite that's fine with a melee weapon attack so you have to be up next to her okay that hits okay neither of these are sharpshooter because they're melee 53 points of damage okay no disengage doesn't have to make an acrobatics check though 25 you land on both feet without an issue oh you did roll 4d6 go for it 4d6 you can move against the wall and get there no because you were-- how much 13 all right all righty that ends your turn all right at the end of her turn she's going to use her last legendary action to attack percy once more that is a 27 to hit all right 23 points of bludgeoning damage all right vex you're up yeah essentially disengage you go into combat and then you can leave combat without getting an attack of opportunity on you you are just outside of her range technically yeah her reach-- actually with the tail no but she's up in the air i'll say you're just out of the range of the tail you can get just to the side of kerrek okay so half your movement there to get up from prone so you can move fifteen more-- you've got three more squares you can move to there go for it that feeblemind 17 does not hit no or the arrow hits and it just splinters across the outside of her body 18 the second arrow does manage to strike the side of the shoulder and then the arrow actually breaks against the dragon's hide and scales that's going to end your turn you still have a bonus action if you want to do something else you didn't use disengage all righty from where and to where pull her down okay all righty so grasping vine here that's going to be a dexterity saving throw that is a five plus nine that is 14 what is your spell dc all right so no because it is forced down raishan is pulled to the ground there all righty all righty right now she would be ten feet from you all right that brings us to percy's turn yes yes you are in melee 19 misses unfortunately (guttural growling) 22 just hits yes so two ones hit all righty nice okay the entire time that's perfect okay so as you go rushing she's going to go ahead and make a claw swipe at you that is-- that is a natural 20 sorry buddy 40 points of piercing damage as the claw strikes you from behind so where are you going now all righty that ends your turn percy correct it's not in range to you the moment the dragon comes into range you can strike correct unfortunately with the fifth edition rules they make it so it's like a quick reaction however the dragon does fly past to get around the edge to this side here you do get to make your attack as she comes into range flying past for you a total of twenty no unfortunately first swing just goes wide the second one hits the side but you haven't hit hard ancient dragon hide before and it scrapes across the outside with no noticeable damage and a little seed of fear wells in your heart once more all right as raishan slams down onto the ground-- no she cast a spell to heal you last turn as a bonus action raishan is going to unleash upon you percy who has avoided the meteor swarm who has shot her in the face and right now in her feral state is just focused on what's closest and angry at her first strike that is a 26 to hit with the bite that is 17 plus eight 25 points of piercing damage so you fall to the ground so you lose a death save you were just a few feet up as opposed to going to angrily take a claw attack at your body which hits a critical that's two death saving throws-- percy you're dead as the bite knocks you to the ground the claw slams down onto your torso and just tears out the side of your body your entrails scattered across the stone floor-- -- and your breath just escapes out kerrek you and kima both there watch this happen as percy is now partially spread across the stone immediately to the right of you and raishan gets her legendary actions back that's going to end raishan's turn grog you're up that's half your movement 25 25 that's as far as you can get make your athletics check grasping vine doesn't keep her restrained it just grabs somebody and pulls them there it's meant to move things-- yes you're not in melee you didn't quite get far enough to get-- correct yeah that'll hit 23 damage all righty sure yeah no well it's thrown you can only do it with melee 24 hits okay 23 you said 27 hits all right that ends your turn grog that's for the larger weapon i'll double-check real fast well here just to remind myself the weapon a melee weapon you're wielding with two hands which as you're throwing it you're not so no all right got it that ends grog's turn kerrek you're up 26 hits 20 misses unfortunately no unfortunately the feral angry unintelligible state of raishan right now as just a beast no not surprised instinct now no yeah 28 points of damage at a max hit points of 520 how do you want to do this (screaming and cheering) i can't fucking believe-- i can't fucking believe that happened so how do you want to do this the feral beast there tearing the innards out of percy on the ground grog slamming into it just seemingly bashing against the world watching everyone drop around you like flies your warhammer in hand as the hammer arcs downward (slow-mo sound effects) it just slams into the snout of raishan just as the head turns up the eyes that were once reptilian and intelligent are now just filled with bloodshot rage and feral intensity the jaw is attempting to snap up and catch the blade however you're too fast your old adventuring reflexes are kicking in as the glowing hammerhead comes down onto the snout the divine energy blasts forward and you watch as the dragon's face explodes inverting inward the front of the skull being blown backward and you guys watch as this flash of light fills the entirety of this necrotic space this one plume of radiant smoke kind of pssssh and left behind you see kerrek standing there holding the rod the actual head of the hammer now dismissed as part of the burst of radiant energy and there the smoking ruin of the throat headless of raishan the diseased deceiver collapsing to the ground unmoving and we're going to take a quick break take a break and we're going to take a little time to take in the aftermath of this moment before we finish tonight's episode so we'll be back here in a few minutes we're going to go ahead and use the restroom we'll see you guys here shortly and welcome back so last we left off the battle with raishan ended with a victory for vox machina but at a rather high cost at the moment as you stand now in the still silence the aftermath of the fray looking down seeing your allies beaten bruised disheveled scanlan lifeless on the ground on one side of this cavern and a partially gutted percy lifeless on the other the smoldering ruin that was once the head of raishan lifeless and still on the ground as kerrek clutches the hammer kima walks over and grabs your shoulder and tightly squeezes it going you did what had to be done thank you i think he's beyond either of our power now allie please tell me she's alive and kima runs off realizing that she doesn't really know the status of the rest of the group allura shouts out to her on the side i'm all right trying to gather what you-- what's outside putting it back in yeah as you guys both kind of run keyleth a bit behind vex you turn and you see raishan's corpse just piled and then on the ground you see kerrek slowly and methodically almost staring off into a memory trying to gather a bit of percival's scattered innards from the side torn open pike comes running around the corner oh god and she runs up real fast and begins gathering her revivify spell did either of you guys want to roll for pike's revivify percival yeah six plus five percival has died how many times i think just once for him right we're double-checking taliesin the necklace does not count yeah similar to the effect earlier so as you're trying to grab the body and trying to make it form it's not-- it's not doing anything and the healing magic is not taking effect into the now-still cold body as pike's metallic hand comes into your visual frame kerrek you watch in that slow breathless motion as her gauntleted arm reaches down and touches the clavicle of the bloody mess of percy's torso and as the divine energy pulses warmth once more through the chest you watch as the bits of exposed organ that you had pushed in close over with skin (breathes) and breath comes back to percival's body you come to consciousness barely yes okay as you turn around the corner-- kima and allura are rushing up to you now as well is he-- and you turn the corner grog and you see vax holding the still body of scanlan just dangling out of his arms this is-- this is beyond any of my capabilities i-- look i have a certain skillset and it's not this kind of skillset i'm sorry no trees allura says i do have a teleport spell i can utilize gather everyone around all right let's all of us gather our hands together she puts her hands out kima takes one side and you all form a circle she closes her eyes she begins the incantation under her breath there's a brief flux of arcane energy and then it fades and you all remain in place she goes um i don't know something is-- something is barring my-- okay she casts detect magic there are a number of magical sources in this room there are a few vials on the back shelf some of which appear to have been broken and scattered on the ground and the magic is fading there is one book that is actually in a chest that she goes and partially opens there is a book inside that is emanating some magical essence there is the doorway across the way but there is just a general magical presence like a faint magical energy everywhere in here on the far end make an investigation check investigation seven the door looks like-- the door doesn't look like it's particularly intricate it looks like it's locked or chained by something you can now okay two ones the door seems not trapped but it appears to be chained or locked from the other side all right all right roll a strength check 26 (punching sounds) you start slamming your fists against the door and as it splinters and then breaks inward and then outward and rocks just start tumbling outward where once was the door in this vicinity here now appears to be a cave-in on the opposite side okay as you slam through you smash a cylindrical space in and it just meets more rock you get the sense that whatever chamber was beyond this room-- -- has just caved in it has a sinister look to it it is ancient the leather itself is darkened not by initial color but by just weather age it has a very very deep leathery-brown burgundy tint to it it has ancient brass inlays and it is locked shut on one side okay okay so you grab a number of the tomes a number of them were destroyed from the impact of the meteor swarm but the one-- you get a number of tomes in there you get some odds and ends some trinkets some bones some other things that're around the territory and that all seems to go in fine okay the staff slams into the flesh one of the exposed wounds on the side of raishan's body as it sinks in the staff seems to right itself in a standing position you let go instinctually and you watch as the remaining visual of the black disease that had begun to spread across the body spreads rapidly across the entire body of raishan what remains of green scale turns to black and very very quickly the corpse begins to wither and blacken and then turn to this rippled fleshy husk the staff disengages and falls to the ground clattering against the stone seeming that the remainder of the disease completed its cycle okay as you kerrek walk toward one of the edges of the pillars there there is a flash on the ground a magical glyph or a symbol of some kind that triggers and your body is immediately wracked with horrible pain i need you to make a constitution saving throw 11 i'll make sure it's constitution let me see and make sure it was the right one yeah okay so as the excruciating pain takes over you instinctually start screaming as your muscles lock up and you are unable to move you guys all look over suddenly as kerrek is just locked in place all the muscles pulled into this tense moment just screaming in place nothing he just walked toward one of the pillars-- in the central area here okay you pull him off the glyph still remains glowing in place and he clatters to the ground still locked up you don't even see color or shape right now it's just white from the pain that is wracking your body you are unable to move make conscious thought you are purely a primal entity that is suffering right now okay so you spend five of your hit points doesn't seem to assuage him almost biting through his tongue allura immediately looks over and is going to attempt to dispel which succeeds actually she rolled a 15 plus-- so the pain subsides immediately and she puts her hood back up as your breath begins to regulate-- as can i all right as you guys begin to walk out the three of you between your staff your wand and allura's preparation you guys just (fire explosion sounds) and you watch as elements of the stonework begin to fall into itself and collapse not enough to the point where it causes a full cave-in to be endangering to you but you ensure that this space is no longer used for whatever purpose it was being used for you guys continue back out to the edge of the chasm where the bridge is currently-- it did yeah yes okay you get across without issue all right you guys make your way across the chasm you can still hear below and occasionally as you glance down as the light opens the area below you can see the masses of writhing bodies that are all reaching up from below but with no magical gravitational trap in effect they have no effect and are kept at a distance you make your way across heading back towards the spiral staircase upwards the glyph-- yeah the glyph is still dispelled from earlier you guys still make your way up in sections using your-- the broom and the magic carpet as you make your way up into the next chamber you begin to hear cackling laughter you hear (cackling) from ahead and you see a little bit of a light source begin to appear from the iron door room that you guys had your first encounter with-- they're not quite in sight yet you can just see the glow as they're descending down a grade yeah okay looking at the radius of turn undead i'll just double-check here because it's pretty close it would be destroy undead at fifth level which she has but yeah it's 30 feet near you so she can wait all right so you guys are holding your action for when they come into range essentially it's a slow grade downward you guys are heading back up the pathway and you see them now coming in your direction once they come into range you're not sure all right so you guys hearing the cackling and seeing the glow coming you hold your actions you're holding your bow you're holding a sunbeam you're holding your attacks that would give you guys immediate action as soon as they arrive so sure enough within a moment you watch as four of them come into view the same four that you destroyed earlier clustered around there's two lines of two essentially so so keyleth sunbeam can only affect two of them so they get their saving throw right roll 8d6 if you could they (laughs) they do not make their saving throws 27 radiant damage to both of them all righty got you all right percival okay hits okay so 19 total they appear-- the blasts of the bullets don't seem to be doing as much damage as other forms of attack right yeah okay this is the ones she damaged with the sunbeam both of those skulls just (explosion sound) as soon as the beam streaks past blasting into two of them two piercing shots in a row you can watch as their eyes begin to glow flames glowing within the back of the skull two of them immediately just scatter into dust and bone the two on the other side okay all right what level right but what spell level oh that's right okay yeah nope nice all righty go for it all right all righty 17 to the one that's over there allura who is frustrated and understanding what their resistances are she's going to go ahead and cast a high-level magic missile okay that one just explodes and scatters so now there is one left that is just partially damaged from percival not quite yet you just charge in okay as you go rushing in that triggers them-- or the one that's remaining to go ahead and it's going to fire two fire rays at you that is 20 to hit and 24 to hit that would be strange that is 13 points of fire damage on one and seven points of fire damage on the other all right you watch as both eyes streak out these burning rays of flame in his direction both blast him in the shoulder one hits him in the side of the knee and thigh but kerrek keeps running forward you can go ahead and make your attacks if you want hits 18 hits all righty yes they are 25 for both hits that's the first one all right so do the second hit now it doesn't destroy it no it does crack the skull and you watch as the sutures cave in from below the light of your hammer still-- 31 that'll do it with that the first blow knocks it almost to the ground as it begins to lift up again its mouth (cackling) you hit it with the side of the hammer and it just scatters into broken bone chunks and shards that splatter against the wall and rattle down the grade a bit towards your direction as kerrek turns around looking back over his shoulder at you guys the pathway now clear ahead of you yeah you guys continue forward you make your way to the chamber with the iron door still open eventually walking to the outskirts of the entranceway to the sanctum you now walk carefully around the previously noticed patches of dirt and sand right and as you pull them out it seals the tunnel once more behind you no that was the one actually she goes i do have a teleportation circle so i may be able to bring us to emon that's one of the few teleportation sigils that still exist in that vicinity at least all right she gets down and begins marking out the symbol on the ground on the outskirts she finishes you watch the arcane flash she steps onto the circle and vanishes the teleportation circle and kima's about to go behind her and kima goes i don't it doesn't usually look like that allura stepped onto it after casting it and then vanished there was a weird sparkle of electrical energy i don't know i don't know and kima just walks in after her sparks once more you can make an arcana check 22 as you get closer and look at it-- you've seen a few teleportation circles and once they're down they just kind of glow with this mild energy until they dissipate which is pretty rapid let's see here yeah it only lasts for a round so it's-- yeah six seconds now you glancing at it there is a flicker to it and weird (crackling) very similar to the weird flash that you saw when you were inside and attempted the original teleportation there's something-- you get the sense that there's something about this-- either this mountain or this underground area there's something that has some sort of influence or impact on any sort of transportation magic it's gone the ritual requires you-- you could probably try that i'd give you a concentration check to maintain it for the duration okay okay okay you guys slowly make your way through the forest avoiding the patches that you noticed before the weird collapsing earth go ahead and make a constitution saving throw keyleth yeah 15 okay what are you focusing on allura okay okay so you focus on allura's life force form face and as you close your eyes slowly moving along with the gradual movement of the flying carpet your vision pulls out of you and above an island it then shifts suddenly and pulls you over blue over water and then there's another flash and there's nothing but water around you you don't know where you are you don't know where it is and it flashes once more and there in the center of this open expanse of water and ocean you see two figures swimming and you glance down and there in the middle of the ocean waters you see allura treading water shouting kima's name kima and looking across the way you can just barely hear in the distance allie i'm coming she swims over in that direction they eventually grab each other's hands and together hold each other and look around keeping treading water as the sun is slowly beginning to set in the distance and nightfall comes you just see allura holding her there trying to keep both aloft it's all right we're alive i don't know where we are but we'll figure this out we'll figure this out and they both begin swimming looking at the direction of the sun and picking what looks to be a northern position and then the scry-- you cannot see-- the scrying is specifically on her but they are both just plopped somewhere in the ocean a short time later you eventually get close to the edge of the waterline and you do find a handful of trees that appear to be alive enough and large enough to maintain one of your spells perception check and add your perception bonus 31 you take a moment and you don't know if it's the sense of the scry spell and something about the arcane winds that blow through the ley lines of magic that traverse across exandria but something guides your attention that way and you focus real hard and you see just at the horizon what looks to be a very very faint speck of movement you arcing as fast as you can on the broom full speed holding on to the hat as best you can the wind of the ocean air coming past your face the salt and the briny spray of bits of reef and rock that surround the island-- yeah you do look out and you see both kima and allura swimming through the ocean exhausted and it looks like based on both the heavy armor that kima's wearing and their general physical state they're both having a hard time treading water and they're swimming in the wrong direction oh that's the best thing i could've hoped for seeing and allura reaches up and grabs your arm and says kima hold on and grabs the edge you can see kima now is like coughing up water and is trying desperately to tread water that's a natural 20 on a strength check for allura holy shit with no modifier manages to hold onto both you and kima and keep you up i need you to make an athletics check just to hold on 13 okay it's enough to maintain carrying them both back as fast as the broom-- which is not very fast at this time it takes you probably a good 15 or so minutes and as the tension's going on you can see allura getting more and more exhausted i'm trying at this point you can see allura's grip is getting shaky on the broom now she says we're almost close enough now and then her and kima vanish in a puff of dark bluish energy and appear on the carpet next to you through dimension door eventually you guys manage to gather the rest of your party at the beachside waterlogged kima shakes it out leaving this trail as her hair's all matted and into her face and she just looks really pissed and is like not a word allura's squeezing out the sides of her braids well now what let's try i think this definitely explains why so many folks who went to investigate this place never came back you came in on a tree yes so you go ahead and find the tree all right hm as you reach out and touch the side of the tree eyes clenched tight hoping that this is enough you watch as the bark splits into the transportation via plants portal and as it splits apart you can see further internal wood striations those split a third layer splits it's having to force its way through this tree and finally it divides out and you can see the sunset-lit outside of the center of whitestone it appears to be whitestone you guys all charge through making your way through the portal you all step out catching yourself just as the tree slams behind you there you see the faintly blossoming branches of the sun tree greeting you to the center of sunsetting whitestone together as a group clutching scanlan's lifeless body in your arms still vax what do you do okay you guys all make your way towards the temple of the raven queen and the graveyard outside of whitestone as you're making this scry attempt with the item go ahead and make another concentration check as you're moving along and doing this on the carpet it's a constitution saving throw remember you have warcaster so you technically have advantage on concentration too don't forget that okay little bit of a show okay your vision pulls back and is dragged fast enough through the clouds to have no sense of direction suddenly you feel your essence thrust downward through the clouds once more towards the closing daylight around kymal in the center of tal'dorei looking down to the rather dirty destitute gambling-overrun and light-law-enforced city that kymal is you're pulled once more into what looks to be a tavern room and there you see a makeshift band of very terrible performers playing and at the back table you see kaylie with half a flagon of ale sitting there dagger on the table just staring and just giving those performers shit she's like you all fucking suck you know that where i come from they'd kill you for this that's terrible certainly okay you're shouting this you guys hear her doing this and you just keep pushing forward occasionally checking to make sure she's okay kaylie just keeps drinking from the flagon and is shouting out someone comes by and you watch as she deftly nabs a little bit of coin from the pocket-- doesn't seem to be having an effect i can cast sending yes okay and so is allura yeah from what you know as kerrek yeah she's-- she guides you one way or the other she's the mistress of fate and if your destiny is cut short there is exception however her real loathing is for those people who go against that natural destiny exactly unnatural unexpected death across one's fate line is unfortunate but it can be corrected so you go ahead and you look for gilmore you find gilmore with a big mug of coffee in his comfort robes still recovering from the war the previous day his hair's tousled up and he's sitting there cradling it looking out as the sun's setting in the main common mess area of the castle and as you walk in oh vex'ahlia you return yes yes i-- (nervous chuckle) i don't know of a sigil there i'm sorry i normally don't frequent places like that it's a bit dastardly for my tastes i-- i'm sorry i mean there's westruun but that sigil got destroyed too what's wrong puts his mug down and stands up slowly his demeanor gets very stoic and very dark well let's see what we can do follow me and he begins walking down and leads you towards the home that he's been staying here in whitestone he goes in and it's barely furnished based on the original attack on whitestone when you guys had the assassins that came after you here it's been cleaned up but it hasn't been replaced he goes rummaging through some things up in his room he goes through a few bags and goes i don't really have many options is it a-- have you talked to allura hold on and he leads you back up to the castle what are you guys doing yeah you've got to scrub that down a little okay are you guys having pike prepare the resurrection ritual is that what's going on i don't know what's happening you guys are talking to air right now right right right okay that's what i thought right right allura approaches and says if we can wait until tomorrow i can take us there but-- i just i have no means of-- vex as you're brought up to the castle gilmore is tugging your arm and you see he has a haste to him and he's like where's eskil where's eskil has he returned please somebody give me this answer anyone and you watch as some of the guards come up and like eskil's been back in his research at the ziggurat for the better part of a week now yes sir yes sir pulls you down and you rush down past the ziggurat and eskil's returning with his servant this older hunched form it looks like they finished their work for the day and as you all begin rushing down the hall to the ziggurat beneath whitestone he says oh hello we're finished there's no reason to-- it's a very strange very-- -- unique magic yes of course peh child's play really kymal why would you want to-- shaun-- shaun kind of goes if you want to be of use to anybody right now buddy this is the way to do it (sputters) kymal all right heh that's a one- way trip so you're paying for room and board all right have you guys caught up at this point all right so we go-- what are you looking for all right i'll take you there and that's where we're staying for the night we'll return tomorrow all right (sighs) it's been a while and he reaches out and grabs your hand be back in a day and begins doing this incantation as he traces his fingers through the air you watch these lines begin to connect and he's tracing almost this mystical map of the portions of tal'dorei and as each finger hits a point you see him connect a thread as he connects a thread both of you blink out and appear in the middle of this busy cobblestone street you can hear what sounds like raucous laughter and shouting in the distance from two different directions you can see now as the night has gone from a bright orange and purple to the dark reds and blues of post-sunset there are a couple of what look to be guards wandering the street but they themselves look to be laughing and probably a little tipsy in their own right you see many humans and you see a couple of half-orcs you actually see two gnolls and what looks to be a goblin that are wandering amongst those people in the street kymal is and you've passed through before kymal is-- it's the real-- it's the seedy reno of tal'dorei if you will it's not laughlin level it's not-- sorry laughlin go ahead and make an investigation check 16 okay okay yeah asking questions rapidly around dragging eskil behind he's like where are we going (grumbling) asking to where the worst performers you've seen perform in this town and everyone keeps pointing you to this one place that's up on this one hill towards the back of the ironseat ridge which is the mountain that kymal is up against as you walk into the tavern you see a little more than a dozen people in various clusters some of them are ready to go they've been drinking since sundown and they're already pretty sauced there's a terrible off-key band in the corner of four people three gentlemen and a lady-- it's a terrible band name and it's pretty bad and there you see half-slumped over in the corner at the table you see kaylie just ready to pass out at the end should i get our rooms one room-- two rooms she's paying hold on and he walks over towards the bar kaylie at the table what do you want from me you-- she grabs the dagger and grabs you by the front of the shirt and brings it-- oh i remember you i'm never sober i don't want to deal with him right now tell him-- look i will kick your ass right now if you keep treating me like this how'd he die and she's still being held up reaches over and grabs her tankard her feet still dangling who would want a death like that that sounds like my father and what and help what make a persuasion check she looks at you for a second you can see her kind of frustrated piss-off facade drops a little and her eyes sink below i really don't know what you think i can do but i mean at the very least i'd like to see his body before it's interred (sighs) so much strangeness surrounds you folks every time i cross paths with you it seems can i take my drink she holds the stone for a second and looks at it squints an eye listen if you're trying to take the piss out of me-- and her form just vanishes from the table it is pushing 1120 i think we will pick this up right there next week here in whitestone for the ritual i'm trying to push the narrative as long as i can get trying to get to a point but yeah this is building and i don't want to drag us in here i know i can't force narrative can't force narrative all right well we will pick this up next week sam can't be here next week oh that's going to be interesting oh snap all right well we'll figure it out if worse comes to worst i'll play him or we'll see if he can skype in we'll see i don't know what he's doing i know he's gone like a tool that's true all right well with that the conclave lies destroyed raishan's plot still not uncovered one of two deaths reversed one still on the line the tethering of the soul to the body withering with each fall and a surprisingly low-level paladin getting the final blow on an ancient green dragon i honestly prepared that to be this-- like we talked about that on the break it would've been an awesome heroic end to the story it just happened to work out that she was pinned straight to the side-- i like that yeah well sam we love you wherever you are
