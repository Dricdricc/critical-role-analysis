going to be at a convention in atlanta this weekend all righty well then without further ado let's go ahead and dive into tonight's episode of critical role [dramatic music] little late on the draw there bud welcome back so last we left off vox machina had made their way through the innards of the undead risen primordial earth titan on its shoulders was held the long-abandoned until recently city of thar amphala from the shadowfell a city that once held the armies of vecna the undying king who has since risen once more and achieved godhood in recent days you traversed to this titan through its innards up into the city of thar amphala which you notice the outer wall currently manages to maintain an arcane dome that holds at bay any of the outward assailing forces of the wyvern riders or devo'ssa the brass dragon where the inside of it contains in wait a cloud of various gloomstalkers and a skeletal dragon that just peruse the city in safety as you make your way through the streets in search of the recently reassembled and standing tower of entropis now upon seeking a sword that you were notified had historical binds to the hatred of vecna and hopefully his downfall the sword of kas you went seeking this weapon long ago discarded and bound within a buried catacomb within a pit of acid along with various corpses left over from an ancient war and in doing so unfortunately notified vecna of your arrival as vex passed through into the ethereal plane the ring that kept any sort of scrying at bay was lost and both vax and keyleth came to his attention all of you managed to flee back to scanlan's mansion where the rest were in wait however with a notification fresh at hand the skeletal dragon swooped into the chamber where the mansion was set on its back riding lady delilah briarwood and the re-risen sylas briarwood the mansion was dispelled you were exited from the pocket plane and barely maneuvering due to a very lucky roll having your plane shift dispelled you made your way into the feywild as a hail mary and through a dick-drawing made contact with the one archfey that you had encountered in your previous journeys artagan upon being summoned and your knowledge of the strange time-altering nature of exiting the feywild you asked if it was within his power to ensure the condensing of the time passage when you were to return he agreed under two conditions one when this was all said and done you would help him assemble a doorway in the prime material plane in which he could visit your space and two upon realizing that vax was of some undying or re-rising nature wished to strangle him until dead you agreed and shortly thereafter vax expired into ashes and you all spent time awaiting his return we've left off with the return of vax but if there's anything you wanted to do over that period of time before his arrival now would be the time to do it it takes a little while yeah that's up to you well the meal appears for a short time we'll say for the truncating of the wait period that eight hours go by 12 hours go by it's hard to tell time in the feywild since it doesn't have a day-night cycle it's always on the cusp of sunset and the longer you wait and the more the boredom sets in the more the stress of the coming fray creeps into the back of your mind you find that it seems like far too much time has passed and you begin to worry you begin to twitch you begin to do search parties around the surrounding forest the possibility that he returned and got lost you don't know how much time has passed until you convene to desperately ask if there was any possible sight and at that point you hear the snapping of foliage beneath a distant foot and you all turn and by the nearby tree you see entering the pale nude long dark-haired body of vax returned in his revenant form for a second time you probably have to draw it as you pull the blade out there's a very silent glass against textured metal sound the blade is so dark that barely any of the light seems to come across it where the blade is up close you can barely make out the outside of it but as soon as you draw it the voice goes hungry as you deal with the nearly hamstrung self that is your right knee the sword is coated well enough in percival blood as it seeps into the darkened blade and the voice goes ah yes yes he is more intelligent than most but his arrogance gets the best of him he likes a show he builds webs of plots so many things intertwined cut the threads and the web can falter i can cut these threads bring me to these threads bring me to him i must cut him down now now me as you put it away you hear a (sigh) giant wings no no wings to give you a mechanical idea based on what ioun had notified you the more damaged vecna's avatar form is the lower the dc to drive a trammel into the body possibly or roll really high early on the choice is up to you that is the risk you have to take you have two strong and one fragile trammel in your midst oh yeah if the creature you transform into has spells you can use those spells but that's the only circumstance a testament to wyrmwood's craftsmanship critrole anyway you guys you can still attach the chain of returning to the sword of kas correct the tower of entropis the very height of it you didn't gauge entirely as you flew up but even at a bit of distance it was hundreds of feet high oh the dome above that is probably about another 100 or 200 feet above that it's a big dome and it encompasses the entire city of entropis make an intelligence check you recall the thar amphala that is currently embedded in the titan is not the entire city it's only the inner circle of the city you encountered the inner circle of the city and you saw a little bit of the edges there's a wall that is built on the inside of thar amphala this was the same wall that contained the threshold crests that caused it to transport from the shadowfell to the prime material plane you looked at the energy of this field you've seen it pulse from the wall upward like (pulse sounds) trinket over there is on the side arms playing pillow to the muzzle you hear this slight squeak of a bear fart in his direction trinket walks up to you now and his fully grown form is a good foot and a half taller than you at the shoulders he comes up and gets really close and (bear breathing) and butts his head against you and then licks the side of your face and sits back it can still be dispelled if it is permanent on true polymorph by the way yeah that was an errata to the spell that i've discovered as the internet made very keenly aware to me correct well you have to know that the creature has been polymorphed into that form and even then it's a 9th-level spell that you're trying to dispel which is not-- to be instantaneous or they have to roll against it yeah you could do that all right polymorph is a concentration spell so keep that in mind yes you wouldn't have to concentrate with true polymorph but those are just the specifications i will put trinket at about a challenge rating of six i'd say because he's not a full powerful creature he's a complement to you i'd put him at a six maybe high end okay think about it regardless who's casting you said you were casting heroes' feast all right as you set up the table you summon forth the meal that is infused with divine energy you all begin to eat in solemn quiet occasionally discussing plans and tactics the delicious-- oh he does don't worry as soon as you guys begin to eat at the far end of the table you see the orange mane erupt from the side of table as he takes a seat oh wondrous i appreciate this thank you hello it was all right i don't know have to try when they're not willing that's a joke that's a joke which wand which wand are you handing him it's a war wand it's a plus one wand for anyone who's casting a spell through it it's a plus one modifier to dc generally you have to attune to these yeah well it doesn't require or contain any magic if that's what you're asking well it's a focus it's a divine focus for those who wish to utilize it to draw energy from their deity of choice and/or just a token of brotherhood delicious meal by the way is it yours thank you all right when do you intend to go back well then sleep it is and he gestures over his hand behind you and as you look back you can see there's a series of beds that have all constructed out of the nearby moss and vines they grow and lift up out of the natural floor of the feywild as the beds form you watch as the tethered vines and roots to the ground begin to form these dome-like tents over each specific bed brass as a god of secrets probably see through an illusion just throwing it out there based on your experience even the creatures around the tower have truesight just keep in mind counterspell can't be done unless they're on the field to see the spell being cast and within 60 feet so second scanlan would have to be in the fray you can and things that see through invisibility like a god of secrets would probably see through it no vecna would have to roll all right as the words leave your lips you can see artagan himself as he finishes the meal leans back hmm like seemingly taken aback by the power of these words you've spoken as you watch as hints of nearby slowly melting snowfall that seem to have gathered elements at the base of the trees nearby begin to slowly congeal into a form you do realize that this is going to take you 12 hours to complete right yeah you'll be arriving a little later than originally anticipated who knows what ramifications that'll have all right so simulacrum is a 12-hour casting time over the next 12 hours you sit there focusing on trying to press your will into this congealing snow golem of scanlan and watch as it slowly takes form and breathes air and-- with no equipment of course-- but has your knowledge your spells eventually the completion of the spell brings to life a secondary scanlan under your beck and call it's me sam and speak for yourself he's already naked mm-hmm how do we know i'm not the real scanlan you're halfway through your sleep the spell is instantaneous unless it's copying the effect of a spell all right scanlan where to okay all right you guys head off to your domicile he can wear things nope he is naked okay there you go all right so you got those so you go ahead and find yourself to sleep the rest of you the night's rest if there's any final words before the fray comes anything you want to do to calm yourself before the final battle now's the time all right you all find yourselves resting uncomfortable at first but the knowledge and the exhaustion hitting you eventually it takes you the dreams lead seamlessly one to the next memories of your meeting of your story of your experiences bleeding between your fears your victories and the people whose lives you've touched and who've touched your lives of wilhand the fall of kevdak to the respect of your father and the vengeance of your mother to climbing the destiny of the aramente to rebuilding the memory of one's family and to spooning a second version of yourself (laughing) and knowing that you've taken your faith from a place of being forgotten to a newly built symbol of hope these thoughts all mingle as the dark of rest takes you and as you all awake in the center of this strange mystical meadow peeking through the hints of purple and orange that signify the sky that breaks through the canopy of this forest the pools of nala that once brought you here long ago you all awake the beds gone the tents gone you're all lying amongst this field in a circle around each other as you come to consciousness you all sit up take a breath feel the warmth and the knowledge of what has to be done wash over you the shadow between two distant trees reveals the orange mane of artagan once more as he steps forth his high green collar disappearing into his long sleeves and a cloak that billows past his shoulders and loops into his back as he almost glides effortlessly through the grass i take it you all slept well well then time is of the essence you've been here more than a day just know but whenever you're ready i'll see what i can whip up as he wipes his fingers against each other you can see the sparkle spiral of purples and blues and oranges and colors causing this glow under his face and his hair as he gets excited at the prospect of seeing just how far he can tweak the boundaries of the feywild that he calls home okay take them as you concentrate and the spell begins to swell around you this familiar energy begins to ride up in your stomach you feel the butterflies take form and as the realm begins to darken the colors that you see spiraling out of artagan's hands begin to consume you as well and nausea takes over and you feel yourself wretched left and right as darkness begins to swell once more and close in the colors surround you entirely and you feel like you're being pushed through a window as you all land and catch your feet the darkness subsides the color subsides and you all feel immediately queasy falling to your knees as you glance around you you can see you stand in the rubble the exterior of a building that has fallen long ago you see large chunks of the secondary floor fallen inward and dust (poof) around you as your knees hit you look up and can see the familiar green-blue crackle of the barrier above you you've managed to make it on the interior of thar amphala you look up to see immediately clusters of gloomstalkers in the distance they haven't quite gotten a view on you you guys all dart make a stealth check please that's one way to do it okay this building is mostly collapsed there's a small alcove in the corner where part of the secondary story is still there you guys dart into the side of it and you rest there for a minute in quiet (nervous breathing) and you suddenly hear an impact of stone against the wall behind you all of you guys immediately turn around and you watch as the heavy piece of stone that marks the outer part of this building is now cracked and part of it begins to fall in i need scanlan one real scanlan and percy to make dexterity saving throws please what are you going to do are you going take it or not okay cool you only take three points of bludgeoning damage scanlan takes six you reduced three points of damage it crumples over onto you you manage to pull away as you turn around you can see right around the edge of the part of the building that's collapsed and fallen a gloomstalker covered in dust shaking its head as it attempts to stand once more it looks like it's been slammed to the ground or crashed into this wall and you can see it's on the ground (croaking noises) shaking its head and trying to get back up its wings trying to unfurl as it rights its head you see a leaping blur of black armor and red scales climb to the back of the beast grasping the side of its shoulders as it spins back and forth trying to shake it you see this humanoid figure trying to take something and throw it around its throat and its head however it's just not able to grasp it around and gets thrown off the side and to the back you watch as the gloomstalker bucks off the assailant and begins to try and get its wings up once more as the figure leaps up again and shoulder slams it into the wall a second time you get a better look at it now you can see now standing at a pretty decent height about a seven-foot dragonborn of red scale and black hooked armor bladed and angry you see a burning fury in its eyes joe if you want to come to the table please arkhan you've been trying to wrestle this gloomstalker down-- you spent days here trying to find a way to recover from the circumstances that left you here this is the closest thing you've had at this circumstance as you've regained your strength and as you leap onto its back it continues to knock you off to the side you guys see this confrontation happening what do you do all right so what are you guys doing all right so go ahead and make two attacks well he's thrown two daggers yes technically adjacent so you do sneak attack damage that's 51 points of damage you have 46 and four it's 50 points of damage marking that down you see two daggers into the side of the gloomstalker it gives this horrible shrieking shout in pain and rears up i will say given the pain it's had make an athletics check because you are attempting to grapple the entity natural 20 no it is not it's considered a monstrosity that's okay you hear the dragonborn shout out seeing the dagger slam into its side what do you yell to them as they're attacking it at which point it now thrusts the dragonborn off of its back he goes tumbling and rolling onto the ground landing onto your back and you see it-- so now i would like an initiative roll from everybody please travis and separately 25 to 20 anybody all right grog-- all right super low all right 20 to 15 joe and all right 15 to ten vax what'd you get eight wow what'd you get pike all right so vex you're up first you're going to use the-- i have the sheet here so you thrust it out it has to make a dc 15 dexterity saving throw all right let's see here-- natural one natural 20 to natural one back to back as you fall onto your back and shout that out you go rushing towards it and you watch as this glowing long piece of thick rope begins to suddenly wrap around this gloomstalker as it's trying to take off again it gets like a foot off the ground before its wings get pulled up to its body and it falls back onto the ground wrapped and restrained by the rope is anybody else going to do anything right now okay scanlans all right arkhan kind of so it's a dc 17 five plus six that's an eleven it does not succeed you watch as the thrashing around gloomstalker on the ground begins to slowly calm down until it reaches a point where it's not moving it's breathing and you almost hear what sounds like a reverse purr it has a series of spines along the back of the neck but no actual horns it has a head that flares out like a cobra but it's made of shadow where the jaw is its tongue lashes out but instead of saliva it gives off smoke mm-hmm so the gloomstalkers they have no discernible pupil it's a glowing beacon of yellow-white where each eye is and you watch as this dragonborn opens its eyes it's headbutted against it and the dragonborn's eyes now match the coloration of the gloomstalker okay it's still bound by the rope but you get up onto it now you watch as this massive dragonborn gets up onto the gloomstalker which is now currently on the ground trying to right itself now still wrapped in the rope make a perception check you do look and see two more gloomstalkers that have broken away from the cluster that are making their way in your direction okay everyone else following everyone else following suit okay you all right do you leave the gloomstalker where it is and then step inside with them if you want to as you guys all dart inside this alcove in the building-- like most of the roof is gone there's a section of roof that's there it can hide most of you the gloomstalker's a bit large as you all cluster into the space as it looms in (heavy footsteps) this is the second time you've had an allied gloomstalker this close and it's a very upsetting proximity kind of as you guys pull into the side i'd like you all to make a stealth check please unfortunately as you're still riding it and it moves and shifts there is still the plate sitting against it so you would still be at a disadvantage by the way there's your stat sheet for the gloomstalker it's taken 50 damage so you can note that when you have a moment you can yeah and there's a moment of recognition for percival and keyleth it's at this moment you hear two heavy impacts from nearby rooftops as you all stay as silent as possible waiting one of them takes off and you can see it arc barely over the opening but seems to be doing a wide sweep out of visual range the other one appears to be stalking from rooftop to rooftop not far from you (thudding) (sniffing and croaking) it leaps and lands on top of the small part of the roof that's above you guys it holds a few rocks tumble around you as you're quietly in that space hoping (thudding and croaking) its head peeks over the edge and looks straight down right into all of you what are you doing okay so as soon as the head passes over make your attacks you're close enough to get one swipe up because you're on the back of a gloomstalker so as its head peeks down you can get a strike at it it's about i'd say 12 to 15 feet up that hits that hits all righty so okay so those both hit 25 damage all righty you do no oh i'd say arkhan probably is 18 damage that does hit yeah okay go for it okay so you get two attacks with that yep that hits all right and with that as soon as its head peeks over the edge two arrows (whooshing) under its throat and you watch as an axe cuts part of its head clean off as it tries to make a noise but the blade is caught in its throat and prevents the air passage as fane-eater is yanked out of the side you see the jagged edge of the axe arc back causing blood to splatter across the back the wall behind him as arkhan goes in with a second swipe and with one clean cleave motion the head falls and plummets into the ground the rest of the gloomstalker tumbles in lifeless into the rock and you see as it lands its wings sprawl out and slowly the body begins to dissolve into black smoke and shadow technically it was a desert but yeah make a religion check scanlan you have passing knowledge that the symbols that adorn both around arkhan's throat and the shield that he holds up are that of the scaled tyrant tiamat which is the patron god to chromatic and evil dragons all across the world (snarls) oh you did not you should do that yeah pike you roll the temporary hit points so roll 2d10 pike and everyone who was present for that-- all right so you guys gain two additional hit points to your max hit points yeah you weren't there for the meal unfortunately it's from earlier however everyone does still have their advantage on wisdom saving throws and you're immune to fear which is pretty huge and poison the hit points are more of like a bonus you're fine you may if you have yeah-- so that would be 4d4 plus four 50 points of damage were taken off yep you got it okay first off make a perception check as you glance out to see how close you are to the nearby wall 30 okay you notice you're on a different part of the city than you were previously if the city's moving forward if you consider the direction that the titan is traversing forward you guys were to the back and right side of thar amphala like a clock if twelve o'clock is where it was traveling you guys were around four or five o'clock looking now at the layout of the city you're closer to 11 and 12 right now and you're maybe about 200 feet from the nearest wall you can see the curvature of the dome is pretty striking from your current position and you can see the pulses the waves imagine like a reverse waterfall of energy shooting upward and every now and then there's a burst yes you do see the pulses aren't universal there are certain locations about six of them throughout the city that you occasionally see them (bursting) and they spread out you can maneuver there it's not directly behind you but you can eventually get to that location yeah all right i would like you all to make a stealth check are you all walking on foot are you taking the gloomstalker yeah it's currently walking unless you want to hover with it 60 feet as you guys are staying lowkey arkhan is currently riding against the back of this gloomstalker as it's hovering in the air above and the stealth check you're going to be rolling is going to be to see whether or not anything notices you on the back of a gloomstalker the gloomstalker is not going to register on the radar of any of the current watching creatures because it's part of its posse for the moment i would say no because it isn't a movement-based stealth check you're just trying to stay still shit all right you're just clutching the exterior of it trying to stay low you're pulling into your armor like a turtle shell since it is black and using that to try and blend into its form you guys can move along keyleth vax fucking rogue okay okay a five and a six all right so as you guys begin to maneuver through the streets dodging from building to building on the outskirts of thar amphala thankfully the streets are a little more sparse on the edges you also notice as you're traversing and this is interesting all right so as you guys are maneuvering vax vex and keyleth as well you have the high passive perception of the group you notice that the droves of undead that have been clogging the streets of this city and the clusters of cultists that have been running about busily running from location to location with some work on their midst the undead who were just scattered and wandering are now unified and moving in patterns they're now being driven by some intent whereas once they were just scattered amongst and in a holding pattern now they're maneuvering with solid purpose away from the sides of the wall and the shields which enables you to go relatively unnoticed but you're seeing them now gathering towards similar tunnels to the one you came up in you can see dozens and dozens of zombies and skeletons and the occasional robed cultist both warrior and mage alike all beginning to make their way down into the titan at various points in the city as you guys make your way around the edge of the city you follow these pulses they occur every two minutes or so so you have to keep an eye out for it until one happens and then reorient your direction but you taking point on this you lead everybody darting from place to place man rolling shitty-ass perception that's okay for you guys eventually you come around one cluster of exterior buildings it looks to be what was once a manor that was converted to a fortress like a small exterior fortress to this inner circle of thar amphala you curve around and there you see familiar to you from once before the walls that surround the exterior of this inner sanctum of thar amphala and the basis of this field that contains the entirety of the city looking at the wall you can already feel the dangerous vibration of this field being so close there's this violent hum to the air that with each pulse hits this certain frequency of sound that causes your ear to tweak just a hint and you can see violent waves of green-blue magical energy (pulsing) up the side of the wall like a very powerful reverse waterfall shooting up to gather and maintain this field you cannot see the crest the crest was visible from the outside of the wall and the energy field is being produced on the outside of the wall you're on the inside of it but you can gather the base location of where this burst is happening to get an idea of loosely where it might be you don't know correct yes you glance over to where the door was below the crest before and you can see the opposite side of a door currently yes it is shut and appears to be made of hard wood with-- it's iron bar reinforced crosshatch thankfully only rolled a nine the door is locked but it is not trapped 28 okay so the door (clicks) and it's interesting as you put your lockpicks in to feel the tumblers you can feel the metal vibrating like the entire door is just (buzzes) and as you hit it and the door swings open almost like something's been pushing it on the opposite side it swings open and slams on the inside of the frame and there you're looking at a wall of violent green arcane energy (whoosh) coasting by-- actually this is blasting downward right now because the threshold crest as you recall was above the doorway in the wall no it's flush it's on the other side and up on the wall and currently where the door opens there is violent magical energy slamming down it hits the field and there's a violent flash in that section about a foot radius around where it was and the rock shoots past you make a dexterity saving throw 16 strange wow that's the first time you've failed a dex save in a long time oh thank god you take six points of bludgeoning damage that's a d4 plus two but it literally pelts you in the side of jaw and the neck and you turn around and feel it and you can feel the pulsing of the blood begin to flow into the bruise that's going to be there tomorrow there's about a 20 foot gap between the wall and any nearby building and there is the large fortress-like manor that you saw earlier i mean i say fortress-like manor it's not a huge house it's two story and a decent size but it looks like it's been reinforced in the walls like somebody had designed for it to be a place to hold off some sort of a stand probably from the war with pelor's army long ago that's the closest thing to this doorway it's probably more than 20 feet actually it's probably like 30 40 feet yeah i mean overall make a perception check there's a lot of them like there's a lot of them by entropis yeah but you do notice that there's-- where previously there wasn't there's a cloud gathering at the top of this dome funneling down onto entropis okay go ahead and make an attack that hits go ahead and roll damage d4 plus your strength modifier times two that's 30 points of damage with a punch fucking siege man that's good as you slam into it you guys watch as right above the doorway in the door frame the entire wall-- just a spider crack shoots up about 20-- the wall is about 30 feet tall or so actually probably not it's about 20 or so feet and it cracks up to the very top and you watch as large parts of it break off and fall but it hasn't completely collapsed but it's sustained some very serious damage i also need you to go ahead and make a constitution saving throw please awesome well they don't stack the plus four is what you get from the aura 24 all right you suffer-- it would be 14 points of force damage reduced to seven and you're pushed back 20 feet but you're not knocked prone so as you slam into it there's a burst of arcane energy out of that section of the doorway and wall that slams into you you go spinning past spiraling and you catch yourself on the ground about 20 feet away in the middle of the open there catch yourself still don't fucking see you okay i'm rolling so shitty today you take a shot as well all right so as grog spins back and catches himself you walk up to this doorframe with your axe in hand go for it roll an attack 19 hits it's an ac of 18 on the wall it's solid 20 points of damage that'll do it so as grog catches up and look up you watch as arkhan rushes forward and with a giant leap cleaves the axe into the stone as it does the archway collapses downward first off make a constitution saving throw that's not going to do it okay you suffer 16 points of force damage and you get blown back into grog's direction and knocked prone so you catch but the impact actually pushes you back five feet and he falls face first on the ground there's actually a dig in the ground like a groove where the impact is at that point as you watch the wall crumble and collapse you see suddenly dislodged from its position the about two and half foot wide threshold crest stone that is embedded in the wall there crumples downward and falls out of its space as it does there's a series of bursts of vibrant arcane energy that shoot up the wall causing this side of the wall to glow exponentially brighter than the rest of the shield at which point like a large slice of pie one sixth of the dome falls inward and for the first time since you've arrived you see the non-filtered sky above of the darkened clouds that have completely encased the upper atmosphere of othanzia you also glance past where it crumbled as the city is at a slight angle forward the way it's placed on the front of the titan and you look down and see immediately around the familiar sight of the vasper timberlands that surround the exterior of vasselheim and there ahead not more than maybe a few miles off you can assume from this distance you see the singular mountain pillar that vasselheim is built around and the outer wall in sight everyone make a perception check please okay those who got over 20 there's this small victory and this moment of joy and accomplishment that is immediately washed over by the realization of how close you are to the city the two hours that you were gone still better than a full rest however has put you within proximity of the city and you hear this familiar large airy reedy stretched screech in the distance you glance over and you see in the distance barreling down in your direction a skeletal dragon familiar to you not far before there's a tower-like structure and then there's that building that was reinforced to be a-- if you all are rushing into this building everyone make a stealth check please if you want to still stay out in the open that is up to you they're all darting into a building so the choice is yours you can stay with your beast he is you're on top of him so do you want to try and blend into his form okay then make a stealth check you would not be within 30 feet of her once she enters the building so make an athletics check as this happens you immediately climb down to the underbelly of the gloomstalker to maintain hold on it because its physical form-- and it's interesting now that you've been this close to it and you've been wrestling it you feel it's partially corporeal there's something about its physicality that is almost gelatinous like it's made up of a combination of shadow and physical will and as you clutch into it your fingers dig and begin to seep into it almost like a cluster of tar but it holds you fast and you're there underneath make a stealth check without disadvantage but this will-- gloomstalkers are actually sexless they have no natural-- you do not okay good to know the rest of you guys okay okay as you guys all dart into this building you all quietly listen outside as you maintain hovering in place the skeletal dragon (croaking) swoops down as its wings catch itself the wind billows through the space in the center here you can see a bunch of the dust and pebbles and loose rubble that's been built up around here and the wall that was left behind just gets kicked up and spins a brief dust devil in the vicinity the skeletal dragon there still flying make a perception check he's kept relatively close to the building no okay as soon as the dragon gets close-- and you've seen it flying about up in the stratosphere area of this dome before-- you can see there are still bits of flesh dangling off of the bones and it is a familiar-colored flesh whereas you and your adventuring party had traveled here before this risen dragon form seems to have been torn from the corpse of the mount that brought you to this city you see as the skull of its body its eyes crackling bright blue-green energy there on the back of this dragon you see two humanoids standing on its back you see a dark armored male with pale skin with a well-kept beard and short hair with his arm around the waist of a female who's currently clutching onto the back of its bones you can see the woman in a red robe that's being blown up her hair bound in the front wild behind as she has a necklace bauble that hangs around her neck crackling blue-green energy as she has her hand forward she glances around at the space angrily what (heavy breathing) looks over at the gloomstalker oh what have we here is this your doing (screeches) adorable wouldn't you say so honey and the man behind her goes oh quite well i'm a fan of taking thorns out of my side is it time we do a bit of surgery darling and the woman goes but of course oh how i've missed you and she nuzzles into his neck a bit and turns around the dragon lands onto the tower across the way facing in the direction of the gloomstalker and it inhales and you watch as it begins to breathe in all of the shards of bone matter that have been scattered across the streets of the city begin to whip up and spiral into its ribcage like a blender as it pulls back (roar) and as the dragon's mouth opens it releases a blast of bone shards that arc out in front of you you and the gloomstalker each i need-- you and the gloomstalker make a dexterity saving throw please correct there you go they've landed on a tower right across from the building where you guys are let me show you (cheering) i had a few possibilities if that was the way it went you guys would have been dead a long time ago i did currently riding your gloomstalker yep yeah well i'm putting it there because that's the range of the blast right there all right so you guys let's go ahead and figure out your placement here you guys rushed into this building here you guys rushed around and into this side so you guys were in the base floor here where do you want to be sure so i'll put you at the window there who else is placed where there's a couple of small slits but they're facing out this way that's more for flavor there would be no attic windows it's been reinforced so there's been placed armor on the bottom the only windows that are available are the ones up top and even then only have arrow slits fair enough vax are you up with your sister all right so you bamf trinket out okay we'll put grog-- we'll say that you were probably down in this building being as quiet as you can percival scanlan keyleth pike up on the second level okay so we'll put you up there all right scanlan i need a second scanlan we'll say for the purposes of this-- this will be tiny scanlan scanlan where are you right here there's small slits they're all armored up all right okay we'll put that there so we'll say for the purposes of this you guys would be-- no sure so now that we're set thank you for your patience so what did you roll you and your gloomstalker that's true that's with their plus six the gloomstalker gets a plus six dexterity saving throw right says under saving throws dex plus six wait does it no it's dex plus eight sorry all right you both succeeded on the save so you take half damage which is only 26 points of necrotic damage sorry piercing damage not necrotic so as the bone shards go slamming into each of you that completes the dragon's turn now everybody please roll initiative (groans) 26 yes you would separately i'll say for the ease of it let's make it on your turn there's a lot going on here all righty 25 to 20 right 25 to 20 i just said that right yeah 20 to 15 nice 18 17 nice no that's in the studio 15 to ten all right keyleth what did you get so is that everybody i believe that's everybody i know be good all right first up first grog it's you yep you're already raging you are now up with these assholes right there that you can (heavy impact) i'd put that at about 35 i'd say you've got 15 feet still well one dash so you get to the top of the tower and you are now base to base with the dragon radius-wise he's close to you still you are within melee of the dragon you may that's your turn grog vax you're up all right so vex you may sure 25 to hit yeah even with shield she couldn't stop that that hits grog's in melee with the dragon i'll say because she was not aware of you they were only aware of him it's sneak attack it's not a crit it's not a surprise attack but you get sneak attack 31 all right 31 points of damage okay what is it 17 nope that misses as you lean through the window you release the first arrow and as delilah's up there both clutching the necklace and has her hand out with this wand you hit her hand with the arrow (snarls) looks over and looks down at the window right towards you and there's a moment of recognition as she sees you as you fire the second arrow she dodges it and goes i remember you okay so you duck off to the side of the window okay good to know all right that ends your turn with that it is now delilah's turn she rolled a 19 for initiative all right she is going to point her finger down at the wall where all of you guys are and a thin green ray streaks out from her finger seems to be i'm just confirming the size of the space that it can disintegrate there we go this entire wall right here this entire wall is disintegrated in place and now reveals entirely vex and vax as she pulls her finger back and the wall turns to dust around you you hear her say i'm sorry honey but no it is now the dragon's turn let's see if it gets its breath attack it does regenerate the dragon (wingbeats) you get an attack of opportunity i should have put tape on the bottom of them that's my fault as the dragon (wingbeats) you get an attack of opportunity on the dragon 34 that hits thank you kindly mr brian foster it is hovering right above the ground it's trying to get down into the space of the wall that's currently exposed please pass the tape over here okay how much damage is that grog yes 32 points of damage to the dragon nice so as it swoops up the dragon takes one arc with the blade and as it streaks across it slams into part of its foot and you watch as the bone splinters upon impact with the sword of kas as the dragon lands it brings its head down into the gap where the opening is and arches forward as it does it fills the entirety of the space it inhales a second time you watch as all the bits of bone spiral up into it it regenerated for the second time no it's a saving throw on you guys' part as it releases this torrent of bone shards and rock and whatever it can pull up into its chest and releases it i need everybody in that room both scanlans keyleth percival-- cover's not going to help you on this unfortunately it fills the whole space dexterity saving throws guys okay all right both succeed 18 barely succeeds barely missed it 31 succeeds all righty the only person to take full damage on this is keyleth right sorry double-checking on the bard ability cutting words roll a d12 that is 49 points of piercing damage to you keyleth the rest of you take 24 yes it fills the space there and you feel every ounce of exposed skin and flesh has been hit with a thousand needles that ends its turn percival you're up probably i'd say about 15 feet roll for the attack that'll hit natural five so as she's holding the wand out with the hand (gunshot grunts) she glances back and as the smoking gun is there she goes i certainly remember you her hand is now covered in blood and you can see one of the fingers looks heavily damaged grog is not in melee okay 14 points got it that hits so 11 to sylas no save right he gets blasted off the back of the dragon so he gets blown off and lands prone on the ground shit that hits put her behind the dragon actually both should be behind the dragon they did they both took 2d6 each five points of bludgeoning damage each that ends your turn percival arkhan you're up did you say you went into a frenzied rage earlier okay yes you would go for it both miss unfortunately its claws streak out in front of it and unfortunately scrape against the bone to no effect but you have your turn if you're going reckless attacks you can then yes you can you're going frenzied rage as opposed to regular rage he used his bonus action to rage right that hits correct 2nd 3rd-level and undead correct 49 points of damage on the first hit so as you rush up and the gloomstalker is scratching towards it you rush with a giant arc you watch as fane-eater's blade springs forth these darkened spray of colors red green black every chromatic dragon's power thrust into the blade as you slam it into the undead dragon watching bones splinter and break from the blast of dark energy go for it as you pull the axe back you arc a secondary time this time with the sound of a union of four different dragon cries the fifth one being your own as you slam the axe a second time hitting the edge of its clavicle it carves through and breaks you can see part of the bones shatter and reform but still broken and not in the same way it's a serious round sylas briarwood is going to move his speed would you hand me sylas please he's prone so has half it he moves through he gets partway through the dragon we'll say so he's about there that ends your turn end of your turn all right sylas' turn sylas seeing you come up and destroy the dragon grins climbs up the side of the dragon jumps onto its thigh and jumps in the air towards you holding a giant blackened greataxe in his hand (groans) he's going to go ahead and make a strike at you oh you know what no he's not going to sylas instead axe in one hand grabs the side of the skeletal ribcage hanging off looks up at you you seem rather strong and looks you dead in the eyes i need you to make a wisdom saving throw you already used your reaction buddy it's true cutting words only-- you can't give a bonus to somebody's saving throw you can reduce an enemy's saving throw through mythcarver oh shit he would've charmed you and you would've had to start fighting them travis and as he stares at you you feel this cold presence consume the back of your mind and you feel drawn to him it's this force of charisma and drive and as you begin to lean forward towards it you feel this (thump) in your holy symbol and as you glance you break the gaze for a second and look down and you see the multi-colored fury of tiamat reach up and block and obscure the vision from him and as the flames burn off you look up and the presence is gone and he looks at you with a frustrated glance he's going to use the rest of his movement to dart back around the side of the tower he used a legendary action to get up and get his movement then on his turn he got his movement that brings us to pike sure you get to about where the twins are everyone within 30 feet that you can see gets affected that you can see does it say which is 30 feet you'd be able to see percival down there grog is farther than 30 feet yeah arkhan's in direct vision sanctuary is a bonus action sanctuary means that if something tries to attack you it has to make a wisdom saving throw to see if it does so or not end your turn pike your movement would've gotten you just up to the stairs at that point because you had to climb up it at the end of that turn swooping down you hear two impacts on the roof above you you hear the growling tearing sound as the long dry rotten wooden rooftops that are above you guy get pulled open by two gloomstalkers that've joined the fray they do not count as undead now the roof is open its damaged bits and parts of it are fallen inward you guys can move around but they have visual on you but that's all they can do this turn it took their full movement and action to break in that's going to end their turn scanlan you're up scanlan one scanlan two as in the-- a simulacrum can not be healed except by-- they can be repaired correct correct kind of yep you would know this having known the spell and the significance of its creation if it is damaged you can repair it in an alchemical laboratory using rare herbs and minerals worth a hundred gold per hit point no he can heal other things the skeleton dragon breath okay oh shit both of these guys appear behind the dragon right behind it i'm allowing you guys to move things thank you all right so that's your action and bonus action scanlan two hasn't gone yet scanlan two is at the very end with keyleth there you go all right vax you're up actually at the end of the turn sylas is going to use another legendary action he got them back actually because he used it before last turn so he uses his first legendary action to head up he runs up the side (impacts) he glances down looking towards where you are all right that's going to bring us to vax's turn yeah she would have cover in this circumstance but you avoid it with sharpshooter so you can yes 27 to hit hits she's prone so yeah you have disadvantage on the attack against her it's a ranged attack you don't have advantage against her because there's nothing giving you advantage no her being prone against ranged attacks it's with disadvantage roll a second time sharpshooter means he ignores cover doesn't give him advantage on the attack roll hold on what was that one 18 technically would hit she's going to use shield as a reaction to add plus five to her ac she's on her back and sees the dagger and goes (ping) and deflects it off what was the dc on that one 18 she has a plus ten wisdom save so that's going to put her at a 20 72 right but it's not sneak attack though no worries all right okay technically i'd consider it to change dagger generally because you're throwing them so fast all right that ends your turn vax at the end of your turn sylas is going to use his second legendary action sylas that's not what this is sylas is using a legendary action this has nothing to do with delilah sylas is going to use his second legendary action at the end of your turn to take a swing at grog with his greataxe of the eclipse that is a 21 that is 14 points of damage reduced to seven and i need you to make a wisdom saving throw please as the blade sinks across you you resist the impact but you feel this cold sensation across the wound that begins to spill across your body you angrily in your rage flex against it and manage to withstand and shrug off the effect that ends that next up is keyleth and scanlan two make a perception check i'd say probably actually you watched her get knocked back you're fine okay that is a four plus one no okay entangle is an action actually i can finally use the layer over here all right you leap over that's the rest of your turn after entangling her you run leap and as the wind from the mantle picks up you watch this gust of wind lift her make an athletics check okay not too bad that's enough it was maybe a 15-foot jump at this point and it's tripled because of your mantle so you leap and land transforming into the elemental and grappling onto its back all right that ends your turn keyleth scanlan two she is yes physically you get advantage on attacks against her it's a melee spell so you get advantage on the attack roll yeah it's 5th-level and you've cast it at 6th correct so it's an additional 2d8 to the punch you already said 6th you have to roll to hit first so d20 with advantage yeah that hits so roll your 6d8 all right sing to the space where he was all right so when he gets back give him the d12 okay at the end of your turn sylas is going to use his last legendary action to move his speed without provoking opportunity attacks he leaps off the side and lands right next to delilah he's not entangled i don't think because he wasn't there for the casting difficult terrain means he moves across at half okay good to know all righty so entangled okay yeah got it cool that ends the legendary action grog you're up sure make an athletics check that's easy enough make an athletics check actually in case something goes horribly bad you are raging so you get advantage okay easy enough at that height you take eight points of bludgeoning damage reduced to four and (impact) you land arcing over her both feet to each side of her and you're standing looming over her body as she's wrapped up in vines going (grunting) okay as you pull the blade up the voice goes yes her she's part of the web her her and you give into the fury go ahead and make your attacks correct well she's restrained roll the damage first she's hurt but she's not terrible yet yeah you roll the damage die double that add the modifiers and then the additional damage we'll see-- three at 17th level yeah so 3d10 additional correct okay so as you bring the blade down with this horrible screaming hiss-- yeah 62 points of damage the blade jams into her chest and as you twist it she screams and the blood from the wounds sprays out in the middle of the air freezes and then slips into the blade as it's sucking up the blood she's like (grunts) entangled and she reaches up and grabs the blade and begins to start pulling it out of the wound she's (choking) as blood begins splattering up around her mouth but she's still alive roll again okay roll damage 24 you jam the blade in a second time and gash across and it carves open this part of her chest and you can see the blood spatter out the bones are exposed and she's on the ground shaking she's hanging on by a tether and her eyes are going wild and she glances over and her hand goes out and you can see sylas who's right next to her his eyes are wide and he's reaching out to grasp for her hand is that the end of your turn oh you're frenzied raging right that hits roll damage 23 points of damage are you rolling extra undead damage on this on these attacks because she's not undead right but you rolled 3d10 there she's not undead though no you've been adding that to all the attacks okay noted roll-- roll 4d10 for me right now i'm going to retract that from the damage she's taken she's still wounded but she's not hanging on by that thread okay so the damage you rolled for that attack roll the d10 and add your modifiers it's okay so as you hack in a third time with the blade making a smear of blood across the ground the entangled vines that hold her there are soaked in crimson at this point and she's coughing and sputtering you can see the open wounds in her chest and her hand reaching out sylas and he's going for her at that point that's the end of your turn she's still alive vex you're up no she's alive correct no that ends your turn vex with a ranged attack yes because she is-- well she's restrained which gives her advantage so technically it would be just a regular attack roll go for it yeah that hits 47 points of damage with the sharpshooter how do you want to do this (cheering) she was reaching out for that dimension door you see her hand reaching out and you see her fingers tracing the incantation in the air as sylas' hand reaches outstretched for hers as she reaches out her eyes are locked with sylas she's not even paying attention to grog at this point all she's focused on is escape and grog as you look down at her and sylas is looking into her face reaching out the arrow just (impact) through the jaw and out the side of her cheek there (breath catches) and her eyes go cold the spell incantation fades and the hand just twitches and falls to the ground still as that happens sylas his hand still reached out goes (yelling) no he turns around to look at you vengeance i suppose is mine this time this is a unique reversal of last time okay 28 minus five yeah that hits that is the end of delilah briarwood clones take a while gotcha is that the end of your turn they seemed to be okay all right first things first as soon as delilah's body goes lifeless keyleth you feel this sudden shift beneath your feet as the bone structure that maintains the body of the skeletal dragon collapses entirely (cheering) you suffer 11 points of bludgeoning damage percy you're up with a speed of 30 you can do that yeah they just got there last turn percy what are you doing percy roll your attack that'll hit okay he's going to use legendary resistance to succeed his first one all righty 18 got it all right go ahead and roll damage he does actually what's the dc on it he rolled 20 exactly that hits that is a 20 again 16 plus four both times as he's there his arm out and he's seething with rage his eyes burning bright red like the same shade as grog's which is disconcerting each bullet hits him and he doesn't react (bullets hitting) he's just looking down at her and back up at vex and down at her is that your turn no they're there oh well 15 misses he puts a hand up without even watching and deflects the bullet from the air 20 to hit he's going to use his reaction to use parry and the second bullet with the other hand he shoots it off to the side not even looking at you just staring at vex still glaring at the space you were when you ran okay yes you do that ends your turn arkhan technically they are yeah that's what they were going to do next turn so that's a two on the one gloomstalker that is a 14 they both fail both of the other gloomstalkers all of a sudden (croaking) their heads begin writhing around they are stunned until their next turn and sylas is going to use his second legendary resistance of the day correct fly this over to him cool and exactly 32 does hit yes he is he is a vampire she's dead the skeleton fell into piles of bones she's not okay she's a slashed-up human her whole torso is a mess she has an arrow through her jaw and cheek 28 points all right so as you rush forward with your axe you swing down into sylas who gets slammed in the side of the shoulder and as the spark of the divine smite energy slams into his side you can see him he's starting to feel the pinch all of you surrounding him roll again it's a dice actually 19 does not hit unfortunately okay so you're rolling your third strike yeah 27 hits roll damage first attack slams into it and bursts second one you swing and sylas' form turns to shadow temporarily and dissipates around the blade and returns the third hit does strike true in the back of the head (yelps) he yelps out in pain as the blast bursts upward you can see the flesh burning from the impact of the radiant damage that end your turn that brings us to sylas' turn sylas does not regenerate because the radiant damage kept it at bay radiant damage prevented his regeneration looking at his current circumstance he's going to-- you watch as he glances around and his body (whoosh) into a bat it's not a spell (groaning) turns into a bat (fluttering) you don't get to grab you get an attack of opportunity you get an attack of opportunity you get an attack of opportunity and grog gets an attack of opportunity bigby's hand does not get reactions yeah one attack that's not how a vampire bat form works it's not a polymorph he has the same hit points in the bat form as he does in his normal form you go first okay roll an attack 24 hits because the snatch is a special attack essentially as a reaction because a reaction gives you a melee attack it's not an actual attack towards him-- let me double-check here for you guys real fast just double checking here okay i will say because i don't allow monsters to use special attacks as reactions and haven't used them the entire game against you guys because that would've been much more dangerous i won't allow it for this circumstance but it does still do the damage on the regular attack it'll still hit go ahead and roll damage this got really weird suddenly no that's fine actually no i do need two of those okay cool make your attack of opportunity your attack of opportunity and your attack of opportunity no (ricochet noise) off his armor that hits roll damage hits roll damage yes d8 additional damage yep 17 travis thank you 22 what does it say it does i'll pull it up here we go okay a strength saving throw that's a natural one so he's going to use his last legendary resistance to resist it he's out of legendary resistances now all right and damage on that one all of his equipment goes into his form as you all slam into the side of this bat form it shrieks out and then just (flapping) it takes off and is going to use its action to go ahead and go into a dash and continue to fly away oh yeah no we're coming back to that he is at that full speed and that form-- okay so that ends sylas' turn pike you're up he would be about-- let's say at that flying speed of the bat which i have to look up now because that's a thing i know what is this bullshit matt jesus christ the bat's flying speed is 30 feet so he's 60 feet away from you guys at an angle that way yeah 60 feet up there all right pike what are you doing okay guiding bolt i believe you have to roll your attack on that one yeah make a ranged spell attack 18 does not hit okay you can use it on yourself right that's what it is yeah go for it that hits go ahead and roll damage 6d6 radiant damage bicoastal roll 23 (impact) the bat now is shining the next attack against it has advantage end of your turn all right end of your turn going to use its legendary action to move at speed the bat is now 90 feet away that ends your turn that brings us to scanlan oh the gloomstalkers actually which are no longer stunned but that's the end of their turn end of the gloomstalkers' turn it's going to use another legendary action to move another 30 so it's 120 feet away scanlan you're up he's just full sprint 120 feet yeah sure all right end of scanlan's turn will use third and final legendary action is now 150 feet away we're now at vax's turn they can hold their action but then at the end of their turn he still gets to do movement okay they both have an ac of 15 no because a grapple check is a versus got it ends your turn keyleth you're up 150 feet from where he was what's the save he has to make that is 22 17 plus five 17 plus five it's a saving throw it's not an attack yeah the earthbind does not take effect on him unfortunately-- no it's an action to cast the spell sorry okay scanlan two anything he can run 25 feet yeah you're just under-- okay all righty bigby's hand punches-- okay we'll say for the purposes of this they're-- they're pretty easily killed given the circumstances you guys have the chase now-- let's say grog you go up there and start anything you want to do-- okay for the purposes of expediency in this so we don't spend time just trudging through these things you guys just hacking at these gloomstalkers okay i will say to note that the control feature generally is a once-a-day type thing-- not like it can constantly regenerate to the next thing we get to sylas' turn sylas dashes twice-- sorry it's your turn then sylas' so go ahead with which gun okay oh sorry you're first go for it as soon as you go around that side you're starting to get close up to you you have scanlan all the way over there you barely have scanlan in your-- ten feet out the window fenthras does not change your range well the way longbows work is you have an inner range and an outer range so if he's beyond-- yeah your max is 600 yep guiding bolt go for it 20 just hits (cheering) no but you have the two different ranges because your range is technically 30 to 60 but you can go the full 60 without taking disadvantage after 30 feet no disadvantage as a sharpshooter it's a crazy feat 43 points of damage that is a nine plus five that is a 14 (cheering) he does take a little bit he's about 80 feet up from there because he's going at an angle so he takes 8d6 bludgeoning damage and with that you watch as the bat form (poof) dissipates the brambles fall weak and open make a perception check make a perception check you see a misty cloud in the space where sylas was 28 to what yeah you see the mist yeah yep dash as your action it's finishing vex's okay so percy your turn all right we'll say for the purposes of this the mist travels and vanishes from sight by the time you are able to catch up to it to get it to a place where you can destroy it delilah briarwood has been destroyed seemingly for the last time sylas has been driven to wherever he needs to recover yes as you look out you can see the mist and the mist vanishes and you can see now looking up dozens and dozens of gloomstalkers have all turned to see this out-in-the-open action that's now taking place in the space around you you are all out not being stealthy firing and shooting out into the air and you see now clusters of these things heading in your direction as you turn and look to the side you watch as delilah's body gets up from the ground as the shambling corpse of delilah falls to her knees before arkhan-- as the realization begins of what is coming at you two you could handle maybe there's a lot in your direction you have revealed your position the wall was already destroyed and everything is swarming in your direction as you all begin to turn around you hear this deafening roar from the sky above you you glance up to see a flash of brass light as devo'ssa comes swooping into the barrier behind a hundred or more wyvern riders risen from vasselheim to join the rest of the brigade come swarming in and collide with the gloomstalkers you now see a frantic dog-fight cluster as hundreds of one and hundreds of the other begin slamming into each other tearing each other apart you see blades swing you see arrows going flying and devo'ssa begins to do sweeping rounds back and forth across the sky you realise if there is a moment to move with the distraction it's now the glowing sparkle light in it is inert now you guys begin bolting your way towards entropis with its large funnel-like cloud encircling the top of its spire and we're going to take a break (cheering) we're going to take a quick break because we want to probably push to 11 tonight and then we're going to leave so make a quick restroom break fast as we can come back see you guys here in just a minute okay guys we'll see you here in a few minutes welcome back a little longer than i anticipated but that's fine we're going to jump in here but before we do that the winners for the wyrmwood box we have zabando is the winner for the jocks machina shirt we have alcyon299 congratulations you get to join the very exclusive jocks machina club so bringing it back in as you guys are charging your way toward entropis running through the streets you do the best you can to dodge in and out of any sort of things that might catch your attention street-side you see most of the undead and various cultists have been filtering down beneath the city a while back and you're not entirely certain where they are at the moment the few dregs there are around there you guys easily enough dodge around pushing forward you see the spire of entropis growing taller and taller the closer and closer you get to it as soon as you get to the base of the spire you look up and you can see the broken seams of the once-toppled tower now held together by the network of glowing magical threads like arcane veins wrapping the tower and lending an unsettling organic nature to its visage the exterior still stands windowless like an obelisk of tyranny looming over the entirety of the city the apex of course is now obscured by shadow and cloud this slow-spinning tornado of twilight darkness entwining the top blocking visibility and possibly entry at the top numerous gloomstalkers encircle the higher level not currently engaging in the main fray which is chaos all around you see more emerging from this cloud almost seemingly creating them the large front doors of the tower appear somewhat ajar and open there is one rot behemoth currently standing in front of this door vox machina what do you want to do perception glancing around you don't see anything it looks like this is the door entrance to it you could make an investigation check but you'd have to get up against the wall and carefully check it you can certainly try you can certainly try it's not a no you're about 40 feet away from it off to the side glancing over where you can see the rot behemoth looming in the archway by the way as you've made this journey forward and delilah's been shambling behind you know sitting behind you this strange pain has been hitting you in the back of your shoulders you glance back and look at the corpse of delilah behind you as a rapidly growing tree is protruding and growing out of the chest of the corpse and is now setting weight off of the top of the gloomstalker as it's trying to flutter up behind the party it's less of a spell effect and more of a divine seed that was placed inside her body when she was slain by the vestige fenthras don't make it weird it's still growing and it's now protruding about four feet from her chest the body is now starting to get a little top-heavy yeah it's not very thick it's maybe about-- okay so you take a couple hacks at it and eventually you manage to cut away the tree now there's a trunk that's now stopped growing about a foot out of delilah's chest with roots that have taken root up into the shoulders and the chest sure a house you have this rot behemoth at the entryway what are you guys doing the rot behemoth it's undead the rot behemoth is about 12 feet tall or so just a mass of stitched-together undead flesh large okay so you take the pulse stone you tie it around-- you see a flash and a flare in the sky above you you see a cluster of gloomstalkers immolated by a burst of flame breath from devo'ssa who's now up in the stratosphere at this same time you see about a dozen or so wyvern riders go riding into this slow spinning storm and get disintegrated into pieces make a strength check for me that's a bit of a lob it makes it about the 20 feet you intended to (clattering) so what was the range on this pulse stone okay it is within range to affect the rot behemoth that's true yeah tink tink it's a will save for the rot behemoth wisdom that's a two no you guys watch as the rot behemoth the stone (clattering) its metal-armored face and glowing coal eyes turn (heavy footsteps) and walks over to the gem and stares at it make a concentration check for me real fast make a constitution saving throw okay you maintain the concentration referring to the blast from the skeletal dragon earlier on all right so did you guys all roll stealth zombie's not stealthed but it is undead gloomstalker it's hard to be stealthed that gloomstalker right now okay you can do that no it's a short rest yeah you put it back on your neck once you've-- correct okay as you step off and look into its eyes your eyes flare the bright yellow color and the gloomstalker nods takes a step back and then leaps onto the side of the tower its claws gripping in as it bats its wings it takes off and starts heading upward it seems to acknowledge your command okay so 27 two and two 15 15 natural 20 he always has a ten minimum all right so as you guys all dart in around this rot behemoth who pays no mind to your presence you dart into the partially ajar doorway into the base of entropis the tower itself it's dark inside as soon as you all dart into the interior the doors are still partially open and you can see the faint glow of the very low general light that encompasses the city of thar amphala the normal greenish-blue glow of the shield is offset a little bit by the natural light that's coming through from the opening of the barrier that you guys have opened however the light still diminishes as you step into this large chamber as soon as you enter the chamber those of you with darkvision glance around and see it's a big thoroughfare you see a large foyer-type chamber with pillars that go from bottom to maybe 25 30 feet up to a ceiling across the way you can see two spiral staircases that curl upward and there maybe 30 or so humanoid figures that are in the center of this chamber well as soon as you guys step and turn around they all turn and look at you and begin to-- (sluggish footsteps) i mean a lot of them are going to be right up on you right now they are undead they appear to be mostly of the baseline skeletal or zombie variety it's a cluster of undead that are set here okay you yank it go ahead and make a roll see if it's destroyed or not all right the stone (clattering) arcs in the center the blue pulse-glow light billows out you see the various skeletons and zombies charge into the light they stop and stare at it let's see okay so of the 30 or so about 20 of them stop and stare at the glow while you hear a bounding heavy footfall sound behind where you came from no you pulled the stone from where you were inside the chamber now so he's now rushing in after where the stone went possibly up to you guys but technically undead are still rushing in toward you and they're immediately scrambling with their claws and teeth out there let's say for the people at front here it's going to be probably the two of you who first made it in so three attacks against each of you that is an 18 against you vax that is a 20 against you no that misses three against you natural 20 a 20 and a natural one all right so while they scramble at you and you push them back at bay one of them does manage to get through it's going to be 12 points of slashing damage against you vex as one of them swings at you with a rusty blade that carves past you all right what are you guys doing about 30 of them yeah you have your channel divinity your turn undead or destroy undead okay so as you rush in toward where this pulse stone is as the crowd of undead are gathered in you hunker down clutch your holy symbol and release a wave of divine energy the whispers and prayer of sarenrae emanating from you like a caustic wave against undead energy what's the dc on that it's your spell dc okay 18 it's okay i lost count even with their saves four undead survive as the shock wave emanates out from you you watch as about two dozen of these various skeletons and zombies many of which are grasping at you turn to ash one of them you see it reaching out toward you you get a glimpse of it you can see this one's a fresher corpse one of the zombies it has dirty blonde hair a torn chin with stubble and for a brief minute you can see-- it has this gash in its stomach a partially eaten arm for a brief minute as it reaches out for you before the wave hits you're like aldor turns to ash a member of the slayer's take once the prized love of-- as the flash expands you glance around and you see a withered gnome corpse has been reaching toward you mostly bald head in places you recognize this is one of your companions grubby before the wave hits and he turns to ash all of these are long dead as this burst of energy hits and all of a sudden dust and ash fill the chamber around you-- the rot behemoth behind-- what is the dc on him yeah it's higher than a challenge rating four so it doesn't affect him at all but the four of you easy enough to cleave him down but we'll see if he's even affected by the stone so the last four that are there as they charge into the stone nope none of them make their save so the last four that are still there all stop and stare and glare at this stone in the center of the chamber the rot behemoth comes looming in (crashing) what's the dc 14 does not make it by one that's true that's true so the rot behemoth (crashing) through the door and then stays there staring at the stone blocking the doorway and holding it in place but now this chamber's open they'll keep following you every time you pull the stone they're going to come toward you we'll say easy enough for you guys to coordinate the skeletons are easy enough to destroy the rot behemoth all in one swoop you guys can take down as one quick blast on it one of the skeletons you also recognize a heavily charred zombie making a horrid sighing sound as it's sitting there staring at the stone you see the remains of vander burnt to a cinder the last thing you saw was him being immolated and screaming okay and with that before you destroy the zombie-- wisdom save three nope you've got two zombies delilah and now your previous ally vander turns from the stone (wheezing) all right make an investigation check what'd you roll 18 okay how long does beacon of hope last beacon is gone technically it's a full hour by the rules i let it slide a little faster in times of intensity i'd allow a 30-minute quick rest but that's still-- okay all right so you guys are taking a short rest in the inside of entropis there is no super-short rest it's a short rest vasselheim was in sight when you were outside i'm just letting you know he regenerates 25-- well there's a lot of things at work here it depends roll a religion check all right but still roll a religion check seeing as how undead is your domain plus okay okay you know this because of your experience with undead and amassing yourself a necromantic energy since breaking your oath long ago when a vampire is reduced to zero hit points and goes into mist form it has two hours to return to its resting place when it reaches its resting place it has to rest for one hour once it rests for the one hour it goes back to one hit point and then it regenerates 25 hit points or at least sylas every single round i'd say 30-ish minutes or so 30 or 40 because you've been slowly stealthing your way through being careful so if you take a short rest you're probably going to look at a sylas waiting for you somewhere up top no meaning if you guys take a short rest he needs to rest for an hour it took you 40 minutes since that happened to get to the tower if you take a short rest you're going to have to deal with a sylas you could take a short rest but understand and be prepared with the knowledge of knowing that you're also going-- put some things in your chamber that will be helpful against a vampire you do have a battery of low-level spell slots right now that can be used to heal things up if you want to make a choice here guys you're wasting time in the tower you can use cure wounds as opposed to healing word oh that's right never mind that takes a short rest to do ten minutes to say the speech perhaps yeah you've got it 4d4 plus four consider now as you guys climb the tower if you have any buff spells if you have any long-lasting things that you want to utilize for the coming fray freedom of movement death ward all the things you guys want to prepare with now's the time to do it you still have the tower to climb but know if you have spells like buffs to cast that aren't concentration and last a while now's the time to do it wait how many slots is that for you guys then three each okay okay anything else you want to buff with okay no death wards you did death ward to yourself so what's the plan guys that's up to you guys you can't see the height of the tower it goes up into another floor if you want to hold your spells until you get higher i'll let you do that up to you i mean it goes pretty high right above you way up just letting you guys be prepared here because you're vox machina okay take your 17-- no 19-- 19 temporary hit points including you yeah well you get temporary hit points like a buffer shield correct okay right there is only one person that can complete the incantation of sealing once the trammels are in-- ascending the stairs you climb and climb the spiral continuing upward both of the stairs spiral upward so which direction did you take the right or the left the left okay you spiral upward and upward and upward climbing an extremely long period of time your legs begin to ache a little bit then another floor opens up it appears the tower is now divided into two chambers from the bottom floor up it's now two sides to a tower and you're on the right side the hallway curves around the outer edge of the tower on the opposite side you can see the staircase continues upward the interior of this chamber appears to be an incredible arcane laboratory occupying the center space of the tower inside you see six overlapping circles of dulled runes and glyphs that encompass the entire 30-foot walkway between here and the stairs shelves and tables of countless glass tubes and metallic vices lay out across tables organized in a near-ocd pattern tomes and books line the inner chamber walls what do you guys do you sense around no undead in the 60-foot radius you don't know from where you are now you can't even see it's too far away you can check for traps investigation okay i mean there's symbols across the ground here but they seem pretty inert three of the circles in the center of the chamber appear to be ready to trigger by proximity a five-foot proximity it's across the way around the outside of the tower wall so you can follow along most of you can it's a very tight walk to get through you have a few large individuals there are three large circles that overlap with each other that are triggerable and then there are three inert ones that overlap it's like a series of venn diagrams yes they do okay make an intelligence check these traps are far beyond your understanding to disable you glance at these and go oh this is bad i need everybody except for arkhan and grog to go ahead and make a general dexterity check okay okay so what'd you get everybody except for arkhan and-- dexterity check you add your dexterity modifier scanlan did yeah it's not an ability check it's a saving throw one is an auto-fail for a saving throw no next would have been partially across because you couldn't get across you're too wide okay that's fine and you got a four okay so as you guys are moving across scanlan and pike you both are clustered next to each other unfortunately pike begins to wobble you reach to grab her and pull her in but the armored weight is too strong and you both accidentally step out of place at which point the glyph to your left suddenly flares you watch as in a flash of sudden arcane energy a cage of force-like power encompasses the both of you in a cube you see these bars of crackling energy (lighting crackle) around you're both currently stuck within this arcane entrapment the gnomes well they're currently blocking the path now with this cage okay as you clasp pike and complete the incantation i need you to make a charisma saving throw it is 20 20 will do it so as you grab her and you both begin to transport outside of the cage you feel the force of it push back but the nature of your innate magical ability manages to puncture through that threshold and then both of you reappear at the opposite side no worse for wear the cage is still present though and it's now blocking the path across the rest of you get across fine it's the gnomes that got stuck and now the two of you are on the opposite end you have 30 feet between you and the opposite side and that walkway is entirely closed off okay the force cage encompasses too much of the wall space to go sideways so you'll have to go across the ceiling as you climb the top and you pull arkhan you tuck your feet up underneath could you both please make athletics checks for me yeah you've been raging this whole time you're the most intense spotter right now yes step by step you carry the heavy armored red-scaled dragonborn across the threshold of the chamber you release him and both safely come to the opposite side of the laboratory you continue up the stairs you guys are based on far you've climbed you're about halfway up the tower i'd say a little over ten minutes or so of continuous climbing it's a stone chamber okay it clatters and the torch burns the powder (flaring) you guys continue up the next set of spiral stairs climbing higher and higher up entropis you can see every now and then one of the various vein-like cracks of energy that's holding the tower together you can glance out and see very obscured movement in the distance it's too fractured too much diffraction continuing upward you come to a second or another floor about four minutes of climbing this next half-chamber you see dozens of sets of chains and manacles affixed to the walls where tortured corpses are currently dangling from them left in pieces the scent is terrible decay is strong no undead go ahead and make an investigation check okay no traps in this chamber make a perception check most of the corpses around here have been mutilated to the point where it's hard to even recognize this was essentially a torture chamber this was a gathering information this was a point-making chamber the ones you do see around here nothing catches your eye one does seem familiar you look and see and it's been a while but you remember the face of a scalebearer desona who traveled across the ozmit sea with you aboard a skyship glancing around the bodies appear to have been cleaned of any useful items this is mainly a for-utility-and-fun chamber the room is clean about 120 feet okay doing a round of what spells to who so only three freedoms of movement from keyleth right and then pike the raven wings emerge pike you said you were doing death ward okay so 5th slot's taken you watch as the forehead space where once you had seen the briefly visible third eye of ioun now emblazoned like a lantern light this bright purple eye in that moment you watch as scanlan's pupils turn to silver and with that you watch as this bright light emerges from the back of pike's shoulders as a familiar but much more vibrant and strong set of divine golden wings not made of energy but visibly beautiful gold feathered wings expand from her back your feet lift off the ground and (whooshing) as the voice of sarenrae whispers into her ear i'm with you (bear noises) polymorph i think is an hour with concentration could be wrong but i think it is do note you still have another series of staircases that are pretty tight okay good to keep in mind let me see the item again well the text remains for an hour yep once the text is revealed technically anybody with any sort of penchant for arcane knowledge could attempt it but you have the best chance correct but the text is revealed for an hour if in theory you were to fall and the book could be found-- yep it's more difficult but it's possible because he was the chosen of ioun he can read without issue but the text itself is still very arcane in nature you guys begin to climb up the next staircase all right you're beginning to spiral up the next length of it you get about 80 or so feet up before-- are you leading this charge visibly you're sending delilah ahead of you as you're coursing around the edge the stairs stop into another chamber the chamber levels off okay make a stealth check 44 so you stealth up around the edge and you see now where once it was divided into two chambers it now seems the chambers converged once more into a single room it's not very big and the tower's been slowly tapering the higher up you go the room is fairly empty you see a few vases in the corners and some basic ancient decor standing not noticing you're there you see three figures in full dark armor similar to who you fought in the ziggurat or the one who was guarding the tunnel that led up into thar amphala the underlings you see them in the same dark horned armor there's one that's humanoid sized and one that looks to be halfling size or two of them halfling size make an investigation check for the immediate entry for the immediate entry for what you can see you can't investigate from across the room they're not facing away but they don't seem to acknowledge his presence yet they don't see him you don't see any traps in the immediate vicinity of the room they're not death knights can't tell fully armored from where you guys are right now they're about 30 feet around the way and then ten feet into the chamber nope you see one staircase one final staircase that winds around the corner actually you haven't seen it yet make a stealth check 39 as you curl around the edge and glance inside you recognize this chamber when you scried in here previously this was the chamber that was being left by the death knight as he ascended to the top of the tower this is the last stop it doesn't look like it's a trap door or anything it's all worked stone it's all very carved two at most would be able to strike at once you have the taller one in the center and the two smaller ones flanking there's a human-sized one in the center and two halfling-sized ones on either side if they're surprised you have to stealth both of you guys curl up to the edge and you see the three of them what are you doing you're attacking the one on the right and you're the one on the left go ahead and roll your attacks if it hits it's an auto-crit but you have advantage on the attack because they don't know you're there that hits that's 58 all right so a second attack for each of you that hits does not hit okay what's the damage on the second one both of the armored ones on the side take the hit and crumple fall back helmet falling off unconscious they're still in the center of the chamber they're about 15 feet from the top of the stairs the two of you are going to rush in arkhan you rush in towards the one in the center go for it so what'd you roll as they both drop you rush up to the one in the metal armor who doesn't react to your arrival stands there staring at you as you rush forward and swing you hit the armor but you hit the edge of the blade cleaves off doing no impact 21 hits he's not undead nope 28 all right you hack and the axe slides into the front of the breast plate and as you pull back you see a gout of blood he takes it not reacting okay yeah the one standing has a helmet and the two that fell their helmets tumbled off as they impacted and fell back you pull the helmet off and you watch immediately a bit of black fuzzy facial hair from underneath as you reveal you see darkened skin and long black hair with a bit of colored makeup under the eyes and a metal band across the forehead looking ahead unmoving unflinching locked in place staring past you you glance up and it's gilmore standing in the middle of the room the helmets are partially off so it's easy enough to slip the helms off to the left it was less of a halfling and more of a younger girl jammed into the armor and a little taller than the other you can see brown hair with a shock of white in it currently laying back unmoving and bleeding out the other one looks to be specifically gnomish short brown hair and eyes wide on the ground make a medicine check 23 they're not illusions and they are both dead they still have the bands each one of them has this strange brass band across the head you take it off the head of one of the two dead it slides off it is kaylie and cassandra no she took it off one of the front he's wounded but he's still alive and staring forward you pull the band off and the eyes flicker for a second (panting) what happened where am i how-- what happened he looks down you see the eyes lull back the stillness of the body as you finish touching the body a warm burst (gasps) breath comes back to her and she starts coughing sits up and leans over gasping as you reach out and touch her chest the brief moment of stillness leads as her eyes slowly blink back and begins breathing again yes i-- i was in my workshop and there was a flash of light a doorway opened and it pulled me through and-- roll an insight check 21 it's shaun gilmore where are we what's going on wait so if we're in-- we're near vasselheim what's entropis then what are you going to do i can get the three of us away i can teleport us it's the maximum of what i can do i can probably take us back to emon why even stay here i'll do that you're going to fight this vecna if we make it quick if you can make this quick i can leave you with some intense adrenaline my friend yes he looks around to the blood on the floor and the two barely living women at his side and says if the one you're going to fight is the one that did this to me and them leave a scar in my name if you don't mind when it's done maybe carve a unicorn you begin to hear heavy footsteps coming up the stairs behind you heavy footfalls and a number of other footsteps heading up the tower behind you he goes and grabs the bodies close glancing around you up the stairway you see emerging the death knight who joined you in the fight against vecna the one that met you at the top of the tower last time you fought vecna emerges looks across and begins to go for the blade you go straight for him gilmore reaches out to you and casts haste on you but it lasts a minute hurry it will be an honor knowing you all still grabbing on to both of the girls and with a flash of light the three of them vanish the death knight has turned to reach out and goes to cast something arkhan rushes up and slams the axe across his arm knocking it aside you can see now behind them other cultists and other things begin to head up the stairs but they're currently being choked at this point where the death knight's being held at the stairway where arkhan is stepping there as arkhan holds off you guys head up towards the top of the tower that's where we're going to pick up next week (screaming) when you revealed to a god how close and dangerous you were last game there were going to be repercussions and he knows how to get to you he knows your secrets i love you guys we'll pick this up next
