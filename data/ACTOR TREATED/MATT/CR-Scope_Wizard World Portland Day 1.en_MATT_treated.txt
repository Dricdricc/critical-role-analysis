this is a lot of people before we begin just want to let you guys know a large part of this panel is a q&a we do have a microphone right up here in front so if you have a question you want to ask line up now so we can get that chaos started before the panel so ♫ make your ♫ ♫ way to the mic right there contra your way to the mic right there ♫ don't actually do that that's a very bad idea all right cool now that we've got that flow going i would like to welcome all of you guys to this afternoon's critical role panel here at wizard world portland (cheering applause) followed up by the wondrously tinker-worthy human gunslinger percival von you know the name played by taliesin jaffe (cheering applause) next up we have the masterful professional mentally possibly challenged barbarian of strength and might grog strongjaw played by travis willingham (cheering applause) let's bring in our lovely ladies of the group as well following up with the wondrous vex'ahlia one half of the half-elf twins the ranger gathering trinket the bear through the wild we have laura bailey (cheering applause) bringing up the rest of our intrepid band of adventurers we have the air ashari half-elven druid keyleth played by marisha ray (cheering applause) and our mystical empty chair will also join us on the edge of the panel this chair represents our two party members who could not be here unfortunately but sending a little bit of love from here to ashley who plays pike which we have a wonderful cosplayer in the audience yes and liam o'brien who plays the other half of the twins vax'ildan much love to you liam i mentioned trinket but everyone was screaming over me but yeah trinket of course your favorite i should've sat you next to her that would've been fun so yeah guys we're excited that you came who here doesn't know what the hell's going on right now so we are  apparently about to explode we're a bunch of professional voice actors working in video games and animation who also happen to be huge nerds who play dungeons and dragons we began streaming our campaign about two years in almost a year ago actually we're coming up on our anniversary soon we stream on twitch for geek and sundry every thursday at 7 pm pacific time we weren't sure if this was going to go anywhere and anybody would like to watch it and well i think we were very wrong which is great we're happy to be here and why not kick this off with some of you guys' fan questions and see the stories roll out from there so don't be afraid to jump in if you have any random thoughts or ideas you sir the front audience we're trying to keep spoilers out of this discussion if possible which is really weird for me you kill the dm your game gets a little strange audience you know this world of exandria that i've kind of created and they've kind of helped build that with their character moments and backstories and such if any characters were to die they would roll up a new character and we'd incorporate them into the story to then join vox machina going forward if it was a tpk if i survive the internet's backlash we would pick up where the story left off probably with another band of adventurers to continue the plot from a different angle in some way i think you have your answer sorry guys sorry great question the mic is your friend audience for me it's the npc for me the character inspiration for the npc comes from where they fit in the story where they fit in the civilization what their drives are then i start thinking about their history then i decide depending on from that point what their racial traits and lifestyle would lend them to have a specific type of cadence texture vocal pitch the voice is the last thing that actually goes to it but i make sure to note next to every npc what the voice type and dialect is because inevitably they're going to be pulled out of nowhere it's fine if it's a home game and a character's voice changes from session to session but when you have critrolestats scanning every episode-- how many character npc inconsistencies has mercer done since episode one let's look at the time code right i know that's also forced me to kind of step up my game a little bit too you guys have helped me with that so i go character first voice second and then make notes to remind myself where that lies that's only come up recently that's called character progression (laughter) well played yeah victor wasn't planned victor was an npc that was pulled out of the ether when we were in vasselheim the first time and percy's like i'm going to go buy some black powder where can i find that and i'm like-- well let's find out (nervous strangled sound) like even when he asked what's your name and i just went victor he was like what was that and i went in my head i don't know what did i just say (laughter) yes i had designed gilmore's glorious goods as part of the abdar's promenade in emon intentionally as one of the characters you might encounter as you went through the city so i was very glad that he got to have his moment to shine and continue to shine i wasn't expecting him to become so central to parts of the story he's a majestic one i only recently realized looking back at the episodes that his hand is like this he just has a hand at all times he's presentary and then when he's mm-hmm of course it's almost like he's holding a fan but there's not one there i don't know it's weird good question audience oh all right you're just hitting that front row man yes audience good on you audience aww technology and then what happens if he comes back into town and someone's like oh look it's gerald the butt poker (laughter) for them to already be rolling a new character during the encounter means maybe then want to try a different class which is fine if they want to do that as far as engaging people to use an old adage you can lead a horse to water a person has to feel comfortable enough to step out of their comfort zone to try it so you can't force it on them you can try and coax them into it over time i also find it helps if you engage them as the npc directly if you tell them you walk into a tavern the barkeeper tells you ah you should buy a room it's different than going he turns to you squeaks the inside of his jar and goes aye miss what can i do for you you know and just that eye contact it becomes a conversation as opposed to keeping them in their imagination controlled facet that feels more comfortable it might take a while you can talk to your players and be like hey guys it'd be cool if we could try and push a little more into character rp and discussions and don't put any pressure on them for it but help coax them out by addressing them directly and taking into account that what they say is what their character says something like oh i'm not going to talk to this guy be like i'm sorry you're not going to talk to who oh i mean-- i didn't-- that was him so you can can play in elements of that and get them comfortable with the idea of speaking as their character not everyone will be and you can't force it well that's the thing rp circumstances can also have their own rewards too if someone talks their way out of a good situation they'll get a more profitable circumstance based on the quest or mission they're on they might uncover information that is vital to their current plan and disposition they may end up unlocking an ally that they didn't have previously these are all different ways you can reward good rp as well as just a nice little experience bump i keep track of good character moments and i give little bonus experience points that was a great question thank you so much (laughter) it's fun i actually felt the heat from laura's stare on that one it's interesting because it is a comfort hurdle for a lot of players and dungeon masters alike to step into the opposite sex you know we have a lot of cultural weirdness in places about that whole thing and you have to kind of look past that initially i was a theater kid so i didn't have any shame (cheering) as far as just distinguishing-- i had this question earlier how do you change your voice to be female i don't change my voice that much really there's a difference between chest voice and head voice you know thinking of the definition it goes up more into your upper palate and your sinuses and for a man it just takes some of the resonation out of it to where a character that talks normally in this way can sound a little softer a little more-- gently domineering which i really enjoy as a strong female npc allura skirts that line quite a bit and i like that a lot more than anything it shouldn't be part of a focus you always get that dumb player who gets asked by the barmaiden can i get you guys a drink and he's like oh she's a woman well i'm going to go ahead and slap her on the butt he's about to get pummeled by the guards in the tavern remember even in these societies sexism probably is not cool and whoever works at that bar has a lot of friends she works with that are watching her back just saying audience no worries good question hello audience yes audience yeah audience yeah that's really great also there's-- i've enjoyed it for a long time-- real role play with itmejp those guys have done phenomenal games for a very long time there's also-- what was that oh i confused myself also recently the yogscast guys have done high rollers which is dmed by a good friend of mine mark holmes out in the uk and they're kicking ass as well so those are a number of the ones that i watch and keep track of both for inspiration and to meet other people in the community so it's cool well done your quest is fantastic that's awesome i was surprised too because she took celestial for three years in college (laughter) right in older editions in some variations if you were to roll a natural one it wasn't just an auto miss it was-- you had to roll on a chart to see what horrible thing happened to you for rolling so poorly which is really fun for my games i consider the natural one more of a narrative failure i like to explain the visual aspect of why you failed so much and in some cases it's more of a shame than an actual-- more of a mechanical horrible blunder and partially because i've played games where people use those charts and they're like all right you go to attack the orc critical fail you accidentally cut off your own head and i'm like really how is that no natural 20 he was like roll a strength check and i'm like to kick your friend awake so yeah i think it's a cool system if you want to incorporate it i tried it for years for certain things and it has its merits definitely i felt for our game i like to make the fumbles more of a narrative failure than an actual mechanical failure because then it can get a little too weird and really really bite you back audience well fair enough and that is entirely their call let them burn thank you i hope they help and there's a lot of great communities online too far before i put anything up there that expand upon these tips as well so don't be afraid to reach out to the reddit d&d page and the rpg check out all those guys audience oh no i'm so sorry audience we can try but understand it's a very strong curse step forward step forward she's going get real angry when it doesn't work naming convention is interesting i've always liked making up weird names anyway and a lot of times i'll just start thinking of-- it starts with letters that haven't been used very often in other areas so i'll be like all right i made a stillben so that's an s name so i don't want to make another s named town nearby so i'll go w westruun kinda came from just trying to think of it's to the west of where the main city will be expansion sent it west and then from that point i started taking inspiration from different languages that would affiliate that area a lot of norse language works near vasselheim looking into root words and certain spelling techniques in other languages and jamming things together that sound interesting and roll off the tongue well and there's also really good name generators online for fantasy locations that you can go ahead worked out well for some folks but yeah just pull inspiration from books that you like campaigns that already exist source books if you have them and take pieces from certain words that you like and jam them together and see if it sounds nice when you say it that's all you really need all of them that is awesome thank you so much i want to take a minute while we're talking about this actually one of the really amazing things to come out of this community aside from the perpetual beer that's real magic to take a minute off that topic one of the-- so many amazing things have sprung out of this community more than we ever could have expected or hoped but one of the things that perpetually humbles and blows me away is the generosity of all of you guys supporting all these wonderful charities all these wonderful causes you guys communally have raised so much money and so much awareness to so many amazing largely overlooked in a lot of cases charitable intents and it's incredible so give yourselves a huge round of applause you sir audience homebrew classes and races is a new thing to me as well like i never really created-- the first real homebrew thing was just the transition of your gunslinger over from pathfinder and even that took a while just testing and figuring it out learning to balance something homebrew on that degree especially a new class or a new archetype it's something that comes with experience and with community feedback while i'm happy that i'm somewhat decent at d&d there's so many great communities out there that are far more knowledgeable of how the game's original design construct was based on what is considered good versus bad balance when i threw my stuff out there--it was to the wolves in a way-- because everyone was like this is broken this messed up and i'm like cool thank you for telling me that now i can go back and fix it how about now this is-- oh this is better now internet may be angry and forceful sometimes with its feedback but as long as it's still constructive and it's awesome which most of the community is that's a tremendous source for you to use there's the unearthed arcana reddit is a whole area that's all about homebrew d&d content and they're all very knowledgeable and very willing to help you with feedback on your own homebrew ideas audience thank you audience when critrolestats shakes his head no (laughter) don't be sad gnome be happy gnome do you mean during the show or do you mean legitimately on a theatrical stage audience okay so an actual stage show and where did you play it that's amazing i don't think any of us can top that good question when i knocked over an inkwell during a production of the crucible as reverend hale i slammed the table during the trial for the latter half of the play and whoever was being the clerk of the court had filled the inkwell with ink which he wasn't supposed to do but he wanted to write legitimately i slammed the table and it (blurp) and spills out all over my hand i look down out of the corner of my eye and it's just like blue ink across my hand and i'm trying to hide it so someone else starts talking and danforth who's the guy running the whole trial starts getting really angry and i raise my finger to point ink all up his white shirt across his face he feels it and he doesn't know what it is he just knows he's got something on his face so he goes and tries to rub off the spittle and there's this giant ink smear across his face none of us could tell him so he did most of the second half of the play just with giant ink smears on his face yeah theater we should go now you should-- okay next question audience it was interesting because his father had actually left his tribe his band they're basically just like wild-living savage bandits that destroyed and pillaged whatever came in their territory his father had separated from them after his early trials and made a name of himself in the city of westruun as a respectable individual that's how when he went and met pike there wasn't-- people were not comfortable with him in the city and stayed away from him but there was no all of a sudden immediate force of the local guard going like i don't trust you we're going to lock you up and cut your face so that wasn't a huge issue but the band is still out there you did run into them once it was a large-scale battle with all these goliaths jumping out and the party was like we are so ruined the fight was about to go and i think it was the first time that i've ever had grog stop fighting and socially talk the party out of battle grog i know audience roll initiative (laughter) i don't know we've got about five minutes left if there are two or three we can get through quickly she gives me the half-drunk one audience it's a fun little exploration element it can be fun it's about knowing as a gm when to edit a scene you can let things happen let it be fun let interactions occur and then once you feel like the goal of that scene has been completed or is close to resolution you can nudge the party and be like all right so from this point where do you want to go from here or as time passes you continue the transaction you can find a point where the fun has been had the major arc of that moment has hit and you can help hurry and bookend and then continue the next moment we've got time for probably one or two more fast questions if we don't get to your questions here you're welcome to come and ask us at our signing later we also have a panel tomorrow at noon that's a tough one for me the archetypes especially for fighter and combat-based archetypes it's much more cut and dry as far as the transition for natural physics a gunslinger we know how ballistics work and some of the possible tropes for gunslingers in modern media so that was an easy inspiration to transition and change some of the things and still make it interesting when you get into stuff like that where you're dealing with more obtuse magics and other creatures that are mythological if you're having a hard time reach out to a community of homebrewers like the unearthed arcana guys and ask for suggestions there there may be things that are already existing that are a good root or basis that you can then tweak more into what you want your final homebrew to be and now there's the dms' guild which allows everyone to put up their own homebrew stuff online and there's a lot of great content there that you can find people with and if you like it you can toss them a couple of bucks and show them how much you appreciate it i think it's really cool that they've opened up the community to create their own homebrew content and provide it like that the gunslinger probably close to eight at this point thank you very much come by later on and we'll get to your guys' questions later on that's a very interesting question they do actually each wristband i keep on me not just from a visual standpoint but each has a very specific meaning this first wristband here was actually gifted to me by somebody in the middle of the desert at my first burning man and it's a representation of personal responsibility and understanding where i came from and where i want to go and make sure that i don't stray from that path and be true to myself it's a long story where it got that meaning but that's essentially what it means this one here was actually granted to me by my best friend brittany wallach for my birthday many years ago that's her right there (cheering) i know right so yeah each of these have a very special significance to me and are constant reminders of good moments and people in my life audience thank you it was a good question good (cheering) thank you so much so 400 group signing we'll be at our tables after that and then we'll be there tomorrow thank you all so much is it thursday yet
