is he on his way well when he arrives in the meantime-- okay as tiberius has an aneurysm and falls to the ground-- yeah all right make a death save no i'm pretty sure that's somewhere in emon (laughter) yeah so let's actually start this game guys thank you for being patient with our intro here we've been gone for two weeks we have a lot to talk about so thank you for letting us get that out so picking up where we left off the party completed the venture of taking the horn of orcus to a place of safety and sealing it away hopefully for eternity with the help of lady kima to the scalebearers after heading to the basement of the platinum sanctuary in the city of vasselheim they've succeeded to do so vasselheim which is a distant city to the far northwest of the continent they're used to this city is a very devout religion-based city and currently considered the oldest bastion of civilization in the known civilized world after taking a skyship across the ocean to get there sealing the horn you guys also discover upon doing so that the ruins long-forgotten ruins of what appears to be an ancient temple to sarenrae were recently discovered while sarenrae does not have a strong following in this city the few that are trying to raise it ask for pike's help to stay back and help build it and bring it to its former glory hopefully to re-establish a basis of worship in this city and she decided to help these folks the party then steps away from the ruins of the tower sad but understanding of the circumstance critical role all of a sudden becomes the greatest grass-watching game of all time as you all stand there you have to decide your next course of action you stand in the muddy road taking in the cold dusk air as the sun slowly sets to the west now this area of the city has a vastly different feel than the platinum sanctuary in the haste to make it to the ruin you've passed out of the section that seems to be under bahamut's watch and into a different area in this area most of the buildings are reinforced with ruddy iron plates plumes of smoke rise up from a handful of heavy smokestacks you can see over the rooftops in the distance toward the center of this section what looks like a massive dark red statue of a muscular bearded man yeah the ruins of the tower if you'd like to all right okay you drink it as you quietly take this moment to yourself amongst the ruins you can hear the clattering of stonework as the small band of sarenrae worshipers are now being helped by pike who's gathered them into a plan as to how to remove and restore portions of the building that are currently visible from the dirt and earth that it's embedded in hearing her voice echo through the hallway it's a very comforting sense you feel a rumbling in your stomach it's probably the emotion okay you find your way back towards the makeshift wooden plank stairway and there was a small alcove not far from there within the earth wall that looks to be relatively private there's little to no light and it does have a view of the current ruin welcome back guys as you finish your business you step away from the alcove back to the stairway the contents of the potion seem to have had some effect as the remnants of what you leave behind have a very soft blue glowing hue to them for the sake of brevity in story progression here and to dissuade a 30-minute conversation about scanlan's excrement after you've rejoined the party the sun is now set the cold air is beginning to really sweep in through the streets the clouds overhead begin to slowly rumble and you can hear distant thunder and you get the feeling due to the moisture in the air you're not too far away from a rain (chuckling) all right as you guys make your way through the center of this district-- yeah you get the sense that this area most of the people that live in this area are more rough-and-tumble than the already-rough people who live in vasselheim from what you've encountered the buildings themselves all seem to be reinforced with iron plates and it looks like there is a very heavy trade in metalwork and a lot of the construction of anything metallic appears to be coming through or from this portion of the town as you approach closer to this statue it's not just a statue you see it is actually sitting atop what looks to be a large blocky fortress-like temple unlike the platinum sanctuary which is a very beautiful but simple array this one has a crenellated top to each of these walled structures you can see braziers blasting flame every 20 or so feet along the top of it you can see as you approach the front of this there are two giant stone doorways with steps that look up to it and what looks to be two gargantuan war horns that spiral along the sides and then open up outward towards the entire city in front of it i'm going to ask you guys to make a religion check if you could as you guys begin your approach even in the darkness you can see the figure this human-like man barrel-chested massive muscles what looks almost like iron bracers around his wrists he is carved or sculpted from solid iron or plates that have been put together from some sort of iron initial structure the beard is long and goes to about mid-chest he carries in one hand this long thick shortsword and has furs and leathers about his legs and midsection you recognize this to be a very hefty depiction of the deity kord laura sam and it is a beard worth admiring k-o-r-d he is indeed not dwarven kord is essentially a deity of warfare combat and storms a god that has been long-worshipped by tribal cultures from long past that enjoyed the essence of battle and challenge and combat and quickly the motif of this section of the town comes into play this you assume is the portion of the city that is dedicated to the temple of kord this being the structure before you no you've only really been to two sections the first one you were brought to was primarily under the worship of bahamut the platinum dragon from the exterior and it is a closed-off temple it looks like a large blocky obstinate fortress that is nearly impenetrable from the way it's constructed and reinforced you don't know what's inside of it two large iron doors about 20 feet tall that are currently shut it's about five or six steps getting up to it it is nighttime currently yes as it has gotten to dusk it's thinned out a little bit but there are a few individuals walking by carrying pickaxes over one shoulder and passing by the two gentlemen one's in his mid-20s the one that turns to you initially probably looks a little older than that late 30s grizzled shaven but the five-o'clock shadow has definitely kicked in longer tousled hair dirt on the face simple clothing pickaxe over his shoulder and what looks like a leather belt that carries other tools these are human yes i heard you calling is this your first time in the braving grounds you can still say it though (laughter) the younger gentleman next to him similarly dressed begins to speak up he puts his hand up and goes the braving grounds is the area of this city that is built around the worship of the great god kord his protection and strength he bestows upon those who live for the sake of challenge to prove oneself better with each passing day that is the basis of the braving grounds it's a community that when called to battle can definitely defend itself what you see before you-- he looks up at the giant structure this is called the trial forge it is the oldest known temple to kord and has been built and rebuilt for many many hundreds of years anyone is able to worship what deity they wish in this town we have an understanding if you're looking for a tussle what you're looking for is the crucible the crucible is a fighting pit i mean there is a sacred arena within the temple but that's reserved for very very special occasions if you're looking to just get your fight on and punch someone in the face the crucible is what you're looking for he spits off to the side and points a little ways down the roadway beyond that way you'll see a tavern known as the bellows' respite one of the finer inns you'll find in the braving grounds proper but i take it if you walk that direction you'll see the crucible before too long me no too busy too many people better fighters than me in there i'll just stick to the mines nah these are battles of honor death belongs in a true war mind you there have been some folks unfortunately who may have fallen to a hit on the head too hard and that's understandable but the purpose of kord is not necessarily to smite your foes unless they've given you damn good reason other than that contest of strength is how we live for the most part i mean we have members of our community that are bastions and guard the whole city but we tend to keep our own-- (off-screen crash) we have some people come in and out probably best to ask around the crucible to be honest i've seen some people take some serious beatings down there i haven't kept much attention to it i haven't the money to sling around it what you think there's going to be fights in a pit and no one's betting on it welcome to vasselheim my dear i don't know take it up at the crucible keep walking you'll see it my pleasure kord's strength to you and he keeps on walking no core strength you guys walk beyond the trial forge back towards the path where you came off to the side on the left and you can see most of the buildings their internal lighting is very low you can see most folks either go to bed at this evening or at least keep a very low visual profile from their abodes however lights are blazing from the interior of this three-story inn the bellows' respite is definitely a rowdy place you can hear already the shouts and music streaming from the interior of it you gather that while there are a lot of people inside you can see at the windows and openings to the inside of the tavern there is a large group gathered in the middle of the thoroughfare just outside of it looks like a circle of individuals that are all shouting and screaming over each other big fist-pumps to the air some folks are angrily throwing their coin purses to the ground grog starts running up bounding up the way you can see the actual-- david bowie and the glass orb actually as you approach you can see there is no registry there is quite literally a pit in the ground it's a 15 20-foot dip it is a carved-out pit maybe no more than i'd say 25 30 feet across and there is no ladder there is no step going down there's just two people in there beating the ever-living crap out of each other and a crowd of people gathering around you do see what looks to be two very well-dressed gentlemen that are in the process of collecting and paying out and you approach just as the final hit takes to this gentleman's jaw this tattooed individual you can see bloodied in the face nose broken teeth knocked out this poor poor human fellow gets knocked clean onto the ground you can see standing over his body this extremely built aggressive looks like another human female with her hair pulled back in a very tight ponytail just spits on his body turns around and wipes the blood from the front of her face snaps her fingers and you can see folks bring a ladder and lean it over the side and she climbs up the ladder as everyone cheers on her way up you can make a stealth check if you like you do know through the discussions that it's arcane magic that seems to be the shunned element in this town as it is a town of worship divine magic for the most part seems okay everyone would've seen you if they weren't currently enraptured by the chaos those who did notice probably didn't seem to care much other than a giant tiger now walks up to them as you pull the shoulder around you can see a rather portly human fellow balding on top with long benjamin franklin-looking hair very nice robes turns are you new to this town then is it that's the siren the siren she's the one you bet on trust me on that as he walks over to you can see another one of these gentlemen very well-dressed hair slicked back tall thin human in very very fine purple robes collects some people's money begins giving out a few things pulls out a notebook with a little charter he's in the middle of putting notes in well actually that was the last fighter scheduled for the evening you wish to fight he puts his arm out and the crowd steps back a bit and he takes a good long head-to-toe up-and-down look at you walks around from side to side inspecting you he gets a little bit close and reaches out not even asking he starts grabbing the side of your arms calm down kitty calm down steps back well it's not too late what caliber of fighter do you consider yourself who do you want to fight pleasure this late in the evening-- i apologize if you're going to have someone enter the arena worth betting on they have to go up against one of our proven fighters first however once your friend here gets his face beaten in you're more than welcome to join him in the ring thereafter you're mighty confident aren't you well first and foremost all bets begin at 100 gold pieces you can increase the bet if you'd like what would you like to bet is she the only one betting you're going to put your money down between your friends to fight your friends his eyes have already wandered from your face he says 500 gold on the goliath do we hear anything else a few other individuals step up and start telling him like 50 gold down it's a hundred-gold minimum 100 gold unproven fighters with a grandiose sense of self-ability enjoy the surprise for this one based on your height reach strength and arrogance i'd put you at four-to-one against all right 500 gold is this all i'm hearing 600 gold 100 gold is the minimum bet all right last bets last bets everyone starts putting in their cash a couple folks frenzy over you see a couple guys-- it seems your friends are confident in your ability let's hope we can put their money where your mouth is all right you cannot cast a spell when you're in beast form as you begin casting the spell immediately the guy says you do that one more time and you're all disqualified from ever competing at which point the other individual whispers into the initial bookie's ear yes retrieve him please for this fight we have a newcomer a newcomer who is named-- phillip the newcomer has decided to hedge his and his friends' savings that he upon what i can only imagine is his first arrival into vasselheim to get his face pummeled by our current standing champion kern the hammer at this point the crowd immediately goes quiet and whispering you can see a few individuals now walking over ushering this man looks like he just stepped out of the nearby mines he's got coal dirt on his face when i say man it is a six-foot-six very visibly half-orc gentleman built like some sort of thick-ass building you've walked past coming through here bald head big bristly mustache and a face that's obviously taken a beating over the years he walks up nonchalantly just wearing a simple tattered tunic leather pants and boots you can see him like cracking his fingers he looks over to the side at one of the guys they better have pulled me out of work for a good reason who am i up against i envy your currently unbroken face currently the bookie steps forward no killing fighting until one falls then you keep punching no weapons no armor fists against fists until one of them falls lower the ladder as they put the ladder down into the arena you can see the orc gentleman pulls out a small enclosed almost like a wineskin like an iron wineskin unscrews it and drinks it all down yeah puts it down throws it to the ground with a ting-ting-ting it is customary to drink before a fight as everyone gathers around you can now see people are coming back out of the tavern to gather around the outskirts of the crucible grog gets lowered down the ladder well grog what else do you want to do before you prepare well if you haven't gone down yet the other guy has come down the ladder make a stealth check what did you roll all right as you walk towards him and begin looking in his eyes as you begin to pull out the flask a hand grasps your wrist and you glance over and you can see one of the burly human gentlemen that escorted kern the hammer in is currently grasping your arm and says i'm watching you one more try and i'll throw you in there we'll go down ourselves shoves you back away still clutching it looks to you grog up into your eyes you going to climb down and fight or you going to be a pussy about it you leap over the side completely avoiding the ladder both feet hitting the ground with a heavy thud sound the packed dust kicks up around your feet at which point the other orc's finished cracking his knuckles just kind of wipes the spit off the edge of his chin gives you a look (growls) and you see a bit of foam toss from the side of his mouth go ahead and roll initiative 20 all righty all right you actually probably would've landed there from the run first round starts you're up kern but it's better if grog gets it wrong phillip all right so use your action to use intimidating presence all right so what's the dc on that 13 that will unfortunately not succeed as you glare at him with an angry phillip glare your bellow echoing through the bottom of this crucible which in itself forms a very interesting acoustic amplifying of your yell you can see kern on the other side is looking at you with the same intense burning rage and you can move if you like okay all right so as you stand there waiting with fists at your side kern takes his turn you can see he begins to circle a little bit around you as he begins to spiral about with an unnerving speed dashes forward fists come swinging one two both strikes coming towards you that is a 19 this is all fisticuffs that is a 24 and as a bonus action using his rage a third attack that is a 21 all righty the first one does eight points of damage the second one does seven points of damage as one fist clips you across the chin the other one goes right into your abdominals you're still tensing and you feel the impact but you just take the sheer weight of the force and flex and angrily stare him down in return that's going to be a gif and as you now see kern prepares for a second bout it's your turn grog what are you doing all right go for the first strike that's probably going to miss 19 is going to hit both hit yep so you go to kick with the front kick and he dodges to the side however you still using your giant haymaker the inertia clips him across the face go ahead and roll damage you're not fighting with your axe this is with your fists so rolling 1d4 and then half that yeah yep but you still add your strength modifier correct so six damage all righty all righty all right so your modifier is plus-- it's plus three for the modifier okay and then what did you roll on that two then five total there you go all righty cool so you hit him across the face and you hit him to the other side he comes back aligns his chin and you can see he's now stooping in for some sort of an uppercut as he slips to the side a little bit with a sidestep that will be a 25 a 20 and a one so what's your ac all right so both the first two hit as he comes low for a full-on uppercut hitting you for that would be six points of damage (whack) under the chin as you're currently reeling from the impact he crouches down and is going to go for a knee to the middle of your groin that is another six points of damage (whack) right in the phillip junk you instinctively give out a (grunts) from the impact after that point he comes up and it looks like he tries to go for some sort of a pile-drive grapple and you instinctively kick off of him and his third attack is completely wasted it's now your go okay okay it's an action to do that so you can use your bonus action to attempt-- you only get one with this technically it's an action to grapple so go ahead and roll an athletics check 22 yeah you slam into him knock him to the ground and you're now on top of him he's currently considered grappled and you can go ahead and attempt your headbutt 24 yeah definitely so go ahead and roll damage on the same 1d4 yep so if it's three or four it's considered two so six all right so as you tackle him to the ground and he's trying to pull you off you reach up (wham) just slam your forehead directly into the center of his face as you pull back you can already see the blood streak off the front of your head as his nose is smushed even further into his gnarled facade as you pull back instead of pain he's laughing (laughs) as it comes to his turn he's not attempting to break grapple he's going to reach up and grab you and attempt to headbutt you in return that's going to be a 21 a 23 and a 19 all right that's a six seven damage so total of 13 damage as he reaches up and slams you slams you again and as you start backing up he goes to slam you a third time and you catch his head in the middle of your mitt and he's now face-to-face with you just like (snarls) you guys are both snarling at each other like two rabid beasts it's your go 25 hits hits 17 does miss all right so go ahead and roll damage for the next two strikes six all righty six nice so as you hold him down his face (wham) head goes cracks against the ground of the crucible as he starts picking his head up again you drill back again (wham) hit him a second time this time you can see now his nose was already busted before now it's nearly concave it's like he didn't have a nose before and there's just a bloody void where it once was he's still smiling in a weird twisted way he seems to be enjoying this almost as much as you you go down for the third one and this time he reaches up and grabs your elbow he's going to take his turn to attempt to break your grapple as his action go ahead and roll either an athletics or an acrobatics check 12 all right he kicks you up back onto your feet and as he does he kip-ups onto his feet as well looks at you with a smile wipes the snot and blood from the front of his face licks it off his hand and with that same hand he rears back almost like he's winding up for a punch and then just kicks you right in the center of your stomach that's 22 yeah that'll hit that is eight points of damage that ends his turn now you're up grog you're both now standing face-to-face again you're reeling from the kick to the breadbasket all right go ahead and roll 19 just barely hits go for it all hit nice (whack whack) you first jumped hit him in the face as he stumbles backward use the inertia to slam him again with the same fist in the face and then turn around with a full-on haymaker to the side of the temple (whack) as you can see there's a spray of blood and spittle across the you guys are starting to push towards the back wall of the crucible and he actually staggers back a little bit towards the wall from the impact (cackles) and he charges towards you putting his head right towards the stomach that he kicked before going for that same soft spot he's opened for himself that's going to be a 20 yeah that hits 21 and 21 comes in slams you into the middle of your abdomen for seven damage eight damage and then an additional seven so that'd be 15 22 points of damage as he slams his head into your midsection picks you up over his head slams you onto the ground and as you're on the ground he runs up and soccer-ball kicks you in the side of your ribs just (whack) you hear a crack as the impact hits and you can feel that surging shooting burning pain begin to fill the side of your torso it's your go go ahead and make a deception check he looks down at you and looks over at the elf and he says i'll deal with him after the fight i've got too much money on this right now all right riki-oh style i like it all right so as you go ahead go ahead and just roll a basic attack 26 make a dexterity save on his end-- no that won't work so you throw the dirt up as he's rushing towards you to follow up on the attack the dirt goes streaming into his eyes and for a second he stumbles and starts trying to wipe his face as he does he has the blood on his hands that's also getting in his eyes the blood's starting to cake up a bit and he's just reaching out in the area so that's your first attack go ahead and roll an attack you have advantage on this currently because he can't see it coming 25 go ahead and roll damage 11 if you're going to do grundle damage so as he's reeling and tries to reach out swiping a back-fist into open air you rush up and (whack) hit him with sheer force that you hear a unanimous (groans) in the crowd all around echo down his knees immediately bend in towards each other and you can see the sound escape instinctively from him it's like (wheezes) as you reel for your second strike which is going to be what's the second one you do no he's still standing but barely you pull back and (whack) a second time in the same spot this sending him onto the ground from behind he is currently prone okay that's rough well regardless of what happens there's going to be a search (laughter) not a natural 20 just a total of 20 he's rolled a lot of 20s that's going to be seven damage as he sinks his teeth into the side of your shoulder and neck area and tears a chunk of your flesh out of the sides of his mouth now in the muscle so you reel back in pain and you're both clutched in this gladiatorial grip it's your go it's mashed in okay go ahead and roll that hits all hit so as you reach forward you use the yell of pain to turn it into an attack reach forward and bite into the front of his face you don't get any nose but you do catch the top of his lip as you pull back with a snapping sound part of his upper lip just comes off in your mouth how much damage does that do six damage all right what's your follow-up attack oh yeah he rears up with his hand right there and is like (yelps) all right go ahead and roll damage on that five all right the blood's pouring down the front of his face and his throat you clip him right in the center of his throat you hear the coughing sound as he with his other hand reaches up and grabs his throat you can now see his front teeth visible through the lip that's no longer there and what's your third strike he's tough he's bending forward but he's not completely incapacitated he's in pain (laughs) all right go ahead and roll damage on this one six so as you leap up using the goliath weight coming down you double-tap the elbow and you bring it down on top of his head he from the sheer force of it (wham) slams down face-first into the dirt just like that onto the ground as he's getting up he's looking kind of rough there you are a gracious warrior of the woods while on the ground he reaches forward and attempts to sweep your legs out from under you go ahead and make-- this would be an acrobatics-- no we'll make this a dexterity saving throw why not ten (whoosh) pulls your legs out from under you slams you onto your back as he leaps up on top of you immediately and with both of his fists in the air slams them down towards your face that's going to be a 22 22 to hit you take six points of damage and a 23 to hit it's going to be an additional eight points of damage just once down on your face and again with a second slam right down onto the front of the face again you can taste all the irony blood and liquid pouring through your sinuses down into the back of your throat as you're currently on the ground with him on top of you you're both looking pretty rough where are you at hit point-wise (laughs) all right go ahead and roll for attack hits 17 does not hit 22 does hit so you reach up go ahead and roll damage (whack) thunderclap to the side of both his ears six points of damage as he rears back and instinctively his hands go up and try and grab at your wrists you pull the wrists back and he's holding you from that point you attempt to go for another strike but he just redirects it with his own arms you manage to pull out of the grip with a third strike what are you doing for that one roll damage five (wham) you hit and you hear the wind out of him from the impact (wheezes) and he's trying to get the wind back he pushes off of your chest to stand up for a second and (gasps) gets one big inhale of air and as he does he reaches up his leg and then tries to curb-stomp kick you right in the stomach while you're still on the ground that will be 18 all right a 19 and that will be a 24 all right so he goes to kick you once and you dodge out of the way kick a second time this time you catch the foot and hold it in place he then lifts up with his other foot to a point where now you're holding him in the air as he puts all of his weight in the air he comes down and slams his elbow right into the center of your chest in the way you did to his head earlier that's going to be for a total of eight points of damage roll an attack okay so as you reach up to try to get his eyes he grasps your hands and instead begins pulling back on the wrists you can feel the tension of the bone beginning to bend from the sheer strength and force of it as you pull back your arms you attempt to headbutt him again and he dodges his head out of the way and he knows he has you at an advantageous position what do you want the third attack to be yeah where are you at hit point-wise by the way he's looking pretty rough too so what do you want the third attack to be he's currently on your chest and waist area right now like (grunts) holding you down (laughs) okay as you shift upward you bring your elbow forward roll for attack oh that's right so six damage okay as you position him up (whack) the elbow hits and you can feel it sink in what bones are there are mostly splintered and broken and you get a good inch into his face with your elbow as you pull back he's looking really rough and one of his eyes is beginning to swell entirely shut yeah this is a full-on drag-out fight he angrily looks down at you (snarls) and he reaches both of his hands up again in a giant hammer fashion that's going to be a 17 a 20 and a 15 so he brings it down (wham) as it hits you manage to take the brunt of it in the shoulder the second hit comes down and slams you for eight points of damage (wham) this one you can feel the sternum crack as he brings up his fists a third time attempting to end this you use the leverage you had when you pushed him up to actually spring your entire body upward and force him off you he manages to get to his feet and you just get up and you both are bleeding from all over your faces with giant bruises and both of you are barely holding yourselves up breathing heavily it's your go roll for attack 24 hits 22 19 just barely hits (cheering) all right and what are the attacks you do it snaps he's still standing on the other leg but the knee is cracked behind as you jump off the other one (whack) it catches the knee it doesn't snap but you can see there is a bend to it and then he falls to the ground on both of his busted knees now looking up at you and with the third strike what are you going to do okay he's a half-orc there are little tusks there yeah they're small to pull you slam down on his face (crunch) you can see the jaw crack open the tongue instinctively moves around a little but the jaw is definitely broken from the impact you can see that blow should have taken him out because there was nothing left his body goes limp for a brief second you can see the half-orc rage kicks in that half-orc's blood you can see him now rally up for one final round of vengeance against you grog reaches up and grabs you by the throat and brings you up to slam into his head this is going to be a 21 a 17 and a 22 so grabs you slams into your head with the first strike that is going to be six points of damage (boom) into the face you can feel like the shock the white light in your eyes as the impact smashes into you he goes to do it a second time this time you instinctively reach down with your hands and push his face away you can feel the fading just from the sheer impact as he pushes you up onto your feet again and you step back and he takes a moment to look at you with his missing lip his bashed-in nose eye swollen shut both knees messed up (pants) respect and then he runs forward and with one heaping haymaker just takes you in the face with a cracking sound for six points of damage (groaning) getting up to the top the crowd cheers you can now see one of the bookies reveals a holy symbol one that you recognize as the symbol of kord and he goes down and immediately begins administering healing to our recently unconscious grog you can see the other bookie who is dressed similarly in the purplish robes you saw before also begins to heal our good fighting half-orc friend as he lumps over and takes his sack of coins from him the clerics of kord are the ones actually running this it looks like you come to in the pit grog beaten wearied and fatigued because of your frenzied rage however you have been defeated in the crucible that was so close make a deception roll i would say given the circumstances it's nice that he's trying but it's been a while since you've been bested in one-on-one combat and a part of you is deeply hurt by it but at the same time there is that burning fire that need to come back and vengefully tear him down from his precipice when you're ready as you're being tended to by your party the same bookie that brought you in comes over and taps you on the shoulder and says not going to lie no one has taken a beating from the hammer like that and brought him so close i don't think he's going to be able to take another round with you for at least a few days but you're welcome to fight in my ring any time you wish there is that yes a curious laugh comes across the bookie's face and he says the third floor of the bellows'-- what did i call it again the bellows' respite sorry i was in the moment the third floor of the bellows' respite does itself run as a brothel if that's what you're inquiring all right grog as you make your way into the tavern there is though in your solemn state you can see a number of the patrons who were watching from the inside who were part of the crowd all give a round of applause to you as you enter the barkeep who turns to you a human fellow who's missing one eye has a tufted spotty beard and happily extends a large tankard of ale and says on the house for you friend you fought well tonight i'll deliver it to the room by the way what room are you staying in the rest of you how many rooms you taking three amongst you three rooms for the night your room's on the house friend the rest of you that'll be six gold for the evening so that's six gold for them all right so mark off your losses for the money you put in for the pot that would be under additional notes it's a half-orc racial ability that the first time they're dropped to zero hit points they can instead choose to be at one hit point they can only do it once per day you brought him to negative five on that final hit but that half-orc racial ability and yet it doesn't stop him as he bite by bite makes his way through the piece of driftwood he found by the bar thank you which the barstools by the way have a thick crusty wool on them so there's a unique flavor to the piece you've chewed through as you all take your evening of rest in your respective groups grog eating and drinking away your worries until eventually you are unable to make conversation you sloppily make your way to the third floor to a room in the brothel that has been prepared and awaiting for you paid for by the bellows' respite and you find yourself sloppily disappointing a woman until you pass out in your own sorrow (laughter) wow that is an intensity pengulord guys pengulord i like the sound of that we could fit pengulord on a license plate right so if we somehow get to 5000 subscribers we get an eight-foot trinket and pengulord gets to rule the stream tomorrow we'll be back in about five ten minutes guys please stick around we have more interesting things to see welcome back guys all right so we had a little break here remember to follow our awesome artists on the twitter so let's go ahead and get back to the game so we can-- we have a lot to do tonight all right as morning comes to the rest of you wake up the first thought of course being the heartache for your friend grog who is not in any of the rooms yeah more the money probably for vex-- but as you wake up grog is nowhere to be found in your rooms of course he wandered off to presumably the third floor it can be okay a giant white saber-toothed tiger wandering the interior does set off a few minds i mean an armored bear being escorted is one thing but a lone saber-toothed tiger as soon as you make your way through the hallway you can see one of the patrons comes out of the room and goes (startled sound) and goes and pulls his blade out like help help there's a tiger there's a tiger in the inn hey keep that thing on a leash sir liable to kill someone goes back in his room and closes the door at about this time you hear a heavy footfall a second heavy footfall a third heavy footfall and from around the corner of the staircase descending from the third floor you see a very hungover and expressionless grog squinting and making his way down you hear (meowing) you guys head down the rest of you manage to eventually wake and make your way down to the tavern where grog is already in the process of consuming his liquid breakfast not until you want to your tankard goes flying out of your hand on the ground it spills across the front-- okay tiberius vanishes the barkeep hands over a big mug of clear water and sets it in front of grog it's the water that was requested by your friend who disappeared meals are ordered you guys are fed as per your purchase of the evening's inn stay your meal's still covered by the tavern eventually you find yourselves full and about i'll say roughly ten 11 in the morning it would be okay hashtag poop earring the crucible was the pit you were in the temple you were at is the trial forge the whole area you guys are in this district of vasselheim is known as the braving grounds you can certainly try yeah as a note too as you're having this conversation you reach into your pocket grog as you're feeling around in your pocket you realize that you saved in your drunken state the upper lip it's rubbery and dry but it's there you get to go ahead and roll a percentage dice 99 no beard this morning it goes the other way lower percentage it's a rough day for grog (impact) you guys suddenly hear this slamming sound that echoes throughout the nearby city you hear this impact like this distant crashing of stone against stone a few seconds later you hear this low (horn sound) this horn that's just bellowing out this deep echoing horn the rest of the tavern looks around confused a couple of individuals step outside to look you've been walking away for a while and you get about roughly ten minutes away before you hear this impact and these horns going off in the distance it's the horn of the trial means there's some sort of attack i don't know but i'm getting ready and he starts going to the back room okay so you become visible and begin lifting up into the air-- oh because the-- okay so you lift into the air and then appear as the concentration spell wears off you got your crown looking over you can see immediately there appears to be some commotion like some dust has scattered up from the forest on the far side of the braving grounds outside of the major wall of the city okay you start gliding over as you guys rush out you can see now a bunch of the bastions that are set across the top of the wall are gathering and loading in bolts and you see two of them fire you hear this now guttural roaring sound but multiple ones like a chorus of large bestial screams echo and then (wham) a second slamming sound of stone into stone and you can see at the very distant wall right below where those two bastions would have fired those giant dragon-headed bolt-throwers both get thrown off the top falling a good 40 feet out of view beyond the distant rooftops you can see a small crack beginning to form at the top of the wall two other bastions now begin to rush in and take the place of those two bolt-throwers sure you grab it you guys start running you're gliding in you hop on at which point two more bolts are let loose and you hear the creature once again scream (screech) in pain and then the footfalls no you just hear it it's on the other side of the wall you see what looks like a toothy maw streak across the top of the tower for a moment and then the tree line shift and the footfalls get quieter and quieter okay you glide up to it and as you look down you can see the two bastions that fell they're currently being tended to one of them looks unconscious and rough from the impact of the fall the other one's walking with a limp trying to find its way back towards the interior of the wall that leads up to the top of his post the one you come by has sweat beading down his face and you see he's loaded another bolt and he's looking out wide-eyed towards the forest he goes it came back we've had this blasted thing seen on and off again for the past few weeks maybe it's hungry or it's bored but either way this multi-headed thing this hydra-like creature keeps coming in and i don't know i think it's testing the wall it's fled got a few hits in but it went and we can never seem to get enough to take it down i mean you're welcome to try it's only been maybe two or three times this past week but it's come once or twice a week for the past month hitting different areas of the city not just this beast a few different ones but mostly this abomination it's a nuisance more than anything although it did get a good hit on the wall and he looks over and you can see there's a crack in the stone he looks nervously over it and i'll get to fixing that right quick it keeps slinking off back into the vesper timberlands kord help us if there's more than one of these you just now glide over seeing the flying carpet towards the top of the wall he is visible just gliding by you guys have run up to the edge of the wall you're beneath looking up at the flying carpet and they're having this conversation at such a distance where you can't really hear them talking percy vex and vax you're up on the flying carpet currently conversing with the bastion you glance over and you can see the canopy shifting slightly it's about a quarter-mile off and disappearing before it's eventually a little bit out of sight you figure a creature that large can't be too difficult to track the individuals are now they're currently-- yeah there are people outside looking at what happened he's there and he's currently putting on armor by himself he thinks to himself says she's a slippery one she only shows up when she wants to start a fight i gather your best bet would be to ask around i hear she runs at times with the-- what are they called the slayer's take the slayer's take as you guys are talking about this the bastion that was talking to you guys is now coming down the wall and he's like are you seriously thinking about going after that thing oh i can guarantee a beast of that size and that much of a problem's got a hell of a price on its head laura and i gather anyone you take it to at that point probably take just one or more of its heads back or some proof it's dead and i'm sure there will be a few people that will fight hand over fist to pay for that trinket is there behind you all right grog okay so trinket once again-- (distressed bear noises) trinket seems to be a little less perturbed by the circumstance grog and trinket coasting through the air arm in paw all right so as you guys all drift up over the town you can immediately see the bastion that was talking to you is looking very very curiously at tiberius as you guys vanish over the wall you can now see before you the entirety of the vesper timberlands below you the landscape is entirely consumed by what looks like the densest forest you've ever encountered the cold air seems to be growing colder as the day progresses on and the clouds themselves are choked dark grey the rain never fell last night but the storms seem or at least the storm front that seems to push its way is still ominously looking overhead the entirety of this landscape looking down across the vesper timberland you can see the thick canopy the occasional mountain or hill that's jutting through the top of it but there is no movement there is no current sign of the creature you can so you take the carpet down and as it hits the canopy it's a very slow arduous process to weave between the thick network of branches and vines and other bits of growth that have completely covered the top of this forest eventually the carpet comes down into the floor the rest of you guys who are flying coming along as well you all come down behind the carpet eventually breaking through the top of the canopy and reaching the interior of the vesper timberland itself good to know this forest incredibly lush presses up against the city walls itself nearly oppressively with the impact it grows up right against the city wall and it's almost like the wall itself is constantly keeping it at bay in the way that the growth that's pushing inward the tree trunks you see now that you've hit the interior vary in size some only a few feet in diameter you come across a couple that are 20 30 feet or more giant trees also even though it's midday at this point in time the light into the forest is choked so thin it's almost like it's dusk near dark inside the forest the air hits you with the smell of wet earth moss vines and branches dangle from and reach from every direction and you can see there are you can walk through the path here but nearing trees themselves the roots are so large and so twisted where they enter the ground you're definitely going to have to keep up with your ranger friend here you guys are in the forest pushing through various walkways go ahead and make a survival check with advantage yep she's tracking the creature all right following its path you see that there are tracks going both ways meaning the creature as it came through towards the city it turned its path about and then exited the same pathway so as you're following it along for a good 15 minutes or so you come across a small opening in the forest where you can see what looks to be a very messily partially devoured carcass of something it looks like it was pretty big it's definitely spread out over this area make an investigation check 13 you look at it it appears to be some sort of furred beast huge in size at one point it is long-dead for at least-- no as big as some of the umber hulks you've fought but it looks humanoid-ish more primate-like the more you look at it it looks like it may have been at one point a large massive ape of some kind but it has been torn open limbs scattered all across this small clearing you can see there are a series of bite and scratch marks across it and most of its internal organs are missing sure 21 as you look down at it and you take close inspection on the attack you look a creature like this when it destroys and bites especially the creature that you saw earlier briefly it appeared through the canopy when you first arrived many heads gnashing teeth the bite marks and the attack on this carcass are definitely in line with that creature however you do notice that there are other marks and attacks across it as well some of the wounds across its body appear to be made by weapons there are gash marks and slashes and the more and more you inspect the body you can see the blood that has been scattered about by this was thick and congealed by the time that it was tossed amongst this opening actually the wounds from the weapons appear to have occurred fresh whereas the wounds from being killed and eaten or being eaten by the creature appear to be post-mortem by quite some time ape creature it's essentially a massive for lack of a better term a dire-sized ape 25 looking ahead this carcass was eaten before the creature attacked the city you can see from the time difference that this happened but it has torn through this space recently you can see part of the body has been shoved aside and crushed under some giant clawed foot it continues weaving between the trees in this small pathway that looks well-worn like there are some portions of the forest that are well-overgrown and mostly untouched there is a specific path along the floor of this forest that looks like it's been used often by large footsteps and small ones there are many portions of this that come across as rough terrain at certain times it's okay especially on the worn path any off that can be a little more difficult to traverse plant life tree roots heavy thick branches that have fallen or have grown out and interwoven occasional rocks or natural formations that are jutting out of the earth make another tracking check with advantage (singing) advantage a d10 all right you continue moving forward off the track for another ten minutes or so before you see some movement ahead perception check you guys are keeping a pretty close view you're a little behind them but you're letting them push forward unless you choose to do anything otherwise all right make a stealth check you and percy go ahead and you look forward and you notice there are a couple small pools of water that have just coalesced through the recent storms or just a natural small pool of water that exists in this portion but you can see the back of a large scaled creature with a tan dark-brown hide long tail currently stooped down and drinking from the waters in the pool you can hear the distant (lapping) sound of water dripping out of its jaws and you can see now there are multiple heads taking drinks out of this pool here in this area because of the nature of the rich earth most of the foliage here is a deep green as the hue of your garments begin to shift to the color of the surrounding forest i'd like everybody to make a stealth check who hasn't already with advantage these are trees there looming at the edge of the water-- that is a massive hydra no it is considered a monstrosity technically you guys are all hidden off to the side here all right we'll put that as your guys' current placement stealth scores are no you don't have to worry about that okay the creature keeps drinking occasionally a head will come up and look around another head will come up and snap at it and snap back and then both go down and they start drinking on their own you apparently are not currently noticed go ahead and roll for trinket okay trinket's fine trinket with his deep green fur at the moment so what would you like to do okay the wall of stone has to be connected to itself so it would have to be like-- our carpet got moved we have flying carpets from fans here i want to use but it got moved we'll find them we've got carpets from you guys to use we'll get that in just a second it's fine we've got to move so percy you have the laser pointer show me that is a rock okay you coast through here unseen around and behind to this side here from here right now no yes anyone else placement okay right there have you read move earth you can move large chunks of earth over a small period of time it's not an attack spell it's more of you can dig a cave probably not with that one okay keyleth where are you going to have line of sight on the creature where are you going you don't have line of sight on the creature there's a tree blocking all right so over here what are you trying to do a creature of this size probably close to two tons more than three tons maybe 5000 pounds it's a big creature grog where are you going tiberius you're staying right there okay that's well within a hundred feet to see it yeah otherwise you would be blocked all right all right is everyone set who's taking first initiative on this trinket moves around next to grog all right there you are okay so you create from the earth a wall of stone that comes jutting out that way the force of the wall of stone slams into him and through the physical form it's not enough to actually move a creature of its size and weight but it does form around it and hold it in place currently it's currently surrounded by a ramp of stone the heads start reaching out and biting at the stone all righty go for it second one hits oh sorry the first one was one misses the final one hits yes dc 15 misses does not make its save nice it is considered a sneak attack because this is a surprise round the first attack that hits is considered a sneak attack no i mean the first attack that hits it you missed missed and then you hit missed missed and hit all right 27 damage you leap run up the stonework click the heels rush down and then slam and the dagger slips into the front of its torso the actual blade pulsing as the magical energy expels itself the poison rocketing through its body all of a sudden the heads turn around and now you have five heads looking at you awesome is he poisoned or just takes 15 additional points of damage no it just means it's poisoned which means it has disadvantage there's the flying carpet (cheering) one of its feet is currently off to the side in the water yeah what's the dc 17 all right it does make its save so half damage 43 awesome so a total of 22 points of damage from a save so as it's stepping into the water it takes an additional i'll say additional 2d8 from being in the water i'll roll them here additional nine damage to that as it pulls back the stone around it the rogue leaps up and slams it with a blade its heads turn around and as it does you turn around vanish from sight and then you cast greater invisibility or just invisibility okay release your hands and a torrent of blue electrical energy rockets forth from your hands streaking out some parts leaving arcs that hit the nearby forests and then slamming into its body its exposed heads you can see the arcs now shooting through between the various necks and bodies it writhes and streaks about slamming its body into part of the stone that cracks and heaves from the impact still holding it in place well done you want to move or is that your turn these are trees anywhere walking on the trunk around it is difficult terrain you cannot pass all right that ends your turn who else wants to do anything this round you all get a free round and then we roll initiative hunter's mark on it good to know so that's 54 damage from your initial strike for hail of thorns 16 does not hit unfortunately no it's against the armor it actually ricochets off the hide of the creature and disappears it explodes against a tree trunk in the distance and you can see a smattering of magical thorns shoot out into one of the canopies hail of thorns is an action to cast though isn't it you've already used your bonus action to cast hunter's mark it's okay it's a surprise round do you want to do anything with your self-placement or trinket-wise okay using your movement go ahead and make we'll say an athletics check to climb the tree athletics because there's no branches nearby you have to-- you slide back to the trunk turn around and grab your bow and prepare yourself trinket anything that would probably be right there all right so you unleash a lightning bolt go ahead and roll damage 8d6 does not make its save rolled a five seven more subs 19 all right gotcha that was the total 8d6 8d6 for lightning bolt roll two more all right 29 you turn around the corner the energy still crackling around it from the chain lightning you unleash your own lightning bolt that hits it from the side slamming into the side of one of the heads the head actually pops from the impact it's now got four heads right now you can't see because there's a tree in the way but you're pepperbox distance from here you could try bad news but you'd have to set up in place okay so as the carpet's gliding past you're basically strafing it and (gunshots) go ahead and fire oh my god there's going to be a giant trinket that's so stupid all right we got a bear as you strafe past you pull your pepperbox and go to fire suddenly there's a dull sound and as you look at your gun it explodes for a second in your face you barely manage to get your visage out of the way as the barrel itself is heated up and you have to shake it off yeah your pepperbox is looking a bit rough right now okay so everyone else has gone but grog yeah all right as you rush up axe in your hand you rush up the side of the stone ramp that she's created and it's right in slamming distance go ahead 24 hits 16 no 16 misses and then 17 points of damage as you hack once again slamming into the side of one of the necks causing a gout of purplish blood to spray over the right side of your body that ends the combat round for the surprise round the creature is now aware that you're definitely there everyone roll initiative all right so 25 to 20 20 to 15 for initiative yeah 15 to ten both of you guys 13 all right all right top of the round tiberius as you start to see the head that got blown off two heads sprout out of the-- it now has six heads yep and when you blew off the head two more grew in its place regardless tiberius it's your turn yep it did seem to heal a bit of its wounds as the heads pull out of it it has a sense of regeneration chain lightning is a 6th-level spell your ring can only store up to a 3rd-level spell we went over this last time it's okay go ahead and roll an arcana check for the first one okay and for the second one okay so it rolled a 17 on its second save the first one it did not resist because it rolled a three so what you do as you cast telekinesis once you use the sorcery points to cast it again you can't get all the heads but you can grab two of them one focus for each telekinetic thing you take both heads and (whack whack) slam them three times into each other and then twist the necks around at the point where both of them are biting onto their own necks after they've torn into a second for that they're both going to take 2d8 impact damage that's nine plus five 14 points of impact damage to each head both of those heads are currently grappling each other so they will not be able to attack on its turn all right it is now the hydra's turn it rolled a really high initiative the two heads are going to untangle themselves that's their attack now it only has four strikes this turn two of which are going to be against you and two of which are going to be against you all right so two of the heads rear back lunging at vax over here that's going to be a 29 second one is going to be a 19 all right so you take 17 and 15 17 and 15 so 32 points of piercing damage one of the heads snaps down on your torso and lifts you up for a second as the other grabs the side of your body and it feels like it's about to tear you apart for a second until you manage to elbow it in the nose and manage to get free of one head and shake off the other grog another head comes at you first one comes at a 24 and a natural 20 for the second 14 points from the first one you are raging so it's halved to seven the other one that is a critical that does come to 24 so 12 points of piercing damage all right that ends its turn vex you're up yeah you can see its body it's pretty large mainly just the heads are visible the ramp is blocking the lower half of it so you can't see its legs and its main part of its torso but you can see the necks and the heads currently no it is blocked by her stone it managed to unravel itself during its turn but it used its attacks to do so oh okay you can sort of see that area best you can yeah the one that you rolled you pull out of your quiver the exploding arrow which you can see it it's heavily weighted in the front so you know you have to fire it at a slight arc against most of your arrows that you shoot so go ahead and roll an attack on this one what did you roll are you serious as you pull back on your bow you go to release it and the string ignites for a second the arcane fire behind it that you absentmindedly trigger and as you do you realize at the last minute the arrow doesn't fire you actually freak out for a second and release the bow the arrow falls the flame hitting the edge of it and it explodes and detonates right in front of you make a reflex saving throw sorry a dexterity saving throw oh pathfinder you squeak in every now and then what would have been an explosively painful 38 points of damage is halved so you take 19 points of fire damage and you're knocked prone you're knocked flat on your ass that was a little unfortunate trinket can still move and finish off the round if you'd like that was only one of your attacks trinket runs up runs up the ramp claws out (roars) 16 does not hit 19 does hit 13 i would say yes because he is your bear i'll let that happen nice so 18 points of damage from trinket as trinket runs up one claw swings through the air and as the head rears back seeing this new bear that's joined the fray reaches out and clamps onto its throat with its jaws tearing a chunk of its flesh out all righty that brings us to scanlan (laughs) good let me open the spell real fast so go ahead and roll a d20 and add your spell attack yeah it should be at the top of your spell page 21 hits go ahead and roll 4d8 points of force damage as the fist slams clocking one of the hydras in the face 23 and with that you actually punch one of the heads off the hydra it goes spinning off into the forest okay what do you inspire him with a half-hearted d10 to you (laughs) all right so as that finishes your turn at this point you see a series of blurs in the nearby bushes a voice rings out saying hey what are you doing and you now see an armored individual come rushing out from behind this tree here another armored individual rushing from there a female with a large sword rushing from this side another character with leather armor and a robed female coming from behind here this is our mark you're not supposed to take that from us this is against the rules you skag so this guy runs forward he can't quite get all the way there so he's going to sit there mage moves out this way and is going to look over at you as you're getting the gun looks over and reaches out her hand go ahead and make a wisdom saving throw you do not have visual on her at all the trees are in between unfortunately as you're on the flying carpet you see over the shoulder you go to get your gun-- you're trying to pull out bad news-- and then your muscles seize and you find yourself held in place the cleric character you see comes forward holding aloft a holy symbol and reaches up and suddenly you see the canopy above the hydra begin to glow with a bright orange light before a column of fire slams down into the ground from the heavens on the hydra it appears to only be affecting the hydra laura and the hydra takes 48 points of damage this character runs up dressed in leather armor hood cloak runs back pulling two longswords from underneath the cloak and swings up to strike multiple times you can see a hawk gliding over heading in the canopy does 12 points of damage with the first strike the second one goes to swing and hits the hide and flanks off of it sorry this woman as she rushes forward you can see the skin has a pink-reddish tint these blackened twin horns curl to the back of her head and she carries a giant greatsword in her hands as she runs in a blur yelling out this angry war cry it's ours runs up and swings towards one of the hydra's heads first one misses second one misses (whoosh) in her fury and anger and the frustration of currently having apparently a targeted bounty of theirs taken she swings wildly into the air missing both strikes that's going to end their round all right that brings us to grog and percy percy make a wisdom saving throw it's whatever your wisdom save is ones and twenties tonight so you manage to shrug the effect but that's your turn grog okay 24 hits 20 hits 19 damage all right (whack) you hit once again almost like you're cutting down a tree you're hitting the same mark you hit last turn carving a large chunk of the throat out you can now see the exposed bone underneath and it's starting to gurgle through its hissing you bring the axe around with the inertia on the backswing and slam it into the base of another one of the necks as it slams into it and gets wedged in there you have to pull it out with a giant spray of blood that actually spatters across the female tiefling which you now see who as it sprays across her she licks it off her pointed teeth and you can see she brings her sword up ready to go ahead and attack it again she's glaring at you now with a this-is-mine type expression vax you are yes all right that does hit all right as you spin over and arc down onto the opposite side there nice well done i forgot to roll for-- it does resist the poison at the end of its turn by the way though even with the disadvantage it still managed to hit you last turn all right cool so you flip over arc yourself down after the series of dagger blades carving these two long ragged wounds down the side of its body as you hit on the opposite side where the stonework is starting to crack a little bit from the impact and swishing about of its physical body you have an attack bonus action attack and then the haste attack all right keyleth in the same space you can see there's a burnt hole in the top of the canopy where that fire column came through there's a slight sizzle of ozone before a giant hammering blow of lightning streaks from the heavens down into the body you feel a jolt of energy in the daggers you pull them out instinctively before it manages to make its way to your body go ahead and roll damage 21 damage nice all righty that ends the round at the top where the secondary head you blew off was two more heads sprout out it now has seven heads okay all right so you're drifting over here oh no you're just aiming at it okay so back-to-back you used the last of the sorcerer points to fire two fireballs that explode one after another go ahead and roll damage on both of them 41 for the first one that's almost straight sixes and fives that's awesome 39 were you adding five to each of those i don't think you're supposed to do that for fireball oh that's right because you have the-- never mind you do yes that's right i need a reflex save from grog and from you vax this is a 20-foot radius what is the what's your spell difficulty 17 so that just makes it for the first one yes for the first fireball yeah you avoid that entirely yep roll for the second one now because two exploded in a row the hydra itself the creature it's a 15-foot diameter a radius is from the outside of it from the middle okay you take 18 points of fire damage grog two saves it's whatever your dex saving throw is 18 so you take 22 points of fire damage here's the other side of it though we'll get to it in a second nine you take 39 points of fire damage oh yeah roll a saving throw for trinket roll a saving throw for trinket okay that just makes it so trinket takes 22 fire damage all right and then the second one so what did you roll seven all right so with the explosion both explode out of the way you both manage to avoid the brunt of the damage trinket falls unconscious on the ground the smell of burnt hair the hydra looks rough however the individuals also nearby that came in are also blasted back by the fireball everyone but the cleric and the mage in there are hit with the double explosions everyone taking full damage except for him who takes half on the first one they all of a sudden look around dazed and frustrated the hydra due to the fiery impact collapses inside the stone structure sam and dead so how do you want to do this i'll say you do this you set off the first fireball as it explodes and damages everyone in the radius it blows one of the throats of the hydra apart the heads are now caught on fire as you take the second fireball you set it off shouting that outward you use control flame at the same time as the telekinesis you're still maintaining to envelop the explosion of the fireball and contain it in the center you slam it and let it detonate as part of the impact into the torso where the heads are currently attached you end up blowing half the heads off the hydra in the process the rest of its body's trying to keep itself standing up however the explosion itself sent the stone wall around you guys broken into pieces and shards now sticking upward the hydra backs up and falls onto its side impaling itself on the shattered stone wall that you had kept up as it slowly slides down on the wound and gurgles out its last life breath the rest of its body on fire slowly sinking to the base of the stone wall all right as you guys rush up-- all right you're right at trinket's side you're flying in here trinket gets up charred but okay trinket looks over at tiberius and gives you a glare well you aren't at a short rest yet because right now as you guys are just standing there the rest of the other party is now stepping up to you the main human you now see in armor he has dirty blond short hair little bit of stubble on the chin very well-armored and the armor itself looks like it's taken a beating he steps up and says all right i'm going to ask you a question what the fuck are you doing fulfilling my contract he looks back to the rest of the group and the cleric steps forward and touches his shoulder for a second shrugs it off and says no no skags that wander these lands taking creatures from underneath those who are lawfully permitted to hunt these beasts and take that bounty and that makes you breakers of the law of vasselheim turns over and looks toward you takes a couple steps forward leaping off of the broken stonework on this side aldor and i work for the slayer's take those of us that are empowered to hunt contracted bounty-given beasts and creatures in this land you have gone out and laid claim to a beast that you had no lawful right to as you attempt to do that the mage walks up and goes i wouldn't recommend that you can see her elven face there is a glare of frustration and standoffishness that is very sincere do not step closer who would pay you where were you going to take this creature for the bounty you keep speaking of this is aldor the same human fighter he laughs to himself and looks back at the rest of them and says you have to understand the slayer's take's contracts are binding magically if we don't take this creature in after dealing the killing blow we're at an impasse with the slayer's take the cleric steps forward this human cleric older whitish hair steps forward his mace at his side armor currently spattered with hydra blood looking a little charred but for the most part okay he says okay before this gets out of hand perhaps if you come with us to the slayer's take there would be a possibility of us still enacting this contract if we find a way to magically bind you to it now mind you i don't know how the funds would be legally distributed however if you talked to the leader of our order perhaps there could be some sort of a resolution to this they look at each other and take a step back defensively and say we don't discuss money matters out in the open where it's so easy for bodies to be hidden the one that you're looking for is on the other page (laughter) the huntmaster (laughter) are you taunting me the only way that would work is if you were contracted to the slayer's take beforehand which if you were to agree to be inducted perhaps that would alleviate the concern we could then write you into the contract magically share the funds even and you would be free to accept contracts to kill creatures at your leisure we're not out here for fun at which point the tiefling female behind him says hah say that yourself i'm out here for both she flicks her sword and the blood across the ground they all look at each other she's been known to do work with the slayer's take yes let's do that as we walk at which point the cleric says take the heads cleave them off we'll take them back as trophies to prove the contract is sealed the leader aldor says very well clean your weapons no funny business a single moment of your eyes wandering to your blade i don't want it to have to come to blows let's carve up this creature i really really don't like you there's a very lucrative trade on monster-hunting in these woods but you have to make sure that you're certified otherwise you're taking money and food out of the mouths of us and our families come on gather up the creature's bits and they all go to start carving into the body of the hydra you don't have to actually the group are very well trained and as you go to try to the tiefling puts her hand down and starts tearing pieces out there's a dominance a standoff here there seems to be a general feel here that you've already broken the law enough if you really want to fight for it you can it takes about half an hour or so to reap the bits and pieces then again making your way back after you've pushed the remainder of the body into the pool itself letting it slowly sink to the bottom you all make your way back the path you came in an awkward quiet march aldor gives you a look good to know we aren't the only trackers in this town eventually make your way back to town skirt around the outer wall to one of the three main gates this one right on the outskirts of the braving (stutters) too many creatures braving grounds the gates open you're all led in first question at the sight of you guys but aldor raises his hand and says no they're with us it's fine you all walk in leads you to the outskirts of the braving grounds to a new area of the town you have yet to travel to at which point he introduces welcome to the quad roads this is where the slayer's take makes its place this is also where the erathis's crown is best you pay an homage to the deity of civilization while here he pulls out a small gem around his neck with a small symbol on it kisses it and puts it back in his shirt you guys continue walking to what is now you can see these large roads that streak across you've seen them join with the other sections this is the most central of all the various districts of the city of vasselheim there is a very large trade bazaar structure not that far out of the main gate that leads to the center of this district you can see barkers shouting out left and right to you various phrases dealing with food and various crops and creature fresh meat fresh meat out of the abundance takers of the abundance and people yelling out for general goods packs leathers large carts being wheeled past you until eventually you make your way to what looks like a very old dark-wood lodge about three stories high decorated with dozens of tusks and claws and other trophies that look as old as the building itself a carved wooden sign stands bolted to the top of the porch that says slayer's take guildhall in the common tongue approaching the door still that awkward quiet keeping over the group there is an engraving into the doorway-- it's pushed into the wood-- that reads here is where the hunters gather keen eyes and blades at ready we cease the unknown's cackling laughter our will is strong our members plenty we stand against the tide of darkness we do the deeds few men can handle reap forth a trophy from the carcass we are your strength we are your candle aldor does a knock on the door the door opens an eye looks through and the door swiftly opens as another individual who's dressed in a makeshift leather and hide armor steps aside you're all let in carrying the large hydra heads through that have been gathering looks from the individuals watching you charge through the streets to the center of the room you see what looks to be amongst the loose cast-iron candelabras that are affixed to the rafters small candles flicker for the interior light you see a long desk where a halfling male of muscular build sits eagerly rubbing his hands together his harsh features and light scars dotting his face and hands his red hair showing tinges of grey his shifting smile belies a youthful vigor as you approach with the trophies aldor welcome back how goes that bleeding mess-headed beast i see you seem to have dropped it before you aldor takes the first head that he's carrying and chucks it to the ground as it rolls across with two large thuds the rest of the congealed liquid seeping into the wood aye that's true but we bring a bit of an obstruction in the way glances to the rest of you obstruction you say okay well this is a curious phrase please explain to me what has occurred in your outing on this contract aldor scratches the side of his face well it seems that we have a group of skags not intentional skags out of the forest intending to hunt and managed to deal the killing blow to our mark this one did it he wipes some of the soot off his face amongst other issues the halfling walks from behind his desk with his hands behind his back (laughs) you come from emon you are not familiar with vasselheim yet the first thing you do upon arriving is leap down to the vesper timberland fighting a freaking hydra no this is okay i like the balls you all have this is ridiculous what you've done he steps away lady i appreciate your brashness but i would hope that you also act like a lady marisha and all i say is i appreciate-- yes your bear is quite fierce he reaches past and looks to the wall and you see there are two dire bear heads affixed to the wall of various ancient degrees well i can see that you may have breached the contract here and there may be ways of perhaps rectifying this should you take the pledge the pledge itself is a process one that i myself cannot specifically judge upon this would have to go to my boss the headmaster my wife (laughter) i will see if she is available one moment and the halfling patters off down a hallway came back a few moments later she would like to see the skags now i have heard of it not before i will call you this upon you making the pledge until then you are a group of forest-walking skags you follow him into the back hallway down past a series of doors some of which are half-open and ajar you see what appear to be bunks or rooms for rest there are some shields and various old weapons set up as decor against the wooden hallways down to a large heavy door that looks like it's actually the red leather stretched across it nailed across all parts of the doorway with a branded symbol in the center the same symbol that you saw adorning the almost like a relief behind the slayer's take lodge entranceway sign as the door opens the halfling pushing it aside please enter she would like to talk to you as you guys all step inside the interior a soft glowing magical torch lights the room from the ceiling the entire room is a large office or study there are books and meticulously kept scrolls at a glance you can see they break down various creature types that talk about indigenous bestial creatures some talk about the anatomy of mythical and mystical beasts this is a research facility for the hunting of any such creature that would find its way near or in the vicinity of vasselheim there waiting for you not at her desk but leaning against it with her hands also at her back similar to her husband you see before you in very finely crafted dark brown and black studded leather armor a small shoulder cloak fixed and tossed over one shoulder tousled short brown hair deep purple skin the second tiefling you've seen today this woman stands with bright white eyes no pupil her tongue flickers out of her mouth like a snake a little bit as you enter and she looks about the rest of the party please it would be my pleasure to talk with you for a moment about what you have done this day thank you husband the door slams shut behind him welcome skags you seem to not be liking this title a skag is an affectionate term we use for those who break our rules and will go to prison perhaps beneath the amaranthine oubliette which is why you are here and not currently being taken for the hall of judgment now my husband said you have interfered with a contract that has already been enacted which is also why you are not at the hall yet he also said you showed interest in joining our ranks to avoid this prosecution which i think is a very smart move and she walks behind her desk and sits down should you be cut out for our work that is you have proven to have slain this hydra with the accompaniment of one of our roving bands of monster hunters you're the one that nearly felled the hammer i've heard of this one (laughs) a fine trophy do not show him you still have that i don't think it would go over too well now most applicants for our humble family make it maybe a month or two before the vesper timberlands take them those that remain well they prove worthy of our business contracts you are all on trial by deed under my claim and authority should you agree and fulfill my request indeed you will be absolved of your infractions against the slayer's take and be given membership to our age-old tradition with membership comes with access to our lodge food room and board and training facilities simple arms can also be provided those that bear our insignia may also get a discount of supplies at most of vasselheim's merchants most importantly though you will then have access to our bounty contracts to specify we don't just hunt beasts and creatures a large part of what we do is harvest from our marks' requested components blood eyes teeth organs we receive orders from all across exandria from as far as even the city emon which you apparently hail from how nice for you i will make a note of it and she reaches over and grabs a quill and not even looking at the paper just scribbles well perhaps this emperor and many of these scholars or seers or mages you've encountered have ordered from us specifically required components for you see the most powerful of magics within nations require a focus or sacrifice of some kind many of these require pieces of these creatures so many contracts are from very high-paying clients that have better things to do with their time than wander skulking about the forest seeking such things as a hydra there's a lot of money to be gained should you be up for it i would ask you to take a contract complete it and return that is all you would have three days to do so do you accept there is a small ritual that binds you to the contract within this time it must be completed should you fail the contract is absolved and your membership is revoked your trial is to take the contract and you have three days to complete it oh yes you will still receive the money for it and with membership from what i have been told by my husband possibly even share in the bounty for this hydra you helped slay earlier on this day precisely also a part of the three-day contract with three days before it is null and void she chuckles under her breath that is good to know she says disbelievingly she reaches to part of her shoulder pauldron lifts it up and you can see there's a brand on the side of her arm then perhaps you'd like the judgment it does not hurt much gnomes three days will you accept i will take that as an acceptance on your part as well good good now i trust you work well as a team but i am curious how well you work with others as this is a test i will be dividing your band between two contracts two teams you gnome giant ranger tinkerer you will form the first team you will be taking your contract with a couple of other hopeful possible members as well three days to fulfill now cutthroat dragonborn vine-speaker you will form the other team your bear is allowed yes i shall now look over our extending contracts to decide your test for tomorrow go return in the morning fed armed and ready to set out and hopefully get affiliated with your journeymen members now be gone i have business to do oh then this should prove a very interesting test life is hard here in vasselheim deal with disappointment i am known as the huntmaster around these parts but should you wish the name in its full huntmaster vanessa cyndrial cyndrial c-y-n-d-r-i-a-l in the morning fed armed and ready knocks the desk twice her husband closes the door behind you you take a deep breath and realize this will be a very interesting challenge (laughs) they call me mertin yes mertin cyndrial yes taps his nose and points you catch on quick this bodes very well for you possibly you are not members soon though when one's brand is achieved as much as you like (laughs) trust me there's no way to change my wife's mind i've tried (laughter)
