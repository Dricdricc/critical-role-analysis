meantime let's go ahead and dial in for the next episode of critical role welcome back so sh (laughs) so to go over the current adventure in its current sequence we have-- the party recently had an encounter with the briarwoods two individuals that were responsible for a lot of strife-- -- in the background of percival's history seemingly responsible for the destruction of his entire family and have for the past five years been essentially ruling his home city and castle they were out for a political banquet with sovereign uriel in emon and the party members of vox machina they were all invited to be part of this didn't quite go as planned there was a scuffle and the briarwoods absconded back to whitestone they sent a couple assassins out to attempt to take out their driver who was spilling information and essentially was going to be vox machina's way of being free of any sort of political issues based on their actions that evening and after much discussion and preparation and purchasing a lot of mirrors the party took their transit over to the east-northeast towards whitestone where they began to traverse the alabaster sierras to the north using the mountain range as opposed to going directly through the forest there they managed to avoid encountering a bunch of harpies that were distracted by eating the horses they left behind they camped for the evening and began to make their way through some sort of a mountainous valley that led in towards the forest surrounding whitestone while they were traveling down this pass there was a rumbling and some sort of really fast rapid-moving large blue creature that leaped down in front catching them off-guard and that is where we begin today that blue creature what'd i roll on my beard check well obviously (all laugh) and my halloween costume requires a decent amount of facial hair yeah 509 away we'll see all right so everyone as this huge blue-scaled reptilian-like creature with multiple arms and legs comes skittering down the side of the cliffs blocking off the entirety of this passage snarling at you with sharp teeth and this sparking-blue electrical energy jutting out of the corners of its mouth i want you all to roll initiative 1d12 plus your constitution modifier whoa what'd you roll that's pretty hot so many hit points for the barbarian all of them all right so initiatives we have-- 25 to 20 anyone all right 20 to 15 16 15 to ten ten keyleth ten to five scanlan you have consistently the best initiative rolls as you should as you should so first up percy instinctively with your drive towards whitestone and this creature in your way you are already ready for this encounter what are you going to do it is considered a huge creature all righty with the minus five 17 hits just go ahead and roll the attacks in succession go ahead and roll the attacks in succession so we know how many hit second shot it hits third one okay okay all three hit go ahead and roll damage 17 damage all righty disadvantage on his attacks this round gotcha do you want to stay where you are or are you going to move you're right close to one you can-- okay brace against that wall there gotcha all righty okay next up is the creature (laughs) because it rolled really high on its initiative it's going to go ahead let's see at a movement of 50 feet it's a valley the cliff sides go up you could climb around it without a problem but it's pretty sheer you'd have to make climb checks if you want to-- so it scurries forward-- lowers its jaw and rears its head back as it does you see its eyes flare with electrical energy and inside its mouth begins to glow with a brightish blue white power a bolt of electrical energy comes forward hitting grog vax scanlan and percy well let's see actually no it would move out to-- hmm that's only 20 feet so to get maximum-- this let's see no actually for optimal-- --optimal impact here instead it's going to go there (laughs) practically it will then do it on-- it would be grog vex and trinket i realized that its bolt is only 20 feet long so utilizing its optimal lightning bolt length you guys were clustered together all right so i need you guys you three to roll a dexterity saving throw you do it with advantage it only affects attacks not for saving throws good to know all right and trinket he got an eight oof okay 33 points of lightning damage to both of you trinket takes 66 unconscious so as there was a crackling of energy forward you two brace yourself managing to get mostly out of the way unfortunately both of you dodging out of the way leaves an open shot for bear that just takes the brunt of it throwing trinket up against the side of the actual mountainous cavern and slumps to the ground smoking off the fur yes not yet until we get to his turn that will end-- yeah technically he should have more from leveling up but even more wouldn't be that much higher so-- okay so that's rough that ends its turn vex you're up first (all laugh) all righty all righty 30 hits 30 hits 22 also hits that's the damage okay gotcha and grog also-- because you're right next to it (posh accent) it doesn't matter you have not taken your turn to rage yet that would be full damage upon you grog to hit okay 15 that's including the hunter's mark right all right good 21 got it so as you look over and you see trinket on the ground smoldering spire of smoke pouring off of his body-- this way do you mean that would be more of an action-action unfortunately but you angrily turn around release your arrow firing a completely furious hail of thorns into the creature as it hits it shatters across its hide some of it scattering onto grog you don't even care you just focus the anger pull out a second arrow unleash this one actually jamming underneath one of the scales you can see a little trickle of dark deep purple blood beginning to pour from the wound okay where do you want to go right there okay okay that ends your turn grog you're up (laughs) okay all righty certainly that hits that hits that also hits 13 damage good to know mm-hm good to know all right so going into the rage you just see that same fury you can smell the burnt hair in the air and you use that to fuel that moment of pain you just (impact sounds) and just start bludgeoning the creature right up in its face you can see it's thrashing and snarling at you and snapping with each blow you guys are locked in this titan-versus-human battle right now cool and are you going to stay where you are this way there fair enough (laughs) okay grog ends your turn keyleth you're up mm-hm trinket's right there you're over here oh that's right make a death saving throw by the way almost forgot roll a d20 okay so not creeping closer to death yet all right so trinket's at 25 hit points conscious prone but conscious you hear the-- okay (laughs) mm-hm uh-huh okay after you finish healing trinket-- -- you pull up reach out and pull this and you're going to hold it in your hands you could feel it's warm to the touch almost too hot to hold and there's this slight pulsing almost like a heartbeat pulse to it you hold it in your hands and just crush it concentrating all your energy on it as you do what seemed to be hard and sturdy all of a sudden turns brittle in your fingers and it cracks and breaks almost like it was made of a very very brittle earth as it breaks and your hands come together the too hot to touch becomes too hot to touch and for a moment your hands burst into flames-- and you instinctively pull back like you want to go ahead and put out the fire-- -- but then it falls to a normal temperature again but the flames remain and you can now see your hands are now emitting flame from all the fingers all right keyleth transforms into minxie and as minxie-- -- appears her form transitioning into this large albino sabre-toothed tiger-- sam and you can see both of the tiger's claws embedded into the ground of this rocky terrain are having licks of fire and flame curling off of the actual claws (laughs) i regret everything (all laugh) right but you can break your movement up you've moved 20 feet so you still have ten more feet to move if you want to that should be there okay all right that ends keyleth now would be tiberius tiberius who now takes the turn to cast stoneskin on himself then backs up behind this side there preparing for the next round vax you're up mm-hm yep all right 24 hits this is with sneak attack yep yep all right that hits regular damage now seven all righty 16 that does not hit you actually go with a third one the first one stabs through and you can see you've actually hit some sort of an internal organ as you pull back and starts gouting blood you see that you stab a second blade in the same area and tend to open the wound another inch inch and a half the third one you pull back but it slinks around over its shoulder its long sinewy neck curling over and staring at you and your blade catches the hide instead and streaks off of the scales that'll end your turn scanlan you're up all righty this giant spectral hand sparkling arcane energy appears roughly in front of your space you can like i'm just saying from a flavor standpoint go for it (all laugh) right oh you can just punch something with it no matter its size to do damage correct correct clenched fisht thish ish the one you're talking about yes all right so-- for the clenched fist make a melee spell attack so roll a d20 and add your spell attack modifier 13 as the fist swings out it ducks out of the way its serpentine body ducking as the fist arcs off into the middle of the air spinning around preparing itself for a secondary round hopefully that's good all right (sings) everyone wants a grog d10 yeah d10 inspiration die from the bard top of the round again percy you're up okay you have the sharpshooter feat right okay so yeah because it would have partial cover right now but you ignore that with the-- good to know yeah but you have to reload after this turn oh no first shot as you pull up to the side you pull your pepperbox out and go to fire as you do you pull the trigger and the actual barrel sticks out the side spins off and (ping-ping-ping) on the ground so that's your attack that's your turn because it'll take you the rest of the turn to collect the bad news yeah you collect pepperbox and you pull your back up to it and mutter curses fair enough okay now on its turn-- first off let's see here but that does not recharge its lightning breath it's going to move here it's going to go ahead and make two attacks it's going to turn around and its head that's looking at you now after you stabbed it in the back reaches down its giant jaws open you can see like this thick saliva that's coating its fangs and it with serpentine speed bites at you that's going to be a 23 to hit 23 all right so let's see that would be-- (laughs) it would be 26 damage so you take 13 points of piercing damage and then as it bites it turns around and its tail begins to snake around your body grog and its whole body begins to try to reach around to constrict and crush you that is a 21 to hit all righty so you take 21 points in bludgeoning damage so that'd be 11 points of bludgeoning damage plus 21 points of slashing damage as well so a total of 22 damage and you are considered grappled and restrained currently as the entire creature begins to wrap around you and you're currently (sound of struggle) you're trying to hold onto your axe but your whole body's being crushed by this large serpentine creature (all laugh) you feel every pulse of its muscles tensing as the pain and ache you can feel muscles and ligaments tearing and popping as it pulls in on you and it's going to as part of its grapple move you with it to there and it'll end its turn vex you're up at the end of the turn okay it has a reach of ten so you are technically within its melee range so you can run but you'll take attack of opportunity from it if you do just so you're aware you can but you have disadvantage on all your ranged attacks because you are in melee range doesn't affect your attacks sorry it's up to you you can stay where you are and take disadvantage on all your attacks or you could run past and it gets a free swipe on you your call okay over to here like how far okay you're right here you can try and back up this way if you wanted to get away that's scanlan there oh here right there over here okay all right okay so trinket gets up and used half its 40 movement it can move-- okay so as you rush away the creature takes-- ooh that's a 26 to hit so you take 18 points of piercing damage oh it's 3d10 sorry 19 i rolled a one for damage 19 points of piercing damage as its mouth lashes out takes a chunk of your shoulder for a second and you wrench yourself away and keep running take the rest of your turn yes you are that hits okay second one hits first one misses or did it hit for damage all right second one blazing bow 16 damage all right okay you currently are completely in its visual range you have to be behind something to reasonably become hidden no behind a person doesn't work it has to be like behind a pillar or in deep shadow something that would break your line of sight to it-- for a moment to the point where it no longer knows quite where you are but now you know all right that's your turn grog you're up all right 20 yes because you are restrained-- need to check what effect the condition-- here just to be safe okay yeah go ahead and you're making an athletics check all right so-- as your teeth sink into one of its scales and you yank it out with the sheer force of your muscly neck it unfurls for a second you manage to pull yourself out of its grasp okay all right that is an action to do that though isn't it yeah for a later time but you have a bonus action still you gain another attack go for it 21 does hit also hits one more hit meaning-- it was one better than your previous-- you hit once yeah just one hit 15 points all right so as you pull away you reach back with your hammer and slam it into its side causing this giant burst of fire-- to emanate from the impact it shrinks back for a second and (growls) (laughs) all right keyleth you're up all right there all righty go for it what was it okay 20 hits an additional 1d6 fire damage yes so any of your claw attacks or any claw attacks you do in any of your forms now get an additional 1d6 fire damage all right go for it your bite does not get the effect that hits go ahead and roll damage for the bite eight plus five is 13 right cool so your flaming claw strikes across its outer body its legs pull away from the pain as you reach up and bite into the edge of its tail as its tail tries to whip away you catch it and it pulls you forward a few feet as you clench down on it eventually it yanks its way out taking a couple of scales with it you can see a streak where teeth marks are on the back of its tail awesome does that end your turn tiberius is going to go around the corner again and is going to cast telekinesis and send his glaive up spinning granny grinder rolls a two unfortunately though just streaks off and spins back around and then while it misses the creature and stops hovering above his head with a slow spin sits there curling his fingers grinning at the creature and is going to the use of the rest of this movement to go back behind the rock because mama didn't raise no fool vax you're up this way that hits sneak attack man 17 just barely hits so oh perfect second dagger wedges in with the second dagger opening the wound even more you're like perfect opening you go for the third one and it's grown wise to it and turns around and rakes its claw out and deflects the dagger midair that brings us to scanlan all right as you say wise guy eh as this giant hand's floating in the air and its head snarls at it and tries to bite at the hand go ahead and roll your spell attack so you get to go ahead and-- yeah 4d8 points of force damage 19 points of force damage as you jam both its fingers into the sides of its head both of its eyes recoil on it it reaches out and starts thrashing at the air around as the hand dodges around for a minute you begrudgingly take 1d10 inspiration dice from scanlan it is not it is a resilient creature and the impact was mainly absorbed by the ocular sockets as opposed to the eyes themselves there's bone around-- never mind all right it ends scanlan's turn percy you're up no you can maintain concentration okay so you take your action to go ahead and repair the gun all right three shots using your bonus action to reload that's right we-- yeah yeah as part of the misfire you would lose one so you have two in the chamber right now yes okay 22 hits what'd you roll you got one shot off go ahead and roll damage sharpshooter damage so it gets the plus ten damage no misfire still hits there is a lot of strengths to the gunslinger this is the one penalty is if you roll bad nice okay so as you go and you fix it-- it takes the first shot with a burst of flame that shoots out the front of the barrel the second shot this time the actual metal in the front arcs upward and it looks like this is going to take a moment to really seriously repair it pepperbox is coming through pretty rough in this fight so that's your turn yeah yeah (laughs) the creature does regain use of its lightning breath all right so you wanna move anywhere which way you mean over here right here okay all righty okay that ends percy's turn considering optimal-- all right so (all groan) so this behir is going to shift back here you get an attack of opportunity on it keyleth so go ahead and take a swing 16 just misses it gets right out of your grasp the flames just lick across the outside of its scales as it pulls back rears down right in your face godzilla-style just unleashes a burst of electrical energy it hits you and keyleth i need you guys to both make dexterity saving throws 33 points of lightning damage to you grog 66 to you you can what's the maximum health of minxie's form okay and how much damage goes over 12 okay so you-- as minxie all of a sudden gets blasted you can see the form shrink down to keyleth's crumpled form on the ground hands still flaming little bit of singe to the back of her hair and stands back up that'll end its turn vex you're up you can-- that would be more of an action to feed it to something else okay a 14 does not hit unfortunately the first arrow just ricochets and shatters across the part of its body both arrows just explode across its hide it's too thick right here a little bit if you pull fully in on this side from where it-- okay don't forget your laser pointers by the way guys it's good for letting me know exactly where you want to go i know just so you know and trinket's going to stay there all right trinket's gonna stay right there guarding the giant gnome giant hand small gnome grog you're up go for it 18 that hits 21 hits 19 hits roll damage all righty how do you want to do this (all yell) it's hard to tell with this entity it's moving so fast you guys watch this continuous barrage this horrible bludgeoning every impact almost quakes the inside of this valley rocks are beginning to tumble and fall around it and you can see as each horrible sickening smack its head just collapses more and more the mush begins to spill out from under it this giant pool of like dark violet liquid and gelatinous mush that was once the inside of its head begin to just grow around it as grog just keeps hitting and hitting and hitting and hitting and hitting and hitting-- and hitting and hitting-- okay if you guys want to take a short rest you can you saw it was up on a higher platform you didn't see a cavern or anything okay looking through the book that you have you eventually take a while to look while you guys are having your short rest you can use your hit dice to heal yourself it is known as a behir b-e-h-i-r behir there are two things anything in the face and teeth are gone they are just mush the entire head is destroyed the the two things in the book that are worthwhile like really worth money are some of its hide can be repurposed for you know like lightning resist-based armor but currently it's unknown who has the speciality to actually work with that material these creatures are difficult to harvest and a lot of their locations are unknown a lot of them were hunted down for that long ago and almost thought to have gone extinct (all groan) go ahead and roll for the hide first if you guys want to go for that sure this would be add your-- for climb this would be athletics it takes you a little bit to get up there it's steep you slide down a few times but eventually because there's no immediate threat you're given time to get up onto this upper platform you can see that there are these various parts of the rock that jut outward that have some short term passageways that this creature uses (laughs) roll a perception check once you're up there you take time and with help from some other folks you manage to harvest i'd say about ten pounds worth of scales at most it's not a whole lot a lot of it has been torn and destroyed from the impact and damage you guys did parts of it are not really armory functional but you manage to get enough to maybe make one set if somebody manages to work really well with it 23 currently you have no eye shot on any particular-- -- tunnels nothing that resembles an abode or a cavern from this position athletics eh it doesn't work like that go for it the twins give a-- -- terrible display of rock climbing in the middle of this go ahead and roll for the glands it takes most of your short rest you will not be able to use your hit dice for healing on this because you spend your time harvesting instead but you manage to-- thankfully the damage that grog had inflicted upon its head destroyed most of its matter right up to the throat gland which is mostly untouched it's salvageable you don't know how much it's worth probably a decent amount as the book says that they're rare especially to find intact you did a number on that one's face you place it within a preservation jar back in the bag of holding okay go ahead and make your check 18 it does cost you half the-- oh right just a single fail it was a dual fail but it was separate you take some time with it during the short rest to tinker with it you manage to bend the metal back in place test it for a bit make sure the aspects that move move smoothly as they should eventually you get pretty confident that it is back to a functional piece of weaponry all right so as you guys finish this rest-- go for it the sky is starting to get a little bit into the orangish color though you can not see the sun from its current location you gather you have about an hour and a half or so before full sundown wait you guys stayed the night-- never mind in the cavern so actually no i take that back i just realized you guys stayed the night last time over on the seaside cavern and walked here-- -- and it only took you a few hours to get here so no it'd be about mid-day noon so i take that back never mind can see the sun it is straight above there is some cloud cover coming in from the north side it doesn't look like anything too dense it moves around so it's hard to get to much of a visual of the-- you can go ahead and make a nature check with advantage okay make a stealth check make a stealth check the mountains here got its name for the white stone mountains the rock-- yeah the mountain range here is a large part of the material that is mined well was mined beneath the-- it's very rare white quartz-like rock that is used for many purposes and it's generally only found in this mountain range it's what a lot of the whitestone's original economy was based on 22 good to know all right so okay i mean you gather the same thing the rock formations here match the same as the coastal mountains the mountain here is all made of the same material few deposits here and there of just normal bits of granite and other forms of simple stone as you guys are pressing forward at this point you guys are taking your time waiting and tiberius is getting impatient and is crossing his arms i feel like i should have gotten more materials i don't think i'm quite prepared enough for this not enough never enough i have an idea i'll be back in a few days he sits down and starts making his teleportation circle (laughs) tiberius leans in and whispers to you in a strange tongue and it sparks in your ear somewhere (whispers) the player's not here and the dm's trying to not make it too complicated for him to keep track of an additional character for this session (all laugh) i'll remember that don't worry i'll be back soon and now i know how to find you he finishes his teleportation circle and with a whoosh with a flash vanishes progressing forward-- -- you begin to-- it's good to help out in the-- you take a moment and anticipate the circumstance and there is within-- what's the distance on it six miles you ascertain that there are quite a few sources of life in this vicinity of some sort of dragon kin or dragon-like entity no technically not from what you can gather but you do gather there are a few blips that are three miles off north at the center of the mountain range you don't know how big or how dangerous but you sense there are some dragon or dragon kin sources attunement you take a short rest with the weapon learning its properties essentially stroking it making sure it feels comfortable nice spread so it feels welcome you guys are heading eastish you guys came up on the eastern side-- sorry the western side of the mountains you're now heading eastward whitestone would be to the east of you guys that would have brought you through the forest and you were trying to avoid that that's what i thought you said last time there's a giant peninsula to the north either side would have been coast you're aware that they're not anywhere close to you to currently be an issue no all right so you guys press on following this winding path that narrows at certain points and then widens for a bit you come across partway through the twins at the front notice around the edges as it begins to descend down into the beginning of the valley descent you see an edge of the mountain that looks more angular than the usual natural formations of it it almost looks like it comes to a point like a very sharp edge and a smooth side it begins to descend towards the valley and on the side of one of the giant-- chasm you guys are at the bottom of you see an outcropping ahead that's angular and pointed like it was sculpted constructed you-- i'd say make an intelligence check roll and add your intelligence modifier you can make a history check you know many things that exist here in the mountains but at this distance you don't see enough of it to actually-- for actually this works out interestingly as you guys are walking forward and you're seeing this and you're keeping back grog you instinctively look over and go oh that's a stone giant fortress with your bloodline and knowing where you come from and you've had a few close encounters in the cliffkeep mountains with a few of this kind you've seen a few fortresses and from the details of it the way of the roof and the scope of its design and the way the mountain range lends itself to that type of topography yeah this is obviously a stone giant fortress or you can move around the side you're welcome to if he was to cast invisibility on you-- you could-- you would move very slow and you would have disadvantage on your stealth checks because you guys don't have a way to move quietly there have been birds that fly through an occasional harpy in the distance you hear screeching and you guys keep quiet until it vanishes and disappears (screech in the background music) i am lucky what were some seafaring like seagulls and various coastal birds have slowly been disappearing and turning into more eagles and hawks things that eat small rodents more of a lush side of the hill you see as you get closer to the valley itself that the actual forest that surrounds whitestone is more and more of these birds of prey are beginning to show up other than that you see very few small things other than occasional lizards about that big in your hand that live on hot rocks it's still a ways away right now you're just catching the edge of it i'd say you're about a good 600 700 feet from it you guys actually used it previously to camp for a night along a cliffside and made the cliff extend further than it was certainly as you guys make your way up the other side you're helping each other i want everyone to go ahead and make an athletics check okay giving you advantage on your athletics check that would help you yes all right so you have advantage you add your strength modifier or your athletics is what it would be you get advantage because of the climbing gear 26 no those who have it because it is mountain all right i'll let you do that 19 26 vex what did you get okay a couple of missteps and almost sliding keyleth at one point you grasp her by the hand and grog pulls her back up onto the platform over time you guys make your way along this very rocky and precarious anywhere from five to three to two feet in width sometimes even lesser than that and you guys are having to shimmy across you make your way around and you can see this large fortress that is built out of extremely large and in-place stones and stonework it looks ancient for size-wise it's two stories for a giant which means it's probably close to six or seven stories of height built into the side of a mountain and it goes down almost like two giant steps it's built on essentially where the giant bowl the caldera if you will of where this valley of this mountain range would be it's built on the inside of it so it's actually constructed as you continue to descend into the valley looking at it you can see openings windows there are areas up top where you see giant piles of rocks and boulders that are used for anti-siege for throwing off the top stockpiles of that you do see boulders around the ground that may have been thrown and not picked up everyone make a perception check hm trinket-- roll an athletics check with disadvantage rangers roll your dice yes nope he gets disadvantage because he's a big bear which is appreciated okay it's been difficult and it slowed your guys' progression but you've managed to keep trinket along with you this large bear is now like pushing against the side he's managed to keep up but it's been a harrowing experience yeah so once again perception rolls this is active actually looking for something the passive is more-- all right you got 26 you said looking from this distance and keeping the best visual you can see there is no movement at all from the interior of the fortress the two front doors you see these two large stone doors that are the entrance to it one of the doors is actually broken in half and left partially ajar and open so at about the two in the afternoon day sun 'cause that's what it is but you're fine you become a bat-- i know she makes her way down through you swoop up to one of the windows and you glance inside and look around you can see most of the furniture inside is in tatters there are large giant-sized tables and chairs that have been broken in half and strewn across the room make a perception check 28 glancing inside you also see there are-- -- splatters and puddles of blood large bits of blood across the ground that is dried but from your current vision from this there is no sign of any living or individuals or bodies there was a battle that took place here but there is nothing present to signify who or what this room is about 25 feet tall it does look like it goes deeper there is a slight-- this is the upper floor there is a grade almost like a slow-- the word escapes me for a second yes a ramp thank you so yeah you do see the ramp that's downward okay make your way down to the threshold of the ramp looking down downstairs as well it looks like there are some fur rugs set aside that have been kicked aside and bunched up on the edge of the room like some sort of a major fight went down no sign of any bodies or body parts no sign of leftover weapons or armor from whatever giants lived in here you just see large amounts of dried blood across the stone floors or the giants slaughtered something horribly here and are currently out and about you don't know but-- did you want to land and make an investigation check quite a bit a little puff not a huge amount but enough where it's not fresh and a closer look the blood's been dry for a while make an investigation check 12 you can't really make it out unfortunately you know it's dried it's been a little bit but you can't quite gauge how long it's been there's the upper floor the lower floor they're two large rooms on their own it looks like-- you haven't actually gone down the grade yet so seven stories for your size it's two stories for a giant size it's a large top room and a large bottom room there are just two rooms top floor bottom floor you're currently on the top floor looking down okay all right the rest of you make you way back down towards the front of the fortress and enter the inside as you go through the front door you see that the impact that destroyed it was from the inside out so it's not like it was beaten in it was beaten from the inside out and there is a streak of dried blood against that portion of the door looking inside too you see there are a large cluster of matted hides and furs like it made for bedding for close to four or five giants put in the corner and there is a musty smell of whatever they were using to make it comfortable and ripe for their own personal needs 17 okay so what do you guys want to do in here you are downstairs at the entrance all right make a perception check actually it'd be more of an investigation check okay you find a giant's fortress for this perception is just seeing things at first glance investigation is going through and rummaging through to find things okay yeah go for it okay as you guys are going through looking at the blood and the way the splashes are the blood that was spilled here was very thick and large amounts of it and it's probably been anywhere from two to three months since this entire fortress was ransacked over time you find a number of shattered glass vials that look like they once contained various elixirs there is one that is unshattered all right and underneath all covered in quite a bit of filth but a little bit of metallic sheen streaks through you see what looks to be a very very well-crafted longbow taking it it appears to have some sort of magical radiance to it it looks like it's very well crafted you recognize the construction is elvish in nature and there are bits of mithril scrolling all throughout the bow itself with platinum caps on the edge of the longbow natural 20 yes this is definitively a magical item it is enchanted if you want to take a short time to work with it and attune yourself to it you could get a better idea of what its effect is all right investigation check for that here are the potion and the bow you guys managed to-- (laughs) give that to scanlan a six it's hard to tell it's a very strange scene and you have no inclination as to what may have transpired here who is the winner who is the loser and what has been done with the bodies over time the only thing you catch is occasionally you see flocks of birds moving through and swooping through the area you watch one flock come up and begin circling a little bit and then make its way down toward the valley this is for grog who is outside roll a stealth check yes you did which means you have knowledge of mountains let me double-check on this actually what the specifics of the goliath's-- you don't take issues with cold climates because you're at high elevation you don't actually get advantage on anything mountain-wise that is a ranger ability it's been a while how long does that last yeah that would've faded by now oh well if it's a natural one it wouldn't have mattered so while you sneak off to the side you see these birds there's a lot of birds there you start yelling out to everyone there's a lot of birds out here shouting it loudly back into the fortress the birds immediately start circling the fortress very close you can hear the screeching you can see the birds now they're crows a very very thick murder of crows probably close to a hundred of them cawing mm-hm you hear an echoing sound yeahhhh formless sourceless you all stand there confused for a moment then continue to try and stealth back inside eventually the crows take back to their original path yep what are you doing as keyleth concentrates for a second you see her eyes the actual color of her irises begin to fade to this cloudy white and then the entire eye itself becomes this icy blue a slight cold mist beginning to drift off the corners of her face you start hearing this pounding sound on the top of the fortress as sleet and hail begins to rain down go ahead and roll damage for the spell sleet storm oh it's just a dexterity saving throw it says heavily obscured but doesn't actually do any damage sleet storm knocks things prone makes the area hard to see douses flames and a few do there are a few birds that get pelted and knocked to the ground encased in sleet but most of it immediately takes note to get away from the storm and vanish and disappear back to-- i'll say one does grog you run out there and grab the one on the ground it's struggling and (squawks) there's ice gathered everywhere you grab it and you pick it up you hear vex go grog and you go (chomp) as she's staring at you silencing the crow you hear the cawing of the crows dissipate in the distance and silence eventually takes the fortress once again and you're left amongst the smell of death you make your way out of the fortress and begin to follow the path down into the outside of the forest and just as you make towards the base of the mountains where the forest canopy begins to take your vision you can see just over the edge a couple of small castle towers and what looks to be a single central spire of the castle of whitestone and with that we're going to go ahead and take a break all right guys we'll be back here in about 20-25 minutes let us begin where we left off yes you know this area very well this entire forested area the parchwood forest that encompases the entirety of this valley toward the center of it center north is where whitestone sits and for your reference as well since you've been here before you would know the city relatively well hold that over by your seat there for people to take a look at that is a basic rundown of the size design and shape of whitestone with castle whitestone toward the top built on top of a leveled off mountain that marks the southernmost point you guys are actually coming in from what would be the northwestern side of the city a little bit further down about that angle there that's the direction you're coming in from i don't have any free time anymore (all laugh) oh yeah totally do you ask this of percy that graveyard does not-- -- it is a surface graveyard there is a mausoleum-- -- but that-- -- is actually contained beneath the castle there is one one that you took to escape he has an aneurysm yeah it is to the very western edge of the mountain precipice the castle was built on it was built to be specifically an escape in case the place was under siege unfortunately the circumstances that the evening happened so rapidly and with creatures that seemingly were unnatural the family didn't have time to make it out and even you weren't fully aware of it cassandra however had overheard discussions about the passage and took that as your escape route it's a hidden tunnel at the very base of the mountain you guys have been travelling through the forest and it is a very dense forest but it is mostly cold-weather trees pines and there is you can see once you get inside the forest the ground itself is very thick and there are elements of melting snow on the top of the trees there was recently a snowfall in this area but it seems like it's been a while and most of it has turned to slush and water you have about two hours of travel into the forest and you all immediately catch the sound of distant howling no yeah make a nature check if you want to make a stealth check 26 those are wolves it sounds like a pack of wolves probably close to anywhere from five or six you gather that it is strange that they're out though it is getting later in the day you are pushing four or five in the afternoon the sun is starting to get closer to the horizon it is strange that they're out this early you're not sure what the reasoning would be for that okay about two more hours of travel about an hour all right now invisibility how long does it last at full duration well flying takes an hour so it's one of those things you could do once you approach it it'll last you awhile as opposed to doing it now so somewhere around six hours five hours everyone who's in a tree please roll a stealth check roll an athletics check well she did not cast it okay we'll say you guys all manage to slowly get yourself up into the tree the best you can as you guys take off while you guys are away making your way towards whitestone the rest of you look down and just from a passive perception standpoint you pick up the most detail you can see there is indeed a pack of about five wolves and/or dogs a little ways away but they're being followed by one humanoid they're being guided there is a pack out here for some reason whether it be a hunting party or whatever other reasons there may be it isn't a wild pack you'd have to roll again because she's casting pass or you won't get the benefit go ahead and just add ten to the previous roll (all cheer) so about five breathless moments pass as the dogs wolves all get relatively close one of them comes up and returns back to the pack you don't get a good view of the individual that is currently guiding the pack and you see them disappear between the thick trees in the distance make an active perception check for you vex if you don't mind is forest no you're in forest now you're sure that's a favored terrain then go ahead and roll again so your total is 18 okay it's hard to make out the details at this distance you check out it does appear to be a female form best you can tell you can't tell specific race or details then another minute passes before the barking and the howls fade and the hunting party seems to have been eluded no do you want to make an active perception check normally if they'd passed by now-- a natural 20 you see the female form it's not someone you particularly recognize but the woman does appear to be older probably in her late 40s early 50s she has some hunting gear over her shoulder she has a short bow that's strapped over her she has a quiver of arrows she looks like she's hunting for food give her ten years no you don't have an immediate lead of visual recognition in the meantime you guys make your way swooping down you can see that cluster that murder of crows circling out it's making a large pass over this entire valley you take this cue as you get to within visual range of the city to cast invisibility on both of you is that a 3rd-level spell okay both of you vanish from view which is a strange feeling for you because you cannot see keyleth you're grasping onto something you can't see and you just look like you're gliding through the air yeah you grab on very tightly -- without choking the eagle does not have-- -- human physiology you get two fistfuls of feathers and you really don't want an eagle to buck you angrily at this height i don't think you have featherfall so that wouldn't go well looking over whitestone you can see outside of the city there are some areas where the trees are carved out and there is farmland set up specifically to grow food and to till to maintain sustenance for the people that live there you can see that there's a small area that's also being cut for timber not a perpetual thing but the wood here is you've heard previously one of the major exports here is very high-quality timber from this type of tree that is used for very exquisite woodcraft and furniture so that's one of the major exports of whitestone as well as the quartz from the mines itself there are people in the city but sparse make a perception check you may (singsong) you may yes you do total of 14 24 okay as you get close enough to start scanning over details you can see that a lot of the buildings appear to be closed or empty there are people working in the fields as you make your way to the center of the town there is a town square there is a tree there a very large old tree that is twisted with all these various gnarled branches that reach out you recall desmond mentioning something called the sun tree that is the centerpiece of this area and you get a view enough of the tree to see that there are eight humanoid bodies of varying ages swinging from it you also notice that patrolling through the city at very slow paces there are a few larger than normal humanoids you see what appear to be approximately six giants patrolling through the town but you can see some of them are like wrecked and broken one of them is missing an arm and is dragging a foot behind it apparently whenever one of them is moving through most of the denizens of the town keep a very wide berth and generally avoid them entirely and go about their business at a distance like over all of the entire city they're pretty well scattered about after you do a full pass over the city those are most of the details you can make out at this height anything further any specifics you want to go for before heading back farmlands look likely to be the largest cluster of people you can see since it's getting to the end of the day there are folks finishing up gathering the crops that were available to them or sort of planting as they go through and you can see there's about five or six people that are all in one group most everyone else seems to be relatively solitary and trying to go about their business as fast as possible the town square nobody is in the town square people are avoiding it like the plague there's eight bodies hanging from the tree and nobody wants to be there there actually are no trees by the farm all the trees have been cleared out to make the farmland so there's actually a bit of the forest that's been cleared for that purpose yeah you can go to a tree that's nearby but that's like 300 feet away there is a wall there is a wall on the outskirts of whitestone okay you swoop down and you perch on the edge of the wall there it's about 25 feet up and you can't talk right now you're an eagle okay okay you make your way down the 25-foot wall she's perched on go ahead and make an athletics check to climb yes 17 the stonework here is old and you manage to not lose your footing entirely as you bring your way down thankfully you're light enough and the stones are not too large so you can get some good handholds you do over the next 12 minutes or so make your way to the base of the wall yep a lot of moments of (gasps) 'whoa okay' but you catch yourself i mean you can just jump if you wanted to make it less but the duration of your invisibility-- you have about 20 more minutes before it dissipates you look over the edge and you can see that they have carts up and that they have what vegetables they have and a lot of vegetables even at a close look a lot of them look withered it looks like there is a general sense of frustration that the land itself is not producing quality crops and even the people look unhealthy and gaunt by nature whether it be the cold winter recently or just their general spirit is broken but there is a feeling about these people that life here is not what it used to be there isn't a whole lot of conversation there's mutterings here and there we have to make sure we get these back in time fill the cart we have two carts we have to get in and the other one's i know i know i'm trying and they're putting it over there and there's a little bit of frustration among them one of them ends up counting the last bit of crop that's it that's all we have that is the entire pull for the day and the older gentleman who is overseeing it grinds his hands and goes sir kerrion is going to have my hide at the very least let's gather it together and hopefully pelor will protect us and the people take the carts and begin making their way towards the outer gate on the southeast side of whitestone where you guys are currently at all right make an athletics check okay 15 minutes after five minutes of eavesdropping you realize that you are not going to make it up that wall and you feel the magic of your invisibility illusion about to fade at this point by the way the sun has just hit the edge of the mountains the sky itself is a vibrant reddish orange slowly turning to purple and sunset is upon you he's invisible no okay as you pass to the side the illusion fades you step into a small opening of dark purplish energy and then reemerge on the top of the wall-- matt and --and hop back on the back of her okay okay you guys vanish and keyleth you take off back in the direction you guys traveled from in the meantime guys what do you want to have been doing are you just waiting are you traveling further in are you staying where you are with the-- okay once per day she fires an arrow and the arrow splits into three and each one bursts into thunder damage bursts of them thunder damage it should say on there oh then it would be lightning damage so yeah it's pretty fun what's that from so the night falls and the crickets begin to emerge the slow mist begins to form okay so you take the partially rusted over but functional metallic skull cap that clarota was wearing when you guys met in the underdark that clarota no longer needs you place it on your head and it's a little loose as you place it on it rattles for a moment and then it form-fits to your skull your hair being pinched beneath it and just emerging from underneath almost loki-helmet-style there's a weird buzzing vibrational feel as its magic attunes to you over the next hour or so as you're waiting but you get the sensation that it will offer some decent protection from impeding charm effects a loki mullet you start to get really nervous about the arrival of your friends until eventually you hear the flapping of wings you look up and you can see since it has taken an hour to get there the illusion just fades both a giant eagle and scanlan appear in the moonlight right above the canopy of the forest you guys are close to and return to the place you were takes about an hour or so but you manage to pull from the surroundings these really nice thick spider silk hammocks that should be able to support your respective weights grog is the only one that might be questionable with the sheer amount of weight that is his form desmond i mean you can go with-- there are maybe many reasons it's called the sun tree you do know and this ties into your story as well because the guidance in forging the city of whitestone that tree was representative to them as a guardian of pelor the god of the sun the protector of light holiness-- sure in your experience with the roving band of barbarians you guys enjoyed very much peeing on very colorful trees of all sorts of plant life all of them generally didn't seem to over time react well to the process whether it be the fact that you all drank a lot of the time so the content of your urine was probably not very hospitable that's a whole different kind of festival the lemon party is held on the far far southern continent of tubgirl the region of goatse no the invisibility faded when he attacked the guard yeah they probably would've gotten to whitestone around seven o'clock and leaving right as the sun had fully set go ahead and roll a religion check a religion check a witch 16 okay pelor is the god of the sun and agriculture it's a good deity and is generally worshipped by farmers and simple folk and people that live off the land and generally it's the most nature-based deity of the main spectrum outside of melora which is the deity of nature you know of pelor yeah there are elements of pelor's following that bleeds into your druidic nature though you don't necessarily follow a deity you believe that the essence of nature in itself is your patron you are not a religious man by nature and you know that there is a strong following of pelor in the town the entire graveyard that you talked about earlier that one is largely built around the imagery of pelor and of all the gods that are worshipped here pelor's probably 75% of the population of whitestone where in some shape or form if not devout worshippers at least were like yeah pelor's cool what is it yeah that's totally doable go ahead and roll a tinkering check just for the sake of a possible epic failure while the rest of you end up taking your evening's rest grog you immediately snap your hammock and fall 15 feet to the ground but you manage to make your way up there and just bear hug the tree trunk for rest you're used to sleeping in uncomfortable situations over time or at once you manage to complete three pieces of parchment roughly page-sized with your black powder treatment successfully the mist rolls in and gets thicker and thicker to the point where you cannot see the floor of the forest the little bit of moonlight that manages to make its way through the boughs of the trees trickles through and then vanishes into these slowly-shifting bits of fog your breath every time you exhale is visible as the cold night air begins to take you find yourselves instinctively shivering as you cannot grow close to each other for heat nor build a fire the night while uncomfortable you do manage to get an evening's bit of mostly uncomfortable rest but rest nonetheless eventually coming to as the morning sun comes up and heats it up the fog begins to fade away and burn away you're at about an hour past sunrise as you all unrestfully come to consciousness as the temperature shift hits you manage to relieve yourselves of your spider silk-based hammocks and/or tree grasping both you and trinket have found this way of clutching onto the tree trinket's used to the wild it's about seven 730 in the morning certainly you take a moment and concentrate on the kitchen at this point in time you can see early morning laina is currently in there yawning and is cleaning about and starting to make a small breakfast for all the guards you can hear in the distance some conversation in the distant room it appears to be a couple of your various employed mercenaries having a conversation as she's making breakfast they seem fine okay concentrating on pike-- about two minutes of hard concentration there's no connection you gather due to the relatively fresh and unstable nature of this potion you had concocted you can only have one source connection up at a time so when you left it in your keep it seems that the one you had at the temple of sarenrae was alleviated of its magical presence what was once a magical scry poo is literally just scan-scat at the temple sure enough with a high enough persuasion roll you don't know ask pike when you see her again (laughs) so you make your way down into the forest about another hour and a half of travel before you start getting to where the trees begin to clear up a little bit and you can see the base of the cleared-off mountain that whitestone castle is built upon and the pathway that descends into the outer wall of the city of whitestone it's maybe a quarter mile space-relation-wise you guys are just getting to this side of the forest right there right there and this is the mountain yeah you'd be able to disguise yourself the disguise kit a lot of the houses have basements there are varying degrees of it there are larger homesteads that were reserved for the actual nobles that ran the day-to-day life of whitestone when your family was in power as you heard from desmond probably the places where the new nobles live those are the ones that have the gates surrounding them the larger homesteads scattered throughout the town it's far too obvious there are many small abodes and even some farm-based hovels the poor end of town is the farming side which is the southwest which is the closest area to where you guys made your stop earlier the shopping district is the center of town around the town square yeah right there you guys are awake after this discussion i'd say it's about 800 in the morning 830 actually your travel to the city and you're on the outskirts of it now it would be closer to 930 okay stealth oh (laughs) your beard is pretty much at the fullest it'll ever be you gather you can probably get a little more thickness to it but your beard is at maximum grog the fact that you even have a goliath with a beard is a feat of magic in its own right so you guys are traveling as a group i need stealth checks from everybody did you roll a natural 20 as well both of you guys rolled natural 20s in stealth there you go you guys are all going together you dirty yourselves up a bit you're still a large goliath you're still a few half-elves a gnome outside of illusion magic you're still going to stick out like a sore thumb this is a legit use of seeming too okay trinket as well of similar size i believe as far as seeming is concerned-- if not then i'll allow it for the purposes of this yep each creature can seem a foot shorter or taller or appear thin fat or in between you can't change their body type so trinket will still be a four-legged creature but you can make him look like a different four-legged creature all right so trinket takes on the form of a donkey the rest of you are a smattering of various humanoids you-- okay so you guys look like pretty rough peasants dirty faces you know hair a little razzled it looks like you've been living the harsh life on the outskirts of the slums of whitestone for quite some time-- -- with a donkey so you guys utilizing your stealth checks and the seeming you make your way up to the-- which side of whitestone are you coming in from percy okay so you come into this entrance here you make your way into the center of town blending in best you can there are a few folks who see you enter just give you a strange look you all are unfamiliar to the denizens of whitestone-- -- but you don't look like a threat per se so you are noticed and some people seem to just stop and watch you pass but no one seems to make any active mention note or change in behavior towards it (laughs) make a deception roll i'll give you advantage on it because the seeming does give you the visual perspective of being close to their type okay that's two luck rolls by the way that you've spent the woman you approach who's probably in her early 30s pale blonde hair looks like she actually might be losing it in some places gives you a look and goes you poor people shouldn't be here you'll find it but you're not going anywhere else welcome to whitestone she turns around and walks back joining arms with apparently a man that she's paired with and the two of them just walk away a bit dumbfounded that people walked into whitestone as this happens you glance over your shoulder and you see coming from the northern edge from this side wall-- (sounds of booming footsteps) a very tall noticeably undead giant with its jaw broken off and hanging from the hinge dried caked blood across its chest it's just dragging this large club behind it you right now you're in a t to the right and left are roads that go along the inside of the wall that surrounds whitestone to the front of you is the path that leads further into the city cemetery's over here all right so you guys make your way through-- what you've noticed has changed is one largely the population is far more sparse than you recall what was once a bustling city you're now seeing about half as many people as you would would see this time of day going through everyone seems to be in relatively poor health there are a few buildings that look long-term abandoned immediately in this area here in the outskirts catches your guys' eye you do notice that the corner lamps that you had set up at the different corners of the streets appear to be shattered there would be like you know glass oil lanterns that at night someone would go around and light them after the sunset the posts that hold them now are all either broken or the glass itself has been shattered there are plenty of buildings that look dark and mostly untouched in this section here as you begin to move closer and closer inward okay you guys move this way as you push towards the center of this here you-- you move past the center here and to the left of you you can see the town square and there it is the sun tree very very large you imagine beautiful tree at one time full height was probably about 40 feet tall the branches twist out and almost look like they're hanging loosely the ends everything looks droopy and desolate there's not a leaf on it make a nature check okay it's hard to tell from this distance there are a number of types of trees it could be it's not indigenous to this land the fact that it grew here means that either it was transplanted or it was some sort of-- -- magical creation for its presence and you do see the silhouette of the eight figures slowly swaying from beneath the branches did you guys want keep moving down this path to go through the square closer to the tree do you want to go southward okay so you're going this way you guys turn left and you make your way towards the town square and as you enter the square looking around you can see there are what would have been carts and small booths set up for selling of meats and other goods what was a small you know barter-and-sale based hub of this town-- nowhere near on the scale of emon's bazaar but you know enough to support this town-- desolate all look to be closed down and untouched for quite some time as you get a closer look to the-- actually i'm gonna have you guys all roll perception checks you're not getting too close to the tree as you guys are keeping on the outskirts of the square it's hard to make out the details and the weathering has muddled the figures that are hanging there percy and vax you guys notice the figure on the far left-- the body on the far left has red paint smattered across its face and its arms it's wearing a dirtied green vest-like robe that dangles below it as it hangs there loosely immediately to the left of it you see what looks to be the body of a child the child is dressed up in a purplish billowing shirt very fine silk shirt and pantaloons and is dangling there next to it to the left of that you see what appears to be a female adorned in greens and browns looks like red paint has been driven through the hair and dangles to the left of that figure next to that you see what appears to be-- -- you see what appears to be another woman dressed in dark blacks and browns leathers some furs across the top dark hair dangling to the left of that you see another man dressed similarly dark greys and blacks long dark hair dangling to the left of that you see a rather large man older rotund probably in his forties clothing padded but mostly open chest hair completely shaven bald it looks like there are dark scars placed across the face hanging to the left of that you see this figure is actually not humanoid you see what appears to have been-- -- a recently hunted bear who is dangling do you want to get closer and look from what you can see now nothing but just rocks and stones and piles of loose cloth rotting below it approaching it looks like each one of these bodies has been dressed up it looks like the color in the redhead's hair has been smeared through with paint it looks like the person who has been painted red has been slapdash you gather with a moment of looking at it that these were not individuals that were caught this way this was set up as a message you guys continue past down this pathway there's other buildings you see in the vicinity that you know look abandoned or for the most part unoccupied i'd say about one in every three buildings looks like it's in disuse you guys came-- made this path-- you can see a little bit you can see is a-- -- iron fence it used to belong to one of the noble families of whitestone each one of these large buildings here these three and you remember this were the three families that ran the town eight bodies no there was a bear think of an eight-year-old child make an investigation check sure it would be advantage on that check for you 21 you gather these bodies have probably been here for the better part of a week week and a half there is some mild decomposition starting to settle in there is a bit of bloating to some of them couldn't have been much longer than that that would probably be somewhere in this vicinity here as the three main houses are right there (laughs) i'd say make an investigation check yeah i'll say i'll say it takes the better part of the next hour or so and you do a little bit of meandering to find it you guys are being stealthy best you can through alleys and such but even so you are out in the open midday but you are also you know under seeming no no the tree is out in the center and essentially the nearest building is probably anywhere from 100 200 feet away from it it's the tree out in the middle of the square and the square which used to have probably more things towards the center more temporary establishments have all been put to the sides and put to disuse you do manage to see what appear to be what was once a tavern or an inn of some kind that is silent closed the doors locked and chained the windows look dusty okay you go around the side of it to the alley okay the window is locked continuing your guys' stealth as your going this would be your attempting to unlock the window 22 okay it takes a bit to jostle it in a way because the lock is on the inside but there are ways that you could shimmy the glass and get something underneath to push it aside you manage to get the window open and as you pull it up the dust billows up around you you set it aside you step in and the place smells stale musty dark there are you can see candlesticks set around that have not been lit for a while and the oil lanterns that normally light the interior of the main tavern social area have been long in disuse if you guys want to look around are you all going in you as well or are you talking to the tree you find your way inside the abandoned tavern and it is what was this giant l-shaped building right here in the corner of the town square there is a second floor approximately runs 20 rooms they are all currently unlocked some of them left open the bedding covered in dust some of it looks like it was left in a hurry there is a cellar you find the cellar and down there there are a number of empty barrels and a couple of ones that are still full one that appears to be a heavy whiskey barrel probably about twenty untouched wine bottles a little bit of ale but it looks like a lot of ale was either completely used or taken with whoever left and abandoned the premises going from a number of the rooms up top not every room has a window but it's like every third room on that side of the building does have a view of the entire square i'd say probably about 200 feet 250 feet if you cast a spell while invisible unless it's greater invisibility then it will drop the illusion there are some windows in the tavern there was one on the second floor you're going to start carving a tunnel-- okay easy enough to find old rags all of them have that stale musty towel scent to them you get them a little wet there's no water here all the water here has dried out you'll have to use the wine it'll probably kill some of the bacteria there are wells throughout the towns you see ground wells that are set in the city there is no nearby river the closest river the one you know about is about a 30 minute walk south yeah you use that to coax them out a bit it's easy enough for you to go around and put cloth over the windows it's a dark interior so it's not like an immediate-- interesting okay right it's more getting the parchment there without it tearing or the arrow leaving it behind because it is a thin flimsy piece coiled and then-- that's going to be a really intricate-- go ahead and roll a tinkerer's check okay you toy with it for a while you think you have something that may work you're uncertain as to on its release if it'll function or not so write down 'parchment delivery arrow' with a question mark next to it all right you continue to burrow through the ground moving the earth aside and the tunnel opens before you like the clay slowly melting away and it is wet earth eventually you start getting to a few thick roots under the tree the roots that you see they continue past the tunnel they go very very deep into the ground you finish the spell and you reach out and you touch the root and you instill the force of your nature-based divine energies into the root silence this tree is dead right now with all the traveling you guys have done i'd say it's past noon probably including the time you've spent inside the tavern searching it through and preparing it as your base of operations certainly so you've made the purchase within emon for how many of the requisite chalice for the heroes' feast it's a gem-encrusted bowl worth 1000 gold pieces which the spell consumes so we'll say how many of those did you purchase in emon knowing you'd be casting this in the future for the whole feast mark 3000 gold from the group's queue and you have three gem bowls using one now so you have two bowls left at your disposal and you prepare a heroes' feast for the group to consume it lasts for 24 hours so until about-- -- 2pm tomorrow so mark that down somebody note that it lasts until 2pm 2d10 trinket can also benefit from this by the way too yep you are immune to poison and diseases and being frightened and all wisdom saving throws are made with advantage feast is awesome and disease and frightened so feast consumed you now take your next eight hours-- --to work on this as she sits down to begin the ritual of cleansing or bringing plant vitality enhancement to the vicinity of whitestone we're going to go ahead and end today's session there pick up at the end of that spell at the beginning of next week this is getting real interesting what you guys got to town around nine 930 walking around seeing things finding the tavern and then getting in there and cleaning it out i'd say you're getting close to one two o'clock now you've also taken it slow you're also being stealthy and not trying to be conspicuous as you move through of course it fit right into my-- all right guys so we'll pick up from there next week
