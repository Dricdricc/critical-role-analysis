one at the speed of light unless we have any other announcements i think it's time to bring us down to tonight's episode of critical role [dramatic music] no i assumed you'd ask questions i'm an open book what do you require you shouldn't to be perfectly honest i am a being that rides the line between what's true and what's false and i know your research has spoken the same however strange circumstances make for strange bedfellows and circumstances as they are i think you have very little choice as do i listen for a moment and i'll tell you a bit about the history of this green dragon before you my home is south of here within the jungles of the rifenmist peninsula along the southern side of the stormcrest that is where i met the cinder king nearly two decades ago he encroached upon my territory we battled then an exhausting struggle over days thordak is keen of eye however and older than i he held his assault he saw me and he saw my disease i was cursed a half-century ago when i infiltrated and toppled a temple of melora that was being built by a high druid for her roving peons as i consumed her last follower broke the druid upon her altar she gave her dying breath to spite me this sickness that she imparted was merely an inconvenience but as the years wore on it spread and worsened i left my pursuits of base interests and began to obsess over a cure for this before it took me i burned through servant after servant to find anything on such a disease everything failed everything thordak somehow noted and recognized my ailment he said 'you are unwell a rare malady upon you 'it will claim you in time however i've traveled the world i've gathered many secrets and i know 'how to be rid of it to burn it out of your system with a fire you will never find i've done 'it before i can burn away the worst of illnesses' now i am a creature that can pierce any lie by nature i know in my heart that he spoke the truth that day that dragon when asked what he wanted in return he said 'your servitude' we made an agreement he would return once he marked his domain we discussed the terms however he did not return i grew furious and sought answers only to find that he was brought low and sealed away by some assembled others some fools from emon it took me years of seeking but i found his whereabouts i was not going to let my chance to strike away this bloody curse slip from me so i met him on the fire plane over the years i saw his swelling his pained form he spoke of plans ideas for vengeance and domination but he would not relinquish the secrets he promised me until i released him i proposed the conclave i assembled the others i negotiated the agreements i corrupted the binding stone i prepared the pyrah gate i did everything as time went on thordak's clarity muddled it seemed his bindings the power that he was absorbing was beginning to drive him mad so we did not have any more time i needed to initiate the escape before he lost enough to forget our agreement the means to even fulfill his side of the bargain no celestial solstice as planned but winter's crest would have to do and with thordak freed the conclave assembled tal'dorei was razed divided and won but thordak still withheld his words he laughs at my requests i see now that he does not mean to tell me and never really did as his mind began to go he enjoys his seat of power over all of you over me i want him dead i want to watch him be torn apart i want to see his eyes go cold and in that very moment i want to call his spirit back and bind his word to tell me how i can save myself and then laugh at his misfortune as i tear what's left of him that is why i come to you i have not the power to take him myself child i commend your bravery in the face of certain doom but think before you give in to such base passions there is much to be gained by us working together and so much more to be lost child your anger is misplaced-- i did not slay a single one of your people thordak's release destroyed the top of that mountain-- keyleth do not mistake my grace in this room for need of conflict nor foolhardy wishes if i wanted each one of you dead i would be chewing on your bones right now i bring information-- i bring knowledge of thordak-- i know where asum is-- the one you call seeker asum is alive in emon still working amongst the clasp the story i gave you was mostly truth peppered with necessary deceit to place me here amongst you for the time i needed he is there to secure survivors against thordak i infiltrated the ranks of the clasp gained his trust which allowed me to find your whereabouts and so i came he sent me on a mission to notify you of his plans which by the way along with brotoras goldhand and the clasp's cooperation they have a plan to strike at the cinder king slippery dragon (laughter) one that'll fail of course you see they put their knowledge in what a red dragon is capable of they believe that by quelling the flames or stoking some nature of the crystal in its belly's magic there would be a way to stop him and there is a path to be taken there yes but their knowledge is faulty they don't understand the nature of the enchantment and should they attack they will burn in the flames of their own righteousness i wish i knew the extent of it-- and you watch as asum's form grows a little more green in places the scales unfolding and as the image though still in the halfling form where the scales rest you can see a series of deep purplish-black veins that ride up the side of the throat and across the chest and the arms and they pulse with each heartbeat it withers my constitution it makes me weary i've sat with this for nearly a hundred years my brain is not dull but i wish not to have this brilliant intellect waste away into ash because i couldn't find an answer well weak by my standards i have no interest in this mass domination most of these petty creatures that you call your brethren they live amongst their cities and that's fine my happiness lies in returning to my home in the rifenmist where i can pillage the eastern and southern coasts or i can ride out amongst the viridian ocean and steal what is necessary to survive and enjoy my network of followers and spies far away from where you live if you're uncomfortable with my proximity post the fall of the king i will happily take my presence elsewhere gather my people my belongings and find a roost somewhere across the ozmit perhaps i have spent many years trying to untangle what could be the lie behind those eyes and i am certain there is a confidence with knowing and withholding it is stronger than the strongest of bluffs and i've seen that confidence in the cinder king a cruelty in that knowledge that smugness by most standards has been for some time but it continues to slip his narcissism grows to dangerous bounds amusing you think that because you took surprise upon umbrasyl the brute his inferior intellect that you will have the opportunity to strike me down you have no idea what i'm capable of no matter what malady festers within me this is your home right percival it would be a shame for it to suddenly no longer exist 19 okay the entity you see before you does appear to be physically present to the best of your knowledge no one's touched it or attempted to but it does seem to be present with you vorugal is a beast simple of mind eager to kill eat sleep that's about the extent as long as it's given enough land and cattle to devour it seems happy it enjoys the hunt it enjoys the challenge our agreement should this go forward does not end when the cinder king dies i demand the opportunity to converse with the spirit from the corpse once that's done then you may pull your rug out from under me if you will i wish you the best of luck you see whereas i have the aptitude to know where my alliances stand vorugal is of the entire conclave the closest thordak has to a lap dog probably the best bet yes i have no interest in whatever enchantment shackles him to his insanity i merely wish to draw from him the secret i've been promised insight check both of you guys go seems to be telling the truth gathering information like i do no i moved down to the stables and found a soft bit of hay yes i sleep in his bed and his clothes it isn't the most optimal circumstance but i think we both have much to gain because everywhere i've sought the information seems to have been destroyed by thordak once we made the accord you could take a look if you like but i myself do not know its nature yes i have i've tried all forms of cleansing magic i've bent many diviners to my aid and all have failed this isn't a simple magic this was a spirit curse this was something far more powerful i don't want to it's likely very quickly yes keeps a close watch on his subjects he's paranoid requires us to continuously check in which i have been i have my means in my room yes no as far as he knows i'm currently somewhere on the outskirts of westruun attempting to forge some sort of vengeance for what happened to umbrasyl i'm very good at avoiding the sight of those who would seek me if i wish not to be seen based on the correspondence that was put out by thordak he was very perturbed at the death of the black dragon that you've slain as such sent a rather large assortment of his and vorugal's wyvern army to sweep the entire middle eastern side of tal'dorei in search of you i presume thankfully your allies put up some sort of illusory barrier which i did not disturb during that time to whatever consolation that is to our agreement this is true you see if i were to utilize my full potential which would be required to fell vorugal-- as idiotic as the creature is it's still a very dangerous and cunning foe maybe i overestimated your intelligence but in doing so would immediately paint a target on my back for thordak i think it's best that i remain in his good graces as we all flank up unexpectedly when the time is right she i'm saying the choice is yours either we work together or you all fall half-elf look at me your worldview is clouded by optimism that does not belong in exandria there is good there is evil but this world has been remade many times because life is destruction you should know this as a purveyor of life in its own right the cycle lives on the chaos perseveres everything grows eats then dies or is eaten you can put whatever fine dressing on it you like are you telling me you have not claimed a life or two in your time do you think your goals and your attempts to save those close to you have not been wrought with bloodshed do you think you have not stepped on an anthill to get to your destination i merely stepped on an anthill to get to mine understand there are different levels of thought intellect and intent here i come to you because we have much to gain together or lose everything by not listening to what i have to say i will if you promise to let thordak's soul be mine this isn't a negotiation what am i getting out of this if i aid you with the tearing of vorugal as a show of goodwill in response you keep my true nature secret between those in this room you maintain that i have access to the length and breadth of whitestone largely because i have interests in deciding my plan against thordak let's just say some of it may include a trinket or two that have come in your way on your travels i have some ideas i have seen it already i've been here for some time my dear i'm not telling you anything that was not part of the negotiation raishan snaps her fingers you see a spark and you notice a brief burst akin to a minor illusion no sound nothing just the image of a tiny black orb i would recommend none of that any suspicion means i'm being followed if i'm followed and feeling threatened the person you told may not survive we do not want that but i'm going to look out for myself so anyone you tell you're putting in danger fair enough it's already off the radar i just will not touch the radar i don't know this is the old war room which is upstairs facing the front nope it's about i'd say-- close to 30 feet by 60 feet there's two doors that enter and then two windows that face out the front make an investigation check if you're looking for traps it's investigation make a general perception check 21 glancing about the room it does not appear to have anything that you notice different it has the two banners on the side walls it has the table in the center with some chairs scattered about and there's the two windows opposite one window that currently raishan has to her back thordak has no idea what lies beneath this city thordak is too obsessed with himself are you referring to your vestiges you already told me everything you informed me of your entire journey of course you did what does thordak want thordak wants everything everything thordak is using the crystal in his belly to slowly build a volcano beneath emon to turn the surrounding city and the countryside into a new mountain of his visage that's going to be another hundred years before the entire mountain is complete but the physicality is already adjusting the molten rock begins to swirl and flow beneath the cloudtop district well the volcano is being summoned beneath him such is the nature of the crystal he carries the energy he absorbed from the fire elemental plane carried over with him and it's still hungry it's why he swells that's why he's in pain but he just laughs amidst it as it also gives him extreme power and nigh invulnerability it's possible i have no knowledge of this glintshore i don't think i know anything about some briarwoods it's a little off-putting yes i know what i've been told do you think i wish to have another creature that i pay subservience to essentially melora is the goddess of the wilderness and the sea very nature life elemental-based deity vecna is not a god vecna was very powerful wanted to become a god and was balked and scattered supposedly destroyed a long time ago but the cults still endure and infiltrate and wander various parts of exandria it pertains to what i think is a sound plan to bring thordak down to our level i will tell you once we finish this next length of your journey since you are so eager to have made the agreement well for one thing i will be peripheral to the battle i will aid you but i cannot be seen on the battlefield or thordak will know immediately there has been a turn of allegiance i can change my form into a number of creatures and be of assistance in that way i have a series of arcane talents that i can bring to the battlefield as well all right asum walks around the table slowly making eye contact with you those yellow reptilian slits for eyes brushes past you you've grown quite a bit in just these few moments young keyleth she stands there keeping the grip and then releases your hand very well what's your plan against vorugal i can guarantee you you're not wrong but i have been and i will regardless of what you try (singing) gotta catch 'em all (laughter) very well i'll go check in with the boss if you will alleviate any concern on his end we shall meet tomorrow raishan looks very confused very well see you tomorrow the image of the veins the scales everything reverts back to normal seeker asum nods and leaves the room all right so you guys make your way through whitestone through the tunnels to the location of the ziggurat the war room is a series of tables and chairs that have been assembled on the top of the ziggurat near the spinning bead of death as you call it but yeah it's makeshift it's functional there's currently nobody else in here even though there are a couple of guards stationed to make sure that nobody comes in here without approval you are currently stepping up to the top of the ziggurat and there it rests still spinning silently in place make a religion check you know that melora is worshipped by druids of nature hunters societies that exist in a more natural setting as well as ship captains oversea merchants in hopes of getting good luck in getting across large bodies of water and weather she is considered by some to be good some consider her to be in a neutral space and more of like a mother nature type entity amongst the pantheon here if there was one and as far as curses go you don't have too much experience with curses outside of the minor ones that you've seen used or have yourself at your disposal but even just from the few of you sam especially sam go ahead and roll an intelligence check yes yes 16 and you get to add your plus two and if you wanted to add your inspiration die yeah d12 26 okay that's what you can do as a bard it's pretty rad through the two of you conversing over this there are simple curses that can be imparted for a temporary period of time usually as some sort of a penance to someone who slighted you some that are part of a corruption on the land a blight that spreads to a life source and there are soul curses usually where someone feels so wronged in their final moments that they basically burn their soul and any possibility of the afterlife purely to scourge whoever was responsible for their pain it's rarely ever done because it is essentially accepting oblivion your existence is done the gods don't hold any sway over your immortal soul there is no afterlife however you die knowing for whatever that means in that brief moment that you have scarred the individual in some degree for possibly the rest of time no you have no idea you've heard of it in stories and as far as you know it was mainly a folklore element and you're like okay no i've kind of heard of this so if there was anything this might be it if someone were to scry on you and you were to succeed on your saving throw they would fail to scry and you'd have some sort of inkling that something weird is going on if you are a person who's capable of casting the spell like you are you would be like okay someone's trying to peer through the veil unless she-- sam and you have no recollection of that happening you can be very conscious of that possibility and keen on intercepting should anything like that occur sure no i'd say this would be a religion check let me double-check just to be sure specifically this is knowledge of fiends is what this is yenk y-e-n-k marisha and and every creature you make fun of is going to hurt that much more when it kills you it's great it's so wonderful i'd say honestly like i might give a religion check or a straight intelligence check it's going to be a hard dc for anybody that doesn't have any specific knowledge or training in anything fiend-centric a goristro is a fiend it lives in the abyss most things in the abyss are fiends i said possibly religion if you have it trained if you're proficient in religion you can go ask her you wait about an hour pike quickly jogs up you hear the clanking of the armor as she ascends the steps hey guys hi what do you need oh thank you grog no fiends are bad but i don't know anything about a goristro what do you guys want to do sure okay who's going to the library okay those two what's everyone else doing okay roll for perception no grog scanlan what are you guys doing kash is in vasselheim right now you have keeper yennen we'll go with your guys' conversation first vax and keyleth you'll have to attune to it on a short rest but you can do that while you guys are doing that percy and vex could you guys roll an investigation check each of you percy minus three because you're still suffering resurrection issues it's still minus three what's your total and ten all righty you guys spend the better part of the next two hours or so poring through the various libraries you know them very well you've read through a lot of these growing up there aren't a lot of tomes or books that deal with anything terribly fiendish you do find one that deals with tales of the betrayer gods it's more of an old history tome that deals with pre-divergence it deals with the founding which is the first era the age of arcanum which is the second era this is all pre-divergence it speaks of the betrayer gods and many of their creations and their followers that began to lay waste to civilization and began to enslave the creators of those that remained on the side of light you do see mention in there of various fiends and demons and princes of evil it's all very thick religious text but there is one page that has artwork on it sketched and simple but it shows this strange almost long lithe vulture-like creature with wings and clawed hands and a beak-like mouth called a vrock you see another section that has a woman but the lower half of her body is serpentine like a snake and she has six arms carrying six different blades it says marilith behind them you see a looming creature of hulking fur and muscle with fists like battering rams a turned up pug-like nose with a toothy jaw and giant horns adorned with brass rings that curve forward under that it says goristro the awkward pause dissipates and you both bumble your way out of the library to find the others grog scanlan you guys make your way over to-- there's keeper yennen there with his small temple to erathis i believe there's nobody in there currently it's empty he's sweeping up with one of his assistants that's helping keep the place clean it's been some time i'm glad to see that you're all safe and sound well i am at your service what can i do what this is very-- he's got the broom in front your hands meet cloth and somewhat wrinkled older gentleman skin make an investigation check you find a small pouch seems to contain a few coins a somewhat stale piece of half-eaten bread a couple of unlit candles that's about it most unusual right right that's all right he picks the bread up off the ground and puts it back in his pocket i have come across texts that speak of a goristro i do not know of one named yenk specifically they were dangerous front-line behemoths when the fiends attacked these lands back in the pre-divergence era they were 20-plus feet tall and living battering rams that tore through stone like it was paper i don't know the specifics but the texts i have read speak of it being an unstoppable fist in the service of the dark princes everything (laughter) i have no idea unfortunately i'm not extremely well versed in fiendish things i know a bit offhand from my teachings but it's a very specific-- i'm not withholding any information i genuinely-- that's what i'm doing we've rebuilt half the city-- (strained) i don't know and he rushes off toward his room you start hearing him turning over blankets things tumbling onto the ground he's tearing through his room in the back of the temple about ten minutes go by before he comes out sweat pouring down his face he's like (panting) i have nothing i'm sorry make an intimidation check he goes yes right of course i will further my research and perhaps i could send someone to scour the rubble of the cobalt reserve it may take a couple weeks i'm so sorry thank you not that still lives in the city unfortunately you're in the service of the greatest minds of our city now up in the castle we're trying to put homes up for those who need them also thank you for yours apparently now so have i cassandra's taking care of the costs she's sending up materials from the turst fields i appreciate-- it's very kind i have a lot of sweeping to do if you don't mind the assistant is over there wide-eyed watching this whole circumstance he's a young maybe 17-year-old boy in a similar robe sebastian stop staring and help me clean yes sir they both start sweeping the rest of the temple as you guys walk out all right the two of you finally make your way to the recently constructed temple of the raven queen that percy had built what would you like to do okay roll a religion check 21 the door still left ajar to the temple as keyleth walked in earlier a bit of a breeze swirls in for a second carrying a few leaves they scatter around come to rest the candles flicker for a moment and the light dims ever so slightly nothing beyond that from your perspective keyleth you vax feel a familiar cold embrace it's interesting it's chilling and causes your skin to goosebump but it's still comforting while you see nothing within your closed eyes you can sense a pair of cold lips to your left ear that whispers toward you knowledge of this is earned you seek this with your allies some have already found secrets i can only say that the path you walked to the sphinx gave you what you need stay alive you feel the lips fade from your ear warmth comes back to your sides and your eyes flicker open knowing that her presence is no longer there as you guys all go to convene in castle whitestone to discuss the next length of your plan we're going to take a restroom break see you guys back here in a few minutes thank you once again loot crate for being awesome our sponsor thank you guys for sticking around see you guys in a minute welcome back everybody from the break before we get started i wanted to bring this up in case you guys were not aware i was made aware of it at the end of last week but they announced twitch prime what that allows is for anybody out there that has an amazon prime account you get automatically one free subscription to a twitch channel of your choice so if you are not a subscriber to geek and sundry's twitch to help support the show and you have an amazon prime account you can do that now free of charge all the goodies you'll have access to the vods immediately you won't have to wait until monday for the youtube videos to come out for the episodes and it is of no additional cost to you as long as you have a prime membership i wanted to make sure you guys were aware of that because i was recently made aware of that all righty picking up where we left off the rest of you guys have done some research gathered some information that may or may not be helpful what do you want to do for the rest of your preparation for whatever you wish to do going forward yeah you guys are still-- it'll probably last for the day as a specific master of dragon and dragon knowledge so you're aware green dragons are-- poison by nature okay (laughs) all right they look comparable yes a little smattering on each of them yeah all right so you go looking for grog who is not around the castle and eventually as you step out you notice scanlan and grog both walking up the pathway to the front of whitestone castle just the three of you guys and three guards back by the front of the castle yes most of them need work a number of them backfired during the actual battle and the other ones were not taken very good care of so you're probably going to need to run a few repair checks on that you have the materials at your disposal you have your workshop okay you take a good solid look at animus get a feel for it thank you travis yep vex you've gone and looked for vax and keyleth after you guys had your conversation about everything eventually you catch up to-- are you guys still together yeah so you find the two of them osysa was the gynosphinx who works at the slayer's take the goddess she worships is ioun laura and while they share their awkward smile you find percival down in his workshop currently repairing weaponry with ripley's gun placed down out on its own in the middle of the table you haven't checked in to see if they're here or not they wouldn't be at the castle they stay at one of the houses at the northern end of the city who has now arrived and steps up you called grog do you wish for me to fetch them he rushes off you hear the armor and chainmail clinking in the distance it's mid-afternoon you guys have spent the day doing research and checking things out you woke up in the morning and you had your conversation with raishan so it's two three in the afternoon you are close to three months past it so you have a ways to go before it's winter's crest again the celestial solstice you're not sure actually make a nature check there are solstices yes 24 the next solstice is going to be in about a month roughly 28 days that wasn't a cave it was inside a chasm a giant ravine you have no sense of being watched by any exterior force you can yes okay percy can you make three tinkering checks for me yes okay rudimentary in their design but functional you manage to clean them all and repair the ones that were heavily damaged earlier and make them functional again without an issue during that time keyleth you were going to mention something you said ioun is the god of knowledge and spreading of knowledge and was what the temple that osysa watches beneath the slayers' take is based around it's also what the ziggurat beneath the city used to be a temple to ioun before it was corrupted by the briarwoods vax is gone right now all right vex you go ahead and find zahra who's in the process of still researching in her room her and allura while she was focusing on the ziggurat and the essence of it so you find her and her tomes are spread out and she's actually fallen asleep on her desk in her room puts her wand out in your direction darling i'm so sorry i didn't mean that tiring if anything she wipes this bit of drool from the side of her chin immediately sits upright in her chair (chuckles) good just trying to figure out what we can from these siphons not yet though it's been a lot of fun throwing things into them and watching them go away remind me oh yes i was able to muster one that is all i've been able to get done in time she pulls out a small case and opens it it looks a little roughshod not quite as perfect but she says the enchantment took oh for this let's find out that would come to roughly-- on the market about 30000 gold pieces it's mostly done i could keep working on it if you like and make it all done well for cost and time i'd put it more about 12 for a friend okay sorry dear i haven't had a lot of time so should i balk on the research and focus on-- noted no worries dear i should make some tea she rubs her eye a little bit gets up have a good night vex walks by as she exits the room as you stand there her tail whips you in the back kima shows up as she walks up it's midday she's not armored at all she's wearing a standard linen shirt that's sweat through it looks like she's been doing physical labor work and she comes up with dirt smeared in her face grog it's been a while (chuckles) you big badass what can i do for you do you need me to get her as well ugh i'll be right back she leaves for a bit you wait a little bit longer eventually she comes back with allura allura not quite as dirty as kima they both arrive hello i'm glad to see you've returned can i help you this is beyond my magic no this is incredible this is very powerful magic i think it has quite a bit of utility to be honest do you need this or could i-- well all right well this is the kind of spell that i could copy into my spellbook and once i'm able to utilize it down the road it would be at my disposal it would destroy the scroll but i would be able to utilize the spell in a few years maybe it takes a few hours maybe be careful with that from what i can glean from the enchantment it offers you quite a chance to pull pretty much anything to your side but no real bindings on what you pull through there are many a mage who ended up trying to bend something to their will and weren't seen ever again no worries i'm about to ready continuing to strengthen the veil with shaun-- oh i'm sorry to hear that these are dangerous times i've got something i've got to do stay safe be careful with that she walks out of the room a little dazed and rubs the top of kima's head and you watch her leave she's stretched a little thin these days to be honest well there's a lot going on and a lot needs to be found and a lot needs to be done and a never-ending barrage of responsibility which i despise where are you guys off to really you see this big toothy grin curl across her face and her fingers twitch so (excited chuckles) i was hoping you'd say that let me get my armor how soon when all righty stay right here i'll be right back she darts off with a spring in her step and a little chuckle as she heads down the hall yeah yeah you got a handful of days left while this is happening vax eventually you find your way to the makeshift training barracks that are established on the northeastern side of the city where kashaw was earlier training recruits you can see now that this late in the afternoon most of the training has come to a halt but jarett is still in the process right now of instructing kynan kynan has been given more standard whitestone armor to get rid of the dark roguish look that he had before partially to help him mentally feel like he's in a different place and has some connection to the city but jarett is in the process now of working him through some swordplay as you approach the two of them stop and jarett looks over towards you ah vax it is good to see you what can we do for you well he's a bit rough around the edges but he's actually a pretty decently trained fighter kynan's quiet i don't know do you want to be borrowed i suppose did i do anything sure let me just-- and he hands the blade over to jarett who takes it and sheathes it on the side i'm sorry too i should have taken it for the lesson it was and i was too dumb and young to let it get through my thick skull what do you need i've toyed with it i wouldn't say i'm a great shot by any means all right okay okay thank you i'm sorry he walks along with you eventually leading you back to percy's workshop where the instruction is given for the weapons anything beyond that he doesn't understand about the rifles nothing construction general outfitting he seems to be more of an adept student than you expected he's got some intellect to him at the very least he can pick up the details pretty quick quick learner when he puts his mind to it about this time as you're having this discussion you can hear the bounding of armored feet and bursting through the partially open door you see fully armored eager hair pulled back in a tight braid big old maul scraping on the stone behind her all right when are we doing this tomorrow that's-- (laughter) it's really quiet here i'm getting extremely bored i mean whenever you need to i'm just saying-- i'm very confused right now okay hang on whoa i need some clarification here the hammer slams down onto the stonework (laughs) no you guys were teaching him about the guns when she came back mind you he seems largely confused and doesn't seem to know what's going on excuse me no nobody's doing that to me immediately the maul gets grabbed she says here are you crazy obviously yes and you think you can trust this dragon come on guys great perfect why don't we kill the dragon here and then kill the other dragon there-- you are a lucky bunch of sons-of-bitches that i'll give to you she leans on her hammer yeah and who told you that who told you that was going to happen who at the very first moment you showed him to me said 'this guy is going to try and kill you' yeah you're all going to die oh i'm coming with you because i'm not going to let you die god stupid bunch of gits i swear bahamut are you serious (scoffs) this is ridiculous i'm not going to tell anyone you made this plan until it's done because this is stupid as shit yes it does please don't call me that where's the dragon what about the one that's here hiding so this whole deal you just don't trust me enough to tell me where the dragon's sleeping in our place right now you're all acting very weird please it is very tempting trust me yes it is but i'm also not stupid i was about to say-- good you're asking me to lie i'm not real good at lying that i can do you come near me with any sort of magic mumbo-jumbo i'm going to clock you in the head scanlan i love you but i'm going to clock you in the head if you try and wipe my memory little gnome until what i have no idea what you're talking about and this is really starting to frustrate me are we going to kill a dragon laura and we're going to kill two dragons great okay what's the plan i'm not going to lie i admire your drive and gusto just be smart about this all right well then if we're leaving soon i'm sticking with you guys yeah and as you're listening in you gave him all the instruction and he takes it in pretty well jarett catches up with you and you both coordinate with that all right you head to the sun tree while the rest of you gather the rest of your materials and supplies okay so that's two damage off any of your ranged attacks so keep note of that as you attune the weapon there's a brief familiar dark glow on the weapon and all the three names that exist on the barrel all dissipate it's now a clean barrel okay do you go to asum's room you knock on the door a voice goes (shushes) you hear lowered voices from the other side of the door for a moment okay about ten minutes go by and as you're gathering things asum approaches i'm sorry percy i was indisposed no i was keen enough to cover but both the cinder king and the frigid doom are under the impression that there is no mounting danger very well might i ask what creature of great strength you intend to bait vorugal with try me reaching into the abyss that's curious i can see that kinship as well i can be of aid i just have to remain inconspicuous i cannot be seen to be part of this confrontation and all shall be fine this was not discussed who would you intend to bring into this deal and disposable i follow all right oh in this form i have many forms i can take i have an idea very well fetch me when you're ready why not travel with you and your band that seems like a waste of magic i understand that but if you're going now it takes me at least three four days of travel over the ocean to get to draconia you're a funny little man well then i'll see you tomorrow and asum turns around and exits all right you guys make your way to the sun tree while you're walking keyleth you head there as well is there anything you wanted to do before they arrive okay so you go beneath the tavern into the basement down into the little tunnel beneath that leads to the sun tree's roots okay it's less of a merger and more as you touch and connect to the roots your consciousness and the sun tree's consciousness can combine yeah you grab the roots and feel the warmth flow through your hands and there your consciousness connects with that of the sun tree and you are both present in that same plant space hey keyleth (giggling) hey keyleth doing all right a little cold but whitestone yeah keyleth i don't rightly know which as he converses with you he says i've been here a long time don't really get around much being a tree but you do feel this light fuzzy blue almost like a mist energy like a particle energy that is coalesced around whitestone and above it and it shoots off in six different directions some that curl up northwards some that curl out over the ocean and you see them spider out in places and then go beyond your peripheral the ley-lines only spider out past the alabaster sierras you can't see much further than that let me look at the specifics of commune with nature real fast unfortunately the spell only lasts for up to three miles you sense that yes these ley energies do travel much further and surround the world and make a network of various magical pathways but unfortunately the sun tree and your vision right now doesn't go far beyond whitestone yeah it isn't a lot can't say i do keyleth calm down i'm happy to answer your questions invite you to my space just because i'm not an all-seeing tree don't be angry with me angry in general just chill yeah it is (laughter) yeah keyleth more or less the tree may know a lot just the right questions need to be asked the sun tree says to be perfectly honest keyleth even pelor's grace left this place hundreds of years ago his presence is here in bits and pieces but when i was first taking seed the gods were much more present much easier to read kind of lonely nowadays i know keyleth i know when you're around keyleth nobody can be lonely don't make it weird laura i appreciate that you've got to come to me (laughter) that's all that matters keyleth you're cool too girl probably oh boy it tingles a little that's all right i appreciate it bye keyleth as you go up top the whole group is gathered there currently all right what's your spell dc on this well you didn't have your hand cone out though when you did it kima's eyes blink for a second didn't i warn you scanlan shorthalt not to try and wipe my mind she's taking a hit natural 20 (gasps) you take 35 points of damage 27 of it blunt damage from the actual impact with the hammer the rest of it's thunder damage as her holy thunder maul slams into the side of your head and sends you skidding ten feet across the ground coming to a halt damn right he did i love you guys but-- thank you i've been tense recently anyway this is true shall we get on with it travis and the sideways tree was where you came through but you found a tree above that you could get to yeah okay you finish your transport via plants spell the portal opens you all begin darting through kima darts through who's the last one out make a perception check 11 okay you dart through the portal before it closes you all emerge from the other side the cold snowy ice hits you there is actually a bit of a snowstorm that is blowing through right now as you come on the other side immediately the wind chill hits you and it gets extremely cold it was darker in the day it was starting to get later in the afternoon here it is night it is blustery not quite blizzard but definitely a heavy snow decent wind night on the bluff right outside the ravine that dips down into the remnants of draconia and the small icy throne that vorugal currently calls home it's night you don't know what hour but it's black night okay you had armor on before right the armor was plus two right you have the item card for it then yeah your armor class would be up by two all right so you guys enter the mansion kima comes in looking around well that's pretty damn swanky (shushes) no fine i've slept in worse i don't need any help she leans up against the side of the foyer wall and starts taking her armor off she's keeping an eye on scanlan the whole time i'm good here i actually am pretty hungry yeah thank you what else do you guys want to get done in preparation for this you can yeah but do you have it prepared i don't think it works that way unless it says it's a ritual sorry yeah heroes' feast is not a ritual so you have to have it prepared okay what are you going to scry tooma is the leader of the-- they're not draconians these are the ravenites draconians were essentially wiped out ravenites currently hold the ravine just so you're aware you can only scry on someone on the same plane of existence so you'll have to step outside the mansion to scry okay okay both you guys make perception checks what's the total on that for you vex okay for what distance that you can see there is no light visible down in the ravine it is pitch-black darkness you can see around you there are the trees that you guys came through a couple of other barren broken trees that have been long dead or at least leafless for a while slowly curling over the edge of the ravine the land has eroded over time and they've slowly begun to move with it you don't see anything else in the immediate vicinity it is freezing cold though you're doing okay because of your armor you're a little chilly and you're shaking naturally from the wind chill as you're preparing the ritual you begin to focus on the scrying who are you scrying on currently all right as the cold begins to hit the tips of your fingers begin to go numb you finish the ritual your eyes glaze over white and your vision projects itself into the darkness in front of you it rushes down like a sudden drop of a roller coaster into the bottom of the ravine and is rushed to the side inside the warm interior of the wall on the western end of the ravine darting through a number of familiar tunnels you find yourself back to the small village that was built by the ravenites through the central circular opening where the small fountain was and you're thrust into the tent where you first met tooma there you see upon the throne is tooma with four guards around currently draped over and asleep slowly snoring as her head droops you can't really tell you only have focus on her you see very fuzzy things there's not a lot of action around that you can tell the scry finishes your fingers are now getting more cold putting your flame hands to warm yourself up a bit well vorugal's lair is in the open of the ravine it's a little ways up where you guys are up on top it goes down into the ravine and the ravine curls through and splits off in different directions in the center of where a section of the ravine forks off in the center there is that cluster of ice with all the spikes off it on top of the rubble of one of the central islands of draconia that's where vorugal is currently living generally a particular creature you can choose from i can let you scry on the location but i'll have to make you roll for it okay anything else you guys wish to do to prepare for the evening before the morning comes okay make a dexterity check add your dexterity modifier to a d20 roll 16 you take a moment and take one of the pistols the little barrel clicks out and you go oh you take-- 11 you've seen percy load a bunch so you go and take this small bit of powder put it in put the bullet inside it slides in and it seems fine all right anything else guys maybe a half- to quarter-mile away from the entrance to tooma's area they don't work from within the mansion to outside the mansion it's a different plane of existence technically yeah it gets rid of tracks makes you harder to track you're going there right now yeah okay both of you go invisible you turn minxie what are you doing you guys are all stealthing along the top of the ravine how are you getting down it's a cliff it's the grand canyon okay you guys disappear down into the ravine you lose eye contact with them once they're outside of 120 feet of you okay okay make a-- make a perception check either of you 22 all right you glide down and it takes you a moment but you do over the next 30 minutes or so it takes you to finally find the area that's familiar to you in this dark that is where you guys previously were you're having to look around for quite a bit and it's a lot of having to go back up again and glide around it's a big space and in the dark in the middle of the night it's very difficult for you to figure out any sign of where you previously tread you do manage to find it but you're now looking at-- how long does invisibility last okay so you guys are about halfway through invisibility's functionality marisha make a survival wilderness check a stoop this is wisdom survival okay best you can you begin to follow the edge of the ravine and try and do your best remembering the path of the ravine based on where you were previously and taking in what sort of outcroppings and structures were familiar to you you think you may have found over time something near the entrance you're not sure best you can do right now you guys eventually find the entrance where you were led in by the rest of the ravenites you zip through and it begins to open up into the subterranean town if you will it is very quiet there are a few walking appear to be sentries haphazardly armed and armored but it seems like the majority of those here are sleeping both of you guys appear do you begin to walk toward the central-- it's a quiet underground tunnel with a bunch of huts and tents and small abodes that are all silent there are two wandering sentries that are armored as soon as you begin walking through they both turn and look and see you spears out put your weapons down i see a sword at your side yes you too persuasion check (draconic words) the other guard walks off there's an awkward three-minute beat where he's staring at both of you intently with the spear out eventually the other guard comes back and talks back to him in a language you don't understand (draconic words) it is a strange hour to drop by but tooma will see you leave your weapons where they lay they will stay where they lay come with us both of them stand behind you guys spears to your back and nudge you to continue forward you make your way to tooma's tent the four guards inside are there with their spears at the ready two of them have shields and they're-- not an aggressive stance but definitely alert and making sure that you're aware by their physicality that they're paying attention to you and are ready to deal with anything you bring across the way there's a small fire in the center of the room a small fire pit that is largely burned out now to small embers the smell of smoke and sage is very prominent and strong in the room tooma you can see is now cupping a small goblet made of simple wood you see steam rising off of it and she's sipping it is a very strange hour aye it was close you are not among enemies your weapons will stay where they are while we speak then you should leave that is your choice i would love to hear about it but i do not talk to people who stumble into my home before the sun rises with weapons and arms at their side they will not be touched everyone is sleeping foolish gnome that can be done yes her eyes curl up with a slight slick sound of older not-as-moisturized lizard eyes you see these eyelids click across as she thinks across to the northern side of the ravine the ramp leads up up that ramp you will see a circle of stones a hundred feet across that should suffice make it 16 the dragon is always hungry for a hunt it's hungry now i'm sure we will be ready we'll be ready i will tell my men please leave me you guys leave the tent make your way back your weapons are right where you dropped them you make your way out toward where the cavern opens into the ravine itself the snow is still a good foot and a half up now up the ravine what do you guys do i'd say it's getting pretty close you're not quite sure of the exact time all right you take the wind the cold wind hitting the wings even though they're an extension of the armor you feel this twinge of cold hit you thankfully you have your resistance up so it's helping with that all right thank you for noting that all right you guys invisibly coast up through the ravine making your way up onto the top of the cliffside into a soft bank of snow keyleth you do hear the (soft impact) of several footfalls maybe 40 feet to the left of you you look over to see an indentation in the snow you guys watch minxie emerge from the darkness and snow you hear (nonsense meowing) (laughter) you both could ride minxie i mean not full but they could both be on your back and you'd be like (strained noises) you could carry them along you eventually bring them back to the outside of the door with vex waiting for you on the stoop you guys make your way into the warm interior of scanlan's mansion where kima is currently de-armored and snoring leaning against the foyer wall you guys prepare yourselves for an evening's rest for tomorrow you battle one possibly two dragons and that's where we're going to leave the session for tonight we'll be back here next week for whatever this chaos is going to be we've got yenk the goristro coming in versus vorugal the frigid doom versus raishan the diseased deceiver the diseased deceiver don't roll low don't roll low sam please don't roll low that would be so bad or so great you're probably pretty good because you have a high enough charisma for you enhance ability let's see let me look at the rules for this it should say on the scroll what do you have to roll actually enhance ability might help with that it does give advantage on checks to the specific ability which would be charisma so it would be eagle's splendor you would get advantage on charisma checks so in theory that could help we'll define it more i'll look at the scroll i wrote up look at the rule make sure we confirm that before next episode but yes that is probably a possibility and if this is an ability check you could also inspire yourself with a d12 anyway start thinking how you're going to handle this next week guys you've got a week to pull this together yeah you guys are having a whole night where you can work this out you don't know
