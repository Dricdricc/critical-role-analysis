know you do oh there you go there you go you need to know who's in your corner laura all righty guys if we don't have anything else to discuss we're going to go ahead and dive into tonight's episode of critical role [dramatic music] laura have you played risk risk is a game where you make alliances and then double-cross people it doesn't say it in the rules but that's how it always happens that's what i assume will probably happen it may not you guys may surprise me i'm just saying be prepared laura and (laughing) okay now i'm voting for that table all right guys the other thing i want to mention is whoever the victor is will get a minor prize a very very minor prize playstation 2 no you will get a fate die that you get to carry over into the main campaign it's a single reroll it's like a luck point as you all comfortably find yourself resting falling into sleep and darkness for the evening in the city of whitestone over some point in the break of the year-long period you find yourself-- your eyes opening bleary blinking towards what appears to be a grey cloud-covered sky you look about and find yourselves somewhat scattered amongst an unfamiliar battlefield travis i want you to go ahead and roll a d6 for me please a two okay yeah so that's you there laura go ahead and roll a d6 a six with trinket there all right marisha roll a d6 four all righty taliesin roll again okay go ahead and roll a d6 all righty so as you take in the scenery around you seemingly no rhyme or reason you wonder how you transported to this space taryon in particular you find that you seem to be a little more viable power than you were when you went to bed that night you watch as a singular cloaked figure seems to emerge from the clouds above you and slowly fall from the sky as the entity you see arms out hood up the wind blowing around causing the cloth to flap and curl about them the hood blows back and you see before you a-- so if we ever do a live-action vox machina film we get owen wilson to play vax so as the figure descends to about this point in the center of the battlefield you watch as the wind blows the hood back and you see there a handsome man with immaculate somewhat ear-length brown hair and a magnificent beard as he smiles and looks around and goes tonight you fight for me and my pleasure for i am the forgotten deity known as colville (laughter) these are 30 feet tall 50 feet up yeah you watch as he grins and smiles i hope you all learn something now you have six seconds to decide where to go and what to prepare for no fighting is to commence until these six seconds are up and then show me what you've got (laughter) you can cast or prepare anything you want to an action or movement or bonus that doesn't attack or assault another person for the first round but first let's roll initiative guys all righty so 25 to 20 all righty (laughs) that's right yeah all right 20 to 15 okay vex and then keyleth and grog interesting i think so i'll have you guys both roll dexterity checks for me please just roll a d20-- just roll a d20 and add your dex modifier so we have vex then grog-keyleth all righty and then tary all righty which by the way you also have-- doty at your disposal at the top you guys just saw the guy and you just got your vision around so this round is going to be running and taking in your surroundings and doing what you're going to do to prepare from where you are right now you can barely see somebody we'll say as part of this round you guys get a feel for it you get a feel for where everyone else is as part of this first round just the doors there or climbing upward and there appears to be a trapdoor on either side there's a ladder ladder and a chain okay so we'll get to your turn percival you're up first which one this one okay so you climb up they're little stone bunker-like structures there's an entrance on this side and on this side so it's half your movement that's 15 feet you can move 15 more feet if you want to there okay here okay so there you are boots are activated diplomacy is activated perfect all right just after percy goes you watch as all the flickering braziers the flames flicker bright you see these two glowing towers that are slowly spinning the blue crystals (crackling noises) little sparks and each of these pillars gives off a slight hum vex it's your turn there is a trapdoor that he can go down and then make his way behind one of those okay go ahead and make a stealth check and trinket makes it-- we'll say halfway down the tunnel with trinket's full movement there so down the stairs and he's halfway through the tower there okay good to know nobody else has any idea where you are right now at the moment all right that brings us to grog okay bloodaxe oof yes you can make an athletics check you rage get up and just crest over the top he rage-climbs the ladder one rung over the other and with the rest of his movement gets to the very top of the tower well your bonus action was rage if you have an action you want to do that doesn't involve attacking or hurting anybody-- okay you watch as a large globule of goliath snot slaps the ground in front of you and skids a bit leaving a trail all right is that your turn grog keyleth you're up okay your staff dips down and it goes about-- it keeps going it's pretty deep to the point where you get like to the very edge of your staff holding it there and it manages to go all the way in yeah well you haven't felt the bottom yet any more and you're going to submerge your hands and move over this way well you're not hiding you don't have anything left to do a hide action but you move there okay all right so taryon yeah all right what are you doing at his size i'd say he weighs somewhere in the range of 700 pounds he is somewhat hollow in places though no he's large and he's heavy metallic substances but he is hollow in places so i'd actually say he's probably closer to 500 maybe 400 to 500 tary only breathable air can pass through the sphere's wall no attack or other effect can correct so you can cast things on yourself within but nothing can pass by however you are at the mercy of whoever has control of the ball at the moment so yes i don't know if you're considered breathable as an air elemental taryon as you slam into the ground how much damage do you take that's not too bad you take nine points of damage and the sphere encapsulates you and you begin to roll forward slightly as doty walks over grabs you and pulls you back about there to the edge not sure what to do he's just holding you now in this ball tary confused all right at the end of that turn you watch over as colville floating in the center goes and now my champions let the fight begin slams his hands together and you watch him vanish in a burst of thunder as it cracks around the landscape and you feel this energy pulse you all at once as the battle has begun percival you're up first you can barely see part of grog with three-quarters cover barely everyone else looks apparently at the moment not really in your line of sight okay you have sharpshooter so you ignore three-quarters cover go for it yeah okay go for it yeah that hits all right so-- one animus shot and then one bad news shot you take 2d6 psychic right okay so do cabal's ruin damage at the end because that is not halved ten points of piercing damage so that's reduced to five and then how many points of psychic four points of psychic seven points of damage wait ten points-- it's nine it was ten points piercing reduced to five and then four psychic so that's nine okay so take that down to eight nope no this is cabal's ruin he's pumping you full of lightning damage okay that's how many d6s 10d6 lightning damage to you grog there you go all right percival and you have movement and a bonus if you want over here that's 30 right there right fair enough all right so end of percival's turn there are lair actions on this battlefield there's a door right there okay well as you're running by it percival you hear that low hum (humming) begins to (humming intensifies) spin up you hear this crackling noise and you watch as each of these four towers suddenly gives off this intense vibration around it as you're walking you feel this force pulling on you like being within a certain radius of this is forcing you to move slower (grunting) that's all vex your turn yes he does have half-cover from you currently all right so trinket does manage to get all the way to the bottom and emerges from the front door there but that's as far as trinket can get with his movement percy yeah you can see percy from there you've just got a billion hit points you do when you go into your large form which is why you didn't halve any of the cabal ruin damage last round yeah all right that hits okay go for it roll a stealth check it's been a while since you used skirmisher stealth basically you're not wrong at the start of your turn you pick a creature to remain hidden from not a general hiding yep but everybody else can still see you if you wanted to make the hide action okay good to know now you guys are aware she's there you just cannot shoot her or attack her from this distance necessarily all right that ends your turn grog mr pincushion what are you doing like a giant hamster ball (laughter) yeah yes you may yes you do make a wisdom saving throw nope so you go to shove him and you go (groan) yep that's what earthbreaker groon did to you you can attack the ball but it does nothing okay so you're going to do the second shove attack wisdom save okay so now getting doty's sheet out here for a shove attack i believe it's a contested athletics check let me double-check real fast pretty sure i'm sure the internet right now is going no it's this god damn it mercer no it's athletics contested by athletics so go ahead and roll an athletics check grog with advantage because you're raging roll a d20 add four for doty you watch as doty turns to grog goes tary (bang) and end over end gets shoved off the parapet slamming onto the ground prone here at the bottom of the chain you taryon fly off (boing) harmlessly and roll into the middle of the pool and are currently now on your side for the 30-foot fall doty takes 11 points of bludgeoning damage and is prone (chuckles) you do you have 40 feet of movement left there is yes it would be an action to lift it up actually it's not that much because it's not locked or anything you can probably just pull it open okay so with the rest of your movement 40 feet you can get almost to the bottom so you're partway through that yeah you're still inside all right that ends your turn grog keyleth your turn that's so awesome you seem to not be affected by it actually you see it there and as you push forward a little bit with your hand it doesn't seem to be-- the gravitational shift isn't affecting you up this way right there on the edge you can just barely see the edge of doty right past these you see his head on the ground you see taryon in the middle and you see percival right there you can move three more squares if you want to okay you can look inside now you see a small chamber and what appears to be a small chest against the wall there and this area is just an open space (laughing) okay (boom) so you watch as suddenly spiraling out of the air this swirl of fire forms into a large burning ball of flame that begins to collide and burn and singe into doty's (squealing metal) prone form on the ground still reeling from the impact of being knocked off the tower that's 5d6 damage go ahead and roll a dexterity saving throw for doty i think it's dexterity right prone doesn't change your dexterity saving throw that does not make her dc unfortunately so that's 5d6 points of fire damage against doty 22 points of fire damage just tary (explosion) just a white flash like akira opening you know what you had ten feet of movement left so i'll say boom boom there you go so you flicker inside and you are currently contained on the inside there oh yeah it's all sorts of held up there for you so that ends your turn keyleth taryon you are floating in a sphere over a pool of murky green liquid boots of speed clicked you have 80 feet of movement on the sphere however the sphere is half your movement to push it so you get to push it 40 feet right now on the water you get about that far (straining sound) it's splashing behind the ball's coasting and you're almost three two feet from the edge of the rock and you're like oh god oh god the sweat's starting to pour from your brow all right and what's doty going to do trapped inside the sphere it doesn't say anything about it making silence or blocking sound so you can still communicate sanctuary once you get an attack-- it lasts a minute until-- i'm pretty sure it's until the creature attacks yes until the warded creature takes an attack so right now it still has sanctuary on yes that's a valid point and reminder it probably will be fine but keyleth i should've remembered because he did have sanctuary no it wasn't you target it to ram into something it wasn't a fireball wisdom saving throw because it says target with a harmful spell so yes you're fine i just wanted to double check on that because i totally forgot about the sanctuary but still warded with sanctuary getting up half movement so doty has 20 more feet to move i think speed of 40 what do you want doty to do okay so doty's going to move five-- no he is and he gets about that far doty's like (clanging metal) tary a ball of flames just slamming into the back all right i think that ends your turn taryon percival you're up okay five ten 15 20 your movement's halved it's like rough terrain essentially as you're moving forward two more but now as you get into the doorway it's not affecting you anymore you do see a small chest in the corner okay so make an action to try and repair it real fast okay yeah so you repair animus it's an action to do that yeah okay so there you are you are inside of that chamber perfect all right the large pillars that were humming diminish the slowly shifting blue crackling towers at the top of each large tower begin to spin faster and you hear (crackling) and bursts of electrical energy just (static) out of each side everyone on the tower which would just be you i need you to make a dexterity saving throw okay so you succeed it would be 16 points of lightning damage it's reduced to eight so you take eight points of lightning damage and then as the bolt subsides the towers slowly spin back down and appear to have gone dormant once more this has been fun so far you guys just barely got into it all right laura your turn what you got vex you can see doty you can see taryon you watched keyleth turn into the fire elemental and disappear into this chamber and you watched percy run into this chamber they're stone five feet of stone you can if you want to you guys are welcome to communicate between each other for this trinket runs up (heavy footsteps) (growl) and shoves you and you spin back roll a strength check because this is pushing against taryon's wound-up sonic the hedgehog gotta-go-fast speed 16 okay make a strength check yeah you get pushed back right into the center of the water there yeah that was trinket's attack it was a shove attack okay so you're holding your attack action arrow ready waiting for someone else to show up that ends your turn vex grog you're up okay you (ferocious growling) (quieter growling) you glance through and you see a large burning ball of fire that's right there just chilling you see doty (heavy footsteps) running away towards the water where you see taryon being pushed back in the water by a large bear and as soon as you glance up a dual arrow release yep so you get two strikes on this yep so eight damage or because lightning's halved too right so six damage currently no by the way it is a tiny doorway and you are a big man the hatch you went through was a leap down and you barely fit through this doorway is going to cost you some movement to get through it yeah it's like (whooshing arrow) (scream) you get out there it'll take you ten movement to get to the doorway it took you ten movement to move and get out of it so you have 30 more feet from here going this way five ten 15 20 25 30 you can get there sure all righty grog is lying down prone is that your turn yes you can there you go you gain 12 hit points all right so grog that's your turn keyleth you didn't use your action so if you wanted to you could use your action to move again if you wanted to dash don't forget you have that option yeah if you're not using your action for anything else and your second wind is a bonus action if i recall correct so yeah all right so instead of falling prone you go do you want to go this way or this way to get towards the tower like the perimeter or center okay you get there and then you go prone all righty say you're prone there from where you are you cannot see him you watched him run he wasn't being stealthy about it and he's 12 feet tall right now you're watching him (heavy footsteps) and he's just out of view but you know exactly where he is ends grog's turn keyleth you're up you see a giant grog just (heavy footsteps) loom past the outside of the structure you see this flickering fire of keyleth's elemental form in the inside of this structure there no there's just the doorway here and the doorway here those are the only-- not from what you can tell you can investigate for it if you want to but that'll be your action yeah it's 25 feet to get into trinket's space okay go for it so 20 movement right next to trinket i believe that misses on trinket okay so the first one misses the second one definitely hits go ahead and roll double-die damage on the second one yes and then add the bonus so trinket takes 33 fire damage and is currently on fire so trinket is like (very unhappy bear groans) (roars) tary or doty go ahead and make another wisdom saving throw 19 yeah go ahead and roll a dexterity saving throw for doty and roll another 5d6 fire damage what's your spell dc yeah no so full 5d6 fire damage as the ball slams into the back you watch as doty's open chamber where the book is held goes (cling) and flings open as fire bursts out from the inside he's now burnt and hollowed out from the inside and you watch as a cinder cluster of pages hits the ground before burning away doty goes tar-- (clang) and falls to the ground one arm detonates it doesn't hit anybody but there's now curled pieces of broken and sheared metal where the arm once was what's the speed of your fire elemental yeah so you have 25-- no it was-- you have 30 more feet of movement what's that i'm sorry we'll say for the sake of fairness because i realize now if one of you guys was the keeper of the health potions you'd be way too unfair i'd say none of you have health potions on you right now you may have to search the battlefield to discover things to help you all right keyleth that's the end of your turn okay taryon okay (laughs) so tary you have your four healing potions as a bonus action you can yeah there you go and you're going to attempt to move the momentum is now going this way you turn around okay i'll say you get just to the edge and you can get ten more feet that direction as the rest of it carries you onto the land on the other side that's as far as you get okay that ends your turn percival okay it is yes so you go (chest opening) throw the chest open ha shit no you do find a greater healing potion over here okay you can get to the very top if you want to okay so we'll say you're right there but this chest is opened so i'll turn it to the side as a reminder basically you knocked the chest prone okay that's the end of your turn percival all righty the fiery braziers around suddenly begin to (explosion) and detonate as the flames inside burst out in a radius nobody is quite in the radius to be affected by them you watch as the corners of the battlefield are suddenly engulfed in flames briefly then the flames retract back into just very gently burning braziers vex you're up okay well trinket first takes three points of fire damage at the top of the round trinket wades into the water and does manage to put out the fire however trinket does take-- -- does take six points of acid damage nope it is not water as trinket wades in he goes (acid sounds) (hurt bear sounds) he gets back out of the water and he's like-- you see like the (sizzling) off of him if a bear could shrug-- what is a whale okay so you (whoosh) over and as you get up you almost bump into the ceiling where that tower is if you were flying from here you could get right over there and see him on the ground yeah you could get right down to him what are you doing make a deception check right so grog do you accept it okay she still touches it to you but you're not willing so what's the saving throw on that (suction sound) grog you are absorbed into a familiar dark stony throne room staring out through this small open space almost like a personalized movie theater of the outside of the necklace she has to release you mind you vex the battle cannot be won until all the other people have been defeated this is not considered defeat remember just be aware if you're the last one standing after everything else happens and you release grog he's going to destroy you so think tactically okay you cannot because in order to get there your full movement leaves you right in the doorway where she can see you you literally landed did that to grog and turned over your shoulder and see a giant fire elemental looking right at you yep because you're not behind anything you're just (groans) the inside is essentially a 20-by-20-foot cold stone room with a central stone throne and the view you have is this ten-foot-by-five-foot slit window that looks out from the necklace no it's just a perspective this is what galdrick the wolf had been looking through for hundreds of years and what trinket looks through whenever he's trapped that's your turn vex keyleth you're up what are you doing oh that's right you're up next grog what do you want to do okay go ahead and roll an attack go ahead and roll damage all right damage okay good you are also technically sieged because of your gauntlets all right as you slam your axe into the front of this you watch as the stone (rumble) quakes a little bit and a little bit of dust (hiss) settles from the ceiling go ahead and roll attack he's designed to make terrible choices so that's 110 points of damage with your siege weaponry as you rear back for your second strike you bring your axe to go against this crystalline field this layer that defends you from that as you slam it the axe hits and you watch as it spider-cracks (cracking) all across and the room (rumbling) is now actively shaking as you look around you can see that the walls are starting to crumble and rocks begin to tumble and you see what looks like a black void behind the cracks that are opening you have a third attack grog what are you going to do mr raging what are you going to do roll some damage oh he would be fucking dead so 120 points of damage so grog you rear back once more and that little bit of doubt in the back of your brain you quickly squash as your frenzied fury takes over you see nothing but red anger and blood as you rear back a third time and (whack) as you slam it you hear what sounds like a thousand windows shattering at once and all the walls suddenly collapse in towards you rocketing and spiraling inward it crushes into your body as you're thrust forward as the crystalline structure ahead of you shatters and pulls you through like a heavy vacuum you suffer 26 points of piercing and bludgeoning damage halved to 13 and the necklace in front of you (shattering) shatters off your chest and you watch as a giant grog right there into the hallway right in front of you your necklace is gone it is not functional for the rest of this battle i was not expecting you to attack the inside of the wall all righty that ends your turn grog keyleth you're up go for it you're technically occupying vex's space right there so you attack 22 that hits yeah so go ahead and roll damage against vex vex you also catch fire oh grog i misunderstood sorry so grog you catch fire flames are just (whoosh) so you take 20 points of fire damage reduced to ten and you're on fire and you will remain on fire taking 1d10 fire damage every round until you spend an action to put it out but it looks cool all right and because you moved into vex's space vex you also catch fire automatically does she immediately take the 1d10 damage for occupying someone's space okay so roll 1d10 damage for vex technically both of them because you had to move into both of their spaces to do it so you take another 1d10 damage grog all right so grog you take two points of fire damage vex you take five yes you can actually that's a valid point go ahead and roll because he did reckless attack last turn okay so what's your attack roll yeah that hits go ahead and roll damage 25 points of damage to your fire elemental form you take full damage however doesn't he take damage whenever he so you take four points of fire damage all righty keyleth so that's your action you've moved 15 feet to get into vex's and grog's space okay so that's 15 20 25 30 you're going to stay in the room yes you have 20 more feet of movement from here there how much does it move 25 30 it'll get just about there it looks like it'll probably land in the acid probably next round it can it doesn't have the movement for the full jump unfortunately so it's right there on the edge (fire noises) angrily burning i need you to make a concentration check by the way with advantage for the damage that grog hit you it's a constitution saving throw and you have to beat half his damage that he did to you so 12 half that ends your turn keyleth taryon wait so your scroll of fire shield you said okay yeah that's ten minutes not concentration so you said warm shield which gives you resistance to cold damage okay all right you've got 40 feet of movement here (clang) turns into a nice crossbow all right (clicking) that's your turn all right top of the round percy what are you doing around here all right you turn the corner grog is now hexed and on fire if they're prone an attack roll against the creature has advantage if they're within five feet otherwise it's disadvantage if the person is prone it's harder for you to hit with ranged weapons this is not very percy of you okay is this also piercing so that's another grit spent 22 grog so you get to also roll an attack against vex as well basically the shot goes through both of you it goes through grog's shoulder (explosion) and has enough weight to actually impact and hit vex in the same shot so you watch as the muscle of the shoulder explodes and in that brief second you dodge your head out of the way and watch as the ball goes (whoosh) and skims the edge of your cheek a little blood goes (flick) down the side you glare at him through the hole in his shoulder tombstone-style 33 points of piercing damage that's 16 four necrotic not halved this time you turn around and see percy there he pulls out the retort shot and you're like (whoosh) and duck right out of the way okay that's about the extent of your movement there all righty that ends your turn not saving throws checks so insight perception things like that all right the pillars that you see in the center here begin to (vibration) emit that weird vibrating hum again and you feel keyleth as the gravitational pull warps around you but doesn't affect your form because of your freedom of movement however trinket seems to (groans) be pulled down by the gravity of it you watch as doty's form on the ground across the way (crack) gravity crushes a little further in towards the stone it seems to be radial around each pillar all right vex you're up okay so you put yourself out as an action okay first thing at the top of your round you take four points of fire damage you spend the action to put yourself out so you are now no longer on fire that's a bonus action from grog rogues man so you can get up about we'll say 40 feet yeah you're up near the top straight up okay so you get a little ways over we'll say about there ends your turn grog you're up she's about 40 feet up from you right now yeah so you take three points of fire damage reduced to one okay so you turn all right you're advancing towards percy (counting) yes you can go ahead and roll your check to see if you succeed or not you land right on the opposite side of percy we'll push this open just a little bit to get your placement as you slam into the ground right next to him (heavy impact) all of a sudden percival you're standing against the wall and you hear (footsteps) nothing (explosion) right to the right of you the sudden slam of stone as the behemoth goliath grog lands next to you grinning blood pouring out of the bullet wound in his shoulder big smile yes you may no you took blood axe didn't you 26 points of damage to you so you rolled a what what did you roll for damage well hold on what level fighter are you right which means yep that's the great weapon fighting you haven't used that yet really wait so how much is that you double the dice not the bonus no just the dice so you rolled an eight so it's 16 plus the modifier plus your brutal critical which is another three additional damage dice at level 17 grog well no because you're not a level 17 barbarian so it is two you're right so that's two an additional 19 to the 30 76 plus 19 right the last hit was 19 points of damage so 76 total before that he did 96 wait right sorry just doing the math here oh total i see okay grog not a bad round you did 96 points of damage all right so that's grog's turn keyleth you're up vex is flying up on the top on her broom have trinket roll a dexterity saving throw nope 5d6 points of fire damage on trinket nope unconscious and burning smoke (sizzling) off the burnt fur (sad bear sounds) full movement and action that was just your bonus action no it's at the top of your round that you take the damage oh and percy roll concentration checks for hex so first attack just roll higher than a 14 we'll say okay hex is gone hex-a-gone all right keyleth what are you doing over here speed of 50 right you can try i don't want to tell you if you can or not you can try to figure it out you get just there on the inside you see it's largely empty and there is a chest that's currently open and looks empty you see as you're running by a large hammer over the top of the wall on the opposite side going (thuds) these heavy wet thuds all right so that's your movement you have your action still right it's a bonus action to do that which you already used to move your sphere sure taryon yes you're there in the corner with your crossbow the broom isn't huge you can fit it up inside there take that quote out of context (laughter) matt and you're right here way over in the corner okay five ten 15 what are you going to try what are you trying tary i'm going to make a judgment call here based on the wording give me just one second can pass through the sphere i'm going to say sure it's not passing through it it's creating a passable window in the sphere it makes sense so you go ahead and pull it off and slap it and you watch as a little two-foot-by-two-foot window opens up all righty yeah technically nah it's too late now to retcon that my fault all right so that ends your turn tary percival you're up greater healing is 4d4 plus four okay all right what does it say on the card yeah just dex modifier well no i'd say add your proficiency as well because you built the thing so that's one attack yeah so percy's (frustrated grunting) trying to reach out towards you lightning damage to you so that's halved so you take 12 points constitution saving throw yeah hex went away if he would've rolled low that would've saved you probably technically you had advantage on your attacks against him because he used reckless you would've had advantage so the two attack rolls we'll say were one attack well you can hit him with the gun you just have disadvantage with the strikes but you have advantage so it would be just a straight roll both hit yeah okay so 11 points piercing damage grog correct you can still run but he gets to swipe at you yes you can (laughs) you can flee (counting) that's as far as you can get with your movement there's two doors and a ladder no you can run up the side up this wall so you're right there that's your turn percy the electrical towers at the top cycle (electricity noises) and flash with a bolt of energy nobody is in the radius to be affected no effect that brings us to vex up at the top as you flew up there on the broom you felt your head and shoulders bump and hit the ceiling and you're like shit arrows ready okay (laughter) first roll damage for everything for all of it from as you're on the wall you feel the sense this burning in your ears and you glance up just as you watch an arrow (arrow sound) come towards you and as it bursts open this series of tendrils of vines you reach over and grab and stop the arrow somewhat before it pierces into you but you still manage to pull it back and the vines begin to ensnare around you go ahead and roll a strength saving throw i believe dc 17 they (whoosh) wrap around you and you find yourself-- that does succeed so as they wrap around you you (strained grunting) and burst off of them and the arrow breaks out and they all turn gray and wither into dust as they hit the ground you fall unconscious and off the wall hitting the ground you take three points of bludgeoning damage as you hit which is an immediate failed death save oh yeah that's part of this yeah if you roll a natural 20 on your death save it's happened before okay drop down to the roof okay you lay down on the roof using your bonus action to hide go ahead and roll a stealth check 27 as far as you know no one has any idea where the hell you are all right that ends your turn grog you're up you watch her (descending noise) as you lumber around you go and see his unconscious body there on the ground okay you move in that's ten more feet go ahead and roll with advantage all right it's an auto-crit because it was within five feet how do you want to do this the whole face caves in as the hammer scatters him like a gallagher watermelon across the stone floor percival is no more first to fall five ten 15 20 toward the tower this way yeah if you want to go ahead and roll for that you land (grunt impact noise) right toward the base that's true last round or just this one that's five fire damage reduced to two and you disappear into the center of the tower you get partway up the stairs yeah it's a spiral staircase all right that ends your turn grog keyleth no you were inside the cusp of this building the entire time glancing around there you saw her up there and make a perception check 21 you got the gist you watched her descend but you have no idea directly where she is you know she's somewhere in this area you know where she is if you have an area something you want to do you could probably hit her but you can't aim a specific attack directly at her because you can't see her you saw grog run by this way and that's the last you saw and you know that vex is somewhere in this area what do you want to do you're there sure yeah okay go for it technically yeah it's fine 30 feet for the sphere there that's as far as it can get right there okay that ends your turn keyleth all righty taryon your turn okay i know where you are that's your turn okay taryon no longer percy's turn so with that the braziers-- right yes and all the braziers flare up don't affect anybody that brings us to vex the opposite tower flying over here you make your way there make a perception check yeah you see the flickering flames of keyleth within the inside in the very cusp of this she has three-quarters cover but you have sharpshooter so you ignore that 17 points of damage 25 to hit that hits damage as the brambles wrap around her the flames burn them away she's immune to being restrained at this point yeah we're skirting a line here of watching you go up and land you aren't amongst trees in a forest it's easy to see where you are vaguely roll a stealth check okay good to know that ends vex's turn grog no it's just stairwell like when you went through the other one it's empty more of a gaining of ground and/or protective space you got ten feet in so ten feet out you still have 40 at the doorway there's a flaming sphere there which you're like oh avoid 25 30 35 40 you're just stepping over the corpse of trinket he's doing okay for now grog that's your movement you're technically right here you have your action still you can dash if you want to get all the way there or you can attack something in the vicinity what do you want to do (counting) you get inside here and see a small chest by the doorway there you can move to the chest but it'll take an action to open it yes you can you do you open it up and there is a potion bottle within it so you acquire the potion you open the chest and you grab the potion you have your bonus action still right so 4d4 plus four you also take six points of fire damage reduced to three because you're doing this while on fire make a perception check you glance up the tower and you see just the edge of vex trying to hide around the stonework you see her feather and the edge of her hair and you see her right up on the top no the fire storm down the side how many cubes is it that's nasty okay fire storm ten ten-foot cubes you could even get to grog if you wanted to yeah it is it's very minecraft (fire noises) all right i need you to go ahead and make a dexterity saving throw vex and marisha roll 7d10 yeah that's the damage of fire storm man what's your dc so you succeed so half damage just barely succeeded the front doors by the way of this tower are now on fire the wooden doors at the bottom have now caught flame from the fire storm and you can see elements of the inside the tower are starting to catch fire too and you get to reroll ones once because of your staff so you take 26 points of fire damage no no based on your specifications and the movement of the broom yes i know where you are yeah it's 30 feet there all righty that brings us to taryon yes or attack something nope yeah well next to vax not on the broom though it's your walking speed no that's starting to borderline on an attack you're not too sure you can try it yes yes you watched grog run past you watched vex get set fire in a tower and you watched keyleth cast the spell and then disappear inside the room she's not caught fire but you watched flames consume her briefly (laughs) it seems to be a theme okay that's your turn taryon all right top of the round the arcane towers burst i need you to make a dexterity saving throw 30 okay that would be 11 points of lightning damage reduced to five all right vex your turn as the flames subside you're like (pants) you glance over and you can see keyleth vanish back inside that room currently you have no view of her but you just watched her just barely step inside you can still get perspective if you were to move to get a better angle there's plenty of places for you guys to hide there's nothing but hiding places okay over here okay you can barely see keyleth out of the side yeah yes because you have sharpshooter so you can attack her you get to about there you can look down and you see her poking out okay i see yeah so we'll say you can be there you can get down to the roof and see her from there you hunter's marked grog i thought percy that's what it was yeah keyleth as a bonus action yeah i'm pretty sure it is okay 26 hits so you're not hunter's marking her okay 16 plus nine roll a concentration check with advantage yeah you're fine hits go ahead and roll damage that's 20 points of damage go ahead and roll another concentration check just roll higher than a ten yeah whatever your constitution saving throw is so maintains concentration you don't really have any way to hide from her right now okay so you drop prone there you go we'll say yep you watched her vanish you know she's somewhere on or near that roof but you're not specifically aware so that ends your turn grog roll for that 22 yep you actually land on doty's head crushing it into the ground that's the rest of your movement there yeah you can dash if you want to move all the way in but you won't have an action okay so you head inside and you get to the appearance of this you get in there and there is the chest there yeah that's your turn all right that ends your turn keyleth yeah you just got shot twice and you're (gasps) you pull back inside and you're (gasps) you glance outside and you hear (heavy footfalls) you have no idea where vex is at the moment the last you saw her she was on the roof and you watched grog dart by without seeing you and then run into the building right across the way what are you going to do keyleth what are you going to do yeah it's just making them adjacent to each other that can be in height too yeah as long as they're against a surface okay so how many points has that spent on the spire there you go you're causing it to consume the entire roof yeah so you can just fill the roof and then down the side and then fill the inside all right so i need both grog and vex to make dexterity saving throws 19 does not make it so roll 7d10 fire damage you take half of it because you're resistant yep 51 points of fire damage to you grog halve that to 25 still conscious good vex you take the same thing 25 points of fire damage so that's your attack the flaming sphere the flaming sphere hits there yeah you're right so yes so you get there no you spent all your actions they're well aware of where you are they watched you (footsteps) around the corner you hear (heavy breathing) around the wall that finishes keyleth's turn taryon you could with your movement reach him okay (hissing gas) what's the radius of that yeah so there's a 20-foot area here keyleth's the only one that can see it out of the corner of your eye you watch as where doty's body is suddenly smoke fills this area here obscuring doty's currently not moving body that's your turn if this is going to continue i want you to tell me where you're going just to come over and whisper to me otherwise this is getting a little weird for the first round it's fine but yeah you can text me if you want to or come by and whisper real fast all right that brings us to top of the round you did take ten damage reduced to five all righty so the towers (vibration) begin to extend that vibration again and the gravity begins to converge and condense around each of these towers once more all righty vex you're up you're on your back right now going (groans) a little bit of smoke (coughs) out of the mouth that you know of okay about there that's as far as you can get with your full movement okay go for it 18 points of health to you all right got it trinket's still doing okay succeeded two you didn't have visual on her at that time not since you moved away from the edge you moved out of the way to make sure nobody could see you sure yeah she wasn't hidden so she's marked okay that's the end of your turn grog you haven't opened the chest yet so your action (bang) open the chest grab the potion bonus action to drink it yeah 4d4 plus four the chest is burning but you're already on fire so it doesn't affect you any more than it would but you do take two points of fire damage it was four reduced to two because you're still burning it's very grog you were hunter's marked by the way keyleth no just hunter's marked yeah yep sam the jig is up all righty keyleth so i don't have an adult black dragon mini we're going to use a red one but you are a black one yeah you are still hunter's marked but yeah yeah you can still move only one way to find out you delve into the pool with a splash as it spills over the edges and you submerge yourself beneath the surface it's just deep enough for you to get entirely within the water it displaces a bit yeah but while she's in it she's currently submerged yep both of them begin to just (sizzle) doty's done nope and trinket begins to slowly dissolve in his unconscious state that is a second failed death save on trinket well yeah is that your turn keyleth all right taryon all right yes okay you're submerged in the water but the spray goes through water it's a light effect so you grab one of your rubies you run up to the edge of the smoke and release a prismatic spray in this direction trinket's done trinket is turned to dust and ash we're talking terminator 2 dream sequence atomic bomb that's an interesting point actually well the only one who's seen you transform is taryon so taryon i need you to go ahead and make a wisdom saving throw please you are considered frightened you watch as keyleth turns into this black dragon and you go (screams) and watch her dive into the acid pool and you go (screams) well no when you're frightened specifically you have disadvantage on ability checks and attack rolls as long as you can see them and you cannot move willingly closer to it you can move away or adjacent but you cannot move closer to her you make the saving throw at the end of your turn it's a spell it doesn't affect him at all so you still have to make a saving throw versus prismatic spray we'll find out here in a second so i need you to roll a d8 please four i need you to make a dexterity saving throw as an adult black dragon nope so you take 10d6 poison damage you earned this 34 points of poison damage to you make a constitution saving throw you rolled twice though didn't you oh that's right because you have that feat she has the warcaster feat so you're good you are so keyleth while you're submerged under the acid all of a sudden there's a spray of greenish light that coasts through the surface of the water and beams across you and you feel a horrible poison take effect on your stomach and internal system you're like (groans) you saw it burst forth from that cloud of smoke that had been appearing on that side of the battlefield just outside of the water with your walking movement yes you still have 40 feet left you are currently here okay there you go as a bonus action okay sanctuary on you all righty that ends taryon's turn you did just in time for all the braziers to go (puff fiery explosion) i need you to make a dexterity saving throw grog 15 you take four points of fire damage reduced to two and you're set on fire but you already were (laughter) okay so you head over to the edge glance down and you see the flames rescind from the brazier and there grog is patting the side of his arm the flames are on his shoulders but he's putting it out on his elbow all right go for it yep okay this is getting close so eight plus one nine nine damage okay you spent ten movement moving up to the side there you get on your broom so you get up to about we'll say for the purposes of this you can't get too high up here you get about there you can get about there a little bit over to this side that's what you're doing we'll say you're up there right about here i'm just putting you-- fine i'll move it there you go roughly that's where you are it's a lot to coordinate that ends your turn vex grog you're up the wood ladder here that is five ten 15 yeah go ahead and roll you get halfway up yeah you get up to right about there and you have ten more feet this way okay oh yeah okay grog you took another four points of fire damage reduced to two from the fire (throwing noises) it's nasty you stayed over the roof you fall prone you still take a point of bludgeoning damage which is an immediate failed save so you've lost one death save and you're unconscious there that end your turn grog all righty keyleth you don't know where anybody is you're in acid water perception check from this perspective not really you do see vex go (thud) how far up are you going to fly it's about 35 feet to the top 35 feet to the top edge you see vex unconscious on the ground there bleeding out of the side of the mouth and you see a giant grog on fire with the hammer pulling back grog you look over your shoulder and you see a big black dragon (whoosh) the dragon goes (guttural growling speech) to be fair you guys focused on each other for most of this fight i need you to make a dexterity saving throw grog that does not succeed keyleth i need you to roll your 12d8 acid damage that grog's about to take nor resistant (guttural growling) there's a stream of acid that sprays down the tower over you grog go ahead and make your constitution saving throw so as the acid sprays over grog grog still stands there covered in acid and looks at you it puts out the fire barbarians have an ability where when they go to zero hit points they make a constitution saving throw to resist going to zero but he's still standing as the acid is (sizzling) your hunter's mark is gone now you have your movement okay into the water you're mostly submerged right now splashing in and out of the water it's displacing a lot of the acid your wings and your back are still visible all right that end your turn with that taryon you watch this dragon fly up spray acid onto the tower and then disappear into the water below you haven't seen him when you were in the sky you saw what looked like a mess in really nice clothing so you saw percival the head was pumpkined it was bad actually here's the thing real fast let me read this frightful presence you repeat at the end of its turn make another roll for the end of your last turn i forgot to make you do so in theory you know the dragon's there you can't quite move closer to it and that would be considered closer so you'd have to go around this way the door to the tower is right there yeah it is yeah you get there you see the dragon as you rush by the smoke is still there you move past the smoke and the pillar this flaming sphere is gone by the way forgot that all right so roll a d8 all right so go ahead and roll a dexterity saving throw keyleth so that's another 10d6 poison damage 35 points of fire damage to you poison damage yeah keyleth make a constitution saving throw yeah you're fine you maintain your concentration okay and you do yeah you have your boots and the potion so your movement is 160 120 yeah you can go anywhere in that tower if you wanted to there's this floor there's the second floor there's a third floor and then there's the hatch through the top yeah this is a stairway which blocks this technically that's just there so you can fit up into here and you don't technically see the dragon from that you can glance over to the side of here and poke your head through the stairs and look and be like (whimpers) and also sanctuary one more sanctuary's not there since you used prismatic spray all righty so make a wisdom saving throw to see if you can resist the frightened effect plus minus one nope you're still frightened you're still like oh god dragon all righty top of the round the pillars once again (vibration) and begin to affect this area around these pillars beginning to call gravity to the ground all righty that brings us to vex roll a death saving throw yeah okay grog your turn well i'll have to pare down the deck since we don't have the full deck here it's a half deck where did you get this oh man i'm going to do this this is very true you may not be in a moment who knows okay so starting from here we have thanks for your patience guys so grog how many cards do you want to pull (giggling) five five cards okay five cards here you guys got to pick all right keep track of the order the final one there okay so vex is the last one okay grog first card what did you pull grog weirdly not much happens to you that you notice in the moment at all your bag of holding's fucking empty now and all of your non-magical items are gone all of your personal wealth is gone magical items are not affected it's non-magical you're no longer a grand poobah in this temporary alternate universe so that probably was one of the better cards you could've pulled what's the second card grog okay okay so no discernible effect at the moment but i'll say for the hell of it should you survive this battle it's going to be really rough one day to have wilhand stab you in your sleep while you're sitting there and you're resting one night wilhand's like (growls) all right third card increase one of your ability scores by two you can increase your constitution by two okay so your hit points now go up by 17 yes he does yeah because it automatically increases his modifier by one all right fourth card okay this is the one i thought you had pulled originally a rare or rarer magical item i'm going to roll randomly for this real fast a beautiful black and ivory-inlaid sword shows up a greatsword shows up in your hand you have to attune to it unfortunately and then what's the next card (giggles) you look at the card for a second like huh what does this do and you hear a voice go (clears throat) you look to your side and there is a gentleman with armor and weapons who goes sir grog i am here to serve you whatever you need let me know my life for strongjaw (laughter) oh goodness sir are you all right dragon okay you control this character you tell him whatever to do so you have a 4th-level fighter yeah however he's the same race as you so he's a goliath in full armor all righty nope yeah okay what about your friend okay so you pull down the trap door once again and it's small in there how far down do you go you go down to the second level and as you crawl down you look and you see taryon there looking out a window looking very scared you re-cast sanctuary on yourself right all right so that's your turn grog as your knight's double fingering towards the gotcha whoa this got weird okay keyleth it's your turn you look up and you see a goliath in full armor just going it does go ahead and roll a wisdom saving throw for the knight jeez he's like dragon where-- (screams) as you land next to him he's like (weak chuckle) so full multiattack on this guy you said right all right go for it roll some attacks here okay that'll hit okay 15 does not hit 18 does hit yep two attacks hit sure go ahead and roll damage okay so 21 total and then your next strike the claw 12 damage as you strike him (heavy impacts) he's like (whimpers) and he's still alive yes you do get an attack of opportunity all right so you hover above we'll say with your full movement you don't get too far unfortunately because you took to get into that space up there would've been 70 okay you stay there go ahead and roll an attack for him no if you're not moving he doesn't you're right never mind all right so bringing it back to taryon all right roll an insight check go ahead you have to drink it on your turn but he hands it to you yeah you can you walk up to grog and (cork pop) he can maintain his rage as long as he wants high-level barbarians man well there can be only one so 54 no 64 64 health i think you're at that's your turn you can move taryon if you want to or do you want to stay put yes at the end of your turn you do at the end of your turn though if you're going to move move first okay you get down to the bottom floor and you're right by the doors which are now burned down entirely the wood has caught fire and crumbled in yeah you have a shit-ton of movement you see the edge of a wing going (whoosh) over here okay with that taryon you head down through here and into this north bunker over here all right grog you're technically in that room there yes now you roll your fear 18 i think it is only lasts a minute all right that ends your turn taryon the arcane towers (crackling) send out a burst of energy roll a dexterity saving throw for your knight friend and you roll as well 18 he succeeds it would be 16 lightning damage instead he takes eight i'll mark that here he's hurt pretty bad but he's still hanging in there what did you roll 15 so you take 16 points of lightning damage go ahead and roll a constitution check okay and yeah how many have you lost now now it's your turn go ahead and roll again and with that we'll say from a narrative standpoint as the lightning sparks out and it hits keyleth in her dragon form she falls back and her back foot (squelch) accidentally smears vex all right so that's the end of vex's turn grog you're up so grog you get up to the top of the hatch and you come out and you're right there next to your goliath friend in the face of this big dragon what are you going to do okay go for it before you roll damage on the next one roll another constitution saving throw for concentration beat a 12 okay you rolled a nine on the die this is the damage so 18 plus your modifier plus two additional dice for the weapon 47 points of damage to you roll another constitution saving throw you have to beat a 23 constitution it's not wisdom it's constitution for these keyleth's form drops the spell drops losing concentration her form reverts into regular keyleth again it wasn't damage over there's keyleth in front of you you still have your third attack okay go ahead and roll damage 27 damage to you and your friend next to you who's no longer frightened because you're no longer a dragon yeah he does he attacks on your turn he gets two attacks with his greatsword go ahead and attack twice for him plus five to hit all right so 2d6 plus three to each hit i'll protect you my lord 2d6 plus three 13 damage ends your turn grog keyleth you're up form has dropped grog is looking healthier than you remember him roll a charisma saving throw i think it's charisma right plane shift is a charisma saving throw grog roll a charisma saving throw what's your charisma so you rolled a 19 what did you roll on the dice that's a 20 yeah so he saves it's what he rolled you resist the effect as keyleth is holding onto you and she slowly lets go shaking a little bit yes you do that's your 7th-level spell gone grasping vine is 4th-level you can't cast it nope still gets a swing at you both of them 2nd-level healing word you can't do more than 2nd-level i can't believe you made that fucking roll it's the hat it's the feathered hat it pushes it just over land safely okay both you and your buddy get an attack of opportunity on her 2d6 plus three six points of damage to you keyleth you turn you run make an athletics check please no it's okay you didn't have to roll high you'll get a decent distance but your jump distance is tripled because of your mantle so you do manage to make it and land on that roof you take four points of bludgeoning damage i rolled one one two yeah it hurt it pops a little bit but you're there four points yeah all right that's your turn keyleth taryon you're way over here halfway up about there cone it's a cone outward you could hit both of them all three of them with it you have to pull back a lot like over here yeah they're all within 60 feet prismatic spray yeah d8 five that's cold damage i need grog keyleth your knight friend is (ice cracking) frozen into place and is now a frozen statue of ice there up in the tower dexterity saving throw yeah yeah you succeed so half damage to both of you roll that now it's 10d6 cold damage yeah we'll see how the roll goes this is close top of the round the towers surge bursting with energy up here and up here grog i need you to roll another dexterity saving throw 18 okay that just succeeds you take half damage right i rolled pretty good so it was 21 points of lightning damage reduced to ten and then halved because you have resistance so five and grog it's your turn you have keyleth over here go ahead and roll your athletics check don't be a one okay you leap and land you do take three points of bludgeoning damage six reduced to three i know okay go for it on the first hit go ahead and roll damage i know so keyleth-- you take the three damage not from the stone breaking your fall but from her breaking your fall as you land on her she (thud) onto the stone flat on the ground the hammer placed squarely between the back of her shoulderblades in the middle of the neck as you bring the hammer back up pulling it back she's twitching a little on the stonework but she's still alive roll an attack yeah it's an auto-crit so it's two automatic fails of your death saving throw (splash) make a strength check he's making it not you you're making it what did you get 20 you arc her (whoosh sizzle) taking the final death saving throw as you slowly dissolve in the acid keyleth eliminated from the battle 70 feet you can hit him at 70 feet yeah it's disadvantage on the attack though right well first make a wisdom saving throw because he has sanctuary you go-- here okay your turn taryon you see him he's not really hiding (laughs) he's resistant to slashing bludgeoning piercing fire cold and lightning right now yeah because of your belt you can get about there a little closer actually you'd have to get to about there and you can throw to him this vial (splash) hits the ground and splashes acid all around you he has to make a dexterity saving throw i think the dc i'm pretty sure 18 makes it no that's a tactic you take eight points of acid damage grog all righty grog it's your turn nope he's about 15 feet ahead of you so wisdom so you go (frustrated noise) you have to roll to attack roll damage on that you're like (laughs gong sound) you taste the blood for the first time in your mouth really yeah going off the roof there and then get inside so you'll be about there you're low you're hunched in there melee attacks inside that room for you right now are going to be at disadvantage because the space is so crowded taryon your turn a straight wall of flame engulfs the room dexterity save from you grog 26 so you take half that which is 13 because you succeeded on your save and then half that you take six points of fire damage he's resistant to fire man that's your turn you still have your bonus action (laughs) all right grog it's your turn he's 30 feet above it you have to move out of the room first so you have ten feet out that would have been great wisdom save second attack lost third and final strike (grunts) 31 points of damage oh to hit okay 26 points of damage all right tary it's your turn all righty dexterity check grog roll a d8 he rolls a d8 what did you roll four is poison yeah yeah so roll 10d6 and he saved so he takes a quarter of the poison damage 21 ten ten points of poison damage he can't have that much more don't give up all righty grog it's your turn it's not casting it at a higher level he's sacrificing a higher-level spell slot to cast a lower-level it doesn't change anything about it you're just using a higher-level slot it's not casting at a higher level he's basically sacrificing a high-level spell to cast a lower-level spell that doesn't get any benefit from being sacrificed first attack you get through he moved right under here no but he's not being knocked-- if it was an attack that pushed or did anything to affect his movement or yank him then it would become an issue just doing damage won't do anything the same things that would knock him off the broom would knock you off the broom it would just mean the broom stays attached to you you made a save on each of those rolls nope yes well you have to roll saves for the next two all right so the last two attacks do no damage yes he doesn't appear to be resistant to acid damage two-face style it's a dex save on you grog to try and avoid it what's your dc no full damage on this acid damage yeah roll a constitution well plus one the modifier gives you a plus one the dc is 15 this time okay he stays up at one hit point the dc's going to be 20 next time that happens you still have your movement over here you can get all the way over here it's better than a grogning all right that ends your turn top of the round the braziers all (explosion noise) in the distance no effect grog your turn yeah right there you can climb it we'll see how far you can get you'll get partway into the first floor on your 50 are you going to dash to try and do the rest it won't get you all the way to the top no okay you'll get-- with your dash into the third floor almost to the hatch so you're up in the third floor right now tary you come to the hatch and grog rushes up into the third floor there as you come down in the hatch your rod turns into a greatsword yes you can hits roll damage grog make a constitution-- roll a constitution saving throw dc 20 you do after this retaliation is an immediate reaction as your feat you mean right but this isn't him getting a free attack from you moving away one of his barbarian abilities is if someone hits him with a melee attack he can immediately attack he goaded you right into doing what he wanted make your attack grog roll some cold damage make another constitution check with a dc 25 grog it's a 25 taryon how do you want to do this the cold shatters you and you feel the ribcage break like brittle glass on the inside of your chest from the blast backward you fall to your knees unable to move a muscle you can feel the life barely beating through your body is heaving with each heartbeat pulse he's prostrate before you taryon as you approach as you hit the ground as the last of the cold damage has curled over your body and freezes you solid you (shattering) shatter into thousands of small frozen pieces the last t2 reference of the night yep as taryon darrington stands victor of this round as you stand there breathing heavily suddenly the stone top of the tower cracks open like it's being pulled apart by giant invisible hands and there you see descending from above a gentleman in a large dark cloak and a magnificent beard and a glorious well-kept mane of hair he lands let this blessing of colville carry you into any dimension he touches your forehead and you feel the fates reach into you and plant you with a seed of possibility and then with that a flash is gone you awaken in your bed cold sweat the next morning after you went to sleep you're not as powerful as you felt before that was a crazy dream but you look down and you see this slight glow of white light across your sternum from underneath your silk pajamas and then it fades and you feel like something from that dream is holding on and that's where we're going to end our game tonight (cheering) i'm curious where were you going to try and plane shift grog that was a great battle guys i'm glad you guys had fun i was hoping it would be fun that's what i wanted to make it feel like little bunker areas yeah here you could have destroyed it hitting it would have done damage to it but it would have prevented that from going off in that area yeah each trunk had one healing potion it was whoever got there first one trunk left that nobody went to well done guys oh man well when this campaign arc's over and we have everybody available hopefully we'll probably have one final battle royale with everyone max level with vax with pike and see who comes through on that one and whatever gift boon i decide for that one if it's similar or the same will probably carry over to the next campaign for their first new characters should be fun you had a 90% chance of just disappearing and drowning nobody tried it's the balance to the necklace so you can't just imprison the main big bad guy of something and be like oh that's over because he rolled poor it will help for a while but if he stays in there for a long time and he's intelligent he'll eventually find a way out it's an imperfect prison i'm going to hold onto those if that's okay i want to use those from now on oh that was so much fun two clerics and an artificer are our reigning champions in the battles guys then pike and then pike pushed your face into lava oh percy you had some bad rolls you more so than anybody in this party-- maybe grog but grog had to still get there-- you with an action surge and some good rolls you can pretty much take down almost any member in one round with good rolls well done guys thank you guys for playing hope you guys enjoyed watching we'll see you guys next week to pick up the next leg of the adventure as we left off right as you were exiting the platinum mines with the swarm of ankhegs below you we'll pick up from there next week we'll have jon heder as a guest which i got to coordinate with him to get his story stuff figured out we'll talk and the week after that will be our 100th episode that's fucking crazy
