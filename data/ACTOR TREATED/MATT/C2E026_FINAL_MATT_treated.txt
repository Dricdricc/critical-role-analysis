critical role and welcome back so welcome back last we left off the mighty nein were making their way north after making a deal with the gentleman in zadash they had completed the first of two tasks for him the second one requiring them to make their way to the northern city of shadycreek run outside of the empire to meet with a business operative of his who had been busy with some other elements and needed some help to reconnect about what their business together was along this journey you had made a stop in the gnomish city of hupperdook where you discovered the work-hard-play-hard gnomish society got all your money taken from you got it returned to you as you found out the thieves were the young children of a family the parents of which had been arrested and had been imprisoned for a while you went to the prison helped destroy one of their long-haywire guardians and paid off the rest of the fine for those parents to set them free returning them to their children and decided to leave your temporary companion for a while kiri with them as a safer means of continuing her journey now with her new family with that you gathered your things found yourself a better crossbow and began heading back on the trail along the crispvale road and making your way northward there you had set up camp for the evening about a day's travel outside of hupperdook and during the night while yasha and fjord were taking their watch wakening jester with their conversation and the three of them deciding to step away from the camp as not to wake the rest of you they were well they went missing we begin today's story as morning slowly creeps over the distant mountains the cold frosted dew on the tops of the nearby grasses glistening like tiny crystals the bits of sunlight begin to just break past the ridge the sky previously clear the night before showing the stars above now is matted with cloud cover and small breaks that show the blue sky above the cold weather is definitely shaking you awake as you all begin to come to rubbing your eyes glancing about the cold atmosphere you come to the hard dirt ground patch that you had cleared out for your evening's rest your packs and tents ready to be reassembled but it's just the four of you make a perception check looking about there is a faint mist that is still burning off that clouds your vision far enough to the point where you can't quite see some elements of the mountain range you had just come from but glancing about around you there's no sign of your three companions there's no visuals that guide you to where they might be as you go about to their sleeping arrangement spaces everything except for whatever they had on them as they took their watch is still there the haversack is left behind the rest of their goods lying on the ground where they were left yep the falchion's always with him he would have a belt with pouches and such but no that was on him at the time those are not there unfortunately essentially everything but the equipment they had on them-- in fact if you look you can see jester's shield is there currently untouched yasha doesn't have much on her whatever she does have she generally keeps on her so she hasn't left anything behind you don't see any weapons yasha keeps her weapon on her at all times fjord from what you understand weirdly never seems to have need but jester's weapon is left next to the shield as well as you begin to rummage through make an investigation check all right then as you begin to rummage around in the nearby grasses tossing over the remains of their left behind materials even pushing through the fire just in case some of them may have fallen in no sign you'd make an investigation check then not within the next mile or so okay okay (laughs) so as you are both losing yourselves amongst the nearby grasses and trying to look for any sign of where they may have been you are focusing on your spell what are you doing beauregard go ahead and make an investigation check this is amazing knocking it out of the park y'all we'll get them out now in the time that you guys have begun to shout you're continuing to shout their names out and forge through the nearby grasses caleb you complete your spell and frumpkin's form suddenly slowly shifts then with a puff of steam and smoke turns into the falcon lands on your shoulder (caws) you watch as frumpkin takes off into the sky and does a few loops go ahead and make a perception check from a bird's eye view which makes it a little easier there you go when humanity fails bring in the hawks with a quick singular pass overhead you watch as frumpkin sends you an immediate bit of information you focus through the eyes and glancing down you see a clearing where a large portion of grass maybe about 60 or so feet from where you guys are has been pushed down and you see tracks and drag marks and grooves in the dirt all right you guys rush over and there you can see on the ground this patch of disturbed grass that has been pushed down along with the dirt that has been jammed and shoved up into small side piles and trenches that were dug in there's definitely signs of a struggle here at a quick glance looking around footprints and signs there looks to be somewhere between five to eight sets of footprints you can see from all different angles and you can see three grooves being dragged through the dirt into the grass towards the road a little bit northward yeah you guys go ahead and follow these the best you can eventually making your way to the outer side of the crispvale road the path that you were on already but a little ways north of where you were and there you can see the grooves end and a number of sets of heavy wagon wheels begin or at least have previously pulled off the trail and then pushed themselves back onto the road it's hard to tell which direction wagon tracks go in necessarily make a survival check (laughs) could be going north could be going south you're not entirely sure northeast or southwest you're not entirely certain the tracks seem to be traveling either in the northeast direction that the road goes that you were traveling or heading back towards hupperdook what you do notice though and what keys you in that this has something to do with this is the tracks grind off the road by about five or ten feet and that's where the grooves of these dragged individuals or sacks stop and then it pushes back onto the road make another investigation check it's better in looking through near where these cart tracks begin there's no signs of blood going back and following the grooves through the dirt you find a few small traces no just standard dark dusted-over blood at this point make a perception check 14 as you look off looking for any sign of change there's the fog at the far peripheral of where you're watching nothing on the road except for a couple of tufts of scrub brush catch your eyes until you see a dark shape on the road to the south moving it looks to be a shadowed outline of a person they run out in half an hour it's like a game gear i think molly's already off so you've nocked your bolt into your crossbow for the first time as it winds back you crank it and it slips into place you hear this faint spring tension as you're preparing for this molly and beau start rushing up okay so you head off into the brush make a stealth check 12 okay good to know molly as you get closer the shape takes more form as the mist fades and your proximity grows closer you see a squat figure wide and muscular armored with a sack over the shoulder ashly if you want to enter ashly burch joins us at the table so ashly if you'd like to describe what molly sees as he approaches roll a perception check for me oh we should get that for you we got plenty yes so roll a d20 add your perception modifier so you see one figure coming towards you difficult to make out gender of lavender skin curled horns filled with jewelry big long coat of multi-colors maroon but then it goes into a rainbow pattern almost with two glowing scimitars to each side staring you down behind that you see two figures a little bit beyond your sight to make out all the details but one seems to be a tall humanoid the other seems to be much shorter and smaller probably halfling gnome and then off in the bushes not hiding very well you see another figure keeping low to your left the de-escalation has begun this tiny figure hooded with wrappings and a creepy porcelain doll face that covers-- a giant falcon (caw) lands it's harsh but functional walked over as you poured the drink make a history check you have not heard of the iron shepherds before you have some base knowledge of some families that might do business in the outside but the information you've been given so far the iron shepherds don't ring a bell there it was i was waiting for it if someone else wasn't going to get there i was going to do it so thank you for taking it there is an aspect of that name that does ring a bell the last name at which point you look over past the camp where they are and there's a cart and there are a number of horses that are currently hitched to it at the moment for a brief moment you're like oh the thought of not having to travel on foot sounds fantastic as you guys pack up your goods get the rest of your material packed up couple things to keep in mind looking at the map if you want to pull it out and get an idea of the direction you're traveling as long you guys can see it is more the job here you can travel with your horses-- with your horse and cart-- look at that timing you guys are currently right here so you just left hupperdook you're on the crispvale roadway making your way to the crispvale thicket which is the large forest at the crossroads you can travel about 24 miles per an eight hour day at a normal pace with the horses and cart you can go 30 miles at a fast pace and you can force a march to go for another hour or two or three afterward but you start making constitution saving throws or take exhaustion points at that point but you can get quite a good distance depending on how fast you're going the cart keeps you at a slower pace if you were to leave the cart behind as an option you could go faster you have six horses between five of you as long as one of you takes the horse head you can have a pack horse essentially it's going to be hard to direct it unless someone keeps it hitched on the side having an additional horse right now how are you going to get that to come with you at a fast pace without a rider you can probably carry a few things you still have horses to help carry things most of your gear you can still put on yourself are there any large things you're not carrying a manticore head anymore the main pack i'd say you can-- i'm going to say the shield's not going to fully fit in it unfortunately it's a fairly wide shield and won't quite fit a tent you can probably mangle and push in there and you manage to get the tent in but the shield someone will have to wear on their back or strap to a horse you can put the shield-- strap it to a horse it's fine because it's just an additional thing you're strapping on to it it's up to you it's just the additional horse is going to be a problem if you're going to travel at a fast pace no there is the crispvale thicket ahead which has the crossroads but there's no town there-- hupperdook behind you or honestly nogvurot or shadycreek run so which one do you leave behind then welcome to the mighty nein as you say goodbyes to loaf you strap your materials to the horses you are taking with you so you're going at a fast pace that's 30 miles sam and you travel in day which will get you well within the crispvale thicket as you guys are riding who's guiding this trip who's keeping an eye on the road ahead of you as you go you can do that sure this is the one thing you see strapped laying over the back of his horse this giant rolled up thick blue and silver tapestry as you take the full tapestry or just a piece of it all right so yeah-- it's you are just-- yeah there you go okay you've traveled this path before so it's well known who's keeping watch okay go ahead and make a perception check for me beau all right as you're heading down into the center part of the northern side of the marrow valley keeping a look ahead you can see just as you crest over this one little embankment the crispvale thicket ahead of you this beautiful cluster of dark-green trees the clouds have completely taken the sky back and it's this low gloomy gray as the air gets chilly as the day progresses onward getting closer and closer to dusk you manage to get to the outskirts of the thicket itself you see the trees growing thicker and the actual canopy of dark green pine trees starting to gather you now have the opportunity if you want to you can travel into the crossroads and head north or you can skirt around the forest off the path those are your-- because you haven't-- you're basically having to go to the center and then back north but you're on the road the whole time or if you wanted to skip past it you'll travel a little slower-- basically a similar pace well you don't know it just depends on your-- make a survival check looking about you gather the faster route would probably be to skirt around the outside of the forest because you don't have to switch back even though the terrain isn't quite as well tread however you've left the cart behind which means the one factor that would've really come into that is no longer an issue at this point in the main road there are a number of tracks whether it be horse foot and cart and wheels of all different sizes you're not able to really tell what's the freshest from a glance if you want to get off your horse and inspect you can try that would be survival you glance down-- from atop your horse you look down and see these smattering of patterns and as you get down closer it just becomes dirt and you have no idea how to discern what came when so which path do you guys wish to choose so you're going through the thicket or around the outside of it okay so you're skirting the outside of the thicket okay as you start cresting around the side of the forest within the first mile or so you see an abandoned homestead maybe 200 feet or so away from the forest on the northern side it may have been at one time a small farmhouse but part of the roof is caved in there once was a window that had pane glass that has since been shattered and you can see jagged edges along the bottom side of its sill right now i'd say it's probably close to four or five in the afternoon you have a couple hours before dusk really starts hitting frumpkin could yeah and it's a one story farmhouse it's a modest home single story maybe from first glance three to four rooms and the partially collapsed roof on one side shows you that's it's been in disuse for some time who knows how weathered it may be on the interior about four or five in the afternoon so you guys continue you didn't get close enough to inspect yeah you can certainly try yeah frumpkin's wingspan in this form is pretty wide wider than the window so frumpkin would have to land on the window and then probably gingerly step in you guys watch as the horse rides off to the edge keg leaps off the horse stomps up and just kicks the door open the door is already partially ajar so it (creaks) and it falls off the top end and leans against the back inside of the farmhouse there's a brief moment where you feel a couple things settle a slight creak and the fall of dust and as you step inside you can see the furniture is in disarray there is a layer of dust everywhere there is a smell of old rot and mildew and glancing inside you can see there's another window on the opposite side that's also been busted out this place is pretty thrashed are you looking for-- well you make an investigation check on that and you make an investigation check to look for things and if you want-- yeah go for it oh sadly no booze what did you roll hard to tell in this space a lot of the furniture looks damaged some of it looks burned weirdly as you looking around on the inside you're rummaging around for any possible books or anything that can be useful you don't find any books you do manage to find a bundle of unused torches five you have a handaxe that's a little old and rusted but it's still functional it's well made that was left under one of the shelves that had fallen over and you find a mostly filled oil lantern while the glass of the actual lantern is broken it still is pretty filled with oil so if you wanted to-- if you had a container you could fill it and have a flask of oil then you can go ahead and fill it with oil now you have a flask of oil at your disposal no crests you glance and you do see a small iron symbol that looks like a star or sun you recognize it to be the symbol of pelor it probably was a mantle of worship here but it's looking on it the metal looks scarred strangely it's almost like elements of-- as you pick it up and glance at it the pockmark scarring on it is strange and the mantle around it you can see a lot of the wood and stonework seems to have been smoothed over in its damage yeah it snaps off you get a torch and you get a torch okay so how long does it take for that ten minutes okay wait all right so caleb-- you're having this moment where you're waiting as he's just poring over this tome and drawing a circle on the ground and inscribing strange symbols in the air it doesn't make any sense you're like ah magic stuff everybody else roll a perception check if you don't mind 17 what did you get beau and keg you guys hear some noises out back the horses are getting a little restless and nervous they're like (anxious chuffing) and you see two of them are starting to clomp back a bit away from the house starting to pull at the reins that have been hitched off to the side of the home at that point trying to take in what is sending these horses into a weird tizzy and you feel this faint vibration in the ground this very subtle quaking okay still utilizing the same perception checks you have looking in both directions nothing there is-- you're maybe a little over a hundred feet or so from the tree line which is what you were staying close to to not be out in the middle of the open field but you don't see anything coming or going okay you do there's this faint (soft rumbling) and it seems to be moving in shifts or in pulses of intensity getting more intense and some of them longer and some of them shorter no that's what you're sensing okay you guys are headed for the trees spell's lost molly and caleb start running out of the home to the tree line and you're just going up on the roof you're still on horseback you can jump off your horse right right so you're leaving your horse there and if-- you can try and look up on the roof part of it's collapsed you don't know the state it's in but you can try okay (galloping) you start heading back to the tree line what are you guys doing you can't you haven't sensed anything everyone has just started getting nervous and rushing for the tree line you can hear the faint rumbling and it is getting louder you're about 20 or so feet from the tree line okay your horse begins to head in a southward direction so you're staying by the house make a stealth check caleb and molly you guys are riding towards the treeline first thing you notice is a splash of dirt to the south you see a small detonation out of the earth in the direction of where your horse had been traveling off you see something emerge from the ground and your horse ride up and hoof down and begin to run back in your direction away from it it seemed to cut it off at the south as it is running towards you-- you see something spray or splash in its direction as it turns and it whinnies in horrible pain before it collapses onto the ground spinning it lies there on the ground making this horrible (squealing) sound as you're watching from what you can see in the distance its flesh burning it looks in a really bad place at this point in time molly and caleb you hear the vibration as the ground bursts to the right and left of you let me get the map since that's where we're going now yeah we're going to move this map out of the way there is caleb there's molly just on the outskirts of the forest this way bursting to each side of you you see these large insectoid creatures that burst out of the dirt and ground beau you are right over on this side as you left your horse on a southern direction there both nott and keg are about 100 feet that direction yeah while you guys are over by the house you watch as this is going on and there doesn't appear to be any action immediately near you so you're quite a distance away you can if your horse is still right by the-- no your horses rushed off towards the-- your horse is still there that's right you still have your horse there you can jump on your horse and head that direction if you want to all right so you rush onto that i need everybody to roll initiative please because we are now in combat 25 to 20 beau's up first 20 to 15 molly's up next 15 to ten caleb what did you get all right and ooh not so great for keg that's all right top of the round beau there's a third one down that way that's maybe about 30 feet away from you that is heading your direction it's up to you if you want to pursue that or come help out your friends yeah you should yeah you can easily get there 15 hits that is a six a five plus one it does not save as you rush up to the side you look for what-- and what you see now at a close look is this massive almost eight to nine feet tall to its head insect-like large cockroach-type creature its chitinous armored body is segmented in places there's large antennae and these massive pincers come out of its mouth with its strange insectoid eyes this gooey saliva that's dripping out of the center of its mouth as it spins around towards you you see a moment where between its plates and its body seems to be a soft muscle-like underbelly you jam your fist in there and attack and it seems to lock up its body for a moment roll damage all right so that's your first strike nice the first strike ends up as just enough to cut past its defenses to stun it as it's reeling from the impact your other blow crack with your staff to the side hits it and part of its armor cracks inward exposing more of its tender underbelly okay you want to learn three things from it what do you want to learn dexterity saving throw is zero plus zero plus one no vulnerabilities still have a bonus attack 13 technically your attacks have advantage while it's stunned so you get to roll again does not hit even while stunned you swing back with your fist and your knuckles glide off of part of the armor that is still hardened and it hurts your knuckles and you pull back a second but it's not immediately able to do anything back at you that's your turn i believe all right that ends your turn molly you're up next (counting) 30 so you're just out of range of it but you can use your movement to move up to it there you go you do you watch as molly fades out of existence and then appears nightcrawler teleport-style right behind caleb go for it yep so 13 damage 19 hits 11 points of damage all right that'll do it with that you teleport next to it and carve it asunder it screams as you slice through it all three times and you bisect it in the center of where its thorax begins falls to the ground and crumples into pieces its greenish blood spilling into the dirt and floor of the forest underbrush all right ends molly's turn nott you're up you do you have 25 feet of movement perfect there you go finishing your go nott you are way off that way you're about 100 feet away yeah that's 30 feet you could dash as a bonus action if you wanted to it does seem to lose your stealth unfortunately you could be low in the brush but you're not moving quiet carefully we'll say at that point that'll get you about to the edge of the board there keg is going to be catching up to you at this point okay got you that ends nott's turn it's now their turn as one of them that previously killed beau's horse-- to that side there another one bursts from the ground-- --on this side and skitters over this direction this one's going to move up to there if your horse is there it can't quite move to that space which is frustrating it that's fine it'll pull back a bit then and stay there actually no because you killed the fourth one so it's not present as they all turn around and watching its one friend get cut down they begin to line up all three of them pull back and its pincers open as it releases this splashing stream of deep green-like liquid that sprays out in front of it for 30 feet five foot wide nope this is a saving throw scenario i need molly and caleb to make dexterity-- actually for this one it's just molly and the horse because it doesn't quite get to caleb on that one yep okay so you take half damage there you go you take seven points of acid damage as it streaks across your body your horse does not make the saving throw your horse gets sprayed on the side and makes a horrible pained neighing sound as it falls to the ground its body now acidically burning away it's not surviving this this one right here is going to spray you as well molly another dexterity saving throw please 11 does not succeed you suffer 14 points of acid damage as another stream blasts into your back and shoulder burning through your flesh and the side of your face begins to pull away and smoke back here this one is going to shoot in a stream that hits beau caleb and the horse i need you to-- dex save yes your horse made it though that is 14 points of acid damage to both of you the horse takes seven it's hurt still surviving that's going to end their go it's now the horses' turn yeah this one's running yep and it's going to run off the battlefield there he's dead all righty that's going to end their go caleb and keg you guys are up on horseback that's a fairly good distance speed of 60 feet that'll get you up to we'll say up to there pretty much right to the edge of where that is there i'll say because a horse doesn't get any attack on-- and it would normally get an action i'll let the horse dash so that'll get you right up next to this one yeah just for the hell of it make an acrobatics check for me what could possibly go wrong so as the horse is galloping you watch-- you watch as keg gets up on top holding the reins (hoofbeats) pulls the warhammer out and then at the right moment just leaps off while pulling the battleaxe out doing a flip in the air landing and coming down with both weapons go ahead and make your attacks on the opposite side of it 17 hits yeah that hits so go ahead and roll both those damage six and 12 nice still have your bonus action yeah because you're dual wielding so you attack attack and then attack 15 still hits yep armor class of nine points of damage oof so as you come down both weapons (whack) clanging onto it you hear the armor crack from underneath and you watch as its light green blood begin to seep through the wounds you left as it turns around this weird clicking sucking sound out of its face you laugh-- --and slam it in the side of the face with your warhammer (screech) it pulls back and it's now bleeding out of its jaw as it looks pretty hurt it is yes 12 misses unfortunately (ping) the bolt streaks off-- actually it hits the side of keg's armor-- shearing off all right caleb you're up all righty all right so you are hasted there you're going to move as far as you can to nott there you go that finishes your turn top of the round beau you're up and hasted you step around the trunk of the tree you get three base attacks correct (singing) haste (hits) that hits all righty nice third strike yep that'll hit seven points of damage on that fantastic and you still have your bonus two more attacks (cheering) so you do get one more hit so roll damage for that 11 damage that's okay that'll do it you just spin around the adrenaline pumping through your veins from caleb's spell instilling you with unnatural speed you rush forward and just (hits) and just do the fastest full on combo you watch as she basically pummels this giant nine foot insect creature into submission it falls to the ground as you're just pummelling its face until it eventually collapses and sputters out the remaining breath before it stops moving fantastic you still have 75 feet of movement because you're hasted oh yeah you go around the tree and then tap it on the shoulder just to be a dick all right that finishes your turn beau all right molly you're up next all righty so move over and push into this space-- because it's an ally i'll let you move into the horse's space there that'll hit 14 points of damage nice that'll hit advantage is nice ooh no it's still alive (groans) that one hadn't taken any damage oh wait no oh sorry i was writing that down under the wrong one my apologies yes it is dead i was writing it under the wrong one so as you dart off behind the first two strikes you unleash carve it into two pieces you watch as the creature as it's turning around to hiss and rear back its pincers about to carve into your face you watch as the head just rolls off of its body and there behind you see molly standing there with the blades out okay you're going to-- right there okay that finishes your go molly nott you're up the inner range is what it's just out of your 30 range so mysteriously perfect all right so as the image of beau appears before just standing there quietly shifting holding its space you can use your movement to go behind and then hide if you want to all right so go ahead and roll a stealth check you teleport through campaigns you're somehow in campaign one all right that finishes nott's turn all right so it's now that guy's turn currently surrounded by beaus-- too many beaus it's going to go ahead and see if it can gather which one is the real threat rolls a natural 19 so even with its low intelligence it can discern the nature of which-- really puce it's going to go ahead and make a bite attack towards you beau that is going to be a 12 to hit yeah it just reaches out with its pincers you manage to go ahead and duck out of the side and slam your bo into it causing it to just completely miss you it rears back it does not regain its acid spray and that's its turn both horses just go running off the board into the fray or away from the fray all right that brings us to keg you can nine damage to that one seven points of damage the first one swings wide no impact the second one slams as a backhand into its armor causing it to crack using that opening you pull back with your battleaxe and jam it into the wound carving in deeper it's looking pretty hurt but it's still standing anything else you wanted to do in your turn you're going to hang back that's what happens when you get emmy award winners at the table you get that yeah that's about it you've peaked at this point we're done after this it's all downhill we'll work on it that ends your go keg caleb you're up as you finish your attacks you glance over your shoulder as you hear this sound you look in the distance you see caleb-- who at this point has been this dirty hobo in the background-- all of a sudden fire these three mystical arcane missiles that glow and arc off anime-missile style through the woods avoiding trees and all three slamming into the sides of this creature go ahead and roll damage ten total (multiple impacts) it sits there for a second after the impact leaving these large craters in the side of its chitinous armor where it's cracked and bits of liquid are spilling out of it it looks heavily wounded but it's still alive you're going to stay where you're put revealing her position that's all good that finishes caleb's go beau you're up that just hits 13 does not hit unfortunately no nothing is actually flanking it 18 hits 15 points of damage on the first hit beau how do you want to do this as you and keg are both there clamoring on two sides of it the image of yourself on the opposite end what do you want to do as you crowbar off a large part of its exterior insectoid armor skeleton it exposes this horrible yellowish sinewy muscle interior as all the striations are pulling off of the armor as it's exposed it tries to go in to protect itself but you're too quick and you zero in and plunge your fist into its body as it falls to the ground with a horrible sucking guttural slimy death and pull it out technically-- okay you can go ahead and make a medicine check no the shield was strapped onto one of the horses you're not sure but it looks dire sure if you want to go ahead and step up to the horse make a medicine check unless this horse gets some serious treatment it's done instantly mercy killed nott you do manage to catch up to the other horses they didn't go full sprint into infinity they slowed down and once they got a safe distance from the action-- you manage to recover two of them there's still your horse by the house you still have three horses you can go check go ahead and make a medicine check as you approach water closet looks not long for this world okay water closet is still technically holding onto life no water closet's final horrible moment is its riders cutting its tongue out correct it's possible as you guys begin to try and work out your arrangements and the horses unfortunately due to the heavy nature of your armor and the broad form and heavy body of keg it looks like you won't be able to fit keg and one other individual on a horse but there are other combinations that might work you and molly can do it yeah keg's about as dense as two of you unless i am mistaken-- i'm going to go ahead and check one element of this because it will-- the battle was pretty quick you still have probably another hour and a half two hours before sundown if you want to go ahead and take a shot at trying-- yeah new toys taliesin and i've wanted to have a setup like that since high school and now i can you've never encountered these creatures you don't have much of an understanding of their anatomy beyond the experience you had extracting the aspects from them which actually would give you a little better idea of their physicality in some places because you looked at their constitution and dexterity i'll say that you know that the tendons and some of the muscle sinew that they use in the inside of their body is very strong and very tight and can be used as cording it can be used for anything that would involve a very strong piece of cord or rope that could possibly be harvested it's a dangerous process you can certainly try i don't know you can certainly try it's trying to carefully remove a giant sac of natural acid from a creature's body you want to roll the dice all right well you have to pull it out you have to remove it you watch as they pull this pack out and beau reaching in pulls out this strange 12-sided construction it looks like it's some sort of an opaque crystal almost like a marble type of color it's grayish and it's undulating with some slight pulsing light like a faint heartbeat with these golden handles affixed to it as she pulls it out and begins to focus on it there's this moment of distant meditation before she comes back with a breath and places it back in it's a strange sight do you have a blade to harvest super bright right now i will say because of your understanding of its body from extracting the aspects of it do you wish to utilize nature or medicine for this roll giving you the choice go ahead and make your check just a straight check skill check with medicine bonus whatever that may be you've seen beau be pretty precise in combat and pinpointing the weak elements of an opponent's body this is almost poetry the surgical precision in which beauregard takes the dagger and cuts pulls rips pulls and lifts tucks finds cuts removes and within a matter of about a minute a minute and a half there is a sac about the size of a basketball-- the ends have been tied off and feels like a water balloon make a dexterity check just a straight dexterity check that's good you do not just puncture a balloon while looking directly at it you manage to find one of the areas that taper within this organ whatever it is that was removed and manage to siphon it off in a way where you can fill the rest of your vials however many empty vials you have yeah you have three vials of acid now it's more of a tossed weapon or used to dissolve things you guys have taken a short time-- it's taken about half an hour or so for you to go through this process of extracting that and carefully filling these vials and discussing amongst yourselves who would get what you have about an hour until dusk hits about an hour until dusk yes about here is where the forest begins and that is where you began your confrontation you're right on the edge of the forest make an athletics check yes like a monkey that was raised in the jungle you watch beauregard leap from branch to bough effortlessly diving through this forest the afterglow of haste you make it up into the canopy make a perception check even at the tallest tree most around you all you can see are other trees of varying heights looking in the northeast direction beyond where you just came from you can see the house you can see bits of natural rock that maybe had either been left by some long-ago volcanic detonation in the distance or pushed up through the ground by tectonic movement you're not sure you see elements of stone that have broken through bits of the grass and open fields part of the natural fields here you haven't actually traveled this far north so it's unfamiliar topography to you-- you've only heard about it-- but it's interesting to see that the further north you get the more rocky the terrain seems to get in the direction you're traveling you do see far in the distance what could possibly be the road that you're getting to but it's a ways off to get to that direction you guys continue for the next hour or so skirting along the forest you guys gather some kindling get back to your three horses and your comparatively uncomfortable riding arrangement and continue on for another hour on the outside of the forest before the sun does eventually vanish the graying sky is getting darker and darker the faint bits of orange that poke through-- it's not a beautiful sunset you only catch the faint hues that manage to push through the gloom but the sky grows dark enough to the point where you think you should set up camp are you setting up camp at the edge of the forest on the inside of the forest on the outside of the forest what's your preference okay you guys set up camp who's keeping first watch you guys want to both individually roll perception or one aid the other with the help action go for it plus all righty as everyone's settling in begins to find their initial portions of rest you guys have your small fire there on the edge molly you glance off deeper into the forest and your eyes even at this distance catch a faint glimmer of matching flame you see a faint bit of firelight sparkling about 200 feet deeper into the forest it is dark yeah it's probably pushing 1000 1030 owls are nocturnal yes you would know that okay you don't have your long rests yet so don't mark that yet okay so as frumpkin begins to crawl through the forest in the direction of the fire we're going to go ahead and take a break yeah it's almost nine o'clock so we're going to take a break so we'll be back here in a few minutes thank you for coming along with us for this bit so far we'll be back to continue from where we left off there we do have our first giveaway at our first break in the new studio (cheers) critical role i did like twice all righty break time guys let's go [break] one two three fuck you as frumpkin begins-- [owl hooting] yeah we're in a forest at night guys frumpkin makes his way through the dark tree bottoms eventually coming upon-- actually this would be a more creepy setting for this i think that's better frumpkin slowly comes upon the warmth of this distant fire closer and closer until coming around the corner seeing a small fire heating a cauldron of some kind some metal bowl a bit of steam is rising off of whatever liquid is in the interior you see an elderly woman in darker tattered clothing that drapes off of the body hunched but tall very tall like six and a half feet tall at a hunch make a perception check for frumpkin please at this distance with disadvantage yes the skin of this woman is a faint gray color almost a gray-blue tint the hair is this matted mess of tangled white and gray that is pulled back and tied behind the head where it cascades over the shoulders the ears are long and pointed out to the sides a bit the nose is wide and pressed up into the face she is going back and forth from this little hovel that's on the opposite side that's built between two trees a large thick one and another that seems to have fallen and come to rest at an angle next to it in that small cranny between the two trees you can see this little hut built of thatch and sticks and rope to construct this little home it's almost like an arch that's holding it up near the ground of this cauldron you see a child of some kind that is sitting on the ground holding knees to its chest it looks to be a boy yes at the moment no it looks like she is going to and from this little homestead and putting things into this cauldron okay you watch now as the woman takes a small clay cup and dips it into this cauldron and pulls out this steaming mass of liquid that she's contained within it turns to the child walks over and kneels down beside places the long fingers along the shoulder and hands the cup to the child the child takes it looking at her and slowly sips from it burns the mouth a little bit beauregard you're leading up so not stealthing roll a stealth check beau who else is following beau stealth check from you nope a short rest-- you didn't call it out i will allow a short rest before you guys went to bed it's fine i'll allow it the two of you have branched off and are stealthing you think what are you doing caleb okay and what's your stealth check okay what are you doing keg you have disadvantage however in your armor the anti-wheaton has been found you can never touch wil wheaton or you guys will cancel each other out like the bad guy in time cop oh my god strangely the stealthiest of all of you is the dwarf in plate armor exactly all right molly you're staying 30 feet back you all slowly begin to approach this fire seeing the shapes and the figures described by caleb previously beau you step forward and your foot catches an under root and stumble for a moment you hear the scrambling of her arms across the bottom of the forest floor the moving and shifting of leaves and branches the old woman looks up in that direction and looks back at you immediately making eye contact with you about 30 feet away her arms immediately jump up in your direction as she begins to shout you you will not take any more of us i will sooner die make a wisdom saving throw yes you feel some sort of magical force suddenly penetrate your mind and this sparkle of colors begin to spray in front of your face that completely distract you and obscure your vision momentarily but you blink out of it and find the effect drift off of your brain the old woman goes (panting) and reaches down and puts herself in front of the boy between you and the child make a persuasion check her immediate tension drops slightly she's still maintaining a very defensive position in front of the child one hand is still up but it seems that she's pulled back a bit from the aggressive stance she was previously in as she lifts her face a bit you can see a bit more of her expression in the light as the hair pulls away as she lifts her chin you can see that the face is humanoid but with a wider nose the skin is grayish almost a blue tint with bits of a soft fur it takes you a second to recognize where you've seen these features before this appears to be the same type of race that pumat sol is it is a firbolg you can see there is a series of necklaces that looks to be bones and rocks and stones that have been polished that dangle around her neck as adornments and trinkets a few bird skulls hanging on it as well the child also you see is a young firbolg as well knees tucked against his chest you can see that the child looks scraped up and bruised and appears to have been injured not my son but we have lost a few yes looks past you for a second to molly who is not being stealthy either how many are you very well okay i apologize i've been on edge for a number of days you seem to know these people or have heard of them at least i'm sorry i am jumnda i'm a healer in my aged years for the guiatao clan we are small in number and now yet smaller still guiatao g-u-i-a-t-a-o this little one is umbo he is awake now which is good fortune i've been trying to bring him back to health for a couple of days yes he is under my care now the woman jumnda looks around for second and takes a deep breath three days back the clan was in celebration for the coming of age for young duma roasted boar was prepared and the twenty of us were dancing around the fire when the murderers came slew toffah and wolya with their arrows as they danced together others fought fennis died protecting me and i managed to grab ombo here as he had been beaten within an inch of his life to unconsciousness we fled but i watched as they grabbed others in nets pulling them away as they screamed and yet made no noise you know exactly who and what she's talking about the methods are very familiar when they left i returned to nurse those i could back to health nila by some luck was off when the attack happened she returned to find her love and child taken they were lucky had you been awake you might have had the urge or instinct to defend them well you're as brave as nila she was i don't know where she is or if she has fared well-- if they've found her i think she overestimates her capability her son was dua you may 15 sam taliesin and well if we indeed have an enemy in common you are welcome to stay with us and she glances across you i can perhaps maybe tend to some of your wounds we have tea that's ready that may help you in your journey ahead i'm afraid that is beyond my capability well if there are more of you they are welcome as well i do not know if i have enough tea for everyone if there is more but-- no i see that you have encountered some of the ankheg variety you gather over to their space it's a nice lived-in space you get the sense this is the home for this medicine woman who doesn't live directly with the rest of the village she inspects your wounds has some balms and natural remedies to help prevent infection the tea while it is not necessarily delicious by any means-- it is very herbal and medicinal-- it does fill you with a sense of rest and relief and what restlessness you may have been struggling with through a night's rest is absolved marisha and as you guys manage to say here for the evening you get the benefits of a long rest you come to consciousness now in the morning day which is a little more peaceful you awaken over by the fire the little boy ombo is sitting there currently with these two small wooden pikes that are jammed into the side and some squirrel-like critters that are hanging on them that are put towards the fire cooking as you awaken ombo turns and smiles doesn't say anything but looks over and inspects them and then brings them back and hands them out to you you don't see her at the moment but you do hear a bit of rustling in the actual little hovel in the tree archway you can you notice that the horses have actually been brought closer they've been hitched together to one of the local stumps to the circle here it seems that in your rest your very deep rest through the evening a lot of things have been tended to and taken care of in your presence as part of your long rest and the tea which you took in the evening you do have advantage on perception checks for the next eight hours okay he freezes on the arrival he seems to smile again looking up at you looking up at frumpkin stays frozen in place at which point the doorway opens from the hut and jumna emerges with a small pouch of some kind steps up to the rest of you i see you have awoken i know you'll be on your way shortly but maybe this can help she pulls back the top of the leather pack and reaches in and pulls out a cluster of moss that has been dried and holds it out to whoever's closest or wishes to take it should you find yourself in a wounded state this should help you with some rapid recovery of the wounds it acts as a greater healing potion but it takes a minute to administer so it's a non-combat scenario no it is crumbled and then ingested you can also put some in the actual wounds if you like but it is meant for ingestion just north is what i know north northeast if you find her and whatever state you find her if it's not a good state will you promise me to at least bring her back so we can give her a proper burial that's all i can ask anyway i thank you ombo thanks you and-- no not at all he does have a giant owl on his shoulder and is currently preoccupied with the owl ooh make a sleight of hand check eight okay it happens but-- the trick is very visible what you did the kid still seems amused smiles frumpkin ruffles his feathers looks a bit spooked thank you for hopefully doing some good in a very dark world uh that does not ring a bell i apologize i do not as you guys gather your things get the horses ready ombo approaches and gives a little wave you watch as jumma approaches from behind and rests her hand on his shoulder looks up to you and says please be safe charming adjacent as you vanish into the treeline ombo the child seems transfixed by the owl's behavior before disappearing behind the trees and you guys find your way back to the open fields of the northern marrow valley so now back on horseback what pace are you traveling at are you still going at a fast pace all right are you going at a normal pace or a fast pace sure all right it is absurd there are sketches across the spectrum of silly-faced interpretations and caricatures of the people you've met of each of you there are little notes to the traveler throughout you see people that you've liked in the past looking beautiful with tiny bodies you see people who you've hated in the past getting stepped on by a poop monster it's childish in all the delightful ways that you'd expect from jester's capability there are notes (pause) i will say laura is not here to specify necessarily that there are passages in common to the traveler what languages do you know and there are a number of passages in a language you don't understand meatier passages longer ones so you carry on at a pretty good pace and you're traveling rather swiftly though traveling at this speed it's harder to perceive things at a distance thankfully this renewed vigor from the tea that you had for the evening may help you in that endeavor as well so who is keeping watch on the roads ahead of you all right go ahead and make a perception check with advantage and minus five to whatever you-- correct okay then for the next eight hours or so you guys continue on the trek on the outskirts of the crispvale thicket eventually coming to meet up with the glory run road that heads northward to the direction of nogvurot you can see there's a road sign that specifically points up to nogvurot southward to the crossroads following the map and the path you've charted out in your experience as well you travel for quite a ways along glory run and then just head straight north towards the quannah breach so you'll be going off into just grassland and scrubland at a certain point essentially about then eight hours hit you have another hour or so before the sun begins to go down you can continue to push for another hour if you'd like to and all take constitution saving throws it's up to you you can do the one more hour or you can stop and set an early camp and get another evening's rest but you do not spot anything along the way it's a beautiful open field you probably have maybe two days' more travel before you get there no you travel for another hour of additional movement which will get you probably another six miles ahead then we'll see if you get a point of exhaustion you push for the ninth hour i need you all to make constitution saving throws please caleb you take a point of exhaustion the rest of you do not on ability checks that's all as the sky grows dark the still gray clouds that have taken the sky overhead the temperature is dropping significantly it looks like it's going to be a particularly cold night do you wish to continue pushing on make a perception check you've push now past hour nine so you cannot have advantage nine best you can find looking around there are a few small boulders or pieces of natural rock formations that have pushed up out of the local hills as you are moving through this more hilly area of the northern valley but there's no alcoves or caves that you're catching a vision of that would give you safe and out of the public eye there's only one way to find out you can travel for another hour okay make a perception check it's the owl technically not him at this distance it looks like it's straight moving rolling hills and bursts of stone first watch is you two do you wish to combine your perception checks for this watch or take them individually roll individually first watch manages to go by you both keep a very sharp eye out in the distance nothing seems to catch your attention though the night is getting quite cold towards the end of your watch snowfall begins to slowly descend upon the northern valley all right so molly and beau taking the second watch would you mind deciding who's making perception checks please taliesin want to both go for it marisha yeah okay as you guys go to bed the both of you keep an eye out for the rest of the evening for the rest of your watch at least and seemingly uneventful yeah the rest of your watch goes uneventful leaving to caleb the final watch all right make a perception check actually you and frumpkin can both make separate ones i'll let you do that i can pull those up pretty quick all right so that would be a plus one that rely on hearing or sight so you have advantage on it though because the owl does have keen hearing and sight thirteen okay looks like this watch is uneventful as well you guys had a clean night they all seem pretty asleep (hooting) your watch comes to a close just as the morning light begins to crest into the sky there's a mild break in the clouds on the eastern horizon over the ashkeeper and the dunrock mountains you're still getting a mostly cloudy sky but there are occasional bits of morning light faint light blues and yellows and soft white the snowfall that has come throughout the evening and packed up the very chilly cold night is beginning to faintly thaw but it is still a very cold morning as you all begin to come to consciousness and gather your things the clouds close once more and you look off towards the northeast side of the valley and you can see another darkened cloud coming with more snow and a less forgiving turn of weather although it's a ways off you can see it this far away you pick up your things horses at the ready do you continue your journey anything you want to do before you head off okay you have to set two horses side by side and use your staff there to give you pull ups there's not any trees here but you manage to pull it together on the road while you're-- you're just chuck norris-ing it between the two horses (galloping noises) (schwarzenegger voice) always pulling up always pushing on at what pace i imagine continuing at your hurried pace pushing on for the remainder of this day who is keeping watch go ahead and roll perception for me please yes minus five because you're traveling at fast pace still an 18 that's good about three or so hours into your journey molly you look up ahead and you can see a cluster of horses and a couple of carts heading your direction heading southward you're not quite there yet but you're getting close to where the direction you should continue on breaks off of glory run but you're still on the road you do see a small caravan making their way southward in your direction okay you guys move off to the side make a perception check glancing off as you approach you begin to make out details you do not recognize this troupe and the cart seems like there are tarps and cloths laid over large bundles they are obscured from view specifically so the contents cannot be seen which is not what you're looking for they don't want anyone to see what's under the tarp which is not the usual operation that you've seen the folks that travel southward they're dressed like normal traveling merchants not of a wealthy regard but those who probably bring common supplies things from the northern side bringing them southward it looks like they have supplied up for a trade run and they're heading southward as they ride past you guys to the right side they give a nod the next rider gives a nod with the perception roll you made it's hard to see because they've covered it specifically you can see underneath edges and pieces that are pushing out and the shape in places it looks like they're bringing farming supplies it looks like they're bringing possibly grains and foods it looks like things that would be easy pickings they're not the kind of people that can defend it so it's maintain mystery and keep pushing okay you continue on on this next leg of your journey we're riding on your perception roll off the road your natural 20 i'll let that stand for a bit the pace that you've been keeping on this without being kept by your cart has gained you quite a bit of ground and about another two hours or so into this afternoon your eyes catch another cluster of carts facing the same direction you are you may it takes you a moment of getting close and you're about i'd say a quarter mile back from this troupe you can see the familiar two larger carts one smaller it stinks of familiarity to you they're moving yeah it's mid-afternoon at this time you've been traveling since shortly after daybreak so it's three o'clock in the afternoon you have another hour or so before you hit your eight hour mark and your horses start tiring and you start tiring you're a couple days' travel or so from it at this pace yes it is i'm going to have to ask you keg to make a wisdom saving throw please that is not a success you feel strangely though it is out of character for your intent magically compelled to offer up a fair amount of information that would seem useful in the coming scenario about these individuals as much as would seem useful for this yes interpret that as you feel necessary you do know that he walks with this nasty-looking glaive it's a polearm with a large hooked blade at the end of it that he uses as both a symbol of station and a very dangerous weapon if need be gives him reach gives him range you're pretty sure there's a sorcerer you're pretty sure there's a druid you don't know a lot about magic stuff but you know one of them seems to be more nature-based and the other seems to throw spells but is cock-sure and charismatic the half-elf is a very short pointed pixie cut that is ashy blonde the spell comes to a close now because you have fulfilled the suggestion okay frumpkin takes off and begins to coast at a fair enough distance to keep an eye down make a perception check for frumpkin with advantage yeah he's an owl still owl has keen sight and hearing frumpkin getting a nice view from this distance makes out that there are three carts there is a figure at each cart the two larger ones have two horses at each front the third one has one horse there is a rider on each of the horses or at least there is a rider on the smaller horse and there are two that are sitting at the front of the carts that are currently holding onto the reins of the other two you do see sitting next to the individual at the reins at the front a very thick muscular man bald with tattoos across the back of his head-- with the glaive resting at the side staring ahead everyone else seems to have hoods up and are trying to keep their image obfuscated lorenzo he has a cloak on and stuff but right now he has the hood back you really don't see anybody catching their attention he seems to be enjoying the air across his hairless head you see seven figures as far as you know most of that process happens once they take them back because usually it's a grab and run type scenario but they do usually have them manacled hogtied manacle style and gagged about two days yeah two days at your pace probably three days at theirs all right (laughter) it was going to happen eventually about a few more hours sundown hits we'll say for the purposes of the narrative here they pull off to the side of the road and begin to set up camp keeping an eye on this in the distance you watch them keeping far enough away making sure you're not in eyeshot of them as part of that i will say two of you helm a stealth check to see whether or not they see you on the road behind them well it lasts for a day all right you take your fragment of possibility so go ahead and roll it's afterward you can roll it and then choose to it's like a luck point all right you guys stay back and watch as they pull off and make camp with that as the cover of ever-encroaching night becomes your ally you begin to arc around on the opposite end of the road going behind one of the larger hill grades which manages to hide your horses as you speed up and take off ahead to do this it's going to cost you an hour of pushing past so everyone make your constitution saving throws please okay all right so beau and caleb you both take a point of exhaustion so you're going to have disadvantage on ability checks all righty so pushing forward on this you come to a point-- how far ahead of the road of them do you want to set up your ambush 60-foot maybe right so who's taking a look for a good ambushing point so roll for disadvantage because it is night even though you have night vision it's only a short distance correct all right you find a place-- (laughter) three carts two larger ones and one smaller all you saw was just goods in the back you haven't inspected them for weak points you're not the brightest bulb in the shed necessarily when it comes to these things they're cages they're made mostly of metal and they seem to hold they got locks keeping an eye on the area as you're having this conversation you glance around and there's an area not too far ahead that you can just see a little bit of the moonlight breaking through the clouds the snow has not quite arrived yet but you can see there are these two small hills that flank the sides of the road not far ahead where you can see there are some boulders that protrude it looks like there is a tree stunk-- stunk-- tree stump and an old rotted tree that's sitting on another one it's not a very big tree if it were to fall it would just hit the side of the hill and be on the side of the road no they're not very high they're maybe seven ten feet tall at the highest and it looks like there's been some erosion on the sides where they've just slipped on certain edges okay both of you make a dexterity check well this would technically be a grapple so it would be athletics for you-- --and then it would be athletics or acrobatics for you completely pulled out of your grasp they can't see them from what you know from what keg told you they're magically cloaked until you get there no from what your experience would be they would probably go to the hideout to their little homestead deeper into the savalierwood they would drop off their payload and celebrate probably for an evening of revelry and then come back the next day to begin the process of preparing them for delivery which involves breaking them presumably there are also people that would-- --would help them they have allies i mean they're working for one of the tribe families so yeah to set the alarm okay i'm going to pull out the map of the location so you guys can plan out positioning well the location of hills if you were to use that one i have multiple-- i have multiple maps prepared depending on where things happen i have multiple maps with different scenarios this is the scenario that you've found marisha and this is the path heading in a north direction these are the two hills this is the tree how would you like to set this up how do you want to do this i could see you probably do something like that sure you have a little bit of time so where are you going to fluff the bushes up here like what are you doing point it out to me (laughs) all righty you can try you can certainly try make a strength check this would be athletics actually so make it athletics because this is you not just lifting it but also bringing it along you begin to drag it actually you watch as this burly dwarf woman with a five-o-clock shadow that is now coming into actual faint stubble grabs it-- --begins just dragging it through this big groove in the ground as you pull it over where do you want to put it and you have this tree here that tree is actually somewhat hollow not completely all the way through but there is an alcove in it where some of it has rotted out all right so nott i'll go ahead and mark you as-- this will be where you're hiding just as a note there i'm excited we've been gone for two weeks i'm like let's do this that tree is maybe 15 feet 20 feet actually that one would be 20 feet tall that you can do you can certainly try go ahead and roll an athletics check for this one just-- 15 okay so you're able to carve into it and use your knowledge of where to hit properly and where the strength should be applied you manage to cut a few wedges into it it begins to move slightly and you're like now's the time to stop okay so molly you're going here beau bush two here all right beau's going to be here and you're going to be behind the tree all righty that's the north side the leading cart yeah the carts are about that wide they'd be going through one at a time you have no idea i think it lasts for an hour or until-- yeah it ends for a target that attacks or casts a spell but it'll last for an hour concentration yes yes it does it's still you concentrating on the spell they both are you can only have one or the other it's like 500-- okay are you guys happy to pull the trigger on this okay then you have your placements you've set the scene the evening requires some rest if you're to prepare for this by the morrow so you set up a small camp here without light without fire you're setting up camp without fire for the evening or are you lighting a fire for warmth you set up the tent behind the hill you spoon for warmth you muster through an evening of uncomfortable but necessary closeness which it's a very cold night a faint bit of snowfall greets you in the morning not enough to coat the place in white yet it's these soft little flakes making their way down a ways up on the road a few miles out there is a front of gray heading your way it looks to be a wall of snowfall that probably is going to be coming about mid-day or so in your direction there's some mist in the distance you come to you shake it off you're a bit stiff from a night of not necessarily comfortable rest but a long rest is had you lose your exhaustion points as you take a moment caleb the bells go off you do if you want you would have to redo it again whoever wants to do it has to do it now okay you guys aren't treating it like a-- whippets from xhorhas this is great as you guys are in your places the first cart comes up all right as this one comes through you notice the person who's guiding it is your friend protto continues to push it along and they separate as they see the coming pinch of the road behind that you see the central one this has the one figure that you don't recognize who's driving the cart and walking alongside it is lorenzo this one begins to continue forward and this pushes forward as well on the sides of this there is the half-orc druid that's dwelma and ruzza who's the half-elf in the back is the small singular cart that's being ridden by one figure and there helming the end is juam the human rage-filled warrior the one that you've had the better experience with correct pushing forward until about there are you doing this roll a strength check the tree immediately falls forward off the side snapping at where it was left actually all of these tree pieces were sent by our friends at steamforge as gifts i was like i get to use these at some point and you guys are using them tonight falling and snapping right at the front half of the cart breaking through i'm going to give protto an attempt to try and dodge out of the way he succeeds with a dexterity saving throw because he's quite dexterous he jumps back into the front of the cart and you watch his lower half vanish as he stops there you don't know actually that's a valid point i'm going to have you guys all roll stealth checks yeah i'll say in advance all of you are pretty stealthy except for you as the tree falls onto the ground all the horses suddenly rear up and you've actually broken where the horses are attached to that cart the axel snaps at which point the carts back up at this point there's a shout in the back and you hear protto go like boss what is-- at which point you're doing what first for the sake of order here because we are engaging in a series of aggressive actions let's all roll initiative please first order of business here for initiative i'm going to sit down for this one real fast write it down 25 to 20 anybody beau and nott up first 20 to 15 14 you said caleb that brings us to-- what'd you get as the tree snaps and hits he shouts back immediately the group looks out at all sides taking this as a means of assault lorenzo glancing over and directly locking eyes with you keg there's a look of taken aback and surprised before any reaction happens though you do get your action you are casting slow you said how many can you target with this up to six that'll be quite a lot you can get all of these guys if you want to well let's see because it's (counting) 40 yeah this whole section here there's six people there there's the one who's helming this horse the one who's helming these horses the back of the cart and then those four for the two thugs that are on the horses two and a three natural two and a three they are both slowed ruzza does not succeed ruzza is slowed the druid does save the barbarian-- the barbarian does not save and lorenzo-- that is a 17 saves this all happens combat has begun starting at the top of the combat order beau you're up first oh got you i put them in the wrong order okay that's your action (splashing) he looks at it sees you dart by okay he can't make an attack of opportunity on you this big one there you dart in and as soon as your vision comes through you come face-to-face with a metal cage right there in front of you for you who can watch the back half of nott is still visible the entire cart is filled with cages front to back the cages are blanketed by some sort of illusion correct but just the front half it looks like nott vanishes partway through like you've stepped through part of a doorway on the inside you see a very sweaty human man who is gagged and leaned up against the cage like (whines) he looks up towards you that's all you've got you can just get to the druid at 40 feet (counting) you do have to get down there make an acrobatics check you manage to land without losing your footing you get right up to the druid there that is that is a natural 15 plus three is 18 go for it 20 total okay all righty 15 what's the dc okay going into defensive mode that finishes beau's go all right it's now ruzza's turn who is slowed it doesn't go off until the next turn ruzza's going to step back looking towards lorenzo and goes boss this is so weird it's weird to hear this slowed-down deeper voice coming out of this female half-elf but nevertheless here we are as she steps away and begins-- she does give a bit of bardic inspiration to lorenzo because she's technically not a sorcerer that's as much as you know oh that's right so they're not doing that still saying that phrase but not in an inspirational way is going to cast glancing over in your direction as the source of it once you cast the spell you reveal yourself buddy that's how it works unfortunately this is going to be-- yeah let's do some hypnotic pattern why not he begins (slow incantation) and slowly backs to here getting up on the hill climbing to get some better visual perspective over the battlefield that's going to end ruzza's turn molly you're up you can get right there that's 30 feet there 30 feet flanking to there you mean yeah you can do that yeah go for it you do i assume you had your rites prepared seven points of damage all righty that hits roll damage 12 points of damage you're carving through she's not slowed by the impact of the spell and taking these wounds hurting her quite a bit she's not horribly maimed but is starting to show some wear from the strikes that she's suffered that ends your turn that brings us to lorenzo hmm lorenzo watching you and your friends shouts out in your direction and goes-- well he's not slowed keg i don't know what you're trying here but i think the line's been drawn he's going to step over here pushing through the horses leaping over in the direction of where nott is there and is going to shout out hey move aside and holds his hand out in front of him that's going to end his turn protto is currently like freaking out by this sees this all happening narrowingly missed the tree slamming into him goes and pulls out his bow and nocks an arrow into it and is going to take a shot let's see the one he saw dart that way's going to be molly he's going to fire at molly what's the range on it yeah is it a 30 or 60 foot range for your blood curse of the eyeless 60 feet yeah that'll do it amplified so disadvantage on-- he gets two strikes first one with disadvantage is going to be 16 to hit what's your armor class 15 so that hits because you're adjacent to an ally of his he gets sneak attack bonus on that that's going to put him-- to be fair it's a shitty sneak attack roll that's a total of 14 points of piercing damage from the first arrow into your shoulder the other one is going to be-- he did yeah 16 on this one because it was an 11 and a ten he rolled and it's plus six on his attacks okay the other one just deals six points of piercing damage he's going to jump off and move over here up onto the top to get a good view since he's a ranged guy with his arrows he's keeping down and getting ready for that that's going to go ahead and-- that was his action surge and everything so he's done next up bear with me guys there is a lot going on right here caleb your turn yeah you had the ambush round technically because it was the trigger slow and then everything happened at once the tree triggered the ambush seeing you so the only one who got a round off was you for the spell okay go for it roll for attacks on that minus two to their armor class goes wide 17 hits that would hit okay so two hits it's 4d6 not a bad opening round yes to maintain they still have to make a concentration check to see if they can finish with their casting yeah that is a 13 plus two that is a 15 so yeah they're fine is that the end of your turn caleb staying where you are okay you go prone caleb goes prone okay now it's the thugs' turn they are slowed so they can't move too far this one is going to move back that's as far as he can move and he's going to pull out his crossbow and he gets one shot because of the slow spell he's going to take it towards you caleb with disadvantage because you're so far away the bolt goes wide this guy here is also slowed he's going to attempt to back away they do not he's going to attempt to use the edge of the tree for some cover as he takes a shot at beau yep and that is going to be a 13 again now it is juam's turn who is slowed and right here next to caleb is going to take a strike at you not technically-- only gets one attack so the first one would've been 12 oh you did that's right you do not i'll have to double check that's the two thugs' turns that's juam's turn keg you're up no it makes sense we've all done it to some degree which the armor that lorenzo is wearing-- you've seen it before it's studded leather but it's straps and hooks the theme of it resembles very much elements of his profession or at least reminding you what he does so the oil weirdly does make it strangely erotic it's your turn you have 25 feet of movement so that'll only get you about five squares of movement are you running towards the action or away from it make an acrobatics check to leap down okay so you lose the last five feet of movement that's your movement there your javelin has a pretty decent range does it have the ranges next to it in the app that's okay i have it here the javelin-- it's 30 and 120 feet so it can go 30 feet without disadvantage and 120 feet with disadvantage so you might as well protto is right up there on the hill getting his arrows nocked completely passes over no you can't that's where you are you can take another javelin attack because you have three javelins you get one more swing at him both javelins miss you're shaken by this experience it's now dwelma's turn dwelma is going to cast dispel magic not unless you have the war caster-- mage slayer i mean the magical effect which is the slow effect if it's any spell third level or lower the target ends so slow fades not from being stunned she couldn't marisha oh well cool feels really good about failing it twice now matt sorry she's going to move to this side actually and is going to run so you both get attacks of opportunity on her 12 is not going to hit not with barkskin sorry actually no she doesn't have barkskin because of the ambush she hasn't had time to cast it so it's an ac of 11 you do hit she is stuck there no she circled around it's when she leaves the range so she gets stuck there that ends her turn now lorenzo's turn's going to trigger i think it just misses you it's right there as a cone of cold bursts forth from-- (whooshing) lorenzo smiles as his friends have come out of the way and this burst of freezing cold arcane energy swirls in front of him flash-freezing everything in front including the cart actually nott has to make a reflex save beau and molly have to make-- sorry dexterity save oh that's a relic nice go for it oh buddy all right okay what did you roll 19 okay nott you take 41 points of cold damage okay so you use your reaction to halve that molly you take-- that would be 20 points of cold damage beau you take 20 points of cold damage yep as it triggers and the frost finishes off in the space there lorenzo grinning looks over his shoulder back at keg and goes like am i going to have to make a lesson here that brings us to the top of the round nott you're up go for it make your lockpick check dex and proficiency so it would be seven yeah it's not enough you spend a moment and the lock is not going these are pretty intense cages and you look over there and lorenzo's standing there with the glaive you move through a very small gap they're pushed up against each other make a strength check to see if you can push through you might not be able to you can't push through it the cages are too close the small gap there you try to muscle it but there are two to three people in each cage and you can't push though you could try you're partially obscured lorenzo's eyeing in that direction okay make a stealth check you appear within your mind to have vanished from the current sight all righty that brings us to finishing nott beau your turn go for it oh snap ten damage oof dwelma's looking rough yeah although technically when the slow spell finished a hypnotic pattern may have gone off yeah that would have gone off so make your wisdom saving throw if you don't mind yes glancing around the area it looks like the people that were right on the outer edge of the cages are frozen the guy who's near you he's fine they blocked the impact there it was your latter half that was sticking out that got blasted 22 all right so the hypnotic pattern does not affect you well done she goes down like unconscious and bleeding out yeah if you want to you could you are okay make an acrobatics check you get over the horses where are you going to stand on the cart there's not a lot of room here to stand to fight and you'd have to get over-- i'll say you can get back right here sure why not so you're on the horse yeah yes you are that ends your turn that brings us to ruzza ruzza who watched the druid go down sees you over there being really defensive and looks around he's going to attempt to cast hold person at level three i need mollymauk and beau to make wisdom saving throws please completely resists it shit back up around the tree trunk there that ends her turn molly you're up thank you for sticking with us i know this is going late but i want to see how this turns out we've been gone for two weeks consider it a bonus episode it's possible you can climb over the cart if you want to it's up to you okay make an acrobatics check to try and get over the cart without issue ten you lose some movement but you still have enough to get right there that's as close as you get lorenzo's technically supposed to be in that space no you do not take your damage nice ten does not hit that first strike carves past you see blood spatter across the edge of the hillside lorenzo's like all right i see what you're doing one for one slams the glaive onto the ground that ends your turn molly it is lorenzo's turn lorenzo's going to go ahead and make two glaive attacks against you you're still level five first hit you guys watch as molly falls back unconscious lorenzo looks confused his vision still obscured the blindness yeah actually you're not flanking because you're at an angle you're on the horse so no the first strike slams down into molly's chest the blade actually sinking about seven inches into the chest blood spatters out of your mouth you can use your reaction to make an attack as sentinel you can yes 14 does not hit so it misses there lorenzo looks back over towards keg looks up at you beau and says an example it is molly in the brief moments of consciousness what do you want to be your last words no this is done molly you have a brief moment as the consciousness and life leaves you what are your last words as it slams into his face respect and then twists the blade the life leaves molly it's now protto's turn protto is going to take a single shot because he used his action surge now that he's gotten two javelin tossed he's going to fire at you seeing that you're in the proximity that's a natural two misses off your armor you're not even paying attention you're looking over at this and you feel it deflect no impact caleb your turn okay the thugs take their turn both of them are going to-- they're both going to back up and take two crossbow shots at beau you have your patient defense on that is still a 16 and a 17 they rolled that's right first one you deflect out of the air no she already used her reaction and the other one is-- you use your reaction to do it but it rolled a 15 to hit you watching this happen hear it deflected off the other one you catch and drop still looking down at molly's not-moving body as lorenzo now grins back at you and says is it time for another or have you learned your lesson then another life it is all right that ends thugs' turn he does not see you (counting) you're the closest there the barbarian goes pulling in is going to use an action to move up into melee with you but that's their turn this is not looking good guys which brings us to keg keg you've seen these situations before what are you going to do can you reach who no with the tree there about there is as close as you can get you can use your action to move but you wouldn't be able to do anything else you can you move up over the log and it gets you there make a persuasion check okay that's your turn dwelma's bleeding out nott your turn he got hit once you hear keg shouting and mid-battle parleying okay you pour acid on the lock it's going to take a moment acid isn't an immediate thing if you're not going to splash it on somebody it has to eat through metal you would know that as an alchemist all right i think the signs are pointing in a direction what are you doing nott beau it's your turn you see nott run with just your movement right there beau you see keg rushing to parley what do you do okay he's going to make a dexterity saving throw i know he fails (flames erupting) roll a d6 damage he is on fire just d6 fire damage four points of fire damage there's now flames curling off of his body he's taking it roll for it (whoosh) he's not even looking at you he's looking at keg she has his attention 18 does hit okay there's a reflex for him to go ahead and take an attack of opportunity on you with his glaive and then he flickers and looks back to keg seeming more interested in what she has to say that ends your turn all right ruzza's going to walk up the moment she does anything what were you going to cast okay as you're watching her very carefully-- she's going to do it she's going to step up and cast cure wounds molly's dead cure wounds isn't going to affect him she reaches out and touches lorenzo and he heals up a bit she starts to try and pat the flames out a little bit and he shoos her off now it is lorenzo's turn because molly doesn't have a turn lorenzo's looking at you and says looks like we have an eye-for-an-eye scenario points off at dwelma who at this point has bled out we'll say yes she's bled out at this point you say you want to be an example huh sure puts his hand up flames still curling up and burning his body which roll another d6 puts his hand up with the glaive in the air and you watch as all the other thugs looking off pull back their crossbows to the side the barbarian in front of you caleb this woman whose face is twisted in absolute rage (panting snarling) puts the hammer down lorenzo says we're going to make an example of our old friend round up what you can you walk with me keg and leads you back over to where the rest of you are as the warrior steps back still burning takes and leads you here they begin to move forward and push the carts begin to push the log off of this to the side and the warrior woman grabs the front of the cart where the horses were and begins to drag it forward as it begins to pull away-- it's a flash freeze and then it goes away it's not like it keeps it there as this one pulls forward one of the thugs grabs the body of their druid and throws it over the top of the cart where she seems to vanish except for a leg dangling out the side of the illusion they go forward grabs your shoulder and pushes you down onto your knees do you do anything looks at the three of you the iron shepherds have a reputation and i expect you to tell everyone you come across what happened here today and what a mistake it is to turn against us pulls the glaive back slowly and leans into your ear and says that's a bit too quick i want you to live with the memory of what you did today and kicks you in the back and knocks you onto your face turns around finally pats out the flames we're moving on if i see any of your faces again-- (chuckles) well at least you'll be able to see your friend on the other side fuck me indeed and he turns and joins the rest of the caravan as it begins to pull back on the path leaving the four of you beaten bruised and glancing off at the lifeless bloodied body of mollymauk tealeaf and that's where we're going to leave tonight's episode (exhales) uh sorry no this is part of the game that was a terrible convergence of events it does wow i'm going to sit down well thank you guys for sticking with us this long i know it's been a late night our return after a week off and the drama
