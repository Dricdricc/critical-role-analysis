of critical role welcome back everybody last we left off the mighty nein had found their way south outside of the empire on the coast of the menagerie coast stolen a pirate ship apparently following a thread to pursue aspects of the mystery of fjord's background and the relationship to his mysterious patron followed a mostly charred map to an island known as urukaxl passing the dangerous reefs you came upon the mother ship to the ship that you had stolen known as the squalleater which was then you realized helmed by captain avantika who gave you the option of either working with her under her guise as essentially currently captives and maybe eventually crewmen of the ship or be killed and left in the harbor held down with rocks and die you took her up on the offer you also discovered that she seems to be as enthralled with this same entity as fjord is and has some sort of similar history with how this serpentine entity known as-- uk'otoa you remembered good job laura and uk'otoa once a creation of zehir the cloaked serpent god now banished since the calamity this entity then began to build its own following and the followers of zehir this old god this once creator grew jealous and sealed it away now avantika with your help is working to begin to release these seals bring it back and as such gain the blessings and boons of this entity you decided to go into the jungle with her on this mission alongside an adventurer a dungeoneer who had plotted out some of the path for you named jamedi you had made your way through avoiding hunting parties of lizard men being hunted by yuan-ti snake people you made your way towards a mostly stone-crafted village in the center of this island that surrounded one large old temple you snuck in masquerading as some of these snake people and mostly succeeded managed to sneak your way through part of the town gathering some attention you threw up some distracting illusions you quickly killed off a few of them that had begun to grow wise to your presence not being naturally wanted and in the midst of the commotion you raced up the steps of the temple managed to kick one of the sentries off the side found a way through the top and closed it off locking behind the very top of this five-sided pyramid now once inside you began to descend slowly down the curved stairs but in missing a trap that was present triggered it the stairs went smooth and the entire party slid down this slide goonies-style before impacting into the ground of one of the top chambers of the pyramid looking within the interior of this five-sided chamber you noticed amongst the two pillars to the side a raised platform where there was a fountain of some kind surrounded by three of these mostly humanoid but snake-scale-covered-in-places yuan-ti people and one with gray armored scaly skin mostly human body though tall and lanky and a head that was purely cobra-like the hood exposed as all of them turn to your direction as you impact with the stone and are made aware of your presence with that mighty nein i would like for you to roll initiative (exclamations) yes you will and that'll be your turn because literally-- it's not so much a stand-- you just slid down and hit the ground and you just take a moment to take in the scenario and then now we get to be-- no worries good call all righty 25 to 20 look at you did you roll initiative for yasha 20 to 15 16 for fjord 15 to ten all righty ten to five i believe that's all of us beginning now this round of combat beau you have the jump everyone is prone by the way you slid down the stairs on your ass and impacted with the stone floor of this chamber nott what would you like to-- sorry beau is-- sorry beau yeah these are-- yes these are the yuan-ti these three individuals that are mostly humanoid but bits of their skin are scaled their eyes are yellow you can see sharpened teeth this individual here is the one with the large hooded snake head that's still a bit taller than the rest and these long lanky arms gray skin they look very unhappy that you've stumbled into this chamber beau comes to her feet that's half your movement it's halved that almost all numbers in the game are rounded down so to 20 i don't know if you have enough room or enough distance to get over here you'd have to go over either way you're going to take some attacks of opportunity so it's up to you you jump onto your feet and leap up onto the top and you're now pincered from both at different angles what are you going to do okay go for it 15 hits it's nine damage that's a natural 18 plus zero it does make the save go for it 13 does hit they're not wearing much in armor they're here for ceremonial reasons eight points of damage to the other one so both been hit i mean they're not armored they have weapons on them these particular ones the purebloods you see here as they are called are not wearing heavy armor so they're not too difficult to hit all right go for it you got two more attacks then do it ten points of damage to the one on the left nice all righty you went whack whack manage to hit them both repeatedly in a row all attacks hit they're both taken aback by the impact and then spin to you immediately their tongues out they're definitely focused on your presence now now you're done yasha's go next all right yasha gets to her feet correct not right now that path is blocked unfortunately yeah currently yes the rage kicks in pulls out her magician's judge sword and-- certainly i mean she's flanked but she can yeah roll for the attack with advantage because you have her flanked 18 hits so damage on that one (music) nice jumps off of the side and with the momentum she leaps onto the platform she pulls her sword out arcs it past the already punched damaged yuan-ti in front reacts looks over the shoulder towards you as you go for your second attack same one 17 points of damage okay then on the same one right with the second strike-- the first one carves past it hisses at her yasha then spins the sword around and with one giant snap the head (plop) and the body falls off to the side of the ground and crumbles okay rage winks that finishes yasha's go that one is going to look towards you beau and in this soft pinched voice go why don't you just go sit down make a wisdom saving throw for me as this brief sparkle happens in your eyes you feel this wave of arcane influence begin to reach out towards your mind you blink it off and smile back the other one is going to moving off to this end attempt to pull out a scimitar and aim down to strike at an angle towards nott who's currently on the ground yeah she is she's within melee so she gets an attack that definitely hits nice yasha's seeing this one slink by and swing with the scimitar down towards nott who's trying to scramble away down on the ground yasha turns around and slams the blade into the back of her shoulder forcing her down however the scimitar is already arcing down towards nott with advantage because you are on the ground all right a 15 and a 16 i believe that's a total of 19 to hit the strike hits you for seven points of slashing damage three now the tall lanky gray one begins to take a step forward and slither around in this direction (slithering) 30 over the top down the legs as they bend seem to give in places they shouldn't with an unnatural slithery feel to even just the footsteps it's really creepy to watch it move as it spins around it's going to attempt to take a bite and scimitar attack both on beau with advantage because it's flanking with its own pureblood that'll be a 24 to hit bite attack so you take four points of piercing damage plus nine points of poison damage as part of its mind fang ability you're also going to take some psychic damage oh that's not good (nervous laughter) 22 points of psychic damage as the hood opens and the giant fangs extend and sink into the back of your shoulder the poison hits your system and your brain suddenly pulses with a sharpening pain the psychic energy courses through the entirety of your consciousness for a second your vision goes flash white and blurs you almost fall to one knee as the fangs pull out of the wound at that moment it's going to strike with its scimitar that's 23 to hit seven points of slashing damage all right that's going to end its turn all right that brings us to fjord's turn to which one okay go for it that hits 15 still hits no as it pulls back from beau and swings with its scimitar the head curves back and stares at you you can see against this dark gray scaly skin its very dull yellow-white eyes immediately trace onto you is that the end of your turn are you going to move or stay where you're at you have 15 more feet of movement (counting) 15 it's as far as you can get that finishes your go fjord nott you're up that definitely hits it's sneak attack because it's adjacent to beau plus the additional damage from a fire bolt it should be on your sheet there i think it's an additional 1d6 fire damage if i recall it hisses as the bolt hits it from the back of the head and you can see where it embedded itself partially into the skull it comes up at top and part of the bone's piercing up and the flames are still burning in the back it's trying to reach and pull it out of its own head all right that's your action it didn't go all the way through the brain it just hooks into it it did some serious damage still well you're still prone if you want to get up it's half your movement or you can crawl at half speed you crawl over here you can go there because you're still in melee with that one but you can attempt to hide from the other if you'd like it's advantage on melee attacks against you disadvantage on ranged attacks against you you crawl on the ground around the corner roll a stealth check yeah you always get advantage while you have that cloak on you believe maybe you've hidden from that one particular creature that finishes nott's go breaking the silence here beau after you've been struck by this terrible psychic pain in your face and the poison courses through your veins you look before you and the one yuan-ti pureblood in front of you you had already damaged is (snarling) and it's pulling this crooked dagger out of this sheath from the side suddenly in a flash out of nowhere behind you see blades go (wooshing) and you watch as avantika who was previously invisible still from the spell appears as she does three main strikes from behind that'll do it eviscerates it from behind (screeches) falls to the ground avantika is there in front of you and flicks both blades off some of the blood (splashing) across the stone on the ground don't worry i've got you and is going to use movement to move up this way actually she doesn't have enough movement to do that she can be right there and gets one more space there that ends avantika's go one more point thank you for the clarification on your math there sam jamedi's going to get up makes me sad good patience on that one jamedi's going to start taking the bow and huffing and running around the way to hide behind this pillar coming that way is going to attempt to fire a short bow at the one that's right next to yasha natural 19 very nice that is six points of damage to that yuan-ti and is going then continue to move-- actually no at that point he couldn't quite get that far he would have been right there trying to move behind but because he had to get up from prone lost half of his movement that ends his go that brings us to jester jester you stand up on the gray guy okay you release the spell and it has no effect it seems that the snakelike form that this creature has mutated into has gotten so far out of the realm of humanity to no longer be considered a person that's your action all right (hisses) towards you its fangs bared that ends your go jester caleb and caduceus you guys are up at the same time ooh all righty roll for attack that'll hit nice you are yes over here (counting) 25 as you rush by its snake head cranes around and extends out to bite towards the side of your shoulder and arm as you rush past if it's during your turn i believe you cannot because you only cast one spell-- it's different from combat spells versus casting spells during one turn i'll have to go back and look at that specifically but for the time being no because there's the one spell per round limitation during your turn at least that is going to be all together a 17 to hit with that the bite strikes out for you that is six points of piercing damage plus seven points of poison damage it's going to use its secondary mind fangs this round similar to beau your brain suddenly gets spiked with this burst of terrible wracking pain that emanates into every memory of your past life like your existence in one instant is just set on fire and pulled away oh that's not too bad that's 13 points of psychic damage to you that ends your turn then technically you would have gotten that far that's half-speed that ends your turn caduceus you're up stand up there you back in towards this cluster of weird mossy plant matter that's on the edge caduceus what are you doing buddy there you go take your eight points of healing okay that ends caduceus' turn beau you're up yasha's go is when you release okay 21 hits stunning strike on this one that is a 14 plus one 15 what's the dc resists it unfortunately there's a (impact) as you hit you realize as you're trying to do stunning strike you don't fully understand the physicality of it its body and organ placement is different from the usual other human-type creatures you've studied and so you're just unable to hit the right point in its body in your confusion and frustration of not being able to find the soft spot in its body your second strike goes and it manages to dodge out of the way no impact all right so then you go in patient defense to protect yourself got it that is now yasha's turn before yasha can begin the round caduceus okay so the next hit against it it has vulnerability correct all right-- what's yasha doing right there as yasha darts off the pureblood behind manages to swipe out with the scimitar has an attack of opportunity against her that is going to be a natural-- they're rolling really good 17 plus three 20 with that yasha suffers seven-- six on the d6 seven points of slashing damage reduced to three because she's raging then yasha shrugs off the impact rushes towards the large gray snake entity and go for it that is correct go ahead and roll damage on that one okay 16 points of damage it is vulnerable against that that is technically 32 points of damage from that strike how does yasha want to do this laura and as the blade impales it the creature grabs the blade with both hands and (hisses) as it's lifted up and begins cursing-- (clapping) hold on pay attention guys it's okay as the blade carves through the stomach of the gray snake man and is lifted off the ground (hissing) it begins to curse in abyssal as the blade begins to carve up its body until eventually its hissing turns into a low gurgle and then it just slides off the blade the parted half of it splitting into two sides onto the ground yes all right this one is going to seeing how everything is working out-- yeah does not have that ability so is instead going to go ahead and (counting) 30 then try and dash-- oh no that's true given that circumstance there's not much of an escape route for this one is going to instead leap down and attempt to assail nott not against that one you're not all right so attacks twice with the scimitar ooh natural 20 on that one and a-- no because when you hold your action you use your reaction to release it so you don't have a reaction sorry buddy that's a natural 20 on one scimitar hit and a 19 on the other to hit the first one that's eight plus one nine points of slashing damage on the first hit that's four slashing damage and the second one is going to be-- ooh that's not good two points of slashing damage now with all of its allies fallen around and seeing everyone else standing up its eyes are darting around looking like it's a caged animal (snarling and hissing) its scimitar in front of it it's swinging it wildly in the air and pointing it towards anything that comes near that's going to end their turn fjord you're up next make an intimidation check glaring at you doing that (hostile snarl) doesn't seem to be fazed unfortunately as it snarls at you you pull the blade a little closer to the face up against the chin (resigned snarl) and throws the scimitar to the side (cheering) i was surprised i was like okay that brings us effectively out of combat at this point you all take stock of your surroundings the one standing yuan-ti the bowls they were holding and pouring into this fountain clattered to the ground the one stands there before you with your blade held towards their neck as they're (snarling) well that would be more generally looking around you guys in this chamber based on the little bit of travel you've done from the very top of this temple this is the top chamber in the pyramid you're about partway down from where it is on the surface it continues down you imagine based on how large it is in size this is the highest part of the pyramid so far within this chamber there are clusters of these bits of mossy plant life that's growing in elements of the corners there is a fountain that sits atop the central platform in the center of the chamber the water itself is slowly trickling off the sides in small little grooves it looks to be brackish and green the staircase-- a few minutes pass-- revert to stairs so ascension is possible that's the most of what you can make out in the chamber the pillars appear to be more load-bearing and designed-- as you get a closer look make a perception check on this one interesting point the stonework and the construct of this entire temple is very old and very simple but you see a lot of intricate carvings and additional stone that's been added to the interior of the chamber that is all carved to represent snake creatures surmounting and a great snake god make a religion check a lot of the iconography in this chamber is directly based on zehir the cloaked serpent and is imbuing their power into the snake followers and giving them mutations you can see people going into this metamorphosis and transforming into a number of the larger snake entities you fought or have seen in the city below but all that carving is newer it's fresher it's been placed to cover the older stone of the temple and you get the sense that this temple was not constructed by these yuan-ti but has been since co-opted by them looking you over it was-- she's speaking in common now it was built to a false idol the eyes turn towards you looking up at your large goofy grin with that parts of their wounds begin to split open wider as you see bits of reddish-orange fungus begin to find its way out it looks like a sponge emerging from it she turns to you and goes are you to let me live make a persuasion check looks towards you looks towards caduceus goes i will not sully myself before the eyes of my god in a flash pulls a dagger from inside the sash attached to the side and-- spray cuts her own throat scattering across the front of you caduceus before the body plummets back onto the ground with a sick thud on the stonework and then bleeds out a small grin pulling across her sharpened teeth before her eyes roll back and she expires make a dexterity check the moment of shock hits you having not encountered someone take their life right in front of your eyes and that brief moment of pause is enough that when you go to try and collect your thoughts and cast the spell the spirit's already left the body i would say you go to cast the spell-- you begin to and then realize they've already expired those are some of the inscripted carvings that were placed over the existing stonework of the chamber okay make an investigation check as you're searching the fountain that's not too bad stepping up onto the outside of this fountain it's a two-tiered fountain along the floor of the fountain basin within the water on the base there are two reliefs of snakes coiled sitting underneath the water with empty eye sockets two of them-- one of them has empty eyes the other one has an empty eye socket and a dull gray eye that still remains the liquid looks grimy and cloudy you do notice there are on four edges of the bottom basin at the lip of the water-- and the water meets the very edge-- there are slight grooves where the water's slowly trickling out and down to the floor and where it hits the floor there is no pool of water you inspect closer and there is a hole beneath each groove where the water itself is pouring through the floor below you to what you assume to be a chamber below make an arcana check to see if you can ascertain any arcane nature to it you guys are all taking a short rest beau you do notice the corner where the moss is as you cuddle up to it and glance forward there is a six-inch or so diameter hole in the corner of the wall goristro need a way out too where the moss is growing there is a hole in the stone chamber about that big around that looks to be a tunnel or tube that slowly descends downward upon glancing at it the interior is somewhat damp with condensation and that's where a lot of this moss is gathering around the outskirts of it you also notice scales little clusters of scales that are gathered on the edges of the stone yeah make a perception check you glance up on the ceiling and you can see two grooves-- well not two grooves but two holes that are in the stonework above bits of the stone have fallen and cracked a little where those two holes are glancing directly below them looking up you can see the faint pinhole bits of light from the sky above you also see the stone right around those holes is faintly stained crimson make a medicine check with your experience with blood and the viscosity of it you gather that if any of it were to find its way into the fountain either it's not human crimson color enough you don't see any signs of it currently in here most of the water that's in this fountain right now seems to be just water and algae and grime that has built up within the fountain approximately sure make an investigation check yes you inspect the body of the now slaughtered cobra figure it is nude there's no clothing on it it is a scaled flesh body no no armor it is just a lanky heavily scale-armored snake creature there's nothing to pull off of its body unfortunately okay do you have the materials to do so have you ever milked a dead snake for its venom make a nature check for me okay you'll spend the next 15 or 20 minutes or so attempting to do this and i'll come to you in a minute with your success and/or failure you go around finding each of these patches yes there are at each corner of the chamber there are these patches and at each corner you do see one of these holes make a perception check all you can tell is that you do see the errant scale they're big scales they're not tiny you see bits of snake skin and larger chunks of scales that have rubbed off from something moving through that chamber yeah from side to side diameter oh through the hole okay it does echo slightly down and you hear it reverberate it does continue downward nott what were you doing with an 11 it does not appear to be trapped whatever stone has been placed has been cemented in with all sorts of adhesive and basic masonry materials it was designed to permanently cover what was there previously if you guys want to take a short rest you can do it at the moment it does not appear that there's any immediate danger the door locked above you and you don't hear any more scuffling from above are you talking about the holes in the corner they are about that big around just so you know yeah you could put a sword in there it would be sitting on the ground and blocking the space a bit you're taking the corpses and filling-- okay okay to which one one of the purebloods make a perception check okay as you're dragging it over you do see a bit of metal jewelry fall out from underneath the robe it is an intricate stone key that is on a metal chain investigation check across the other two bodies you find that was the only key you do find amongst the two of them some errant pieces of jewelry you find a nice gold ring you're not quite sure how much it's worth but it looks probably worth something you find two jeweled daggers ceremonial that they had kept sheathed or one of them had brought out earlier that's what you find on their bodies both of these blades have very simple snake-like iconography where the pommel is it looks like the snout of a snake mouth the ring no the ring is a simple gold ring well for you it's taken the full hour if everyone's taking a short rest it's a full hour of rest no while you're all resting too jamedi is carefully looking through the different holes in the side of the chambers and helping you plug them with some of the dead bodies as you push them in avantika saunters up to you fjord and says so how long has it been for you eh since you've been called we'll say for this purpose you guys are out of earshot of most of the group then it was destiny what happened tell me everything i am familiar with this promise aye glancing at her expression she's enthralled and there's a moment where her head turns and you see a flash of jealousy in her eyes and then it reverts back and she goes that sounds incredible a few years about apparently her eyes are still locked on yours and she leans forward and takes her fingers and puts them through the side of your hair and goes i can trust you right and you trust these people good good she puts her fingers the rest of the way through your hair through the back of your head pulls you close and headbutts you a little bit and lets you go and gets up and walks off jester your short rest comes to a close you've used your hit dice you've healed up a bit you've gotten your arcane-- cool what would you guys like to do make an investigation check best you can tell they were carved onto a separate piece of stone that has since been affixed to the previous backing of this chamber it's been that way across most of the walls here you're shouting into a dead body stuffed into a hole you don't see any language carved in here it's mostly visuals of zehir the cloaked serpent bestowing the blessing and mutating followers that are rising up his army of snake people there are the holes in the ground at the base of the fountain where the waters is actually trickling through to something beneath there's the curled snakes that are in the water below those are the only things that you've noticed around the fountain make a medicine check nice looking her over you can see the dark circles under the eyes the continuous sweating along the brow and the shoulders and the chest area the pupils are slightly dilated and the breathing is more shallow than normal definitely warmer to the touch than a healthy person would be there's some sort of a disease that's working her way through her system you don't have a whole bunch of book experience with disease necessarily but you get the sense that this might have been transmitted by some of the insects that you encountered on the island on your way in it's some sort of disease transmitted by them through bites that's true it says condition be blinded deafened paralyzed or poisoned and then above it says diseased and i did not read that part earlier as part of my own mistake here we'll say that this is where you come through with your casting of lesser restoration before yeah exactly it takes a while for it to work its way through the system that's what i get for fast reading going oh well it doesn't list that among the conditions but disease is not a condition that's my fault he's sitting there he's inspecting the side of the walls and the carvings i am okay but i appreciate the offer i do on occasion yes he turns back towards you with a curious glance and says-- i'm sober his eyes narrow yes i would love some jerky he takes it from you i appreciate the offer he eats and continues to look over-- make a perception check looks like it you see him chewing chewing a little swallow chew chew chew chewsing sure you take your paintbrush and as you put it in there-- because there is the groove on the side of the fountain and it meets with the hole in the ground so the water is going through the hole below you stick your paintbrush in it and it mixes with the paintbrush it's thicker than water barely it's faintly viscous and where the groove is you can see the greenish slick where slime and general algae buildup has caused it to discolor against the rest of the stone it builds up a bit and you pull the paintbrush out and it continues down into the chamber below it smells like a typical type of algae though the liquid itself has a somewhat acrid smell to it no the blood of the yuan-ti that you've seen as it scatters is a deep purple in color correct correct oh yeah that's right you did not unfortunately as you try and sit there holding the head over a jar and jamming the fang into the thing this awkward process you don't get much out of it unfortunately i will say you do recall as when you entered the temple now that you're thinking about it that the door that locked behind you above you the trap door it had a small opening where a-- you complete your ritual the ring is not magical but it is worth a fair amount of gold you swirl the paintbrush in the fountain for a bit it collects some of the brackish liquid he's turned around he's still chewing the jerky he puts his shortbow over his shoulder and gathers his things he's loaded up with pouches and sacks he's not designed to be a combatant he's designed to be a traveler i am not a religious man but i appreciate your sense of inclusion he looks over at the dead serpent people jammed into holes (laughter) jamedi has dark brown skin smooth bald head gaunt features he's wearing light cloth billowing sleeves but it's tied with a bracer to each side so it doesn't get in the way of his hands' movement a few pack and satchels around him he looks like what you'd imagine a professional dungeoneer would look like where he has a few things to defend himself but he's not a combatant by any means he's very good about getting in and out of places quickly unseen and gather as much information as he can correct there were three of them one of them is missing two eyes the other is missing one and had another gray rock in there what you know about zehir zehir is a god that wanders in shadow is the creator of snakes and serpent kin it is essentially the evil god of poisons assassins and darkness they believe that to keep your acts obfuscated and secret is the greatest means of success strike quickly and without reason blind the target with their own confusion and kill slowly agonizingly or worse make them enjoy it are some of the tenets of their religion and belief you reach into the water and place-- using mage hand into the water it finds its way in seems to wedge into and affix mage hand again into a second one on one side the grime-covered snake that's coiled up there now has two glittering ruby eyes peering out unnaturally versus the rest of its relatively bland dark gray-green body you take it and place it in the opposing socket as soon as it slicks into place you all hear this grinding of stone the fountain shifts and begins to slowly spiral down below as it begins to move downward beneath it begins to show the about two feet of stone of the floor that you're standing on eventually gives way to the roof of a chamber below you lightless it is pitch black below you're still standing on the outside of the fountain looking down in only just the outskirts of the fountain went down in this slow spiral you glance downward it stops about ten feet below you it comes to a stop there's a bit of a ten-foot drop to where the fountain is and now below where it was standing there's about two feet of smooth pillar and then very thin stairs that continue to spiral down those of you with darkvision since there was no light source in here you can see in pitch black of dim light within 30 feet the chamber itself goes just beyond that so you cannot see the floor of the chamber what you can see the boughs of stunted trees the smell hits you as you lean forward it's a fresh earth and vegetation mixed with a smell of fermentation and rot it seems that below in this chamber there is a small orchard of some kind that exists without sunlight what do you do okay (flittering) make a perception check absolutely silent as you guys glance down these small orbs begin to illuminate the base on the floor the pillar drops down about 40 feet the chamber is about 40-foot from floor to ceiling you have about ten feet before you hit the actual staircase down but it's a thin staircase each step is maybe about seven or so inches wide you guys look over and see this as well the orbs float down and light the area it is a thick mass of jungle vines and roots and damp earth that hits the floor you can see a lot of these similar trees it's just this singular type of tree that is just repeatedly planted throughout the area you can see these slightly green- to yellow-colored fruit that are bared by these various trees a lot of which have fallen and are beginning to ferment on the ground and rot that's where you get the smell that hit you originally some of them that have fallen begin to just slowly rot away and decompose into the floor of this orchard about 40 feet from where you are about 30 feet once you hit the stairs okay make an acrobatics check for me easy enough to do even the slick spots and as it ground its way down smeared some of the algae along the outside which caused a faint bit of slickness on outside of the pillar using that without an issue slide land on the top step it holds your weight you got it for investigation to see if there are any traps on the way down no traps it is a simple descent and as soon as you hit the soft floor of the orchard it's just natural ground around you in the immediate vicinity yeah two that are within a foot of where you stand they're somewhat beginning to ferment yeah the interior is a bright orange-yellow color it looks fleshy like the inside of a mango it smells sweet but it has that turning point where it's starting to get a little bit-- yeah it tastes sweet and tangy okay you nibble a little bit it tastes pretty good it's got that tang to it that iron-y tang aftertaste to it okay you eat it what are you guys doing it's just fun to fuck with you guys make an acrobatics check you catch yourself there but keep yourself up and begin to descend down the steps and below okay beau acrobatics check you hit it and your foot hits a slick spot you catch yourself and hold onto the edge adjust and then continue down without issue ten unfortunately there's not a whole lot of handhold in this area it's a smooth ten-foot space and as you try to find a handhold to grab onto you just fall straight down on how many that's awesome that's slick yeah i was going to say they're not falling as soon as he slips in-- okay do you take it do you guys-- as caleb sees this happening shoves the four of you fall and begin to slowly drift you all land gently on the tips of your toes before the rest of your body finds its weight now resting onto the soft floor of the subterranean orchard nott about a minute's past since you've eaten that fruit and you start feeling a little tingly on the inside of your body you turn to look at caleb and it's crazy his hair's purple now it's pink now it's orange now it's purple his pupils are purely dilated as you're glancing around the light orbs that are slowly drifting they're leaving trails behind make a perception check with disadvantage because you-- six okay at this point jamedi and avantika have managed to join you below in the chamber hello jamedi he pulls out a torch and lights it up it's very bright everyone turns slowly to nott as the faint orbs are met with the brighter torchlight from jamedi it opens up the chamber this entire chamber is roughly 70-ish feet by about 50 feet in size this orchard these trees are everywhere no this chamber is four-sided actually it seems-- make an intelligence check actually based on the shape of the temple as you saw it the size of the chamber you were just in and the chamber below there should be more space on the sides and the front of it it looks like this is probably a central chamber of this floor make a perception check with disadvantage well with advantage because you have the torchlight on or no sorry regular roll brain working it's been a week yeah nothing seems receptive jamedi looks around i did not go this far into the temple i returned for your aid so no it is very possible i didn't spend too much time studying the inner workings of their day-to-day i was more focused on surviving avantika's looking around arms crossed glancing keeping her hands near her weapons it's not a massive amount of it but each tree is in the process maybe holding about a few dozen no not this stunted they're squat trunk and the top doesn't reach the very top of this chamber they're about five or so feet below they're not massive trees by any means but the idea of trees like this-- and as you look at it now the color-- previously you had just the faint light looking across the ground as you look up towards the leaves in these trees the coloration's not green necessarily it's more of a deep purplish brown color to the leaves currently it looks to be soft earth and where are the roots and various vines that have entwined their way around from other plant life that have been subsisting off of the ecosystem that's built in this space you can certainly go check make an investigation check your vision is jittery there nott okay glancing about the same source the one small blip on your radar jamedi in thinking of those questions the ground itself is damper around the base of the fountain yeah you could say it's comparable in some ways it goes from a brown to a faint purple-ish tint you don't see any signs of animals you don't see bits of droppings or claw marks or teeth marks on any of the nearby trees at all you're looking for investigation check because at an immediate glance you don't see there's no open archway or anything as you two begin to make a perimeter you don't see any doorways what you do see are on the south wall the western wall and the northern wall there are large stone tablets that are affixed to the wall similar to the ones you saw above that have almost mirroring inscriptions of this same vision of zehir bestowing these mutations upon the followers on the bottom of each of these tablets there is a hole that's about 12 inches wide and about five or six inches tall there's no door that you can tell but you see these large stone tablets that are affixed to the north western and south wall each of these tablets is about maybe eight feet wide ten feet tall and the base of it right before where it meets the floor there is a little space a little hole if you will that's about 12-14 inches wide and about 4-5 inches tall it's rectangular you also see amongst the ground as your walking your foot hits something and you look down and you can see a wicker basket an empty wicker basket that's overturned no as these globes of light are brought over to see it it's quite beautiful but before you even see the relief in the wall there's this extremely bright series of symbols glowing on the stone in front of you they look like that another set of symbols say it what is it no it's been more than an hour make a perception check okay make a survival check okay you can see some grooves in the damp dirt and areas where the soft bits of leaves that are fallen that are pressed down but the grooves are pushed through pressure no not necessarily that works too attempting to sketch these over i'm going to say make an intelligence check with disadvantage please nott yes you do what you think is a decent job trying to copy what you see it takes a little while okay looking at the spell here it doesn't do anything because you cannot see the language you have to be able to touch it and see it to read it right you see no language you're figuring this out now as you go to the wall that's okay as you go to the wall there's nothing there you're like there's no language there (laughs) caleb eats the fruit that would have been probably decent enough to get through that message over the next minute or so caleb the colors of the lights begin to shift you guys watch as caleb begins to slowly move the floating orbs in different patterns gets distracted by his own cantrip caleb make a perception check actually it would be with disadvantage because of the effect of the-- glancing about the interior of the chamber you look in the directions where nott was and you can see the three markers and you see a faint fourth glow from the eastern wall jamedi is holding the torch as a light source for those who need it avantika is grinning watching this whole thing as you're walking by avantika saunters up to you fjord and goes like i can certainly say this is the most entertaining bunch i've traveled with in some time oh of course we wouldn't be this far if they weren't you head to the southern wall he cast comprehend languages correct south which one do you go to western one avantika just looks straight to you and goes the false serpent we are close what do you wish to do there's a strange moment as nott-- this cold sensation on your back you're like oh that kind of tickles it begins to constrict and you guys glance over and one of the vines is curled up around nott and begins to tighten around it you take 15 points of bludgeoning damage and are grappled you are restrained all right go for it yasha goes in takes two swings you got it you hold him up at which point a vine wraps up around your body jester that is a 16 to hit you kick it off and pull away you can now see this-- this thick vine that is rising up and it curls around snake-like in its own right towards you other vines begin to thicken in the area around you and the roots begin to turn the area into hard terrain to walk through the floor of the forest seems to briefly come alive and you now see these large two thick entangling vines one that's wrapped entirely around nott and constricting her tiny body the other one trying to wrap its way around jester both hit roll damage 12 points of damage on the second one you can now see as this is happening-- who wants to take action on this one no nott's still being constricted yeah no carved into and cut elements of it you can see the vine itself where it's split open there's a hardy thick light green tendon-like material beneath it's a very strong vine it's wrapped around multiple times around nott now and it's pulling and trying to squeeze her to death you can either attempt to help her escape or you can attempt to punch the vine the choice is yours all right this is your action make an athletics check nine unfortunately it's too strong and as you try and pull the vines away they just are locked in this death grip around nott that ends your action caduceus it's fairly damp it's not super moist but there is a general hint of humidity in the air while this is happening nott what are you doing no you're just focusing action spent willing yourself somewhere else make a constitution saving throw 18 all right you don't pop a blood vessel in your eye but it gets close you can-- matt and okay you manage to disperse a lot of the moisture in the air but you cannot pull it from a creature you would know that with the spell all right it fails its save roll damage caleb what are you doing you're being held up by jester right now now giant jester is holding caleb over your shoulder 11 points of damage all right that ends your go caleb casts enlarge on giant jester fjord what are you doing yeah sure you grab it and pick it up and look at it it looks like on the inside it had some elements of remnants of fruit that may have scuffed part of the wicker but other than that it just looks like a basket well you'll get to that next round because it takes your action to lift up the basket and inspect it that's okay that ends your turn now the vines the one that constricts once again to you nott as it's pulling you in you feel now these thorns emerge from the inside of its constriction and poison bursts into your system you take-- 23 points of poison damage yes your action was lifting caleb up off the ground the other one will attempt to constrict you again that is a 14 to hit with that you kick it off with your giant foot the vine pulls itself back up now you can go what's the dc on that three and 13 they both fail roll 3d6 damage and they both take it you're close enough to the vine that is trying to attack you yeah 15 points of radiant damage to each the vine that was constricting around you hadn't taken any damage yet you see a burst of radiant energy you watch as it lights up the area briefly the one that's currently burning around there the radiant damage burns past you can see part of it blacken from the impact of the radiant energy but it's still holding nott tight that ends your go yasha what's yasha doing go for it that hits both hit roll damage still tearing into that same vine that's holding nott correct damage on the second strike 2d6 plus five weirdly cocked 11 points of damage hacking through that vine it's still holding nott but it is looking really rough it's on the edge of keeping itself held together and you can see the parts of where yasha's carved through and where the radiant energy has blasted it it's starting to leak this thick green sap it's having a hard time yeah it's a plant bleeding if you've ever seen a plant bleed there you go beau yeah nott's still stuck though the vine around nott is hurt pretty bad go for it the one that's around nott or the one that's after jester the one that's around nott or the one that's after jester okay go for it that hits ten points of damage all righty 12 misses you swing the second hit with the staff and as you do the vine arcs out of the way and it hits air 13 just hits marisha and at this point i also need you to make a strength saving throw yep now that you've moved in the vines in the area begin to entangle and move around you manage to push off of the vines on the ground around you that are trying to entangle and hold your legs to the ground jester i need you to also make a strength saving throw yes no issue you just kick out of the vines without problem that brings us to nott on the top of your turn as you are still constricted you take another 19 points of poison damage nott goes unconscious and you watch the vines closing entirely around her face and torso just the arm poking out of the side you can now see as the lighter green skin tone get darker with blood now being pushed towards the outer sides of her limbs at end of your turn nott i need you to make a death saving throw that's a success all right caduceus you're going to attempt to-- okay what are you saying make an intimidation check mm-hmm oh buddy okay there you go you no longer have to roll death saving throws it can still constrict you but all right so that ends your turn unfortunately your cries fall on deaf ears as it appears the hunger that drives these vines overrides the communication you're attempting to spring with them that opportunity may have worked but not this time all right finishing your go now -- that's right jester and-- well no you cast spirit guardians this turn right last turn i know i'm trying to keep in my head here-- she did she lifted up caleb the first time the second time you cast spirit guardians now we're going to caleb and fjord fjord what are you doing there you go dancing and spearing with their little horns all right roll a strength saving throw to see if you can manage to break through the entangling vines to get towards it you feel them pull at your shins but you still kick through and you hear them snap as you manage to brush past their grip making your way towards-- which one the one that has nott go ahead and make your first attack it's present that hits go ahead and roll damage five points of damage you carve through the vine-- bisecting it you watch as now looking as you get close up you can see the base of it now this slowly shambling chunk of rooted plant as you run forward your blade arcing through the air you cut through the base of it the actual vine falls limp and uncurls nott's body falling to the ground unconscious that vine is destroyed you still have another attack and there's the other vine still trying to wrap around jester all right you move up to strike that one nine misses unfortunately all right that finishes your go caleb correct correct-- on your turn or their turn their turn's coming up they forgot to keep that up last time okay bolt okay i was like-- all right 25 to hit that definitely hits basically it should be-- how'd you get a one if it's 2d10 at level five you're-- three damage to it that ends caleb's go all right now both of them are going to attempt-- the one's dead the other one fails its save so go ahead and roll that one sam and 14 damage nice it's going to go ahead and attempt-- it's now moving away from you and moving over towards fjord that is going to roll a 17 to hit it hits you it-- (whiplash) wraps around fjord pulls your arms to the side of your body and constricts you you immediately take nine points of bludgeoning damage and you are grappled and restrained all right that finishes that one's go that brings us to-- now avantika kicks in avantika pulls out blades and is going to go ahead and attack the one going after you and goes hands off of him hits with both and then-- natural 20 on the dagger avantika just starts eviscerating this vine with two slaps of the rapier and then one giant dagger strike that carves up the side looking pretty hurt still holding on though that being the case we're going to be back at the top that brings us to yasha who's next ashley's going to be real happy nah it misses oh there we go no for the first hit the first hit that hits gets the divine fury you double the dice on that one 26 points of damage as yasha just carves through the second strike cutting straight up the side almost freeing you it's shredded and still holding on by a thread of its life as it's trying to pull you back to wherever it crawled its way out of but still standing that finishes yasha's go jester it's barely holding on all right it fails with a four on its wisdom save there go ahead and roll damage five points of damage how do you want to do this jester (cheering) okay the giant jester stomping out the vine on the ground it's now like-- (splattering) parts of it are being crushed and turned to pulp caleb is fireman's carry make a perception check jamedi's still holding the torch up to give you a good range of light looking around you you can see where the two clusters of these weird vine creatures were these assassin-type vines you see there's just two of them and glancing about the chamber and giving a good solid look you don't see any more of that type it looks like these two were the ones that were rooted here either as protector or had just woven their way down here and became part of the ecosystem but at the moment you don't see any other threat all right both fjord and caleb (crash) onto the ground tumbling onto your sides they both very much are you have no idea how long this is going to last the only other thing you've seen are the central slips the holes in the bottom of those three tablets as you make your way towards some of those doors we're going to take a little break (groaning) you can find this available now on kickstarter through halloween run by our good friends at wyrmwood this one will be given away to someone who wins the giveaway which in order to enter you have to come over to the critical role twitch chat-- that's twitchtv/criticalrole-- during the break and enter-- only once-- the code word snakes plural (as indiana jones) why'd it have to be snakes we'll have a winner for you when we come back from the break and we'll see you in a few minutes [break] congratulations punypompouspuffball we'll have your wyrmwood gift sent off to you asap happy halloween so where we left off mighty nein you began to go and inspect some of these tablets with these gaps beneath the bottom which way did you want to go they're about 12 to 14 inches wide and about four to five inches tall or on the bottom all right there is no tablet or hole in the east okay into the south who's doing what are you looking through it all right make a perception check are you doing it with a light source below perception check glancing inside you see a hatchery of some kind there's a strong smell of fermentation in there a majority of the room seems to be a series of clusters of roughly one foot tall eggs they've all been placed in various edges there nestled in soft dirt and molding fruit this is the south room right you also see what appears to be a broken humanoid corpse long decomposed jammed by one of the clusters no no manacles you can look around you go ahead and make a perception check well there are a number of eggs inside there they look to be somewhat reptilian yeah i mean it's hard to tell from this distance all you see is the eggs and the body there they start about four feet into the room and the room itself from what you can see down there is enclosed go for it you do see in some of the walls about two feet off the ground similar sized holes that are pushed in against where some of the vines and some of the carvings are that curl upward-- you imagine probably meeting with some of the holes above you get the sense that perhaps something uses these to traverse up and down parts of this temple you head to the west one and you go ahead and look inside i imagine putting the spheres in as well make a perception check glancing inside it's a relatively simple chamber from what you can tell there are elements of stonework placed in but they haven't been carved and they are only partially done they've gotten most of the temple finished and they haven't quite fully completed their work in going over the walls inside the small chamber is maybe 15 by ten feet and while there's no other real discerning shapes or details to it you do see about ten feet ahead of you it descends into stairs ten-foot wide set of stairs okay make another perception check please this looks to be a sister hatchery room to the one on the south this one does not contain a body but just other clusters of eggs make a nature check with what experience you have with seeing much smaller snakes and other type creatures in nature you're not really fully understanding the gestation period of yuan-ti these eggs don't look like they're ready to hatch in the next few days or so there's still some time before the oldest clutches of-- yeah i'd say so it's the same five-inch tall 12 13 inches wide space make an investigation check you have no idea sure make a strength check it's wide enough the actual stone tablets are maybe about three and a half four inches long you can get your fingers through and pull on the other side but it does not budge at all make an investigation check okay it doesn't separate at all but you do see each of the tablets where they're part of the wall they're actually recessed in as opposed to placed against it you can see a very very faint gap where they would probably slide either side to side based on some mechanism (laughter) which one are you going in it's the western one all right make an acrobatics check just to see if you can squeeze through the space your small goblin form has no real problem-- you have to rearrange your skull at a certain angle to make it through the gap but you do manage to make your way through to the opposite side of the chamber you see the simple chamber it looks like at first there was unfinished carvings in the wall so it looks like the carvings come to a completion and then the rest of it is a solid stone interior that stops at a wall on the opposite end about 15 feet in and stairs that slowly curve down about ten-foot wide just begin to go on a wide spiral downward make an investigation check okay so amongst the right hand carving you look within one of the simple portions of a pillar or an obelisk as part of this carving that looks like a similar construct to the city that surrounds this temple but the obelisk itself appears to protrude from a slight groove from behind this actual gap behind the obelisk and you reach through and give it a tug it pulls forward about an inch at which point the doors-- all three of the doors open at once and the fountain raises up to close and return to where it was above you fill a pocket with fruit okay you grab some fruit and put it in your bag jamedi's waiting for all of this to happen avantika isn't immediately visible mm-hm you can see the southern wall avantika is rushing back towards you well done congratulations shall we i was inspecting the other chambers as they opened snakes and a dead body huh there's a corpse in the other chamber rotted flesh and some bones i've seen a few in my time perhaps even caused a few she looks at you with a grin (snaps fingers) you watch as this brief burst of flame (poof) in front this is going to be so much fun that was not part of the arrangement you are proving your use to me as my companions and part of my team as the captain of the ship and as your superior i tell you what to do and you do it so what you kill me then return and my entire crew just wipes you out as you arrive oh i can read between the lines quite strongly there fjord i appreciate that look this is not me trying to impose my will just continue the arrangement we made and i do not feel like taking the lead no that is not the safest route for the captain eh no she's visible yeah there's a dead body there make a perception check looking around you see the egg clutches you see the body not much else in there it looks like a decomposed corpse tattered clothing broken leather belt a simple satchel hangs open just rotted and gone it's been there for a long time you go ahead and scoot down for a look you have no idea she was the first to inspect the body so who is to make their descent how about you captain tusktooth will you choose one of your subordinates to lead the fray into the subterranean chambers i think she's volunteering huh that sounds unanimous then beauregard i believe is the name that they keep calling you please find your way down we'll be right behind you all right so what's the marching order pretty big beauregard's in front who's after beauregard all right jester's after beauregard okay so we'll put caleb and nott here all right and avantika is going to stay back with fjord and caduceus and yasha is going to be right in front of you guys all righty are you descending quietly i need you all to make a stealth check mm-hmm roll for yasha if you don't mind as well all right beau while you catch yourself about to stumble down the stairs yasha reaches out and catches you and stops you pulls you back quietly under your heels and just pats you on the shoulder and continues walking down travis three natural 20s thank god continuing through jamedi's staying back not wanting to show the torchlight who's going ahead to-- i'll show you what you see as you look past the corner on that staircase into this chamber you see these three large load-bearing pillars intricately carved that make their way to the ceiling of this roughly 60-foot chamberin the center of it a pool of water around a small well but the entire chamber itself is filled with about an inch or two of water while it's not a glass surface-- there's a slight disturbance to it there's a slight shift a shape that is currently coiled quietly on this end one of the large full-bodied snake yuan-ti that you had encountered briefly in the city outside of the temple that had grabbed jester and was about to make off with her you can see the 15- or 20-foot long serpentlike lower part of the body where there are no legs-- just this long snake-- that coils around the muscular wide humanlike broad shoulders and muscular arms themselves folded forward you can see the head-- this full snake head is curled in eyes closed and almost like prayer or sleep strung across one side of its back is a long scimitar that's sheathed the other shoulder has a longbow thrown over the shoulder and there is a beautiful silver shield almost like silver and marble that's resting on the ground next to its coil and it's quietly looking down towards the pool of water there are a couple of other raised platforms in the chamber decorative or ceremonial you're uncertain but it is quiet and what little movement that remains there is probably just the very faint ripples of the last bit of physical activity this creature had made amongst the surface of the two to three inches of water that fills the chamber from what beau can see yes the well is risen above it and the surface is still on the top of that well since the fight oh yeah what level is that there is no light source that one time yes why but of course i can make myself or another invisible you get the sense from the fact that most of this temple is not lit at all has no light source they probably can see in the dark they have eyes not necessarily to see smoke still obscures in darkness yes is it philip yes i can throw this and she tosses the dagger and catches it but i am more of a up close and personal eviscerator you can certainly try okay given the circumstance i would put jester and nott nearest to the top here right behind jester and nott would be whom we'll say for the purposes of-- who's at the back of that sorry all righty who's after them we'll say avantika will be about there jamedi's staying back here with the group that is the marching order as you guys are in the staircase it does not make a sound it is illusory we're both right (laughter) make a perception check jester from here best you can tell its eyes are closed all right invoke duplicity 30 feet away that's where it appears right like right there adjacent okay all right both attack with advantage melee spell attacks it's an ambush it doesn't know you're there correct that hits and you you are yes ten misses correct no it does not it has to occupy space for it to be an ally right so it should just be a single attack the first one you rolled that would hit so roll damage because it is an ambush you get advantage on that oh it was a critical hit no no it's okay you're thinking of a critical hit it's all good no worries so the total is 38 points of damage that is not bad at all all righty then-- 21 points of damage in one round (impacts) the bolt hits immediately the creature (growls) the eyes flash open and looks around sees the illusion looks in the direction where the bolt came from and glances up and sees you at the top of the stairway everyone roll initiative (cheering) all right 25 to 20 nobody 20 to 15 on what what did you get it was nott-- fjord got what all righty then caleb got a 14 now it is-- ten to five laura and aww what did yasha get that means that if you guys have any creative ways to do combined attacks the three of you can go at the same time and be fun with it correct well essentially in that order you would be able to be like (spell attack) right before somebody hit if you wanted to because you're still on the same initiative order yeah that brings us to the top of the combat round beau you're up first well you have 45 feet as your distance right (counting) that's one move that'll get you about there yeah you can do that try it out it is 30 feet from you yeah go for it yeah it's a ranged-- 18 hits all right roll damage for each d4's yep well hold on if it's a monk weapon because it's the shuriken you got-- oh but the darts they're not monk weapons yeah yeah the daggers or something akin to that would be a monk weapon 13 damage total you can move five more feet there to get behind that pole if you want okay patient defense would be your bonus action you're not going to do that then you still have a bonus action sure i think it's an unarmed attack actually for your bonus action i'll double check the player's handbook has vanished from me it's all good while i'm looking this up anything else-- an unarmed strike is a bonus action so you cannot throw a third shuriken hold all right that's beau's turn next up is nott nott you are up next fjord you're on deck this way all right five ten (counting) go for it 16 hits sam and it does not count as an adjacent ally unfortunately 11 points of damage nice as the three shurikens stick into its form (growling and hissing) it sees you rush past and (growling) okay it looks (growling) it looks up (snorting) and can't quite track you it does see jester up in the stairway though it's now its turn as the abomination takes its round it is going to pull its scimitar out and rake it across the stone carving sparks and grinding off some of them causing this echo throughout the chamber before resheathing it and pulling its longbow out and getting it out to fire a volley of two arrows at jester with the longbow you are in its first range first attack is 18 to hit oh yeah that does hit you take 18 points of piercing damage as well as-- as well as 15 points of poison damage as the arrow (groaning) it's longer than an average arrow this longbow is a longbow for one of these large abominations and it just sinks into you it pulls back for another arrow that is a 15 this one you deflect it and the arrow splinters off and hits the wall with that it's going to move behind here and is now back to the wall and it's getting another arrow ready that brings the end of his turn fjord you're up here back we'll say there there there well you're glancing your eye it's where you looking at going to land wherever it lands wherever you want to place it 20-foot radius yeah that'll definitely be good back there yeah that's about right the whole area fills with darkness and these strange somewhat translucent slimy tendrils occasionally whip out the sides of this orb where light cannot pierce that's your action and your movement is that the end of your turn all right that brings us to caleb you're up you come around the chamber and you look and all you see is a giant sphere of blackness you have no idea where the creature is let's double check no light magical or otherwise can illuminate the area and creatures fully within the area are blinded yeah you haven't seen it yet you are concentrating on that all righty that ends caleb's turn all right that brings us to yasha caduceus and jester all right d8 plus five i believe of course remember if she doesn't attack or be attacked she loses her rage next round she's going double rush in (counting) 30 35 40 dash and she can get over on this side you mean over here all right now the chamber primarily is now visible to everybody without issue yourself included is it an action to cast light as a cantrip well you had cast light previously on the edge of your staff you're still giving off your own light source are you going to stay put then in the back of the hallway there mm-hmm okay back a few steps make an attack with disadvantage if you're going to be doing something else are you doing another inflict wounds all right okay you go to release spell is expended but no impact on the creature unfortunately 3rd-level spell used back up here all righty crowded hallway all right start of the turn got it all right at the top of his turn however you guys both finish yasha did her turn you're all done there looks good now comes to avantika and jamedi avantika's going to charge down goes in there with blades out ready to go jamedi is going to come forward and take the torch and throw it further inside it clatters this way helps illuminate that side of the chamber and then backs up correct it lights everything around it top of the round the surface of the well begins to bubble and move the water begins to rise up like the surface bubbles up and begins to pour on the side as you watch this large snake-like serpent head arrives and another and another and another you see emerging from the center of this chamber-- -- the true guardian the warden spoken of in the text above it definitely enters the hunger of hadar a dexterity saving throw on its point there that is a ten ten points of cold damage to the hydra all right gotcha right now avantika's the one closest to it moves forward has a reach of ten doesn't have to fully get into melee with her it's going to take multiple attacks at her you see this body emerge from it that is a natural one good for her that misses 16 that hits that hits and that hits with that avantika takes 15 points of piercing damage ten points of piercing damage and 11 points of piercing damage avantika she's like holy fucking shit i could use some assistance she is just trying to fight these things off all right now it's beau's turn it does got it it's burning and holding it in place slowing it down but it seems to neglect it for the most part all right that brings us to-- -- beau's turn all right as beau swings around hasted-- not at its current position you can get into the pool if you want to you're hasted where do you want to be here here all righty go for it 14 just misses your staff just scrapes off of its hard armor you still have a bonus action what are you going to do don't listen to them do what you were going to do no disengage is an action unless you're a rogue and had that ability probably okay that's good one per head that finishes beau's turn nott you're up it's a singular creature step of the wind allows you to do that nott what are you doing go for it 11 to attack misses yeah she doesn't know you're there so it would be advantage since you were hidden previously that does hit you do get sneak attack damage 16 points of damage to it strikes into it one of the heads looks back into your direction glancing around back which way to here got it that finishes your turn nott it's now the abomination's turn yes it does 11 points nice slithers out of the radius sees yasha and sees avantika avantika's handled now by the hydra he's going to now look towards yasha and take two arrow strikes at her yep no the abomination right there no she's not raging that is an 18 to hit and a 19 to hit she takes six points of piercing damage and eight points of poison damage second attack is 13 points of piercing damage 13 points of piercing damage and ten points of poison damage she got lucky on those rolls there it's going to stay back here in the corner trying to keep away it's just using its arrows from a distance it's starting to show some wear and tear this guy over here has been pummelled with a few things and the tentacles have been tearing through him but he's staying outside of the radius of that sphere that finishes his go fjord you're up you're moving you said okay here as you're moving in that direction (whooshing)-- this against the hydra that hits ooh 22 points of damage as both bolts slam into the head you watch as the head pops actually blasts them off the hydra but now you know hexblade's curse right there that brings us to caleb that hits all right roll the first 2d6 double this 35 points of damage you watch as another head gets burnt to cinders from the nearby impact it actually cauterizes where the first head was destroyed and where the second one was destroyed all right that finishes caleb's turn it is now yasha caduceus and jester's from this position you cannot hmm you'd have to get this way and you don't have enough-- you could try and leap off here you'd have to make an acrobatics check to see if you land properly all right you step out and see the hydra this sphere is preventing you from seeing the abomination okay charisma save no that is an eight i'm looking it up again right you're concentrating on that it is concentration for up to one minute yep that is bane is that where you're staying all right pop back out healer tactics that finishes caduceus's turn jester and yasha let me just double check something as far as your duplicate is concerned it might be the case it might not be i'll double check here no it just says you create it for a minute it says it's concentration an unoccupied space you can move the illusion for 30 feet in space you can see but it must remain within 120 feet of you but you cannot see any of these spaces where it is you can right now it's consumed in darkness you cannot see anything past this the hunger of hadar is blocking all your vision you do not know where your illusion is you just see this large sphere of darkness correct technically no but nevertheless to a space you can see you can but it would be over on this side over next to beau on this side you could try to you can get it right there on the cusp floating above the top there it's just peering out and it's visible to you now go for it roll for an attack 16 hits roll damage (music) you are correct that finishes your turn yasha you move back all right this way (counting) okay that finishes yasha's go top of the round now the hydra goes the hydra spins around to face beau who has now moved up now only three functional heads it's going to take three swipes at beau (laughter) double natural ones that's impressive minus three that's a 12 that's 21 with bane you take 15 points of piercing damage as it suddenly-- two heads you manage to dodge by there's one that was moving too quick that you didn't see coming and-- 21 then it still hits you bites you in the side lifts you off the ground from the impact and you feel the teeth crunch into your abdomen you manage to elbow your way out and land and you can see the fresh teeth marks starting to bleed down the side it's going to move out and into range with both of them right there she's not within range no they have a reach of ten all right so that's going to bring us to beau you're up that's true yeah that lowers it to 16 plus five on his con roll one more dice just in case it's a crit there you go gave you that to you as a freebie plus zero no vulnerability for the hydra yeah six points of damage there go for it 15 hits that misses you have one more hit rolling series of strikes you pull some information from it manages to pummel the sides of this base where its torso is well done does that end your turn okay you stay where you are that brings us to nott with your explosive bolt okay all righty you're holding your action it is now the abomination's turn the abomination-- or avantika's turn i feel like i forgot avantika's turn and jamedi avantika would have darted around and gotten into melee with the hydra ooh nice natural 20 on one of those hits that's a-- (counting) 22 points of damage to it correct from avantika yeah those were two rapier strikes finishes her go jamedi is just shaking and not even getting involved in the combat too scared to go in that brings us to the abomination's turn who's going to turn around the corner rise up on the platform here-- that's a good thing yeah because it turned around and it's going to take two shots at you with its longbow that is 15 and 23 16 points of piercing damage including 12 points of poison damage correct so you take six well here-- you resisted all of the damage from the arrow entirely that's pretty slick yeah it doesn't even catch you no poison you manage to stop it in place the poison doesn't even hit your system watching you reach behind and catch the arrow and stop it from going there and the second one just manages to dodge past you (growling) it's going to go ahead and-- that's when you take the 2d6 spitting it out on the side your lips and tongue go a little numb all right that ends its go fjord you're up and then caleb you're on deck 18 hits you're concentrating on that i forgot about that did you add your extra damage for your hexblade's curse that finishes your turn fjord caleb you're up all righty well this would be concentration regardless the abomination that is a natural 12 plus two that's a 14 what's your dc for the hydra-- it's a natural 18-- minus three for the bane that's 15 this ends caleb's go that brings us to-- caleb moves off to the side yasha caduceus and jester jester steps out to the side throw it high make a strength check nott roll an attack roll no you do not so (laughing) the barrel (whooshing) the bolt (arrow firing) and detonates somewhere on the opposite side of the chamber as the barrel (landing) into the water of the well in the center there you hear a splash of water that would've been spectacular if it had worked there you go all righty okay got it that finishes that turn caduceus to yasha there you go she is flanking with avantika yes correct you don't have to you can if you want to 14 misses goes wide second strike 16 does hit 15 was the threshold yeah and she still does her divine damage doubled so it's 32 points of damage another head is carved off of its body that ends yasha's go it's now avantika's turn avantika is going to take three strikes at it the rapier-- both hit 18 and 11 naturally the dagger misses with a four oh shit (counting) 25 points of damage 25 points of damage from avantika carves off another head there is now one head on the hydra next up is jamedi who's staying out of the fray next is the hydra's turn the hydra who only has one head but is slowed and can only make one attack anyway is going to swing back to you since you're the one who looks the most damaged too and it wants to start taking something down no against you ooh that's a natural 20 against you no you specifically got out of sight it happens as it happens so roll for yasha she can't reckless out of turn it's all good 15 just hits roll damage for yasha that's cocked that is 18 points of piercing damage to you beau mm-hmm nice it's starting to look hurt hold on a second at the end of its turn-- ah end of its turn it grows two heads for each of its heads that died since its last turn unless it's taken fire damage since it was slowed and did not take fire damage it regrows four new heads it's a natural ability it's not an action it just happens at the end of its roll no the cauterized ones are still gone but the two that it lost last turn-- yes it makes a wisdom save against the slow right at the end of its turn natural 17 oh right yeah this could do it minus one-- 16 what's the dc at the end of the spell a creature affected by the spell makes another wisdom saving throw at the end of its turn on a successful save the effect ends no what's your spell dc it succeeds the save i just rolled it was a one on the d4 it brought it from 17 to 16 he succeeded the slow fails and it does regenerate some hit points from regaining the two heads back all right that ends the hydra's turn beau you're up go for it not from beau it's not yasha and avantika are flanking 21 hits 12 misses unfortunately okay avantika and jamedi are at the very bottom she already went she was the one who cut off one of the heads and then it came back patient defense for beau that brings us to nott yep it's still over there in the darkness somewhere go for it roll for an attack i was hoping fluffernutter was going to work i'm so sorry 13 misses it goes wide you are hidden you have advantage on that 18 does hit so roll damage 23 ooh nice all right it takes the damage it sinks into one of the necks its body is taking wounds heavily it's hurt it's not on the edge of its life but it's hurt that finishes nott's turn it's now the abomination's turn correct he is going to go ahead and-- can't take a reaction right oh man the only one close enough to do anything is beau it's going to sweep up behind beau and take one giant swing with its scimitar at you with disadvantage yes staying just on the cusp of the bubble disadvantage because of patient defense which is good you did because its was a natural 20 and then a five that brings it to 12 it totally misses it swings wide it would have been a head cleaving blow and out of the corner of your eye you see it with your patient defense ready and watch it slowly carve past catching a couple hairs on the side of your head as you duck out of the way then it makes a wisdom save to see if it can to see if it can resist that natural 11 plus two 13 no still slowed man that fucks him up too bad that ends his go fjord you're up dropping the hunger of hadar correct now the chamber is visible that hits what did you roll 12 no it misses with that you blow off another one of its heads there you go now it's down to four heads fjord the stump goes limp laying on the ground but there out of the corner of your eye you can see another head or two little snouts beginning to try and regenerate out of that neck point you now are seeing those processes of regeneration with each head that is removed it immediately begins to try and regrow in its space that finishes your turn fjord caleb you're up how many slow slots do you have but you've cast haste when you got in here and you cast slow earlier so that's two-- that's right 6th-level you get a third slot that's correct i was thinking you had two yeah all right dc 16 with bane for the abomination with bane that's 12 with him so he fails so he's still slowed and the hydra (laughs) that's fucked up it was a natural 20 technically you lose concentration on the-- when you recast a concentration spell it drops before-- i understand but slow is an area effect meaning you can hit multiple enemies there's no reason to not hit him otherwise you lose the concentration if you want to look at the dice i know that was-- right but then i rolled a four on the bane which brought it down to a 16 which is exactly the dc that's fucked up that's why i laughed i was like that's really stupid all right well ducked back behind it maintains basically where it was before that finishes up your round caleb yasha caduceus and jester okay correct to not be a stickler on-- i'm just saying there was no benefit to not choosing the snake guy because he would have lost his slow if you cast it on just the hydra and recasting it again you can choose them both which means there was no benefit other than retroactively doing the die rolls correct i'm sorry man wizards are high-risk high-reward for that reason that brings us to yasha caduceus and jester the hydra okay wisdom save on him natural 18 yeah plus two it's 20 oh a dex save that's even higher that's a 21 that finishes jester's go you're putting your back against the wall here you look at him and he's genuinely scared how many times have you used it now that's right because of short rest got it okay that brings us to yasha you're still flanking with avantika yeah that definitely hits that's 18 points doubled so that becomes 36 travis and with that another one of the heads is carved off reducing this-- laura and that hits it's hurting real bad that's rough that finishes yasha's go avantika it's now her turn to go three attacks oof that's not a good round a two a three and 16 on the dagger that hits though five points of damage for avantika jamedi is just going to stare back at you and be like i was not hired for this that brings us to the hydra's turn sure make an insight check hard to read the hydra now that it has technically advantage with the abomination across from you beau it's going to take its attack-- because they have you flanked that is 20 to hit all right right that would make it 18 there you go that is 21 brought to 20 that hits roll damage for yasha ooh that is 14 points of piercing damage that is 21 with the bane brought it down to 21 i rolled a three it was a 24 he's rolling really good this round that is 14 points of piercing damage marisha and that finishes the hydra's turn the hydra now regrows come here buddy it is back up to five heads now it's looking really rough though with beau down it's going to slither up over here and get into melee with you caduceus because you already used your reaction to do so in which case actually it's going to slither even further up into getting with melee with jester as well now the heads are curling down inside and it's making its way to up into the hallway that ends the hydra's turn beau i need you to roll a death saving throw please first failed death save nott you're up it's in the water currently right there (music) okay you scoot around the corner 19 hits he's so close he's still slowed and you watch him (groaning) all right you grab the keg that hits roll damage just right through the temple onto the ground you're just holding the keg there okay that ends your turn nott that would have been the abomination's turn but he's dead that brings us to fjord that hits that does not hit you undo its healing from last round meaning it healed up 20 points and then you just did 22 you blast its body and part of its back muscles are exposed and bits of bone are showing it still has all of these heads that are sinking forward and desperately biting around it but it's looking really rough that finishes your turn fjord caleb you're up correct you were just out of its range well this curves around so you can get that close but you can't see it that's where you can see it any further and you're not going to be able to see it go for it it has technically three-quarters cover because of most of it's covered by the rest of the chamber that's half cover yeah next to jester there will get you into its melee zone it's in the melee zone hold on a second just letting you know you have disadvantage on attacks when you're in melee with something correct it's either get into melee and have disadvantage or take three-quarters cover well it's disadvantage or it gets plus five to its ac your call all right so you get in there you can yes 11 misses the bolt goes wide arcing past it you are in melee range yes all right you're staying there all right that ends caleb's turn yasha caduceus and jester that is a natural 17 a four fails actually no technically-- in casting spirit guardians which is a concentration spell your bane drops so it does succeed okay we'll just walk that back a little bit yeah spirit guardians is a concentration of ten minutes okay then you are in its melee so disadvantage on the attack roll whatever your spell attack modifier is i think it's plus eight 13 misses unfortunately guiding bolt goes wide you turn invisible which means you're still there-- this is the mark that you're invisible that means any attacks against you have disadvantage two space over-- here you mean inside the tunnel you mean that finishes your turn some bad rolls you guys i'm sorry jester you have to move forward to see it you can move there and glance up the side if you want you can see beau cure wounds with-- yes i'm sorry that ends your turn jester it's yasha's turn sure there you go at the moment no because nobody is directly into melee with it they're just within its reach that hits well there you go 15 just hits okay and the next attack how does yasha want to do this the blade shinks out the front and then (squishing noises) with a violent swing the torso splits apart with yasha standing over the back and leaping off behind it where it falls and slides down the steps to the base of the bottom chamber with the hydra slain and fallen everyone looks around taking a moment breathing heavily taking in the much worse way that could have gone a few times both nott and caleb are as you step out you look down and see avantika walking up and kicking the body and looking at the rest of you there's sweat in her brow little smear of her own blood down the front of her face not bad not bad at all you can stay on the crew puts her blades away and that's where we're going to pick up next week what i love the mini it comes with so many heads that was fun well done guys man i wanted that to explode so bad if you had thrown it high enough if you hit it it would have just hit the hydra but that low roll was just this low arc it would have probably hit beau and everything around it in essence with the low strength roll it's probably best that you missed because it would have been-- it would have been like a free fireball essentially i don't know you still can use it you'll figure it out we'll pick up for this next time we play which will be in two weeks technically because we'll be at mcm however next week you get to see laura's amazing one-shot she's running enjoy that we'll pick up this campaign november 1st we'll get to see the aftermath of this battle explore this chamber and what the things you've learned and hope to learn mean until we get to then guys we love you very much and is it thursday yet good night
