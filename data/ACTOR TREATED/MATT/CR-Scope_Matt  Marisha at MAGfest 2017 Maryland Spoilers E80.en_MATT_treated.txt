we found the room (cheering) like the original gauntlet not like gauntlet gauntletâ€“ the initial variation of gauntlet yes marisha ray needs tequila badly (laughter) they say it works well well hi everybody (cheering) i guess we'll do some quick introductions i think some people here already know who we are so we'll make them very quick hi who are you (cheering) yay i am matthew mercer marisha and hi guys i am the dungeon master thank you most of you know the context and for those of you that don't we're just not going to explain (laughter) i'll call you on it we'll be good anyway i was kind of directing it in this direction raise your hand if you have not seen critical role you are going to be so confused i am excited for your journey this evening you're seriously earning some great friend points we're not going to remember tonight tomorrow well cool this will be primarily a q&a we'll do a quick overview of how our weird show came about and then we'll go into questions from you guys i believe we have microphones set up here in the center of the room so when we begin to open to questions we'll go ahead and have you guys very calmly and respectfully line up behind the microphones we would like to avoid clotheslining or pile-driving unless you are a guile cosplayer which i will allow you one piledrive that's the only circumstance check if he has a pulse he's alive we're good audience what's your name audience taylor all right so if anyone gets crushed it's taylor's responsibility to make sure that you're alive thank you taylor audience oh great we're set (laughter) if anyone watched last night's episode you really know the importance of clerics (cheering) yeah because i have to unpack everything yeah yeah i know i should go to sleep but this isn't happening until three well good i'm glad you suffer with us in the best way (laughter) i'm sorry look if we did it any earlier sam would just be that much more late basically yeah mr ducktales for those who don't know they announced recently the ducktales cast it's amazing sam our bard is the voice director for that series i'm forever jealous of him for that i know but they won't take him from us they can try i'm so torn because we want you to support her show blindspot but if it doesn't come back we get her back but no watch the show it's a great show we want to support her selfishly they need heals it makes me so happy or i've instilled a poor priority list in all of my friends one of the two what could possibly go wrong smash cut to me under an overpass bridge in ten years slowly rocking inside of a cardboard-- exactly in the nature of opening the discussion with you guys if you do have a question that's burning in the back of your mind calmly and carefully hopefully without a need of the lifeguards start making your way towards these microphones in the front we'll make two lines here and we'll alternate between either one that type of control only comes from being a dungeon master yeah this is true actually fantastic all right we will do our best to accommodate as many questions as we can in the time we have allotted for this panel which means we'll try and be as concise as possible with our answers so we can get to as many as possible i'm sure there will be many topics we'll ramble on for for an extended period of time we'll do our best to get to as many as we can if we don't get to your question here bring it up in another panel even if it's completely not critical role-related it's fine it'll confuse the rest of our panel you choose if i ever told myself oh yeah you'll be singing musical theater on the internet in front of thousands of people i'd be like because i hate myself because i want to be hunted down so thank you that we have an opportunity for this audience we all have our very deep-seated obsessive love of hamilton but-- yeah that's the thing i'd say knowing our types of humor and our love of trey parker and matt stone i'd probably say book of mormon i feel like the cat that had the petal put on its head and it saw through infinity okay points i'll give you that hi audience awesome audience we've had discussions audience spice we'll just put out small packets of cinnamon critical role brand spice or just different spices in each package you don't know what you're getting oh or we could have a packet of suude we don't tell you how to use it totally worth it okay she'll come into my office at times when i'm working on game stuff and she'll be like hey matt and i'll be like don't look don't look at me pushing maps in the corner (shushing) what and respect is the key because when you consider that a person is at the table to play the game they want to play it for the challenges and the same level as everyone else does and yeah you might say oh they get special treatment it's like you're disrespecting her and her interest in being a gamer and wanting to come at this at the same level of challenge that everybody else is so it's just being able to distinguish that difference and respect as players at the table that that's not the case i have that shit alarmed (laughter) no worries good question (cheering) hi what's your question i was like did i black out for half an hour because i'm an asshole anyway you had a question audience i am sorry and you're welcome (laughter) welcome back and let me tell you how long have you been playing approximately audience deities and demigods but that's the thing though we're going into an age now where not only is the game more accessible to a larger audience but there's less of that stigma to discuss it and people are more interested in either getting back into it or finally learning what it actually is and it's actually a lot of fun when i grew up like you said you're in five games now that would be insane to me when i was 14 audience yeah it was like spotting a ufo you're like wait wait you know somebody else who plays d&d you don't want to join our group no that's fine audience whose backstory do you choose like what order to go in audience i think it depends on their backstories and considering what level of difficulty that might come to fruition in if someone's backstory deals with a drug lord that crossed their family and they're trying to get vengeance on them that could be a fairly low-level encounter that could have some long-running background elements you could tie into the future if someone's like well my backstory is i had one of the evil gods devour my people on a continent that sank into the ocean you're like probably not getting to that until the later levels so that does help at least prioritize somewhat at least as far as the scale of the group's power if there isn't that easy-to-discovery priority list per se then see if there's any that you can combine see if there's a plot from one backstory and another that they thought were completely unrelated that suddenly tie into being the same group or the same villain or perhaps it's fate that came together for this specific purpose or just tell a player hold off a while be respectful i can't do everybody's story at once this is going to turn into the wire (laughter) ambassador it was like a maury episode yeah and good on you for taking up the mantle of helping dungeon master other games i can't emphasize it enough for so many years i've known people who were afraid to pick up the mantle of the dungeon master it is daunting it seems but it's a thrill in its own right to create a story to create a space for your friends to play in and that's your gift to them and let them live and breathe and write stories within that space that you created is-- there's no feeling quite like it audience i know but once you wait for the right moment to release it and you go here and they all go what you're like yeah i don't know which mic to drop there's like six at the table (laughter) yeah i think him matt colville and chris perkins are the only people that know what the next arc in your campaign is i'm tempted like time to steal some money or i'm just going to melt down snow-blind aged 40 years he had no legs it was weird (laughter) talk about training with weights on dude damn very fast workout you first oh you're going to hate them when you're back to your new campaign at level three yeah they're hyper-paranoid they're just strange and dangerous those are fun all of those are good choices look (laughter) i like the idea of an entity that is such a powerful force of nature on such a mythological level that it just slumbers beneath the surface of the world and emerges once every generation or so to rise up and eat for weeks anything in its path until eventually it's either defeated or it's quelled its hunger and then slumbers back into the core of the earth again supposedly on an infinite loop for all of time that's fun also hyper-magic resistant vorpal bite trample attacks it's fun hope they never run into one audience good question thanks buddy you sir hey zeke oh heath i misunderstood that as a fan of heath bars i'm sorry did he really anthony excremancer (laughter) i would say two moments for me one's going to be legitimate one's going to be a little cheesy the legitimate one is the moment that i decided to become a dungeon master as a performer because it was a lot of pressure but it also allowed me a space where i could create and understand so many different varying character personalities from my imagination and give them life give them a voice give them a personality and play in that space it helped me hone a lot of the skills that i still use today as a professional performer so deciding to be a dungeon master-- in a space where the only experience i had was one dude who was a really bad dungeon master and i became one out of spite as a reaction to his campaign really nice guy but just not that great of a storyteller that was important to me honestly it sounds cheesy but the moment that we decided to do the livestream it went against a lot of our instincts for such a personal game and we were like i don't know man we all had our brushes with the internet and the internet being a mob of flaming torches and pitchforks we were like okay do we want to set us up for this kind of heartbreak i think our decision to take it to the stream and hope for the best led to two years of this (applause) thank you for the question hello that's okay hello audience nice congrats audience i played a number of systems growing up d&d was my first introduction into rpg and will always be my dearest because it for a lot of people was the introduction and the kickstart moment of the genre as a whole i grew up playing the palladium universe for better or for worse through rifts which is broken in its own right i love call of cthulhu tremendously dungeon world's a great system actually i've only had the opportunity in recent years to try that one out exalted was fun because you play an anime character being ridiculous you get more benefits for having the most ridiculous combos like that's even cooler then you get more cool because you're so cool because anime exalted is fun in that regard a lot of the white wolf stuff world of darkness is a lot of fun audience that's awesome i've played a lot of terrible systems i played a one-shot in a world called synnibarr which is one of the worst games ever made and i played it because of that it already had that reputation and i was like i at least have to try this once and it lived up to its reputation it made rifts look super streamlined beautiful and cohesive as far as worldbuilding it was incredible marisha yeah that wasn't the intent that was a year and half before we started dating it wasn't i'm a good boy (laughter) (pathetic horn blowing) shut up continue answering your question couples that stay in their pajamas playing minecraft together i think is a very therapeutic experience for the two of you i highly recommend it if it's a rainy day outside get yourself a cup of coffee sit there and be like hey babe you want to build a castle out of this mountain let's do it let's raise some sheep hello oh it's becca becca's our og critter just so you guys know becca i think was legitimately the first critter we met at a convention after the show had originally launched becca's been there from the beginning i just picked songs that i knew and liked no there was a little bit of searching yeah it was like how do i encompass an entire npc's personality in one song i chose elements of each and it was hard to do a lot of mine were songs that i already knew or i was a fan of the bands and picked one that fit for those characters and then a lot of searching as well i'll be doing a second list soon should be interesting thank you becca i think we can get all these questions done in the next seven minutes there's a panel after this right damn right you are that's amazing (gilmore voice) if i do say so myself you look glorious audience oh that's an interesting point who knows some elements might still come in per se who to pick it's interesting you try to prepare as much as you can as dungeon master but the players always inevitably go nowhere you expect you end up having to throw half your stuff out the window that's part of the fun of being dungeon master you go okay let's see where this goes i've been really excited that through the marquet journey they've got to see a bit more of gilmore's backstory which is fun seen some more about allura's history and initial adventuring party a bit the original battle with thordak and stuff like that i would say there hasn't been enough time or interaction in vasselheim the platinum sanctuary and highbearer vord and the history of how kima came under his training and their relationship which is of mutual respect but also tenuous teacher and impetuous student even for as many years as they've been working together and as high ranked as kima is within the order we never had the opportunity to really explore that too much and i don't know if we will depending on where the game goes maybe it will we'll see kima's always been a personal favorite of mine it's a character archetype i never got a chance to roleplay too often which was the all right you guys are planning you're taking too long i'm kicking the door anyway i love that i love the individual that while wise and understands and never acts in a way that would endanger people and is plotting well but still gets impatient and will push even their plot forward in a way that will freak everyone else around them but they won't tell anyone that i got it under control in the end when everything works okay and they're like what are you doing they're like oh it was fine i had a plan the whole time like why didn't you say anything forgot kima works in that realm a lot we'll see maybe one day awesome all righty we have a few more minutes we do have a panel i believe after this right i think so yeah so we won't be able to stay after i'll try to get through a couple more questions as fast as possible and if we don't get to your question like i said come to our other panel keep it in mind and if you don't get to it at magfest maybe hit it on twitter or another convention the campaign guide as it comes to fruition later this year will have information about that they're not well-known within most civilized areas in tal'dorei the continent proper they do exist on the outskirts of society and usually don't interact on this continent too often with the fairer races i guess you'd say they're a little more common on other continents specifically wildemount that's as much as i can tell you audience good question audience to add onto that too characters realistic characters are complicated and full of contradictions and flaws while a lot of media you can pinpoint a few similar traits that can explain a certain character and that may be true most of the time but there will be exceptions there'll be points of high duress there'll be points of extreme emotional pain there will be moments of severe fury or wish for vengeance that a character will act out of their normal active zone those moments are wonderful and human and places you can really identify with as many of us have been in those same places on one might be like no why is that character doing this that doesn't make sense how many times have you done some things that didn't make sense and you may have regretted down the road that's part of the process too we also understand that passion is passion after every episode we get that barrage of oh my god why our first response is like because then we all calm down the next day and we're like eh it's all right audience no worries one or two quick ones because we don't want to hold up the rest of the evening two more quick questions those we didn't get to we're so sorry we have another panel please bring it with you next time question oh how do you price out laura's bear armor i'd have to go back to my notes a lot of it is spur of the moment trying to figure it out based on well the time of an actual suit of armor and then barding for a creature and then custom barding for what is a non-common creature to have armor constructed for it would be like double or triple the cost and then you consider the materials involved are rare materials and the quality of how they were harvested so for that-- yeah to find somebody who's actually comfortable doing this and rolling for them to see if they don't end up ruining the materials and then like well here's half your money back and you don't get anything it can be that complicated if you want to or you can just say uh it's 5000 here's your armor depends on how you want to run your game i run in the middle of not too overcomplicated and a little bit of just keeping the narrative flowing but a lot of those moments like that i didn't know she was going to try and do custom bulette armor for trinket so i went sure it'll cost this much and you have to find this person make notes later to write down how much the bulette armor was you know so off the top of my head i have no idea but i'm sure critrolestats would be happy to let you know (laughter) oh what that's awesome thank you buddy and you for the final question of the evening monsieur audience oh yes it's hard to do that when-- well i've been gaming for a long time and it comes with experience to learn how to bullshit your way to get things back on the rails it may be by the seat of your pants but as long as your players are having a good time it's better to let them guide that to that point so even if it's completely away from your story and you're like all right i wrote three hours of story that we're never going to see that's fine if the players are having a good time you just let them roll and see where the story finds itself at that point if you can find a way to connect it back try to if not finish the session thanks guys that was great and then spend the next week going oh shit how do i bring this back downtime as dm between sessions is huge to try and tie those threads back together but you don't want to feel like you're pushing the players back because they went too far beyond the boundary because i think that goes against the-- the nature of what makes d&d so special is the fact that you can essentially push in any direction and not find an invisible barrier and run off the corner like a bad resident evil character so yeah i don't think there was ever a point where i felt like it wasn't going to work there were definitely many points where i was like i have no idea what's going to happen and the session ends and i'm like all right i got homework good game guys good game audience we do have a signing tomorrow i don't think she'll say no to that you are doing the lord's work guys thank you all so much for coming to our critical role panel (cheering)
