the heads-up on that let's see the other announcements oh that's right new episode of gm tips went up today this one is about how to design and write your own one-shot it goes through the process of initial story design and how to prepare encounters and npcs and be ready for a one-shot circumstance for a single-run arc these tips can also be expanded upon to do multiple sessions or a full arc or even a full campaign but these are little bite-sized condensed tips so i hope they're helpful and inspiring so people can learn a thing or two about running a one-shot or more so check it out marisha you-- that's actually pretty rad you had an announcement if i recall since the triassic it's like you were the harbinger of the end of the circle of life for gamestop you know what i'm talking about there you go good great all righty that being the case let's go ahead-- twins -- and bring it in to tonight's episode of critical role (opening credits) you then eventually found yourselves the ship reaching the outside of the anamn mountains-- anamn islands it's been a long week where the ship set anchor on the outside of the reefs that encircle the center of these three islands where in the center of them lies a partially submerged city of vesrah the last stop on keyleth's aramente and the water ashari that live there you upon arriving just past sunset watched the city come to life and the vesrah come out and upon discovering that you were allies or at least friendly they took you in and gave you the idea of what you had to do to finish this aramente your task to come the following day was to be led down into the aerie of torrent where the elemental rift to the water elemental plane resides under protection and you were to retrieve three lodestones magical stones that are occasionally farmed from the water elemental plane as they fade from power these stones are utilized apparently in both keeping the rift contained and keeping the city of vesrah aloft and up towards the air however in the process of them researching where these lodestones came from it was discovered in the most recent years that they were byproducts of one of the krakens that lives in the water elemental plane and-- there are a number of krakens this one however was drawn back to the rift from one of the earlier expeditions of the waveriders that were attempting to find them and now has taken up its lair on the outskirts of this rift so your task as vox machina is to enter the rift into the water elemental plane find and bring back three of these lodestones and do so without slaying the kraken as it is an important part of the ecology and continued existence of the city of vesrah so that's where we come up so as it is evening you've been fed a largely fish- and marine-based meal and you've had the opportunity to speak with some of the locals and prepare and discuss amongst yourselves exactly what you wish to do for this journey tomorrow so i mean it's probably-- post-food and mild celebration of you guys making it here in the first place they don't get too many intentional travelers most of the people that come here are either shipwrecked saved by the waveriders in the middle of storms and some of them stay and end up joining the vesrah they have a number of reformed pirates people that almost died at sea or drowned but were saved by them and eventually joined them but i'd say it's about maybe close to 10pm the equivalent you got here just after dusk uvenda is around yeah you can find her as you approach her she's finished her meal and is half-napping in this almost a high chair though it's built beautifully of what look to be petrified bleach-white shells and coral structures this looks to be her seat at this open natural gazebo-like eating space she's half-resting off to the side with her staff leaning off a bit and as you start approaching one eye flies open and rolls in your direction and she leans forward young keyleth what do you require my nap yes but you seem intent what do you wish from what we know the kraken is a very hungry beast it carries with it a swarm of long grasping tentacles it moves unimpeded and destroys structures in its path seems nigh-unstoppable which is why maintaining the rift is so important to unleash more of these entities into our plane would be disastrous not just for our city but for the entirety of the ozmit do be aware that you will be encountering this beast deep deep in the fathomless depths of the water elemental plane so be prepared best you can to swim anything that crosses its path you'll see the sand below the vicinity of the rift is partially soot dirt and sand but a lot of it is sprinkled bone of things that failed to make it through the rift it's not the brightest place no we will show you these down in the aerie tomorrow but they're roughly-- and she gives a motion about that big in her hands about that large but you can take time and research the ones that are dwindling within the temple that way you'll know what to look for mainly however they have a degree of control over the waters that surround them those who have returned the waverunners who do these passes every few years they speak of currents swiftly changing it leaving bursts of darkened ink-like material to obstruct the space and they speak of sudden surges of energy that rock through the nearby waters there are creatures but those of flesh and bone usually find themselves in the belly of the beast and due to the nature of its presence and the rift's energy elementals do occasionally wander half-crazed directionless in that space as well so be careful our waverunners they travel usually in various forms of their mer-form anything that can swim quickly swiftly search fast and retrieve and return whatever that is to you that's your choice with the alter self you can give yourself gills and webbed hands and you would gain a swim speed of your normal walking speed should that be your preference sure as she begins to talk about the-- anyway just be warned i would recommend taking some time in the water first learn how it reacts to you and you react to it know that the limitations of not combating in air can be restrictive tonight we could escort you to one of the more deep areas in vesrah if you'd like all right you guys are escorted over four or five structures past the main eating thoroughfare into an area that quickly descends the beach drops down into about a ten 15-foot depth you can see this area is almost like a farming ground for bits of kelp and other sea plants that are just maintained for food you guys just said you were doing it before-- yeah tomorrow is when you actually venture down to the aerie okay so how many targets can you do with that oh don't worry in older editions there were arguments because they didn't specify all right so between all of you including trinket you guys are able to imbue for the next 24 hours water breathing onto the party ten willing creatures perfect ah doty does not need it doty does not breathe all right so you guys you feel this strange kind of sensation as the air seems to change in your lungs but still function it's a bit colder and as you slowly submerge yourself in the water you dip underneath and the instinct is to hold your breath for as long as you can it's that natural survival instinct but the moment you give in and allow yourself to inhale you panic for a moment but then regulate for a moment and feel the water cycle through it's cold it chills the interior of your lungs a bit but you can breathe fine speaking's still a bit of an issue it's still a kind of a garbled-- there's no air passing past the vocal cords your visibility is as good as it would be underwater it's murky it's difficult to get a very clear view of anything beyond maybe a 20-foot span plus this is nighttime it's dark you would have to ask probably for materials to do that you don't have anything to craft goggles okay you pull back and release the arrow and it does fire but it fires much slower and is impeded it only gets about half as far and even then with a dull thud it functions but essentially the-- and this goes for any ranged attacks most ranged attacks i should say and melee attacks are at disadvantage underwater and ranged attacks don't go further than their first range increment so if you look at your bow and it says like you know 60 feet 120 feet you know for first increment second increment it's disadvantage and anything past that first increment is an automatic miss it just stops in the water yeah and that's as far as it'll go also your movement speed is halved unless you have webbed fingers or you know use alter self the minute you submerge your gun the powder is wet your firearms will not function underwater i'm sorry percy all right so for the longbow your first range increment is 150 feet so you're okay but anything beyond that not functional correct yeah you're going against resistance in the water what's your crazy idea no you'd probably only get one shot each 'cause it would pierce the containment the barrel would then fill with water yes let me check actually all right what is your question yes one hour yes yeah you would have 40 they're just regular bolts they're bolts not arrows you're welcome you have no idea but the stories say immense yes yeah from what you've heard yeah you'd then have normal speed through the water for the record with swimming you're essentially flying too i mean as far as in water you can swim in an up and down direction as well it's not gonna help you if what the target's gear melds into the new form the target can't activate wield or otherwise benefit from any of its equipment yes right all that you get in the form of the creature if you become a creature that has an armor class of 11 you have an armor class of 11 alter self you keep all your stuff and just gain the ability to swim underwater correct but it's better than half your movement speed which is really not very fast so your call yeah it's pretty dark from what you've heard and what they've talked about the water elemental plane most of it feels like you're a mile beneath the surface of the ocean there is a little bit of light that comes through you do have some visibility though the source is difficult to really ascertain okay okay call lightning let me check real fast yes okay so you begin to speak underwater (burbling noises) spell isn't coalescing do chain lightning out of the spire as you concentrate on the staff the lightning arcs out of the staff and ends up searing and burning a small section of the floating kelp vines that are wandering up there clears a little area okay you turn into a killer whale you are-- it is about 15 feet deep so you are occupying a large portion of the water nearby it's really hard to swim in this vicinity especially with the density of kelp in the center of this dip okay roll for an attack okay so with your strength bonus-- -- you (laughs) let's see what's your strength bonus yeah so you take we'll say nine points of bludgeoning damage as grog just smacks you in the nose yeah yeah yeah gills right unfortunately because there's still water passing through your throat and vocal cords if you get a full breath of air you can get one spell off and technically with your breathing the water underneath because you already had the gills in it didn't work you get a breath of air and you cast the spell as the air leaves your lungs but once you cast the spell the air is gone water breathing you can breathe the water but when you still-- -- but you can't yeah it's still water passing through the vocal cords-- -- which doesn't have the vibration to make the same sound you could muster that yes all right you guys make your way out of the small kelp farming area eventually back to complete your-- you're doing a heroes' feast okay so mark-- that is totally doable the finest of gluttonous sweets available in tal'dorei are summoned upon this fine mahogany table that thrusts itself out of the sand everyone in the vicinity steps back and kind of ooh ahh at this display of unexpected magic other folks step forward to try and take a piece from it before somebody else stops them with a hand it's not for you you guys spend the next hour eating your meal and gain the benefits of your heroes' feast (all cheer) yeah marisha rolls for you guys-- all right so 11 extra hit points to all you guys including trinket who scarfs up happily at the table wisdom saves you got it the morning is what you were told going to bring you to the the aerie of torrent so as you guys are brought to your sleeping quarters which are these semi-private huts elevated above the water so they are actually about half a foot above the surface you are each given a small chest a soaked damp chest like the wood itself is just waterlogged through and through as you open it on the inside each of you receive what looks to be a leather band with a circular stone affixed to the center of it okay what do you do there's a cluster of them at various-- it has almost like a rudimentary belt clasp on both sides okay it warms as it touches the outside of the neck and it feels like there's a very loose-- almost a vibration to it it does transfer your voice through the water (laughs) you didn't go back to-- yeah it does you guys can talk under water there is still a limitation to the distance you travel 'cause sound is you know actually no sorry the sound does travel further underwater conduit however you also look within the case and each of them has what looks to be spherical somewhat see-through domes of some glass-like material you are also affixed with goggles and you remember looking back you saw some of the people who were part of the troupe here especially the guardians on the outside of the city had the same similar goggle sets hanging around their neck nobody asked-- but they were provided these are standard given to the waveriders the guardians that look on the outskirts of vesrah (laughs) just goggles yeah (all laugh) yes (all laugh) you have a breastplate right actually it's heavy but it's not super impeding you it's heavy but from a mechanical standpoint it doesn't make it more difficult for you to swim it's just more of a (heavy breathing) yeah it is shiny your armor is shiny okay all right yeah it's i mean it takes you a while to get through the whole robe and get it done and it's functional more than visually appealing but you get the job done sure it's not too difficult she's in the same seat snoring loudly while two of her guardians stand at the side with their thin polearm-like blades just watching as you approach and she's just like (snores) one of them takes his bladed trident and hits her just gently on the side with the butt of it she goes (snorts awake) ugh yes young keyleth hm she leans forward putting on the presentation but you can hear just that slight undertone of frustration what can i do for you keep talking please what do you want (all laugh) child there was little left of her and her allies we found other pieces of her friends but pieces her leg was all we found we could not recover much else but the sea floor is littered with the many corpses and pieces of the kraken's various prey it does not take much to ascertain the nature of her end what it does to anything that crosses its path it eats to survive i'm sure there is there are many potential possibilities for anything that happens i only have the information i was able to glean from the various scouts and teams this was four five years back a few days prepared for the journey much like you did that was the last we saw of them i wish i had different news for you her head turns curiously i fear i did not we gave a quiet burial to what we were able to recover but that's all of course and once again i am sorry for your loss keyleth yes yes it is yes you should yes yes you will goodbye (snores) just conks right out again anything else you guys wish to do for the evening mm-hm just like slow narration of keyleth disembodied as they're both just flying over vesrah at night perfect that's perfect all righty so anyone else doing anything else okay okay (disgruntled bear noises) (more disgruntled bear noises) it's various knots and seawater clusters-- it's just not fun all right so morning comes to the sun rises it's a warm day but the waters are crystalline and beautiful as soon as you step out and since you haven't been here during the daytime you can see it's a paradise-like existence the sands that fall beneath the waves are white just bright bleached white and the entire city seems like the middle of this distant tropical paradise the islands that do kind of flank in a triangular position as the islands of anamn they are just lush and green and dense you see no signs of civilization built across them they are just unending canopies that swarm these masses of land that break past the ocean's surface in the distance but here in vesrah the city cluster it's beautiful the water has almost a turquoise-type shimmer when you see the areas that are deeper and you see in various sections where the sand drifts away the sandbank vanishes into the reef and there you can see just an array of colors that refract beneath the water's surface as a gentle breeze kind of blows through in sections it's beautiful okay you guys eventually gather your way for a morning meal and you can see in the distance now some of the waverunners are doing perimeters and you can see that they have large sails that are up on these triangular-like pointed boards that curve up into horn-like javelins in the front and they are coasting on them basically surfing across the waves in the distance doing runs around the perimeter of the reef and they are wearing the same goggles and the same throat pieces you were given this is part of the standard equipment that is given to the waveriders as they check on the outside and the vicinity of vesrah it's a clear sky not a cloud visible beautiful blue above you what do you do to prepare okay she's actually already waiting for you as you guys-- she's been up earlier than you were and-- nice okay yes no the form reverts-- becomes trinket at full hit points carrying over any damage that happens and remember only trinket's or any of your natural form maintains the bonus hit points from your heroes' feast your animal form does not so you just have the base hit points of whatever creature form you take and once you go to zero and revert back to yourself or just revert back to yourself then you have your hit points plus the heroes' feast if it was a shit-ton of damage yeah asking around-- -- you approach uvenda to ask this question even as you approach they're looking out in the distance she says yes that could be certainly mustered and she snaps her little gnomish fingers and one of the guards wanders off comes back a few moments later and retrieves an extra pair of goggles and the throat bead and it's called a throat bead so alter self is a what-level spell you have three second-level spells you can cast and two thirds so you'd have to use one of your third-level spells to do that technically you could do-- you are correct you assume the form of a different creature for the duration a creature different from herself of the beast variety yes no unfortunately the magic is only localized we've recovered as many as we could from previous scouts that have fallen all right thank you okay all right about this time as you've seen uvenda's been looking out patiently the water nearby at the very edge of one of the reef drop-offs splashes out and you watch as a figure darts out and lands and shakes off and what you see there looks to be a very very dark-skinned stocky dwarf wearing the same goggles and throat bead there sorry about the delay he wanders up and pulls his goggles off and rustles his hair a bit hello so you're the ones traveling to the aerie today waverider durent pleasure to meet you and he reaches over and grabs-- as he takes your hand-- you put it out to extend it he grasps it and gives a firm shake you see he's got very very short dirty-blonde hair-- and a beard that is just tattered and knotted from not being kept or combed through kind of yeah he's the venice beach dwarf basically straight-up actually now that you point it out all right i'm taking you down to the aerie you ready well i'm just getting you to the door it's a figure of speech oh you look really excited you shouldn't be now come on see you've got your equipment and takes his goggles and puts them back on they're bulbous they're just these giant domes that make you look fly-like okay now follow suit he looks over thank you uvenda of course take care of them that's not my job and dives into the water all right so you guys follow suit diving in diving in each one of you in the order you wish eventually with doty (splash) just sinking very heavily down after you do you prefer doty not to no he can just walk across the bottom your call correct what's your plan yes or no goes to jump like-- a little seagull flies overhead (all laugh) another one just taking very very good notes eat your heart out darwin doty's on the case it's ridiculous so you guys all eventually dive into the water and as you do you look down and there is essentially a 40-foot-wide gap in the beach here just barely submerged beach that coasts down and drops off directly down into this cylindrical section that is just open and as you drift down your goggles visible you can see around you dry pale reef that slowly gives way to colorful life-teeming reef you see hundreds of fish of different sizes and colors all darting in and out of the various gaps and openings in the side you see vibrant plant life beginning to massively jut out from the side of this reef further down you see eels twisting through and bits of kelp and other long underwater plant life tickle your body as you push past and drift keeping track of where you're slowly sinking down desperately trying to follow this dwarf that is no longer in view he just dove straight down and is far more comfortable under the water than most of you eventually the reef begins to cluster in tighter and tighter and you start getting a little nervous as to if you're going to hit a bottom or hit a pinch point and then suddenly it stops the reef just ends and you now are floating down into what appears to be endless dark ocean and just below you see just a faint bit of light and you start noticing the dark color is because you're about to hit an extremely dense forest of underwater plant life you watch as all of these long thin tendrils of almost vines covered in elongated leaves begin to curl up around you and you start pushing through following this light and as you get across to the edge keyleth you're the closest ahead and you guys have just enough light to watch the bead of where keyleth is keyleth you can still see durent and keep that pace he leads you down over this bank of where the top of this underwater forest ends and you see attached to the reef above by a single pillar of stonework that seems to be built or carved out of the reef emerges a spiraling tower that eventually ends on the floor of the ocean here it's made of a yellowish-white sandstone-like color there are pillars carved out of it naturalistic but also have almost a series of bevelled edges to them within the inside there is a dull green glow that is pulsating and as durent makes his way down toward one of the many openings in the floors you can see there is a very very faint sparkling energy that seems to just drift up out of the center of this tower as you make it further down towards the base you now begin to see through some of the openings the center of this tower is hollow it is an exterior like a very thin colosseum-like structure that goes up for multiple floors slowly pincering as it gets to the top and it is just an open interior inside as eventually you touch down onto the soft bottom of the ocean here and begin making your way slowly swimming towards the interior you can see a number of other similarly dressed waveriders as well as armored guardians that stand all with various trident or spear-like weapons a number of them appear to be of varying races human half-elf elf it appears that durent is the only dwarf you see in this vicinity and a couple of them appear to be merfolk like straight-up half-human half-fish tails fins gills the whole circumstance (laughs) you see two of them one of which is male no visible hair on him actually just the frill that goes down his head the other is female long deep dark blue hair that drifts past and as she shifts and looks in your direction you watch it hold in place and slowly shift as the water currents push through (laughs) as you're entranced by this your attention slowly glides over to the very center the base of this temple where you can see there are these three large smooth gray-ish rocks that are embedded in the ground about five feet wide and in the center of these three rocks you see what appears to be-- it's almost like an oval shape about ten feet tall about five feet wide that is crackling blue energy this opening here and you can watch as occasionally clouds of black murky soot or sand deep deep ocean sand push through you can see as you get closer and peer in this is a doorway into the plane this is the rift unlike the one that you saw at pyrah which seemed to flicker and have a barely contained energy when you've seen it at its torn-open stages this appears to be fairly contained it's demure there's not a lot of movement it's just stationary and the guards that surround it in the center of this temple all look inward keeping vigilant watch as you follow durent making his way towards the doorway you can see within each of these three large half-buried stones there is a smaller deep emerald green almost jade-looking stone that is about that large that is embedded in each of these durent points over to one of them and you hear him through the water the throat bead carrying the sound of his voice through this is what you're looking for this is a lodestone take your time as much as you need to study it find what you need let me know when you're ready to pass through yeah you glance through they're all the same color slight variations and the shapes change a little bit some are perfectly spherical some are a little oblong just whatever shape it eventually hardened into kind of yeah but like a dark dark jade like maori new zealand jade no okay as you put your hand towards it you feel a very very faint vibration actually a very similar vibration to the throat bead at this point now you notice yes they're made of the same material you see that a lot of-- the lodestones' main purpose is here but a lot of the inherent magic of them or at least the enchantment properties of it it's a pretty big part of the general life here at vesrah there is no change but you do feel that faint hum and vibration of power of the lodestone that is embedded within well i mean all over who knows where they've been dropped the ocean tends to swallow things up you might have to dig mostly we find them buried let me show you and he goes over and grabs one and (strains) and pulls it out the doorway flickers ever so slightly he's like it's fine for a moment and hands it to you you take it and for its size it is surprisingly dense it has about twice the weight you were expecting and your arms just (grunts) a little bit also as you're holding it you notice the clasp on your cloak is being pulled towards it as you pull it away and pull towards it you realize these are actually fairly magnetic yes as you're having this conversation you watch as durent's patiently there no but i need the stone puts it back inside okay we're good you do profoundly magical this is a very very strong natural magic source make an intelligence check interestingly enough there are similarities it is not the same material but you've had enough time to study whitestone and get a feel that there are-- this is your first inclination that there are more than one substance that seems to be related to the nature of magic this is-- at least based on the ecology and what little bit of history you've picked up from the kraken and how long it's been around-- whitestone may be one of the more recent sources of this type of power or variation on this type of power but there are certain comparable facets of its ability yeah no that's fine i'd say you have them on you you're percy it's fine they're very simple magnets you notice that you don't-- any sort of pull you feel on the magnet doesn't seem to hit until you're within about a foot or so of the stone okay you pull out your compass as you pull it out you watch as you stand there it's confused it's darting around and doing circles as you begin to step in one direction towards one of the stones it rights itself in its direction (shattering sound) yeah it seems to be a functional compass all right locate object by the way-- yes it does yes okay so you guys ready all right-- durent looks at your faces as you're all staring and goes okay so about time oh yeah i've seen it oh it's fucking terrible you know this this size it's a lot bigger oh yeah hundred it's hard it's spatial awareness look i'm not a science man like these two but it's big thank you yours isn't too bad yourself boy he tousles it up i'd say it's pretty fast aye i've seen him through the door oh i don't go in there no i just watch the doorway that's my job i have not yet seen the kraken drop its lodes no if it goes bad come back just get back you'll fail but you'll get back as you guys one by one plunge through the rift in the aerie of torrent into the water elemental plane and that's where we'll take a break we'll be back here in just a few moments guys real fast we do have a giveaway from our friends at wyrmwood we have a hero vault made of very aromatic cedar that actually smells of the most glorious hamster cage ever it's awesome aww i love that smell it reminds me of when i had my first pet so this will be going out to somebody just to clarify if you want to be part of this you need to come into the twitch chat so come into the twitch chat our code word tonight is guess what 'kraken' so as soon as that opens up in the chat make sure you write kraken in the chat to be entered into the contest and we'll come back with a winner of this awesome hero vault in just a bit [break] yeah it was quick imagine that they will shortly so as you guys emerge-- (all gasp) so this here is the exterior portal into the floor you step out at about two feet below the doorway your feet (two dull thuds) slowly hit the soft cushy bottom of the water elemental plane you see about you a number of thick clusters of various underwater plant life rising up and slowly shifting with the waves and the water you also see throughout the dark sand in the vicinity hundreds of bones and various other chunks of flesh in various long states of decay it is dark down here you maybe have about 20 to 30 feet of visual range right here unaided our two humans friends over there have almost no sight beyond a five ten-foot distance here usually from just the glow of your armor your helm itself has this radiant glow about it okay you're-- you're divining for what okay as you carefully close your eyes and focus you lend your essence out to the raven queen even across the planes to guide your vision to anything of undeath or fiendish in nature and nothing i don't know do you know how to sense krakens looking at your various choices okay as-- as you focus your attention utilizing-- and mark off your ability there you sense nothing you said elementals are on there which one are you choosing okay you sit down and focus and dozens of nearby signatures hit you you're not quite sure what direction they come from but you know that this area is teeming with elemental energy it has drawn many elemental powers nearby (bubbling noise) they do you do i mean your vision in the vicinity is dark and you feel like you're at the bottom of a very very deep abyssal ocean looking up you see a faint turquoise glow in the upward direction but it seems sourceless almost as opposed to straight up it almost encompasses a full dome and you see no sign of a break in the water-- -- and the various strands of plant life extend far into the darkness and strange kind of fuzzy distance where they fade out nope this is her particular spell to cast okay your feet hit and pull apart and as soon as you do you get about four inches of the soft sand before you start hitting black dirt that immediately starts to cloud and obscure your vicinity so you carefully stop for a second okay so you go ahead and you activate so mark off another one of your opals as you activate it as soon as you close the device and you feel it contained within all right you cast locate object laura all right so as vex you focus concentrating on the lodestone that you saw before let's see you feel the direction pull you this way you don't know how far away but the distance pulls you in that direction okay so i need all of you to roll-- is trinket still in your necklace that's not an answer yes this is true yes trinket does not have goggles and cannot talk or cast spells underwater i know i know as soon as trinket (splash) (confused bear noises) pass without a trace-- this is before or after pass without a trace oh that's right yeah that's right (confused bear noises) it's very wet what's going on (all laugh) (distressed bear noises) (bear noises) he kinda lands in the sand looks around very nervously looks at one of the nearby kinda floating pieces of weird errant plant matter and-- (all laugh) i'm okay what is a whale (all laugh) okay i trust you love you okay the slowest you see him start like just bear-paddling a little under the water just like-- mm-hm okay now are you casting-- oh no you're casting pass without a trace i want everyone to make stealth checks stealth checks all of you guys including trinket please 25 right rogues it's his dex yeah all right what'd you roll for trinket nice all right you guys (water sound effects) start very quietly as you can begin walking across the bottom of the floor-- taliesin -- barely your toes barely touching the surface of the bottom making your way in this direction you guys slowly begin to shift this way following this path now you're maintaining locate object you said now you cast-- is speak with animals a-- it is concentration up to ten minutes locate object is ten minutes oh speak with animals is not sorry sorry then you're fine looking in your vicinity you see clusters of ruins you see broken pieces of very very old stonework and looking at them they are scattered throughout the vicinity singular chunks of structures let's see percival go ahead and make an intelligence check okay looking to the left of you as you pass by this one structure you can see the chunk of wall that's visible it is thick enough and tall enough where it looks like it's a sliver of the base of a larger structure that was designed for far larger creatures the sense of the erosion and the relatively smooth edges of the various broken parts to it tell you that it's been there for a very long time giants or larger it's hard to really tell this is not a human-sized-- they appear to have crumbled the structure in which they're placed has intentional placement within here it looks like they're eroding as expected for something that's been there for a very long time no no they're almost extremely smooth just been there for so long and hit with various blasts of water current sand dust and other things for such a long period of time that it's smoothed the entirety of the wall structure all right you maintain the locate object as you guys push forward eventually it leads you this way until you begin to feel the direction change this path there so you lead the path over this way and it leads you to the edge of this wall make a perception check glancing about the vicinity looking over it all you look at the wall it's smooth there's no indentation there's no sign of a stone looking at the sand on the ground at the base of it no sign of a stone make an investigation check yeah you begin to pull apart some of the sand and the black murkiness begins to come up underneath and you don't see anything perception check the compass is currently focused on the same direction that you're moving towards the wall okay nice you glance this way as you're looking overhead you can see a dark very large dark shape right about here looks to be the shelf of some sort of an underwater stone cliff or a mountain of some kind that leads up here like a bank at the very top you see very faint movement looks like individual long tendrils of some kind just barely visible at the outside of your dark vision okay so you cast detect magic you currently in front of you don't see any sort of magical source nothing seems to glow or emanate at the wall or near the base of the wall right let me double-check something here for you okay you faint-- you still feel the direction of the magic where you're looking but you don't see anything on or around the base of the wall do you move around as you and percy find yourself at the other side of the wall there the direction of the locate object leads you adjacent and just beyond the wall on the other side of where you guys were looking you do not see anything okay both of you guys make investigation checks please you're both digging through and pulling at the sand and dig further and it causes the black--- focusing you do feel a very very faint magical essence from the sand about two feet to the left of where they're currently sifting through the sand start pulling through you get past the sand you get to some of the black murkiness and you're careful and start digging before (clunk) you feel one of your fingers hit a hard surface and you begin to pull underneath you pull and begin clearing the space around it and it takes you a minute or so with the help of both taryon and percival but you dig enough of this sand and soot from underneath to get around and you have there currently in your presence one of your lodestones over the wall meet the rest of your allies it fits inside vanishes you feel this slight vibration in your fingers as you take the stone and slowly relinquish it to the bag of holding's entry port it vanishes within you do you get a sense of something in this direction like a line pointing this way all right i need percival-- tary vex and grog who are moving currently to make stealth checks all right are you guys staying ground-level are you curving over are you going around right so you guys make your way around heading this direction following vex as you continue to curl forward vex bringing your way forward trinket's kind of getting nervous of the distance okay so you slowly meander up to the side and help keep trinket quiet for the time being oh god you guys follow behind and-- go ahead and make a perception check you're not looking you're staying back with vax 21 okay yeah you come to this heavy heavy piece of thick natural wall-like stone that is heavily embedded in the ground this is not like the previous ones that looked like it was carved this is just a natural formation of stone that is jutting out of the sand and it's a thick ten 15-foot-wide embankment maybe five feet thick and about six feet above as you approach and get to it you don't see anything that would mark it as different other than a series of-- you start looking down as you're inspecting and you see a series of skulls some humanoid some larger some like almost elongated fish or crocodile-like jaws some of them are older some of them are fresher some of them still have like bits of little thin tendrils of flesh-- (all groan) it's goggles-- and just this little stone right over the larynx (vomit sound laughs) and this cloud of green yellow and brown just kind of emanates from the front of taryon's face investigation check who else is helping yep you're looking on the compass grog's lookout i just need vex and percy 18 13 you guys sift through the sand in this vicinity poring around trying to kind of dig across the exterior of the stone to pull away you spend a good two to three minutes or so searching the vicinity and you don't find a stone it points in the direction you-- okay okay so you start making your way this way okay i need you to make a stealth check you as well roll for trinket good holy shit marisha and all right you guys make your way between areas as trinket comes behind you-- don't want him to stray too far in this circumstance you sense the magical presence of it in the direction that you've been facing but it seems further past what yeah you can maintain the-- okay so you go with them okay grog you staying put or you going with them okay you all three searching then investigation check investigation check investigation check nine and you got a natural one okay as you're digging through your fingers taryon-- hits something hard as you pull up what you think is the stone you look and instead it's a humanoid head that is mostly skeletal bone with strips of flesh hanging off of it with one eye that is a pale swollen pink-white color yeah you just start like (gags) you instinctively step back start yelling about the point there just for the sake of this make a stealth check holy shit okay keyleth as you're carefully looking up in the shadows you watch as this giant dark mound just diminishes and vanishes as you guys hear this you glance about the vicinity and watch as suddenly a series of large tentacles (whump whump) around this large outcropping of what looks like stone or wood jutting out of the base of the floor you rolled a-- 19 you just barely hit the exterior of it when this happens you're like oh i found it you look over see taryon yell and then watch this creature suddenly swift down and begin to crawl over the top i need all of you to make initiative checks all right so 25 to 20 24 22 nice all right 15 13 as you watch this entity suddenly emerge from the top there-- enjoy it so top of the round vax you're up you hear this noise through and keyleth giving the warning as you glance over and see the top of this structure the dark shadow of the kraken pull its way over the top you see this gleaming yellow eye on the one side that's near you and what looks to be three five seven or more tentacles begin to curl over and pull it over the top making its way towards your friends what are you doing okay what's the distance on that 30 feet yeah grog is just in range it is a concentration spell okay so that's your-- you used the haste you have your action what are you gonna do for your movement over here your speed is 60 right now so you can move 30 feet hasted underwater swimming yeah yeah you can do that roll a stealth check okay cool yeah all right so that brings us to keyleth from vex you're not sure you'd probably be somewhere in the neighborhood of 35 40 feet you've used alter self on yourself you've altered yourself right to swim fine i know so how many feet do you want to move she's just on the other side of the rock and as you say that you look up and notice the creature and you see vex's head just barely poke over this stone barrier okay so you're holding your casting action until you see her arrow go because he does not have an earpiece but you do hear it because you're underwater and because of the-- you do hear it it's a little garbled but you pick up the essence of what she's saying all right keyleth you're holding your action okay as the kraken pulls its way over you watch as its yellow eye all of a sudden glows blue and you watch as the edge of its tentacles begin to (charging noise) give off this luminescent blue glow and suddenly this (electricity noise) burst of electrical energy shoots forth from it and completely encompasses the surrounding-- all creatures within 120 feet have to make a constitution saving throw all of you no this is a lair action for the kraken it's made this its lair for the past-- for a number of years all right so- okay so you take eight points of lightning damage percy 23 eight points of lightning damage keyleth you take 19 points of lightning damage 19 halved to eight points of lightning damage-- oh wait actually-- oh no you didn't make it no i'm sorry it was-- right-- i apologize it was nine nine and 18 damage so nine nine 18 18 18 points of lightning damage trinket 18 points of lightning damage grog you take eight points of lightning damage or nine-- sorry nine nine all righty vex you're up as you kinda reel from the sudden electrical shock that pulses out in the vicinity what are you doing yes it's to cast the spell on yourself and you see it just slowly arc-- okay let me see here daylight is this light or daylight 'cause daylight you just choose a sphere for it to happen you don't need to sure sure okay we'll go with that oh it happened it happened so as you hit that-- you're not working out i don't know man kraken just showed up that sounds like a workout to me well on that note okay so you focus as she draws the arrow and pulls with intent in the back of the bow as you do you focus and you watch as vex you aim and then close your eyes as you see this spark of energy curl off the front of the arrow you see bright nature-based daylight burst out of the arrow as you release it go ahead and make an attack against the kraken with disadvantage please no you were right if you choose a point with an object you're holding and one that isn't being worn the light shines from the object you were correct 26 that hits go ahead and roll damage all right so 13 right so the arrow sinks into the underside of the kraken's dark form you're just barely making out bits of its shape as the light hits you can see now close to it looks like ten various tentacles curling and finding its way over the top of this structure it slams into the side and daylight brightly sprays out from under it by the way because daylight-- no it lasts for an hour so you watch as this light is now billowing from underneath the creature you can watch as its pupil adjusts to the light it does not appear to be blinded or have any issue with the daylight however it is now a beacon and the arrow now partially jammed into its side you have a very clear idea and a bright view of the battlefield around it as this kraken is now emitting light in its vicinity so that's your first attack no you've already attacked once that was part of the attack action yep it's not about aim it's about the actual-- the water resistance go for it that hits go ahead and roll damage okay you watch as the spark of energy from the arrow hits it the second time the daylight obstructing your view and the energy bursts around it the lightning damage you're used to seeing from any creature it impacts the lightning seems to just hit its blubbery hide and vanish that's as far as you can get because you don't have your alter self form yet you're like (swimming noises) you're slowly swimming through this water sluggishly as far as you get trinket you want to give trinket any sort of movement on this right here yeah trinket moves up and guards himself behind the side all right percival by the way vax did you make-- what do you want to do for your bonus action you can okay okay you go ahead and spend your entire turn pulling the lodestone out and you're now holding it in your hands okay so that's your action do you want to move at all okay so you move over and you're able to go ahead and put it five ten you're not able really to get any cover unfortunately because the water's like (swimming noises) you're swimming through after putting it inside there and you move along you used your action to pull it up kinda put it inside there as the rest of the turn you just swim past that's as far as you can get all right that ends your turn all right now it's the kraken's turn let's see swim speed of 60 feet it coasts around this direction we'll say it gets over in this side here perspective-wise vex what'd you roll for your stealth again it was-- for your hide because you're gonna hide for your bonus action so go ahead and make your hide check stealth check okay by the way vax i meant to ask go ahead and make a concentration check so it's a constitution saving throw 15 okay you maintain concentration on the-- -- bless to you guys so you still have that all righty so the kraken is now-- its tentacles begin to whip outward it's going to make one strike against vex-- -- one strike against tary and one strike against grog 'cause why not wait that's right you're hidden so it does not it's tary percival and grog that is a total of 32 against tary percy that is 23 and grog that is 23 again all right taryon you take 16 bludgeoning damage percival you take 20 bludgeoning damage grog you take 19 bludgeoning damage and all three of you are grappled the tentacle wraps around you and holds you in place your movement is zero currently until you try and break free all right that ends the kraken's turn as it goes ahead and grapples three of your allies in the process grog it's your turn yes it is okay that's your bonus action yes you can so you shift into your larger form you are still grappled by the creature but you are larger to slam your gauntlets together that wasn't-- does it specify an action on the ability look at the item so you cannot break free currently this turn that is your action to transform you're still grappled yeah okay tary you're up yes you're currently grappled you can't move you can i mean you can't move like your movement is zero you can do things you can still cast any attacks are at disadvantage because you are currently restrained within the grapple attack rolls spells are still unaffected but-- you have some spell scrolls you have patches on your robe and you have your helmet that's not part of your helmet so that would probably be one of your patches okay okay so you rip off one of the patches and you go ahead and you're using hypnotic pattern that weaves through the air inside a 30-foot cube within range so you create a hypnotic pattern around the exterior-- -- of the face of the kraken where the eyes are so as you tear the patch off you release it in the water and you watch the patch slowly drift up and for a second you're like nothing happened and there's a spark out of your hand (pff) and you watch as suddenly there's an array of colors and various flashes in the face in the area around the kraken's face wisdom saving throw what's your dc on the item this is the robe of useful items correct the spell scroll-- oh yes it is one of the scrolls so yeah i'll say i'll just use your dc yeah 17 wisdom save on that that is a 21 so yes it saves unfortunately so as the spark hits the slight flash vanishes and you watch as the lids are still closed tight and they open with this horrible sickening sliding sound and the glowing yellow eyes still seem trained on various allies of yours in the vicinity two eyes all right is that your turn taryon all right top of the round well you've already used your action to try and use the patch the patch is a bonus action then you can do that yeah okay sanctuary on yourself all right vax you're up you glance just barely over the side and you can see it's already wrapped up grog taryon and percy with its tentacles that'd be grog (counts) that's as far as you can go okay to dash that'll give you just the time to swim right next to him okay so are you attempting to-- un-grapple him all right i need you to go ahead and make a-- because this is not you in the grapple this is him-- this is an athletics check acrobatics is to escape from it to help somebody else you're having to actually physically force it off nope you try and grab you're hacking at the side but as you're hacking with the blade you're watching as it's not quite beating past the hide of the tentacle around it okay keyleth you're up a lot of them are yeah three of them okay okay all right the third lodestone is in the direction and just past-- it's this way at least so you're here you're here marisha and it's going this way correct okay you get there and you're still feeling it in this direction okay unfortunately no investigation is one of those things where you spend your action moving through and searching in the vicinity other than your bonus action that's about as much as you can get you just feel it's in this direction from you the kraken's about 20 feet above you party members you have percival taryon and vax i'm sorry that's vex over there okay from-- where does the grasping vine start from this stone right there okay so a vine curls up whips towards-- taryon wraps around-- for this i'm going to say this is an opposed check of the vine versus the kraken's strength i need you to go ahead and roll and add your wisdom modifier no your wisdom modifier just your wisdom modifier 26 it tugs and tugs but it's not strong enough to break free the vine is now pulling back and forth between the tentacle and taryon's like argh being pulled from both sides unfortunately it's a very strong creature okay ending keyleth's turn we come to the top of the round i need everyone to go ahead and make a constitution saving throw as once again-- once again the kraken its eyes light up blue and its tentacles release another burst of electrical energy in the vicinity blessed yes 19 points of lightning damage 19 points of lightning damage ooh 19 points of lightning damage 19 reduced to nine points of lightning damage 19 points all right so you take 5 points of lightning damage trinket okay so that is 19 points of lightning damage at the end of that turn the kraken is going to go ahead and use-- let's see-- get in range here-- going to go ahead and use one of its legendary actions to do a tentacle attack against keyleth that is 29 keyleth you take 21 points of bludgeoning damage i will say i will use these red markers here as people that are currently grappled because you are now grappled and restrained keyleth oh percival because of your hex i need you to go ahead and make a constitution saving throw okay you're fine that brings us to vex vex what are you doing you're hiding behind the rock you watch as four of your allies are now grappled by this creature all right so you cast alter self on you as an action all right so you grab the coin that taryon gave you you focus on it-- and your gills suddenly pull from the side and all your fingers get webbed suddenly and you begin to be able to move at your full-- this rock here okay so that's (counts)-- your full movement okay you still have your action by the way that was your movement to get the-- oh no no no-- sorry sorry action was spell movement you're right bonus action okay make a stealth check okay so you're keeping low at the end of your turn it's going to use its other two legendary actions to do lightning-- yep sorry that's okay it uses lightning storm with its two other actions and begins to charge up now and as most of you are in the vicinity you watch as the front of its mouth-- you now see between the darkness of the daylight that is glowing beneath it the light begins to surge electrical energy you see this strange beaked sharp mouth that opens and as it does bolts of thick lightning energy shock out from it that's going to be hitting grog vax and percival so i need you guys to make dexterity saving throws please 23 you take 11 points of lightning damage you take no points of lightning damage because of your evade and right so you take-- -- 11 points of lightning damage all right that brings us to percival's turn you are still grappled and held in the creature's grasp acrobatics or athletics your choice all right no 16 you try and slide through but it's holding too fast you can't escape unfortunately so that's your action okay that's your turn all right it is now the kraken's turn the kraken is going to shift over here still holding you guys in this vicinity pushes past the area kind of reaching the ground area we're going to say push you up to there it's going to go ahead and make a bite attack against you grog you're the largest meat in this circumstance that is going to be a 27 to hit all right so you take 27 points of piercing damage because you are raging it is halved to we'll say 14 points of damage however as it pulls towards you its tentacles pull up and that giant piercing beak just (gulp noise) swallows you you suddenly-- everything goes dark and you feel yourself being pulled into the dark interior of the kraken the burning numbness of the acid of its interior beginning to burn away at the outside of your flesh you are restrained you are inside you are blind you watch grog even in his large form just disappear inside the kraken's maw that's going to bring us to grog's turn yes you are very faintly you hear (heartbeat sounds) it's like a triple heartbeat yes because you're inside being crushed by its interior muscles that are pulling you towards its digestive tract you can it's at disadvantage okay go for it now it's a regular attack just one roll 30 hits 23 okay all right attacking again same thing one roll 26 hits roll damage 22 all right just regular rage right now right okay let me check one thing real fast as far as the frenzied rage goes all right so we'll leave that as the turn so you go into a frenzied rage as your bonus okay that ends your turn grog tary still grappled and restrained yes as a note too those-- i forgot earlier any of you that are grappled or restrained by the creature have disadvantage on your dexterity saving throws i forgot about it earlier it's fine going forward keep that in mind mm-hm i just remembered from the rules here i'm sure chat room was on that okay hah take you to the goth club all righty it is you still have to roll an attack to hit it-- but it's a melee spell attack i'm pretty sure so vampiric touch all right so you use your action to cast it on yourself and then make a melee spell attack against the creature so go ahead and roll a d20 with disadvantage because you are restrained you can yes 20 hits yeah all righty so that's 3d6 necrotic damage 14 so you do 14 points of necrotic damage to the kraken and you regain seven hit points as you draw its life force away grabbing onto the tendrils of its tentacles like argh' you watch as the necrotic energy pulses into it and pulls the life force into you all righty all right all righty sanctuary is concentration true however if sanctuary is a concentration 'cause vampiric touch is also a concentration i'm saying if sanctuary is a concentration spell-- yeah you could do it every turn if you wanted if you wanted to the sanctuary is not concentration it lasts for a minute so your sanctuary's still on you don't have to cast it again-- oh no you did attack so you cast it again but yeah so you can have both on there we go there we go we figured that out all righty top of the round vax you're up (counting) she is okay yeah i'd say cutting at the tentacle-- i mean both are pretty rough for you because you don't do a lot of damage with the dagger i'll say for the sake of going forward in this go ahead and make an attack roll yeah you can yeah 31 hits go ahead and roll damage not sneak attack yeah the actual body the sensitive part of the body is away 15 points of damage all right you just rush to the side of her and begin hacking away at the tentacle you watch as you're carving into it and it begins to break away it doesn't fully-- okay go for it that hits okay it succeeds what does it say on the item yeah so it's just-- nothing ten points of damage okay it doesn't quite carve away entirely it's close you can see it's taking damage and the tentacle's starting to pull away-- but it's still holding her fast you're still grappled that's the end of your turn okay end of your turn it's going to make a bash action since taryon and percival are right next to each other it takes the two tentacles pulls them back whack and slams them into each other both of you guys take 11 points of bludgeoning damage and are pushed adjacent to each other which you already are so that's that all right keyleth you're up you are yes yeah there's a 30-foot reach on each of these tentacles so you're still just on the outskirts of its reach it's damaged it's hurt it would be easier to break free but it would take your action to do so okay so you point this way actually you are part of the bash so that is an 18 plus 12 so yeah 30 yeah sorry yes you do what'd you roll taliesin and yeah hex is gone sorry buddy you are taryon percival-- yes okay this way you push yourself-- this way how many feet of movement okay so you and vax both okay keeping vax away okay okay so i want you to roll a d20 and add your wisdom modifier yes no it's your wisdom modifier it's a wisdom check not a wisdom saving throw laura and the strength of your control water does actually-- -- is stronger than the kraken's current ability to hold itself in place so yes-- the kraken gets pushed this way about 20 feet you guys get dragged around by 20 feet and you get dragged along with it 20 feet yeah it pulls you-- not vex and vax just you you forced the kraken this way so yes maintaining concentration your locate object fails but you're still controlling and you push the kraken and the rest of the allies that are grappled along with it okay that finishes keyleth's turn we're at the top of this here so let's see as the water begins to force the kraken this way with it being pulled and dragged across part of the rock nearby and seeing everyone pushed in that direction it turns and tilts sideways and as it does it pulses with muscles and releases this giant cloud of ink-- -- that swallows this vicinity 60 feet in the area the entire surrounding vicinity of the battlefield all of a sudden is now heavily obscured by black ink it doesn't-- it encompasses the area and blocks out the daylight kind of yeah like the ancient in neverending story basically yeah vex it's your turn that's one movement there yeah you just move out of range of the kraken but it does not see you because of your hide check earlier so it does not get an attack of opportunity all right we'll say trinket's right there okay there is trinket currently grappling onto him okay so make your claw attack against him yeah i mean all attacks are at disadvantage underwater okay 25 that does hit go ahead and roll damage for cr-- for trinket i was thinking crinket different creature that was with disadvantage right laura and nice 13 points of slashing damage as trinket just rakes into the side of the kraken cutting four distinct lines through the side of its armored crustacean exterior no no there are parts of-- the underside is but a lot of it has this crustacean-like armor on the outside all right correct grasping vine is a bonus action spell yeah but she already used her bonus action to let trinket attack i don't know what's a fey creature that swims underwater you realize this doesn't help you to what cr does the spell say great let me pick one out for you a fey creature there are a lot of fey creatures in the monster manual wizards of the coast just want to point that out okay so you're conjuring a fey creature of challenge rating-- two one creature of two or lower okay so i fucking hate summoning spells so much they are the bane of my existence oh it's okay because they're not in the beast section it's fine it's cool i remember all this it's gonna be great fey creature you know what i'll let you sure oh i see you are right all right where do you want it to appear all right we'll say it's right there you get a shark now at the kraken all righty i'm glad we worked this out all right go ahead and make your attack on it bite attack plus six with advantage it has advantage because it's been damaged plus six it bites-- a battle of futility against the armored exterior of the kraken all right end of your turn it's gonna go ahead and use another one of its points to do a-- let's see yeah it's gonna go ahead and make a tentacle attack against trinket who's biting at it currently that is a 23 to hit all right trinket takes-- 20 points of bludgeoning damage because of his armor and trinket is grappled currently all right as that's the end of your turn percival what are you doing okay what are you using to attack all right so attack with disadvantage that hits go ahead and roll damage it is not a dragon okay all right go for it with disadvantage that hits go ahead and roll damage all righty third attack with your sword with disadvantage 28 hits roll damage 15 with that you manage to finally-- -- cut through the tentacle it tears open you can see the dark purple blood beginning to cloud around the area as you feel yourself freed from the tentacle's grasp that's your action this way so you're heading this way this way okay you can move five ten-- here all right okay well it's a bonus action for rogues to hide i'm pretty sure minor illusion is an action sorry welcome to fighting a kraken buddy okay go for it okay there you go at the end of your turn percival it's gonna use its third and final legendary action to attempt to hit you with a tentacle that is 21 to hit all right you take-- -- 26 points of bludgeoning damage and you are grappled once more (all groan) yes does that end your turn all right top of the kraken's turn grog the acid from the interior of the kraken begins to-- -- begins to slowly pool around you and you feel your flesh on the exterior begin to singe and burn and melt away that's a lot of dice i'm going to go ahead and use the app here that is 45 points of acid damage all right and so turning around the kraken's going to make its way back-- oh no trinket oh no trinket is left this way it's going to swim past to there-- correct i agree the kraken has an ability called freedom of movement the kraken ignores difficult terrain and magical effects can't reduce its speed or cause it to be restrained sorry your shark does yes as does trinket technically from the shark yes you do trinket has disadvantage 22 from the shark nice all righty and disadvantage for trinket trinket unfortunately his claws strike against the back of its armor as the kraken passes no effect all right yes oh that wasn't the damage yeah that was to hit so yeah roll damage for the shark 13 points of damage from the shark nice yeah all right so as the shark bites and watch as it tears away makes its way over towards the grappled keyleth its jaws open with its beaked mouth that is 24 to hit all right 22 points of piercing damage and keyleth you are swallowed by the kraken yes you see nothing it is black blind darkness on the inside and it's not darkvision blindness it is folds of internal muscle tightening flesh across your entire body so not only is there no light but there is no room to actually see anything even with your darkvision you scream into it like grog as you're being devoured sure all right that ends the kraken's turn grog you're up you are unable to really feel around you're like holding your hammer here and the whole thing is squeezing against you and the muscles are pulling in tense well what are you trying to pull out you could probably pull the alchemy jug out if you wanted to yeah all right and you force it out and hold it on the inside okay the jug now produces a bunch of oil it gets to fill up the inside of the jug or a kraken all right so you produce a bunch of oil for your action inside the jug is that your turn okay that brings us to taryon taryon you just watched keyleth the pinnacle of leadership the guiding force in this whole adventure get swallowed by this terrible writhing sea monster what are you doing taryon okay you can it's just any attacks are at disadvantage and you can't move okay go ahead and make a-- this would technically be-- a melee or ranged but we'll say because it's so close roll a d20 twice with disadvantage so so with your attack bonus for the attack twelve you reach out to pull it out and throw it it tenses once and then-- and it just-- it floats away before it just slowly sinks into the sand and rests there you channel brazio and stare at him to give him disapproval with wordless okay that ends your turn taryon that ends your turn i believe all right vax you're up okay make an investigation check 18 18 okay you just get to this part of the sand and you start sifting through and it's causing this cloud and you hear the water just being rapidly whipped through and cut behind you from the rapidly moving tentacles as you pull through you just begin with your action to uncover what looks to be the very peeking top of the final lodestone bonus action is a weapon attack so you manage to-- correct all right that ends your turn then it's going to use a legendary action to attempt to hit you with a tentacle that is a 28 to hit all right yep that is-- 28 points of bludgeoning damage liam okay uncanny dodge as the tentacle wraps around you currently now nine it had ten now it has nine that might possibly be an option all right so that's vax's turn keyleth you're up we'll say that you're just as the muscles squeeze you deeper in its body you kind of slam into what feels like a hard bottom of a boot make a constitution saving throw as you were damaged by the piercing maw which is we'll say 24 so go ahead and-- can't remember what the number was but we'll go with that which you have advantage on because of your warcasters constitution saving throw okay so you maintain concentration you do yeah no it is muscles tensing and a thin layer of acid and oil is inside the jug currently you're in the stomach not the esophagus you can spend your action to try there's not a lot of water in this space right now it's mostly like actual stomach acid of the creature and muscles that are tensing around yeah okay i need you both to make dexterity saving throws with disadvantage yes okay at disadvantage what's the dc on the spell for your staff so it'd be your spell dc yeah so you do not make your save your spell's too powerful so you go ahead and roll damage yep so go ahead and roll 8d6 damage to you you and the kraken usually if a creature's fully submerged in water it has damage resistance because of the water around it however the spell is inside of it so i will say that it does not get the fire resistance you take half damage 25 was what you needed to force it to make a constitution saving throw well based on the circumstances i halved the damage required for it to make the saving throw to regurgitate however a fireball explosion based on the-- yes all right so-- no as the fireball explodes the oil that you created inside ignites and also detonates roll a d20 for the strength of the jug okay the jug withstands the force of the blow (all cheer) the jug however detonates for an additional 18 points of fire damage to both of you and the kraken this is on top of what you did correct that would be 43 fucking rolled a natural one i'm not even joking on its constitution it's a dc 25 constitution saving throw even with +15 it's a natural one and so (explosion) it bursts inside you watch the eyes bulge on the outside of this kraken as suddenly it vomits out a burst of smoke dark kind of bloody water acid and both keyleth and grog are jettisoned out of the front of the kraken's mouth nothing you would yes okay go for it remember you still have your wild shape forms too okay that ends your turn keyleth all right secondary legendary action to go ahead and as soon as you guys emerge one of its tentacles wraps out in your direction keyleth that's a-- plus 18 yeah that hits you for like 32 so as soon as you emerge you look around one of the tentacles wraps around you and you take 19 points of bludgeoning damage and you are grappled by the tentacle all right that brings us to the next lair action everything is still obscured in this black inky space by the way oh you guys missed that while you were away the kraken did an ink jet and filled this entire 60-foot radius with ink the whole area is drastically obscured well lasts for ten minutes while you're concentrating did you maintain concentration-- that's true-- well save right now right but you just took damage from the-- from the tentacles however you are correct the water jet did clear out the ink from this area not wisdom plus your constitution okay that's enough you maintain concentration so yeah so you've now cleared out this section this section is cleared of ink control water the stream you've been doing has cleared out this area so yeah all right so-- all right at this point as it is now the 20 count on the lair action the kraken once again gives another pulse of electrical energy everything in the area i need everyone to go ahead and make a constitution saving throw all right five points of lightning damage 18 you take ten points of lightning damage keyleth ten points of lightning damage so five points of lightning damage ten points of lightning damage grog so five points of lightning damage and trinket was what ten points okay so keyleth goes unconscious you watch as she just gets jettisoned out and the lightning streaks through her and eyes darken and she kinda falls limp in the water as the tentacle begins to slowly draw her back to its maw vex you're up that's as close as you get right here in this position you spend your action to free it and you get it out of the water and put it into the bag of holding so you have a bag of holding colding okay yeah you can put it there it has enough space you have all three lodestones currently correct okay shark moves here yes right there this is percy this is taryon okay correct 15 unfortunately it's just gnawing at it but it's not quite breaking through it's tough hide all right so you swim backward this way how far which direction towards the rock here that's about as far as you can get unfortunately you have alter self on you right you cast it-- so you can make it we'll say that's as far as you can get no reason to hide you're still out in the open you don't have anything to hide behind unfortunately actually you do back up into the ink cloud so you can which is not obscured to the kraken so you cannot hide he can still see you in the ink cloud yeah so-- it didn't-- this whole area is filled with ink so you just cleared out this area here sure all right trinket on your turn moves up to the back of it-- (bear noises) oh trinket can't move you're right yeah trinket can't move right ten points of damage trinket just tears with his jaws into the side (growls) no he did not i'm sorry that ends your go vex at the end of your turn it's going to use its third and final legendary action to go ahead and attempt-- let's see-- it's going to attempt to make a bash attack against percival and vax which pushes you two together there's no way to escape it you just whack slams you both together and you take-- liam and you take 13 points of bludgeoning damage both of you all righty that ends that percival you're up okay correct 17 does not hit the first one you can't quite get your arms free and you swing-- you just barely-- carves like a centimeter into the creature's flesh 19 hits go ahead and roll damage 13 points of damage 16 does not hit unfortunately takes an action to do so yeah in this circumstance the best bet you want to have is gills and fins so you can swim okay so your alter self is in that ends your turn percy that brings us to the kraken legendary actions return kraken is going to shift around up and over there so we'll say for the purposes of this-- not quite going to curl over the top there trinket does get an attack of opportunity no because it just moves into the space between you and keyleth the shark does not-- yeah 'cause the shark was attacking percy's tentacle so it was not in reach to attack the creature trinket was not he already moved before 'cause trinket was grappled before he could get into space with it all right it is going to use its lightning storm so i need four bolts of lightning that's going to be against-- that's going to be vex taryon percival and we'll say vax dexterity saving throws you guys at disadvantage yes if you're grappled so hold on was that five 25 points lightning damage percival 15 25 points of lightning damage so 25 reduced to half 13 points of damage 29 you take 13 points of lightning damage well it's evasion so if it's half you do nothing you failed so it's halved so yeah you take a quarter right i got confused so yes so half that as well all right that ends the kraken's turn grog you're up you are right next to keyleth all right so that is 4d4 plus four mm-hm you get 12 grog you still have your bonus action you are frenzied and you have your movement okay so you come up onto the actual-- -- kraken okay so you're right there okay so go ahead and make your attack so just a single roll 28 hits roll damage 35-- 25 points of damage you just whack bash it in the side of its face (growls) yep that ends your turn grog all right taryon okay 20 does hit roll damage 22 points of damage as you slam it and it begins to dissolve it it is not enough to break free but it is fairly hurt and still holding onto you good to know all right taryon that's your turn vax you're up okay go ahead and roll attack with disadvantage just to see it doesn't get caught in the water and float away yeah it's just enough strength for you to chuck it and (swoosh) hits the sand right next to her you are no longer restrained-- you are next to keyleth yeah basically yes 34 with that the tentacle holding keyleth is torn asunder you using your dagger to cut her free and the cloud of blood left behind and withdraws she is freed yeah all right that brings us to keyleth keyleth you are freed from the tentacleand you are conscious but up above you as you look up into space you can see the giant kraken maybe ten 15 feet away from you grog is slamming in the side of its head and vax is right there looking over you right now yeah trinket taryon and percy are currently grappled okay no what do you wanna do don't have rules for eels we'll use that saying a giant constrictor snake has a swim speed of 30 feet that's the same speed as-- marisha and make your choice keyleth most snakes are 30-foot swim speed sea serpent monstrosity you can't do what are you doing these are creatures you would know yeah yeah what creature are you choosing is my question snake-- i'm sorry you need to pick a creature you can't make up statistics here let's see here so most snakes i'm seeing here have 30 feet swim speed what are you doing as you're casting your spell it's your aramente what are you choosing what form okay eels we're using the statistics for a snake all right i-- whatever fine you are all water snakes you're majestic ten-hit-point forms as water snakes you all suddenly transform-- -- into these tiny snakes we'll say for the current purposes of this until it comes to the kraken's turn everyone who is currently grappled is not grappled because you are a smaller form until the kraken's turn so we'll have to see whose turn order is what all right so-- that brings us next to the initiative counter 20 so i need all of you guys as snakes to make constitution saving throws i know you did choose electric eels which-- no hold on i know because you chose eels-- -- the electricity has no effect weirdly-- -- this worked to your advantage for the 20 initiative count so as the pulse of electric energy shoots out from the kraken it shocks around and through all of you but your physical eel forms take no damage as they're used to conducting energy vex your turn 30 and you're gonna use your action to dash as well that's as far as you can get all right finishing vex's turn all righty that's as far as trinket can go there he doesn't have a double action he moves in your turn roll an attack for your shark 21 hits roll damage all right 12 points of damage to the kraken gotcha all righty it's gonna go ahead and use lightning storm costing 2 of its actions it's going to focus this on-- -- taryon grog and-- because you were the source of its magic and it is horribly frustrated keyleth i need the three of you guys-- oh fuck it's lightning storm it's not-- you're all eels what am i doing i'm-- it's been a long week and i keep forgetting my fucking shit it's okay all right so it makes a lightning storm-- -- that strikes you guys-- -- and yeah it tickles your fancy a moment as two of its legendary actions all right percy it's your turn respect respect on the electric eels that i gave you weirdly saving your ass right now 20 25 30 you just get out the other side just barely seeing the eel-vex ahead of you just swimming through oh end of vex's turn it's gonna use its last legendary action-- -- to attempt to make a-- -- a tentacle attack at-- -- at you vax the one that just recently severed one of its tentacles that is a 28 to hit ten plus 18 28 the effect is still on there so yeah for dex saving throw no it's an attack roll against your ac which as an eel is like ten so you take damage that is 18 points of bludgeoning damage 28 28 so your eel form is destroyed-- -- and you take eight points of bludgeoning damage and you are grappled 'cause it has almost no hit points the lightning did nothing but it just bludgeoned and grabbed and squeezed around the eel and then you formed back within its grasp all right you arguing just making sure i know it's all good i just i ruled you guys to have ten hit points in that form yeah flying snake is like five hit points so you're fine so that ends-- all right so that was on percy's turn end of that turn it's back to the kraken's turn the kraken gets its legendary actions back liam and yeah vax went then you turned everyone into eels and then it went to the 20 count so now it's back to the kraken you did it's okay all right the kraken's going to do three bashes it's going to be against grog it's going to be against keyleth it's going to be against taryon grog that is 29 taryon that is 31 (laughs) and keyleth that is 34 all right so against grog that is 24 points of bludgeoning damage you are an eel and grappled you are out of your eel form and you're grappled so-- well your eel form just goes dead then you take-- what did i say again it was 24-- you take 14 points of bludgeoning damage-- still raging-- halved to seven taryon your eel form is destroyed that would be 22 points so you take 12 points of bludgeoning damage and you are grappled keyleth-- lucky roll that is 14 points of bludgeoning damage your eel form is done you're grappled and you take four points of bludgeoning damage eel freed itself so now you're back up on your feet taryon as well you can against him or the tentacle all right reckless that hits 22 points of damage you slam into the tentacle and it's still holding but it's looking severely damaged it's starting to-- the muscle's starting to tear apart all right that brings us to grog your turn grog your turn go for it 30 (all laugh) 16 points of damage you slam it again this time the tentacle tears open and you're free you are no longer grappled you're gathering at this point like somewhere having around 30 points of damage gets rid of the tentacle you now are down four tentacles total six left just below you about ten feet is keyleth and vax all righty all right keyleth i need you to make a constitution saving throw by the way with advantage 'cause you took damage-- with the shift form you're fine go ahead and roll damage for that plus your-- ha so roll the d10 times two 18 yes you do so roll two more d10s yes well nine plus rage damage-- well 9 times two so it's 18 plus rage damage plus your strength modifier you destroyed the tentacle the tentacle's dead yeah keyleth's tentacle is just smeared like a-- you slam into it and watch as a cloud of dark purple liquid kind of goes past her face the blood from the kraken clears and the tentacle just goes limp the section that's been removed from the rest of the tendril go for it so roll for-- yeah it hits 22 you slam into the side of vax's tentacle bash it bash it it's starting to tear apart but it's not enough to free him entirely all right your movement is 50 and you've not used alter self right yes that's-- yeah but you have to use an action to do so so that's five ten-- -- 15 20 25 'cause your movement's 50 normally so that's as far as you can get just kind of swimming by trying to get over there ends your turn grog all right end of your turn it's going to use lightning storm two actions it's going to hit grog vax and keyleth need all three of you to make dexterity saving throws with vax at disadvantage nope no just vax that's not going to make it unfortunately correct correct and taryon as well actually well it's not at disadvantage wait you're restrained you are-- yes so yes you do yeah so 24 points lightning damage 24 points of lightning damage keyleth falls unconscious once more vax no no what-- you take 24 reduced to half-- yeah so 12 points of lightning damage reduced to quarter-- -- six then grog-- 24 points lightning damage reduced to half travis and all right so that was the end of grog's turn taryon your turn okay (all laugh) all right heal yourself 35 you still have your bonus action if you want to do anything vax you're up sanctuary technically is still lasting 'cause it's not concentration well no every time you attack you lose it you're right i keep forgetting that so yes you cut a tentacle so sanctuary is back up okay yes yes she is okay all right you just escape the grasp all right by the way all your guys' forms you revert back to your normal selves you are no longer eels so you're backing up 30 feet you are hasted so yeah 30 feet you just get out of the range it's going to take an attack of opportunity on you with its tentacle that is-- nine plus 18 is 27 to hit you take-- -- 21 points of bludgeoning damage halved to ten and you are grappled by the tentacle all right keyleth it's your turn you come to consciousness once more you watch as vax is darting off and a tentacle wraps around him you see taryon pulled but the rest of your allies are rushing off in the distance what are you doing you can't see from where you are it's actually blocked you just see this giant jutting underwater structure no you only got rid of part of it here the ink cloud still sits in this vicinity you're casting it again okay around you it is grog it is vax and it is taryon and a shark all of you towards the portal all right say 20 feet five ten 15 20 five ten 15 20 five ten 15 20 yeah i mean taryon and vax are still grappled by it and this-- the kraken gets moved to there 30-foot range so you're right there and yank him towards you you cannot see this unfortunately no this is all obscured with ink right now this thing got pushed this way-- actually with your control water that pushed this way would have cleared some ink in this area but right now this whole structure is blocking it you cannot see this rock this here you can vax is right next to it well the grasping vine only pulls things towards where it emanates and since he's right next to this it'll just pull him right against it tary's right here as well it'll just pull him into the rock you still have your bonus action your wild shape miss five hit points not to tell you what you're doing but this is your thing and you're at five hit points right underneath the kraken the closest to it you're here liam and what are you-- what are you shaping into killer whale all righty i don't actually i did not come-- i'll say for the sake of this-- for the time being this-- -- this naga will be your killer whale sure that'll work all righty yes you've cleared out some of the ink in this area that's your turn all righty top of the round the kraken is going to go ahead and-- the water current seems to shift in the opposite direction i need each creature within 60 feet of the kraken which is all of you to make a strength saving throw yeah all of you 11 23 all right so you only get pushed ten feet okay pushed ten feet okay 22 is a failure all right so that is 60 feet away from the kraken for everyone who failed so you're right over here pushed away the water just rushes through and pushes all of you away trinket is pushed-- -- 60 feet that direction roll for the shark if you could it's gonna maintain its grapple on you guys you guys are just being yanked in that direction yeah so no that's not gonna-- so the shark gets pushed up into that there actually you do but it doesn't do any damage it just kind of pushes you and the tentacle kind of holds you there keeping you grappled it's not gonna release the grapple yep all right so that brings us to vex's turn all the ink has now washed away to the space and everyone gets pushed away by the force of the water okay so there and you can just-- -- see over this way you can see your brother there-- -- you see the kraken you see everyone being pushed to this way and everything being shoved to that direction all right go for it yep 25 hits go ahead and roll damage nope that's enough your arrow goes right through and that's the last bit of damage it needs to actually sever that tentacle freeing him all right you could certainly try if you land back down that way-- so go ahead and roll-- breaking line of sight just barely go ahead and make a hide check 22 okay okay the shark has a speed of what 40 30 35 40 just barely gets up into the space to hit it so 26 hits 14 points of damage all righty sure yeah but it's fine you haven't done enough damage near enough to really threaten the kraken yet so you're fine all right ending vex's turn end of the turn it's gonna use its last legendary action it's going to go ahead and make a tentacle attack at you that's as far as trinket can get all righty that is a 29 to hit it's your ac that is 18 points of bludgeoning damage and you are grappled right so nine and it grapples you once more with that tentacle five all righty percival your turn that's as far as you can go what form that's right you did yeah so yeah you leap out you are through okay top of the kraken's turn-- it's gonna move over here-- grappled vax it's going-- giant beak-- -- opens up towards you that is a two plus 18 that is a 20 to hit because of the haste bonus i fuckin' rolled a two okay all right as it goes and snaps towards you-- however hang on however while you were attacked you were restrained so-- -- restrained creatures attacks against them do have advantage so that is a 28 i just realised that 'cause it says-- i forgot it says here-- it says until the target's grapple ends the target is restrained and attacks against restrained creatures have advantage no sorry so that is-- 15 24 34 points of piercing damage and you are swallowed all right that is the kraken's turn grog you're up you watch as it just swallows vax as his eyes go limp and the jaws just take his not moving form and swallow inside you do 'cause you're back here make an intelligence check i know all right what are you doing okay so you just get into melee range sure go for it okay 35 points of damage you go ahead and sever one of the nearby immediate tentacles as it's whipping around you okay as you finish that strike you feel this strange sense piercing into your relatively unprotected skull as no language peeks through but you get this very strong angry hungry sense-- this emotional force that says oh now you've made me angry you start realising very quickly that this creature while it seemed like a force of nature has been just feeding but you've got its attention now its instinct has turned now to its intellect to reach out to its food you've made it angry what are you doing with your next attack all right that hits 17 damage all righty yes it is damaged but it's still there 31 hits 25 you destroy another tentacle as three are currently remaining correct that ends your turn you used your full speed to move up to it okay taryon okay so how many charges-- okay so you use all three charges go for it so go ahead and make your ranged spell attack with disadvantage that hits go-- 17 just misses you try and squeeze it by and the ring releases and it smashes into the rock and destroys part of the nearby plant life which then begins to just float away chunks of rock and sand and some of the underground dark soot begins to billow out the tentacle still remains affixed around you all right it is going to use one of its legendary actions to attack grog with one of its remaining tentacles that is a 34 grog you take 19 points of bludgeoning damage reduced to nine-- -- and you are grappled okay against okay go for it that hits roll damage 21 points of damage you slam into it it looks like it's pulling apart but the muscle's still holding tight vax i need you to make a death saving throw with advantage okay brings us to keyleth you're back here grog is closest to you grappled and there is taryon on the other side that you cannot quite see you would yes correct you're free over here yes yes correct well you have your beast shape you used to turn into this form your wild shape you used to into this form alter self just gives you gills and fins you used-- animal shapes you've already cast on everybody-- right but you lost concentration-- -- when you went unconscious okay grasping vine from where you can have it come out of the ground here if you want it to grog is right here so pulling up this way okay so we'll say pulling this way all right go ahead and roll a d20 plus your wisdom modifier correct which is your wisdom modifier is plus six right all right so you pull grog this way and with grasping-- -- vine that's a range of what what's the range of your grasping vine how long-- how far does it pull right so you-- okay you can pull him out of the range it does break-- yeah so you do break the grapple on grog and pull him away from that all right so your movement correct no you're a whale still you haven't taken any damage you just got pushed away which actually technically in whale form you couldn't cast the spell so would you drop your form okay so keyleth-- keyleth is back into that cast the spell you have your-- well you have your-- you can cast your-- -- second level or lower as your action and you have your movement still okay and you're gonna move towards the-- so you're gonna stay here or move towards the kraken are you not moving you're right here right but you can see my fingers there you go so we'll say there yes do that all right i need everybody to make-- -- a constitution saving throw 13 points of lightning damage percival you're not there that's right keyleth constitution saving throw 13 points of lightning damage 13 vex wait wait you were at five before ooh yeah keyleth goes unconscious yes eight you're zero you just fall unconscious all righty a 20 all right so you take 13 points lightning damage 13 points of lightning damage all right so that's 11-- -- six points of lightning damage to you grog all right so control water is dropped that ends-- -- keyleth's turn the 20 count vex what are you doing you saw keyleth just go-- -- get shocked as the burst of electrical energy shoots through the area and she just kinda goes limp again and is kind of floating in space you would've just barely seen it over your shoulder and heard someone say it over the earpiece you have your bonus action for a dash if you want to try and get closer it's up to you what are you doing okay what level hail of thorns no keyleth is over here currently no fourth level you still have a fourth-level spell you did that's when you pull-- that's right you did yeah okay fourth level so that is an additional 4d10 piercing damage towards the attack go ahead and roll the attack 23 is the disadvantage okay that hits 4d10 okay plus 18 points of damage so as you fire the arrow it sinks into the side of its mouth just bursts with thorns in the vicinity kind of roils but it doesn't seem to have any effect you have your secondary attack if you want to okay go ahead and roll 29 hits okay you already used your bonus action unfortunately to cast the spell okay percival you're on the other side of the portal looking through and you're watch-- i mean you get a slight-- if you peek out the side it's still obscured and like the water-- the daylight spell is still kinda shooting out from underneath so it's this beacon of light in the underwater area so you get a decent view of what's going on you see keyleth kinda go limp in the distance you see grog there you see vex trying to shoot okay nope it is a cantrip you concentrate through the portal and you watch just short of about 30 feet past you a little shimmering space looks almost like a fish but it's sort of translucent and blob-like it's not really gonna help in this situation sorry all right end of your turn it's going to use-- all righty as you pull back through and it returns it's gonna ahead and use-- it's taking another legendary action to make a-- this is gonna be a tentacle attack against you grog with advantage that's going to be nine plus 18 that's 27 you take 12 points of bludgeoning damage plus ten that's 22 divided by that 11 all right percy's-- you already used it sorry it is now the kraken's turn at the top of the round you lose a death saving throw as the acid begins to slowly burn away-- oh no i mean like you lose one as the acid burns the acid is slowly digesting you it's gonna move four five ten 15 25 30 we'll say for the purposes of this you're right there grog space is getting a little cluttered over there i mean it hit you and grappled you one of its remaining tentacles-- tary is-- you're being pulled up over the rock and dragged across liam and like oh god over there that's a 34 you take-- this shit's getting intense oh my god (laughs) that is-- -- 29 points of piercing damage halved-- to 14-- and it swallows you a second time pulling you into its body-- you are consumed and restrained once again in its dark space inside as you're pulled into the-- that ends its turn grog you're up nope ah as you're pulled inside the voice comes up again and it's now emanating outward to you as well vex and in the unconscious darkness of vax and keyleth the voice just says i've been here a long time and i'll be here long after you are dust feed me and give me sustenance i'll find my way through somehow grog all right so-- you can either reach around for him try and feel for him-- you can take a healing potion as a bonus action if you'd like oh it's not for you you can make an investigation check to try and find him this is gonna be your action to do so the kraken not from what you've seen you guys haven't been doing focusing damage you've been trying to move around him he's lost a number of tentacles but-- no they do go for it feeling around inside you're unable to find any current form of vax right now however you still have your bonus action and you are frenzied all righty so what potion is it all right 4d4 plus four hit points oh laura do you want your shark to do anything by the way that hits roll damage 14 points of damage that was one that had previously taken 22 points of damage-- the shark actually does tear the tentacle free so technically taryon before you're about to get dragged over the coals of the top of this before the shark actually tore into and removed your grapple from-- it is down to two tentacles four here four there it is your turn now yeah there is actually-- there is a small kind of under-- kind of a low bridge you can move 15 feet as you swim through 15 you can just get out to that side yeah on the kraken yes you do two more you don't see any-- it is a big creature your friends are somewhere deep inside its fleshy digesting interior the outside is armored and filled with very very taut muscle and hide so yeah you would probably not damage your friends if you were careful oh shit okay so as a prismatic spray in this direction-- out this way it'll just crest past the front of the kraken and the tentacles-- let's see here prismatic spray that's a dexterity saving throw on that that is a 23 all right so roll for your first beam which is against the kraken itself are you focusing on the kraken or one of its tentacles currently no so it'd be just the kraken all right so roll a d8 to see which beam hits it five that is 10d6 cold damage so go ahead and roll that 35 points of cold damage reduced to half because it made its save that's 13 all right you get that sense all right nah it's one of those things where it just damages the creature you have to focus a specific physical attack on one tentacle all right that brings us to the top of the round vax go ahead and roll a death saving throw with advantage a regular potion you mean a patch potion using the patch is an action i think originally sorry so vax all right so keyleth death saving throw please nope just a d20 what'd you roll all right so you failed one death saving throw let's see then after that it's-- all right vex trinket and taryon make dexterity saving throws please 11 six points of lightning damage six points of lightning damage six points of lightning damage for trinket yeah all right well yeah yeah yeah he is keyleth you fail another death saving throw you took lightning damage all righty vex it's your turn you have an unconscious keyleth over here okay cast it so that was a total of what seven so keyleth you are conscious you heal seven hit points you are conscious all right ending vex's turn percival-- actually vex you still have movement if you want to you have nothing to hide behind it's hard to do that right now but you have the door that way there's a little gap all right that ends vex's turn percival anything it can just barely get there go ahead and roll an attack okay holding your action to just sword at the ready okay 28 hits roll damage all righty that brings us to-- -- the kraken's turn top of the turn the acid burns through you even further vax you fail another death saving throw that's two all right top of the kraken's turn it's going to-- let's see who's in range here this is kind of nuts all right it's going to make a tentacle attack at both-- at the shark vex and keyleth that's right two tentacles so it's going to make one at vex and keyleth you gather this creature is far more intelligent than you think it's not a natural beast it's a fairly intelligent creature that is a 26 versus you you take-- well the good news is i'm rolling shit damage that is 18 points of bludgeoning damage to you vex and you are grappled by one tentacle and against keyleth you are-- it's technically not within five feet of you that's a natural one i was like i'm pretty sure he had advantage because you're prone but prone is the creature has advantage against any creature that is within five feet of the creature otherwise it has disadvantage so yeah that's one thing that saved you and that's gonna be-- just the two attacks that's all it can do this turn all right that brings us to grog you're up great weaponmaster as well or not two-handed versatile means you can hold it with two hands pretty sure that's how it works i'll check real fast i'll double-check the wording just to be safe oh it's a heavy weapon not-- so yeah you cannot you were right 29 just gonna double-check 'cause the internet's gonna get angry at me 29 hits 20 points of damage 22 hits 24 points of damage all righty roll damage that in its own attack is enough to make its constitution saving throw let's see if it-- that is a four plus 15 is 19 is not enough to make its constitution saving throw it vomits grog and an unconscious vax-- -- out in the front jesus christ guys you're killing me so grog it's you you still have your movement yeah yeah 25 you can get there all right ending grog's turn taryon no he's unconscious with two failed death saving throws-- there you go sam yep no you're right over here you're-- what would taryon do at this moment you're about 50 feet from him yeah uh-huh sure i'll say-- all right so-- there you go go ahead and make your attack with disadvantage you pull it back and fire and it goes (kerplunk) and the bolt just goes and floats up and you're like shit okay so you'll be-- all right ending tary's turn vax death saving throw with advantage with no luck left the last bit of air escapes the lungs of vax lifeless on the ground all right that ends your turn obviously keyleth you're right here on the ground you see vax not moving you see vex currently grappled inside there and grog and everyone rushing in this direction towards the portal you are ten feet from vax and 15 feet from vex or ten feet from each actually yeah okay all right you can you can grab-- you can grab vax-- and begin to tug him toward vex at half speed so that's five ten-- right but you're-- -- you're dragging him behind you as you go five ten 15 20 25 30-- you're like just in the space what're you trying to do oh shit okay all right and with that the three of you vanish the shark vanishes plane shifting where plane shifting where keyleth okay all right they vanish grog all right so that finishes keyleth's turn top of the scale here i need both of you guys to make dexterity saving throws grog and taryon dexterity 18 all right you take eight points of lightning damage-- grog that is eight points-- yeah reduced to four all right percival all right end of your turn the last legendary action to attempt to grab and grapple grog with advantage because you-- that is 26 you take nine-- ten points of bludgeoning damage being reduced and you are grappled yeah you can 23 hits go ahead and roll damage 23 that one had taken 13 damage earlier that tentacle is destroyed there is one left you are no longer grappled there is one slightly damaged tentacle left as you do so the voice says no come join your end here in the depths all right that ends your retaliation percy's it is now-- wait so that was percy's turn right right okay it's gonna come forward here it's gonna do lightning storm against both of you i need both taryon and grog to make dexterity saving throws once more all right that is a really shitty roll 13 points lightning damage-- -- 13 points lightning damage okay it was 13 minus that to-- -- seven so taryon falls unconscious i know so grog it's your turn okay laura and okay so the gills and fins appear your webbed fingers and what're you doing no unfortunately because you used your action to do the ability on you however-- oh wait wait you have the-- so you have the full movement-- you are just on the outskirts of it and you see percy yelling at you all right coming through at 20 grog i need you to make a dexterity saving throw that is 10 reduced to five five points of lightning damage against you taryon you fail a death saving throw-- -- automatically 'cause you take the damage from the lightning tary is-- 40 feet yep your running speed is 30 all right percival what're you doing percival what are you doing all right grog how are you looking what are you doing what are you doing percy grog make a wisdom saving throw with advantage because of heroes' feast actually it's supposed to be charisma checks against him what are you trying to do wait are you trying to intimidate him all right make a persuasion check with advantage that's how technically it's supposed to work but i'm giving you-- 20 okay okay grog you come through and see percy looking at you and oh shit you don't wanna make him mad he's your buddy okay all right the kraken is going to go ahead and make a bite attack against you because it only has the one tentacle left that is an 18 plus six that is 24 that hits you you take-- that's 23 points of piercing damage 23 reduced to 12 because of your raging and you are-- oh you were not grappled by the kraken so it does not swallow you (all cheer) well it's 25 there it's gonna take an action to pick him up what do you want to do grog it's your call yeah what do you wanna do grog well it's up to you friends affects him more than it affects you technically he just seems very persuasive okay moving back with him because your strength doesn't reduce your movement (counts) 25 you don't quite reach the edge no it takes your whole-- to pick him up and get there you only have your bonus action right now if you have one yeah so there you go you take it it's 2d4 plus two 2d4 plus two ends grog's turn taryon make a death saving throw 11 so you're fine that brings us up to the top not quite yet we are at the 20 all right that's a dexterity saving throw from you grog it's just all-out shocking 16 that is 14 points of lightning damage to you grog yep halved to seven automatic death fail all right that brings us now to percival okay well currently there is no tentacle in your range right now the tentacle's in range when it's wrapped around somebody you can hit it right there right now it's just in the distance you can grab and pull taryon you pull taryon through his unconscious body through you have a healing potion okay so i'll say that between your movement you'll have enough go ahead and 2d4 plus two to taryon 2d4 plus two to taryon taryon is conscious all right it is now the kraken's turn the kraken is going to sit right here now directly behind you grog its tentacles swarm it's the one tentacle all these broken tentacles that are trying to extend you can see parts of it are regenerating and starting to extend a little bit not fully but it's going to take a while for it-- but you can see it does regenerate over time you know what at the end of percival's turn it's going to use one of its legendary actions to attempt to bash natural 20 so that is 17 points of bludgeoning damage against you reduced to half that would be nine yeah and you are grappled now it's the kraken's turn and it is going to attempt to bite attack you it does not have advantage that is a 20 that is 18 points of piercing damage reduced to nine and you are swallowed all righty grog it's your turn go for it all right 20 that hits 24 all right that hits it has to make a constitution save that is directly a nine plus 15 it's a 24 the dc is 25 it fails and vomits you out again to the front of it jesus christ i'm going to take a picture of that so people-- -- are like that's a little too close and you do as you step away through the portal (laughs) i can't believe that shit i just tweeted that final saving throw on his end wow and that's where we're going to
