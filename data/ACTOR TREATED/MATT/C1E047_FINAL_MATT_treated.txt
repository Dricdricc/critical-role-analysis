so-- that's awesome fantastic well cool guys then let's go ahead and get this show on the road so last we left off vox machina having to traverse the world in search of artifacts known as the vestiges of divergence ancient items of power used in massive-scale warfare in ancient moments of history they had acquired one from a sunken temple of the champion of the raven queen taking the life and thankfully not permanently of vex'ahlia over here the party then retrieved their first artifact and made their way towards the pyrah tribe of the ashari druids the fire guardians of the gate to the elemental plane of fire which apparently thordak the cinder king the great red dragon that helms the chroma conclave that just tore through all of the civilization of tal'dorei emerged from apparently by that i mean confirmed universally tore through you guys went there found a surviving faction of the pyrah tribe including cerkonos their headmaster as well as a few members of your tribe the air ashari keyleth and your father you went towards the remnants of the cindergrove ran into an ally a strange blue-scaled dragonborn by the name of gern blanston master of necromancy and candle-making and combining the two for interesting effect you fought your way through the cindergrove tearing through elementals encasing efreets in hamster balls and holding them aloft for extended periods of time worked out well and then managed to seal the gate with the help of the druidic tribes there gern and the intrepid adventurers of vox machina after which you went to spend the evening there on the mountainside to rest before continuing your journey to wherever that next step may be so the rest of you are beaten bruised and winded over the previous series of battles and the accomplishment you achieved here at the top of the caldera of this mountain the erupting seismic energies and molten rock that once spewed from the center of this rift have calmed and the gate once again has been sealed to its dormant controllable and watchable size you guys are free to make camp wherever you'd like not yet you're about to set up rest there are sections as you're walking out of the cindergrove that you can see members of the pyrah tribe are pulling up still-functional pieces of huts and tents and things that were destroyed when thordak tore through the rift and they're beginning to reassemble a place to stay for the evening for themselves so if you wish to stay among the pyrah tribe for the evening it seems to be at least a relatively safe bet most of them are made of pieces of stone the actual blackened grey rock of this mountain elements of it have been fused together with bits of glass to forge these thick very sturdy walls when they aren't being torn through by a colossal red dragon so they're being brought back up druids are using what remains of their powers from the fight today to assemble more walls of stone and they're basically creating ramshackle living spaces using their magic all right so you begin throwing up some stone walls to help build a small shelter for the evening the rest-- you've lost sight of gern gern went back into the cindergrove and began essentially gutter-sniping what pieces of red dragon scales he could locate in the vicinity he has not been seen since that moment who knows to where he wandered okay so you guys watch as scanlan rummages through some of his side pouches and belongings pulls out a few elements a small doorway carved from ivory he pulls out a piece of polished marble a tiny silver spoon and puts them on the ground in front of him closes his eyes for a second-- yes you may you guys are mildly confused but as he picks up the items you can see the door sets off this small spark of white energy that glistens in the air hovers and then creates a somewhat shimmering doorway just standing in the center of the space in front of you any creature you designate when you cast the spell to enter so you could say the entire pyrah tribe if you wanted everybody in the group or the pyrah here there's close to 35 including the zephrah through the soot and ash and the rather somber atmosphere here that paints them as a people that are the survivors of a horrible calamity beyond that there's probably a few that you'd consider attractive sure if you're that kind of person you see some of them stop and drop the rocks they're currently holding and building some of these small shelters they all look at each other with a strange glance and continue building their current shelters okay you open the door and as you grab it it is a solid door and the handle spins you look inside and within you see an incredibly lush foyer to a grand mansion a 25- 30-foot ceiling made of marble and dark woods you see a two-part staircase that splits off onto a second-tier floor you hear soft music playing in the distance and immediately you see two somewhat ethereal servants come down dressed as a butler and a maid they come down with an echoing voice that say how might we be of service let me take your things master by the time you go to stop him three of the servants that have grabbed a few of your belongings and been carrying away are swung at craven edge passing through and their energy dispersing and their contents of whatever they're carrying drop and clink to the ground this maid comes over a plumper older woman no feet just drifting along with this path of mist behind her yes master but of course master it is my purpose master what does one but enjoy their purpose in life and continues braiding his chest hair these tiny little hairs doing a very good job it's not very long but sure enough there is a pattern of course master but of course sir we have an entire winery as part of the mansion all right an ever-spinning top on the banister at this point grog you can see that the servant you had sent off comes up with a very large somewhat spectral flagon that upon handing it to you turns into a solid metallic form and inside-- -- a very very finely chilled very nice-smelling wine it makes contact a little cushy but it does make contact yes the servants gather up a platter of food piling up grapes and meats and cured ham as soon as you pop out of the door it all turns to smoke and dissipates at this point keyleth returns with a few straggler pyrah tribal members that come in looking about surprised bewildered and some of them a little freaked out by this transdimensional space they just stepped into tardis-style servants come up and start helping them some of them are still clutching the rocks they were building as they pass it off and start making their way out to various rooms to inspect the mansion a few stay back to continue what they were already building ensuring future establishments to sleep once you guys have left so yeah you guys are welcome to rest for the evening if you'd like it takes a minute so yeah with a flash of deep blue and black light trinket emerges (bear noises) they all look at each other right away sir and all five of them drift off a moment later they all return with a spectral cow no each one of them is just traveling with one cow they've all brought you together one spectral cow there's just one cow you touch it and it has weight to it it has surface area there is no blood no blood they all look at each other and shake their head no sir we have limited resources here the cow we happened to have one at which point the cow disperses yes you guys walk out of the foyer into the main hallway and at the end to the left you see a doorway appear where there wasn't one before it opens up on its own and as you walk you can see stairs that lead down and into a basement chamber that has a sand pit surrounded by brick there are a series of wooden training dummies and various training accoutrements there are chains hanging from the ceiling for lifting and climbing exercises there is a basic set of weapons against the weapon rack and a basic set of armor on the other set just the two of you okay trinket comes along with you and in a very confused manner attempts to train with you for a short time it's been a while since you wrestled a bear so it's kind of fun at times trinket backs up (bear growling) looks over at you again like are you sure across the sand flooring into a giant rolling attack towards you that is going to be what's trinket's attack bonus plus eight that's a 23 to hit you go ahead and take seven points of bludgeoning damage go ahead and make a strength saving throw so trinket rams into you and you hold firm and flex conversely the giant bear bounces off stumbles back onto trinket's butt licks you right along the face beard cowlicks up a little bit you do all right hop nothing grog it's not very strong okay that's true with vex not there trinket gets a little antsy and eventually your training session with trinket comes to an end as trinket goes to seek vex you can finish your wall climbing in solace okay okay the door opens up at the first knock (creak) a gentle classical piece with a small low-timbre brass section comes in yeah it's nice it's not too involved doesn't distract you too much make an arcana check 14 okay looking over the broom you can tell it's enchanted there are runes along the sides of the broom you do gather from the nature of the enchantment that it is an item that requires a spoken phrase from the wielder to initiate its magic short of an identify spell you would probably have to guess if you know the identify spell that would be a way for you to make an intelligence check or you know what this would be specifically investigation investigation check you do notice that many of the runes intricately carved on the side of the broom are-- they're part of the enchantment however there is a certain phrase that is not part of the enchantment it's scrawled into and very cleverly hidden amongst the broom it is not common what languages do you know it is not a language you recognize do you point it out to her it is draconic it's archaic draconic it's from the base root of the language which is one of the oldest languages in civilization it spells out phonetically the word for candle at which point the broom jumps up in your hands and almost lifts you off the bed for a second and you catch it and hold it back down it's a pretty big elf hand compared to your tiny gnome hand how high are the ceilings in your room for this room because it is an extradimensional space this room is probably a good 50 feet high high ceilings with drapery it's so garish yeah better write that down (hacking spit) welcome to d&d as the words emit from your mouth the broom takes off and you have to aim it a bit you start going around in circles slowly rising up towards the roof of the room (whistling) you do and you start going whoa go ahead and make a dexterity check yep that's fine you're fine a really bad roll might have had a circumstance but you manage to catch yourself on the broom in time and okay you're getting the hang of it it's still not something you're used to but it's fine you do and you take a few minutes to figure out the pitch and wobble of it and it's less of a directional flight more than it is a combination of how you hold the front of the broom and concentrate on its direction but nevertheless a few moments pass and you get the hang of it she drifts out of the room the door (slam) shuts behind her you lean back in your bed on your fine black silken sheets with flight of the bumblebees still blaring by the fireplace they all get up the music stops and they all slowly drift out of the room one by one fireplace still crackling not a worry so good so anyone want to do anything else you going to go rest for the evening all right you all eventually find your ways to your rooms happy and comfortable in the fact that no one has to take watch for this night as you all get to bed a few hours into the evening keyleth you are just starting to doze off when you hear a knock at the door you open the door on your door keyleth it is cerkonos please open up i wish to speak with you okay cerkonos comes in the first thing you notice-- previously you had seen what was his burned-off arm at the shoulder you can now see the flesh is extended and is currently very slowly in the process of regenerating his lost arm and it catches you off-guard for a moment and he puts his hand up and says sorry it is not very presentable and he still keeps his hand over it slightly embarrassed by the mid-regenerative state of it i'm sorry to have disturbed you i come as unease has taken my mind and he enters the room and closes the door behind him may we sit he goes over and takes one of the nearby chairs and sets it down places one across from him for you to sit gestures with his one arm sits down i would not speak with those i do not trust and i have seen your purity of soul keyleth so i come to you with these concerns his eyes trail off for a moment in the distance and he gathers his thoughts and his words four years ago a young woman came to pyrah for redemption a lost girl cast out and wishing for acceptance we as we do with outcasts took her in taught her and in time called her one of our own one of the pyrah in recent months she began to grow distant taking to staying in the cindergrove unattended for days at a time one afternoon the mountain moved angry with shifting fires we felt a disturbance in the gate and when we went to investigate there she was commanding powers we did not know she had these were the magics taken by man who defied the gods these were the purest of ancient arcane threads we watched as she reached out and tore open the gate she laughed as we called out to stop but something terrible emerged from that wounded sky this dragon you speak of yes i defended all that i could but the power was too great and unconsciousness took me i awoke to my people in tatters the fires untethered and this terrible girl gone it is both embarrassing and greatly alarming that we could be infiltrated by such an entity that blame falls on me as the headmaster for not seeing this earlier when she came to us she couldn't be more than 15 perhaps she did not seem to blossom into womanhood as many do we considered her more of a runt of her litter if you will she seemed human we take many forms as druids if she was indeed human at that age to command such power i do not know her true nature her name was raishan anyway i wish to tell you this because my heart is heavy with guilt and i want you to know that even in places of comfort family be careful keep those you know you can trust close be mindful of those that promise aid when they have not proven themselves if you have an instinct follow it i just do not wish you to make the same mistake i did anyway i thank you for your companions and you coming to our aid it shall not be forgotten should you need the aid of the pyrah though we are not much at now come find me i look forward for to you bringing zephrah together you will make a fine leader kaitiaki keyleth cerkonos leaves that is true that's all you know is the name raishan was used when the conclave attacked emon and it seemed the name belonged to the green dragon that initiated the assault where you guys were so these thoughts echoing through your mind-- you sleep but uneasily as all of these realizations swirl in your head eventually sleep takes you but it is not an easy sleep just enough to function barely vax as you yourself have attempted to stave off sleep for many days pushing yourself to your limits it finally takes its toll and you drift off into a deep deep slumber in that slumber you find yourself in darkness echoes of a distant voice muffled as if underwater crash the darkness is shattered into a thousand black feathers and you find yourself falling falling falling towards what seems to be a tangled net of glowing threads you're afraid you might impact at such a speed but before you do you slow and come to a stop before this extremely prominent glowing weave this infinite tapestry in all directions you are uncertain of the meaning of this moment when a large cold hand reaches past your shoulder and grasps a thread right before your face this singular glowing thread pulsing with light like a heartbeat you follow the arm over your shoulder and glance up directly into the massive form of the raven queen porcelain face like a mask long jet-black hair her body encasing you like a physical cage your eyes follow the arm back to the thread that she carries between her massive fingers she tugs it ever so gently and it causes waves to ripple through the tapestry into infinity her voice fills your mind both calm but cold this is you my champion you are fate-touched the choice is yours rebirth or ruin maker or martyr conqueror tyrant or nothing she plucks the thread from the weave snapping it you plummet into the hole left behind it falling faster and faster into the dark losing control you turn around and see the raven queen disappearing into the distance growing smaller and smaller until suddenly nothing grog you fall into a deep snore heavy heavy snore after drinking the wine climbing up walls you've had an exhausting day of-- okay you are face down it's great you've drooled into the sand and it's clustered around your beard it's horrifying but in the middle of snoring this restful sleep also comes into your mind and you find yourself walking alone a long hallway into blinding light you have to cover your face it's so bright but you push forward because you know there's only one way to go you cannot see but you can hear around you and sense the hallway's ended and there's now space around you you cannot see but you sense an arena gladiatorial in nature you can hear the distant whisper and hum of crowds cheering you sense others around you closing in suddenly a voice ever-whispering in your ear says release me still blinded eyes closed on instinct you pull the cold dark blade from your back and swing wide over and over again feeling the shuddering shock of each impact your strength matched by the razor-like edge of your weapon cleaving down any who would approach the high of adrenaline is incredible and you laugh aloud at the sheer thrill of your own power the light subsides and your vision returns you look to see hundreds of people dead at your feet farmers children you see pike motionless cast among the carnage you want to scream but instead you laugh against your own judgment and intent like you're locked within yourself and have no control and as you look up from the pile of corpses at your feet you see a towering figure before you cast in furs and bone standing even a head and a half's height above you is kevdak looking down at you with pride the entire herd steps up beside him staring at you atop your throne of corpses and the herd kneels kevdak bows looking up at you smiling you you have finally made me proud grog you wake up (gasp) spittle and sand and grit mashed against your face who knows how long it's been but it's been a while since you've had a dream let alone one like that now as you all eventually come to in the morning having your evening's rest you've recovered your hit points your spells all of the usual good stuff in a fantastic mansion maybe not the most fantastic rest for some of you but a fantastic mansion you all eventually find your way to the breakfast nook which is as extravagant as you would imagine a scanlan-based breakfast nook would be there's a fantastic breakfast feast already prepared rows of servants along the walls waiting eagerly to attend to you guys as you sit down pouring fresh juices it smells fantastic and most of you look rested except for a handful you haven't tried it before you hear a voice go (grunt) trinket's over there face covered in breakfast food trying to sit at one of the edges of the table like a person the actual bowing of the wooden bench that trinket's on you hear the creaking as he moves around in it you guys watch as vex all of a sudden (whoosh) takes off above the breakfast room all right laura i want you to go ahead and first roll a dexterity check 13 okay you almost slip off the broom in the process of drawing the arrow from the quiver you catch yourself and just barely manage to pull back and fire i want you to go ahead and roll an attack with disadvantage 16 (impact) the arrow does get relatively close to your hand but it does stick into the turkey okay make another dexterity check 13 okay this time you start falling off and you catch yourself entirely the arrow just goes wide you don't even get a chance to nock it in the bow so much chicken guys servant rushes forward more chicken sir right away vegetables sir chicken it is south of westruun your herd wanders all across the silvercut roadway that whole area to the west of westruun south of kraghammer east of emon that vicinity osysa no the scrying that you saw was umbrasyl the black dragon that took up residence it seems in gatshadow the mountain north of westruun at the base of the cloudkeep mountain range yep that's where you guys initially that happened at the time because you were not specifically paying attention to this ability of yours there is no specific tree that has caught your attention you could attempt to make an intelligence roll nine unfortunately you can't recall the specific location of any trees in the frostweald it's been a long time since then and you weren't being conscious of it at the time if you would like to yeah if you want to yeah the trees in the area that you would know that you recall there was a there were trees based around the crossroads which is the middle point of the silvercut roadway that's even further northwest and west of westruun there's the bramblewood forest which is just north of westruun most of them would be further west from there those are the closest not on up in the mountain but watching down probably you didn't notice in your scry okay so you're going to the crossroads the crossroads is about two days of travel northeast of the frostweald about three days' travel here we go this is the frostweald this is westruun this is the crossroads this is emon this is kraghammer it's right here it's by westruun the crossroads is over here you can totally take the crossroads but it'll be-- bramblewood forest okay that's fine because you spent a lot of time in westruun specifically you do recall various locations you take a moment to concentrate on a few trees actually within westruun you recall there was one that was near a playground where you had once interrogated a small child if they had seen-- yep you begin to cast the spell and you concentrate on that tree in the park there's no connection to the tree you gather that the tree may not have survived the initial attack on westruun however you do take a moment and you do recall at the entrance to the bramblewood when you guys were briefly attacked by that group of thieves that were pulling you off to the side pretending to be a stranded caravan there was a series of rather large trees that marked the roadway there and you recall one that had distinct markings and you do manage to find a point of concentration or connection there you complete the spell against one of the petrified trees on the outside of the cindergrove the doorway opens up and you guys can see a thicket of bramblewood trees on the opposite side you all rush through one after the other trinket jumping behind you all make it through and you're now standing on the central pathway of the bramblewood further south you're probably about an hour and a half foot travel before you exit the southern portion of the forest to the frostweald you're about a day and a half on horseback you're about a day under a day on foot you're looking at about two days' travel a little over two days' travel sam and that's a rapid pace you're fast in mist form it would be a little bit faster than a horse so keyleth what are you doing are you doing the-- so keyleth goes ahead and casts-- is it wind walk all of you guys take a moment to transform into a mist form and you all begin to coast right around the top of the trees making your way south to the back of the bramblewood as soon as you exit the top of the trees you can see westruun ahead of you and there are a number of interesting things that catch your attention first and foremost you see halfway between the treetops to the south end of the forest and the very north part of westruun there appears to be a large green open field with thicker patches of grassland here and there there is a section that is a grassless dirt mound that has as you start coasting over you can see what looks like spikes of wood a couple of things that glimmer in the light as you pass over and what looks like large grooves dug in a haphazard pattern this patch is about 15 or 20 feet across and you see two people bringing a cart away from it yeah these wispy people-clouds (wind) no one seems to pay mind the two individuals that went away with the cart are a little far from what you can see at this point but they both appear to be humanoid in no particular rush but they're hauling this large cart away as you look you can see in this patch of dirt the glimmers that you saw was a smattering of gold and silver coins that appear to have been tossed into this pile it looks like there are pieces of wood that have been broken and crushed in the giant grooves who's taking the intense look at this one right now okay so the two of you i want you to roll investigation checks you recognize and you get a feel for it too because of your specialty in this you notice that the giant grooves that tear into this are actually sweeping claw marks like something of a large size and a very fast speed came down and has come down multiple times to snatch up something that was placed in this location right which as you're seeing this now yeah you would gather the information with him as you did do you guys continue southward coasting on the outskirts of the city you guys begin to coast around the outside of westruun drifting up above as well this wispy pattern of clouds you get a view of the external farmlands that dot the north-northwestern side of westruun a number of them appear to have been burned not like forest fire or cataclysmic meteorite like intentionally burned the crops are charred and black and there's a pattern to how that was set a few farmhouses also appear to have burned as well but there are farmlands that are also functional and you can see people tilling the land i want everyone to make a perception check okay so people above 20 would be the twins all right so vex and vax you guys look over these fields and two things you notice one each set of farmers that are working there is a well-armed individual on the outskirts of each of these farms that is intently watching them work as you're paying attention to this one of them walks over and starts screaming at one and pushes them over and then stands back and keeps guard you also notice that the outside of the city there appears to be some sort of construct or battlements almost like another wall a very thin wall has been built around the various entrances to the city can't talk to each other no not in mist form it's up to you guys do you guys want to go investigate or do you want to keep going south you only see two that are actually in the immediate farmland and they're quite a walk away from the actual city they don't appear to be on heavy lockdown yeah that's possible in the form vex you see vax your brother stop in front of you put his hands up and point downward with his hands you guys all follow yeah it was really confusing to you all right you guys all drift down towards the ground as you see vax begin to take on physical form on the outskirts okay are you going down to the burnt farmland or one of the healthy farms there are a few of the fields that are more high crop corn-style stalks okay percy vax and vex all take a moment to revert back to their physical form all right scanlan keyleth all right so all of you including grog or are you staying in your mist form you all take a moment to revert to your physical form i would like everyone to make a stealth check what did you get again where'd the party go you all begin to weave your way through the various lines of high-stalk crop where are you heading are you heading in towards the city or are you heading towards the farmers as you guys are having this conversation you can see there's a slight rustle and a farmer comes across carrying a small satchel as he's picking things off of one of the nearby areas about 15 feet from you he doesn't seem to notice you guys the farmer turns (gasps) you now see him it's a man in his late 40s early 50s gray beard yeah he keeps picking you can see there's some heavy bruising on his face and part of his cheek is swollen he goes it would be hard around these parts to find someone who likes a dragon let alone that one not the worst of the worries right now though the ones who work for him every one of them otherwise they just go ahead and steal from whoever's nearby isn't a caravan that's made their way past westruun in the past week drops the fruit he has in his hand please please help us please they have my daughter those beasts keeping a lot of people he leans over nudges towards the direction of the city i don't know his name he looks a little confused i don't know they just take what we have who are you talking about i don't know they're all different types i haven't seen the one who has them they have them half-orcs-- interested in whoever keeps him at bay i don't know they take whoever seems useful sometimes they take them and slaughter them before us as a warning i don't want to think about it he points over to the city but there's one right out and you see him pointing angrily around the corner probably to the one that you saw on the outskirts of the farm area you guys came down in reginald once every couple days maybe about half a day ago dusk yesterday i don't know we all stay inside around that time just in case i haven't seen anything flying but the dragon there was a huge fight not more than a week ago between these people and that thing they seem to have come to an accord the orcs the whatever they are the big strong angry ones that keep taking all of our stuff some do the dragon came in and tore everything down burned liquefied dissolved portions of this city people screaming and then it left both of them from what we saw green and a black i think a white one but that one kept going all of them kept going we thought we were safe we tried to re-gather and then within a day a bunch of these bastards came and took what was left slaughtering stealing from what i've seen i don't go too far into town they keep me out here but i've seen a few perception check most of them are yeah 17 okay you don't see the guard nearby you guys want to try and find him okay you guys begin making your way towards the direction that vex saw the guard you start pushing through the crop making your way to the edge and at the point where these high crops end it opens up into what looks like a heavy root-based field potatoes carrots things that are beneath the ground you guys see across the way the two other farmers that were out there the one that you saw being loosely beaten they're both filling satchels and emptying them into two larger carts that are put up to horses one of them a larger pony you see what appears to be another hulking humanoid taller than an average person skin slightly gray a smattering of tattoos across the body you recognize-- from what you can see you actually recognize this individual this is an individual that you knew quite a ways ago a young goliath who was still about a half a foot shorter than you when you knew him he was named horace because he hated it and kevdak gave him this name and you actually at some point in the past recall even giving horace a good beating a little of the smaller of the goliaths you've encountered this is years later this punk kid and he was kind of a punk has grown up now and is still smaller than you by a size but still seems to be every bit of an agitating little bitch you remember from the way that he's treating these people not in his hand at the moment no but he does have across the back what looks to be some sort of large blade sheathed glancing about because it is a pretty open area you can see the secondary guard is walking away looking to check one of the other homesteads there is a farmhouse yep it's flat farmland on the outside of westruun as soon as you break the south side of the bramblewood it's just plain i'd say the other guard's probably a good 400 feet yeah okay so as you all take a moment stepping into parts of the stalks of the edge of this land vex you go ahead and start taking up leaves patches of dirt mud from freshly watered ground and you start smattering the rest of the group with it you guys are going full arnold from predator you begin to blend into the vicinity you can be prepared for it when it happens the spell expends when cast so it's more of waiting to release it to make it as part of a set trap that would be a consumable trap you would have to construct okay so you guys all have hidden he's behind you guys watching all of this happen yes promise so you guys are all working on the very edge of where these crop fields begin reginald pushes through a little bit and goes ow ow ow you hear in the distance a voice go hey you what's your problem he goes my ankle and he starts hobbling into the crop you shut your trap it's your fucking ankle what's that stupid-- oh you-- (grunts) he starts lumbering up i'm going to teach you about letting a peep out of that stupid maw of yours i'm going to beat that face so hard it can't make a noise ever again stupid git okay so as soon as he steps into the high crop area all right so what are the specifics of the entanglement spell all of a sudden all of the crops all of the large stalks and vines start (whoosh) wrapping around his body it's once he's inside the area so it's not like the wall on the outside no just the ones in the immediate vicinity okay so he's going to attempt to make a strength saving throw make a perception check if you could vax surprised so he has disadvantage on the saving throw what's the dc 19 that's a failure all right and what 28 yeah vax keeping an eye the guard doesn't seem to have kept notice and continues walking off towards the distant farmhouse the plants all wrap around his body and he what's this stupid--  you motherfucker--  at this point now he's got blood pouring out of the corner of the eye one eye has gone a little red from burst vessels you can see it starting to swell up already blood's now pouring out the side of the nose where you've hit it and he's still fighting even though the plants have kept him entangled as soon as the calm comes to him (heavy breathing) the eyes go wide and all the tension in the body loosens fucking hell you're still holding his face (muffled) fucking hell he spits a couple teeth out the side of his mouth you're supposed to be dead you're supposed to be fucking dead i watched you beaten to death why the fuck are you still alive no one it's me and cole but cole's heading back to the city we have other ones passed out around but most of them stay in town especially during the day that's where the festivities are do you want back in you're alive man now's the time it's a good time for the herd yeah probably aye kevdak stays in the city as well up at the old margrave's place actually turned it into his palace want me to take you make an insight check all of you guys are still hidden by the way unless you want to do something all of you guys make another stealth check with plus 20 you guys have never been seen retroactively no one's ever seen you in your entire lives if it was bad news it would still probably break stealth okay unless you rolled a one yeah no (laughs) horace hasn't seen anyone i could take you in which one are you talking about reggie (laughs) he's a little bitch that one is no but you know what i caught him sniffing around i think he's keeping some gold hidden twisted his arm a couple of times we could do this for old times' sake each take an arm pull until he tells us yeah here's the thing let me get loose here for a minute i'm feeling a bit uncomfortable okay we were heading up north we took out a small caravan just south of the road cuts near the silvercut way and all of a sudden out of the sky we saw these streaking dragons come through largest i've ever seen dangerous as the day's long so we fled we watched them come here and tear into this city rend it destroy it smoke and flames and ice and all sorts of craziness and they kept going we figured dragons come didn't take the spoils there's plenty of spoils for us more than we could ever dream of most of it's pretty well-guarded but there couldn't be much left over there so we gathered up who we had and mind you the herd's swelled a bit since you left my friend we conquered another wandering tribe last year zanror took the head of their leader and commanded them to join we're about a hundred strong these days pecking order still us goliaths at the top we got all sorts of other piddly men half-men half-orcs a few brutalized elves here and there they make cooking easy anyway we took that moment and we rushed into the town took it before the day was over killed all who didn't bow before kevdak himself days of revelry ensued my friend oh you missed out wine women gold we took what we wanted until one of them dragons came back black one scary killed a lot of us we weren't so much a hundred strong then but by the end of that we had 50 or 60 to our name before the anger finally stopped kevdak bent a knee and made an offering to this dragon i know but trust me you see a beast this size it was survival through a mutual discussion if you will promised our might to its worship gathered our spoils deliver it every now and then we got to have the leftovers we rule the city in its stead not a bad deal doesn't watch we leave it what we find-- most of it at least we keep a little on the side-- and we live like kings here westruun is now property of the herd you've missed out and there's quite a few openings now since we've lost a few of the less than strong folk you look strapping i'm sure kevdak would be more than happy to have you back that's a good blade it's been probably half a day since breakfast aye why his expression begins to shift as realization begins to dawn on his face before he can say a word-- he tries to speak through the pain but it's met with the gurgle as various bodily fluids fill the inside of his lungs and throat the blade now you can see (choking noise) peeks through the back of the mouth as his eyes go ever so dull the rest of the blood flow pouring out the sides of his mouth as this is happening the blood that has filled the mouth begins to seep back into the mouth the trails are still there but what was once filled to the brim has been slowly recessed swallowed not by the unmoving body of horace but the dark blade itself now drawing from the inside as the stalks unwind leaving his defiled body and you draw the blade free scanlan you find across the body there is a simple slightly chipped-but-still-functional greatsword that was sheathed in the back wrapped in a haphazard hide that functioned as a scabbard mostly just leather pants a few furs looks to be a bone necklace and a bone bracelet around the wrist which looks to be teeth human teeth about 27 gold pieces in total change about a five-minute walk you pull him up into one of the walls of the plant stalks and set him in there mounding up whatever bits of fallen leaves and dirt you can he's pretty well-hidden some flowers come up there some of the local leaves from the stalks bend down and help cover him up the guard's gone reggie's still sitting there watched this whole thing happen looking at you and goes you did good you did good thank you thank you yeah it would be being conscious of the cloud patterns in the sky moving with the wind in a way where you become less noticeable as something strange so it's possible all right the four of you convert into mist form crest up over the edge and start drifting your way over the top of westruun leaving scanlan grog and reginald amongst the crops do you have some he drinks thirstily both because he seems genuinely thirsty and second it seems like he could use a long hard drink i've been drinking longer than you've been alive friend just (guzzles) yeah and for that we'll take a quick break come back here see you guys here in a few minutes and we'll continue this story see you in a minute [break] welcome back ha ha they got it on stream sorry liam we're not as good as you are at it so guys quick note before we get back into the game apparently the shirt link wasn't working earlier it is working now they got it functional so go ahead and hop on now while you can returning from the break as grog and scanlan sit waiting to hear back from the rest of the team traversing over towards westruun seeking information in their mist forms the two of you remain behind the four of you guys who are in mist form where are you going this is your mist form ocean i like it i'd like you guys to make stealth checks you guys make your way across the rest of the fields you head over cole you can see walking his way to the outside of the western side of the city you come towards the bottom of the gate you can see the rigid small fence structure you noticed when you were far away from the city becomes more clearly visible it is a series of spears and pikes that are set up as a barrier or a barricade to the outside world to westruun you do see adorned atop a number of them a few heads varying sizes various people various ages it's hard to say it looks built outwards there are breaks in it but essentially it's partially a pseudo-defense mechanism it's more as a warning it's a point of intimidation yeah it's not anything too classically designed not quite no you coast over the outside wall and glance down within you can see there are people wandering the town townsfolk that are out in the streets many of them are in pairs or groups two to four people appear to be traveling from one place to another most of them are accompanied by one or two armed individuals some of the people have chains around their neck you do see a number of these buildings are in ruins patchwork places some are just crushed some appear to have been melted down like the wood or stonework itself has been dissolved into a pile of matter you see places where fires have broken out and some places have burned into a giant cluster of ash and broken wood a quick memory glance at this height you start looking for specific areas that you recall from memory one you glance over and see where you first came to meet pike where she and wilhand lived that area is the area of town that was apparently salvaged from the battle it still stands there appears to be very minimal impact as you give yourself enough closeness to check in the red brick homestead of wilhand does appear to be standing at this distance no you also note towards the shopping district of westruun there is the shop of abjurist noja one of your first enchanter friends who protected you during your first winter's crest his structure is still standing as well a few buildings around did not fare so well but his shop and a number of other ones adjacent to it seem to still be standing you can't really tell if they're functional or how busy they are or if anyone's doing anything with them but that's still there you do notice though at numerous parts of the street there are just piles and piles of burnt wood and ash like they're large burn piles that were set at different periods of time and have long since burned little bits of white post-burning plumes that still smolder over the past few days you're not quite sure what these piles contained at the time they were set ablaze there is still the worship district here you have the various temples best you can glance a few of them have been partially toppled there is damage to some of the buildings still too far away to make out any specific details beyond that some of the structures having taken a hit in previous conflicts you're not sure from which source the margrave's towards the southern central portion of westruun south of the main town square where the bulk of your first winter's crest festival here in westruun took place the margrave's house is at the very southernmost portion of that that entire square is lined with row after row of sharpened wood sticks and various other weapons tridents broken swords that have been with ropes strapped together to form a military barricade if anything were to attempt to attack from the ground it would be difficult to do so if this area was filled with prepared soldiers using these as protective guard the actual margrave's home is intact although at this glance you can see a lot of it has been defiled elements of the outside walls are strewn with dark burgundy paint slapped over you can see what looks to be some sort of strings adorning edges of it like decoration you see walking through this area what looks to be 12 or 13 or so armed individuals of varying heights probably a good six or seven goliaths among them others appear to be human half-orc it's hard to make out the full details from this distance they're all on the outskirts surrounding what was previously the margrave's home now the homestead of kevdak seemingly you have no idea what kevdak looks like make a perception check 16 at this distance it's hard to make out any specific details you can barely make out the fact that they're goliath it's only because you've traveled with grog so long you can pick out the details the hairless form the tattoos the general tone of skin they're male and female it's a smattering of all different types of goliaths some of different thickness some that are a little more barrel-chested and wide some that are a little shorter there are other similarly dressed individuals that are not goliaths as well but they seem to be more of a subservient role within the herd than the goliaths that would be the ruling class within this self-contained society but no one stands out to you as matching the descriptions of kevdak that grog gave you seemingly the prison you were being held in was in the umbra hills that's far north of westruun do you see a what it's hard to tell because most everyone who lives here is in some way shape or form a prisoner you do see at the various gates of the city as you went through there's about three four individuals average stationed there nobody seems to be entering or exiting and the pace of those that are not of the herd that you see walking through the city has a feel of hopelessness or at least their presence outdoors is more of function they do what they're told and if they're not you've already seen what happens to them make a stealth check guys on the way out okay you guys make your way westward is there anything you guys wanted to accomplish while they were gone you take out craven edge you hold it out in front of you it was a good snack a snack it was if there's more where that came from i would be so thankful it's a greatsword it's almost twice the length of your whole body and probably weighs close to as much as you do as you hand the hilt over towards him there's hesitation in the voice only you are worthy of holding me you will hand me to no one make a charisma check seven okay you can't give the sword up it means too much and the voice in your head says only those proven worthy to feed me can carry me and you grog-- make an insight check grog make a deception check grog's not the most able liar you glean you're pretty good at seeing past the deceit of others this definitely falls under the line of deceit as adorable as it is to see him try is it a wisdom saving throw i'll pull it up real fast just to make sure i'm pretty sure it is yep make a wisdom saving throw not using the cone so no it still fails so you feel compelled now to give this sword you're like no that's a great idea as he holds up the sword towards you you grasp the handle as his hand touches it the voice goes no only you can wield me go ahead and make a wisdom saving throw again i'm sorry that's a charisma saving throw 19 all right you feel the influence of the blade begin into creep into your mind but the bond you have with scanlan and the time you've traveled together you manage to shrug it off fighting that impulse you still hand the blade over you take the handle you let go of the weapon you hold it in your hand now it's a (heavy thud) there's a long beat of silence and then a barely audible (annoyed sigh) all of a sudden you hear this tiny voice creep up in the back of your head if you truly wish to hold me in your grasp i require you to prove to me your worthiness the blade all of a sudden it almost seems to have a slight shift of its own like a divining rod and it moves and the blade shifts away from the direction of you and grog and gently shifts down the way to an older gentleman who's now returned to picking a few crops and it points in his direction and says prove to me pointing to reginald make a charisma check it's not a spell let me double-check if you're referring to the gnomish racial capability let me go ahead and check the rules here because this could make a difference here against magic i'll say yes because it's technically a magical entity the sheer force of personality that begins to exude from this weapon you sense that it is old it has seen many a hand and has probably taken far many more a life but it's not met a gnome like you before scanlan shorthalt at which point you both hear a voice simultaneously go always hungry make an arcana check 12 it seems magical as a bard you understand that there are certain artifacts weapons that either upon their creation upon their development had the essence of a creature or soul put into it or conversely the weapon came into being as its own personality you're not sure of the nature of this and you're unable to ascertain which side of the spectrum it lies on as far as morality goes at which point a few clusters of wind come landing out of the sky you guys you're the mist yeah you notice that reginald's sitting there clutching his full stachel hi right that's okay but you're coming back right all right i'll be careful you be careful too come back as soon as you think you can when you're ready good luck i haven't seen him for days spits on the pile where his corpse is all right hope to see you soon then he turns around and begins walking back you guys all take a moment collect yourselves revert back to your mist form coast out of the farmland heading southward in the direction of the frostweald and there we're going to finish our campaign for the evening we'll figure it out we'll get her back sometime soon right we'll have you back soon buddy no you're not you need to be here i know hopefully we'll be having ashley back when blindspot releases her between seasons we'll have her back for a few months
