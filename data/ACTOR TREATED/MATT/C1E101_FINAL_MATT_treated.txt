hello everyone and welcome to tonight's episode of critical role where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors sit around and play dungeons and dragons at the same table thank you so much for your patience as mentioned last week we're adjusting and changing and updating things and taking your feedback and our feedback and everyone's been working really hard to make this set progressively better and better to make it a better experience this is our first time all at the same table since the home game (cheering) still in front of a green screen totally thank you guys so much for being patient we are up now and let's dive into the announcements for the evening we don't have a whole lot this week but we have let's see any updates as far as the merch is concerned all right cool also a reminder guys the tal'dorei campaign guide's coming out at gencon in august pre-orders go up i believe mid-july and i think if you pre-order it i think it's like five extra bucks or something like that you get the pdf download immediately all the information is on green ronin's website so go check it out if you have any questions there because they can answer them better than i can i'm steeped in art approvals and everything right now it's looking awesome we've pulled in some-- we've got a lot of community artists that we pushed over towards green ronin so they've been pulling people from the community which makes me happy because i want to get as many of you guys involved as possible in this i was referring to the community not you guys yeah i've seen it and it's pretty yeah they all wind up looking like genitals it's crazy we have the podcast which is now up (cheering) i don't blame you so we got that and we have wednesday club make a big effort to bring back the what the-- comics you've almost learned invisibility anyway apologies to all our scientology fans all right so exactly and signal boost all right cool then unless we have anything else to announce let's get into tonight's episode of critical role [dramatic music] yeah hey building a reputation and a criminal ring in ank'harel as a forging master in various types of furniture and accoutrements and upon realizing through the aid of one his hired help lionel or chud chad chod whatever the various pronunciations were that came through discovered that there was a second sphere apparently on some sort of pyramid-like ziggurat structure not far from ank'harel upon you returning as scanlan to notify the party you all made your way to ank'harel briefly met with kaylie and saw a little bit of the setup that they've been building for the past year or so and then made your way towards the smouldercrown mountains to the southeast of ank'harel where apparently this structure resides and this cult that is apparently sacrificing objects of magical power towards this black sphere so you made your way to the outskirts of this mountain discovered that the entrance that was previously there had been collapsed and discovered a new carved entrance into the mountain were beset by a few traps made your way into a far corner set up a mansion and after dealing rather briskly with a cluster of undead that had built up on the outside of your entryway to your magnificent mansion you made your way to the final chamber where the structure was residing a number of cultists there were in the process of quickly hastily throwing these objects to the top and then noticed that you had come as interlopers into this space at which point you realized the head of cult at least this group here at the top of the pyramid was none other seemingly than lady delilah briarwood who then protected herself and two of her cult members beneath the veil of a prismatic wall in the shape of a sphere and you did battle with a number of undead and other cultists and followers of the whispered one that involved largely just throwing a bunch of them into the ceiling including yourselves thanks to a well-placed reverse gravity scanlan had darted past the prismatic wall with a clever use of dimension door actually no looking at the rules too it was a good call to bring it back in my opinion but nevertheless they escaped seemingly into the sphere delilah and two of these cultists after turning it from this glowing white back into its black magic-absorbing self leaving you all there managed to cleanse pike of her feeblemind spell and after acquiring a few of these magical artifacts that were left unbroken and some cult robes and apparently symbols of this cult of the whispered one you now stand in the middle of this cavern on the outside of where this second ziggurat exists deciding what to do next and what the next step of this journey means for you so vox machina what would you like to do no that much time has passed unfortunately you could use the same funds to bring that doty back it would just take you the week in reconstruction anyway but you're not losing that doty the other one you unfortunately lost in the city of dis but this can be brought back at the same cost of a new one so you're not having to reconstruct an entirely new doty yeah yes you do with the brief glance through the-- well the arrow was in the one beneath whitestone through your connecting with sarenrae the vision that you received through that portal seemed to be very similar to what vex described seeing through her arrow not within the radius well no actually because when you used your wings outside you guys came inside did you use your wings during the battle did you guys take a long rest you did so by this conversation happening the rummaging through the bodies inspecting the vicinity i'd say you maybe have 20 more minutes on your wings you did that's how you found the objects that's right you found them on the cart you did not actually rummage through the bodies make an investigation check 23 okay over the next 15 or so minutes as you go through and begin to gather the corpses most of the skeletons out here that have armor on it's old rusted destroyed broken armor and the weapons either fell apart in the battle against you or are just barely usable or functional at this point in time of the various cultists' bodies the armor on the black guard that you were battling is a pretty nice-looking set of full plate you also find similar symbols these dark iron necklaces that you found on the previous cultists six which just as a note the visual of grog pulling this body out of the bag of holding is much like trying to pull a slim jim out of the wrapper it pulls weird and you have to yank yeah it's like by sections and you watch him strain as you pull some out and it folds over it's just really awkward and awful but yeah you manage to get the body out (impacts) up each step as you throw it it impacts and you watch as the body stops in mid-air from the gravity stopping where it stands its legs fold over and like a broken physics engine you watch as the body (crackling) twists cracks and gets sucked in (suction sound) you place one of the various symbols around its neck and then babe ruth-style lob it and you watch as it gets within a certain proximity the orb seems to shimmer and shift open ever so slightly it's similar to what you saw it opened to a mouthed gateway when delilah and the other cultists walked through the body still rattles and you watch it twist a bit but it's a far less impactful transition i can carry him and you look over and chod goes over and grabs doty (grunt) should i put him somewhere okay they are magical it's a mild enchantment it's not extremely strong but it is very specific and it is more of an attunement to a specific plane it has something to do with whoever's bearing it or whatever's wearing it is already partially crossed to a certain extent so it limits the impact of the transition very well so this is plate armor of resistance to radiant do you ask this question of him can i have it those boots are better than my boots can i have the boots it's full armor plate they're still part of the armor set he leans over to scanlan hey boss do i want a jewelry box yes i would love a jewelry box thank you it makes music do i want it yes please take all of it now he's carrying the music box and doty (laughter) that's loud no you guys can keep putting things on me that's fine it comes to about 180 feet from the actual sphere it's similar from when you originally tested it it was about the width of the whole chamber underneath whitestone and that chamber was more cleared out more of the actual structure was visible this one is still partially buried and you're only seeing the upper half of it in that chamber you cannot fly at this time it would be yes (laughs) all righty so you guys all make your way back to the second entrance the hidden illusory one you all back out of it leaving just pike and grog on the inside okay cool so i need you to go ahead and make an investigation check and you can assist him which gives him advantage total of 19 okay halfway through the hallway you find the place where the initial collapse was started or you start looking to see what they used to destroy the first entrance that you were supposed to come through you can see the way it's carved designed especially the smooth entrance which now that you get a better look at it that soft spongy ground that dust you were finding you begin to recognize the pattern of what carved its way in you saw it used at the top of the emberhold when you were fighting the queen there it was a series of disintegration rays used to carve away into this mountain that's what that dust is that's on the ground and why it's such a smooth entrance on this side mm-hm however because it was just a series of magic disintegrations pushed through to create this second opening it's a little harder to find points in the structure where the weakness is so you begin to cut away at some areas you get like a small axe or one of the various objects that you've-- pointed objects that you've acquired over the-- yeah and you just hit at some areas and you do find one section where you would think it would be a relatively weak point of impact between the various rocks and stones that hold this up you would recommend hitting it and then running pike go ahead and make a strength check as grog throws you up to the ceiling to where the one place in the rock structure is 13 okay so you take her and you alley-oop and you (impact) hit it and you watch it (cracking) and some dust falls and settles a couple of small pebbles (falling pebbles) and you grab her like oh okay seems okay for now okay so it just happens naturally so go ahead and roll a strength check with advantage 23 so for the height of the cavern here you get yourself a nice-- you crouch low and full shoryuken-style like (impact) punch into the roof and as you hit it impact and go clean through and bring it to the ground land and you hear the (crumbling) you guys start bolting through and as you're rushing pike you're looking over and you can see the walls (impacts) you guys are bolting out as well both of you guys go ahead and make dexterity saving throws please okay so as you guys are bolting you're holding onto grog and you manage to look behind just fast enough to see one of the walls is about to full-on collapse at the side and you go ahead and grab the side of grog's ear and yank his vision that way he starts turning off to that side and you manage to just avoid that side of the wall as it (impact) so you start steering him from behind like a prized racehorse and making your way through this cavern until eventually the back half of the cavern collapses and comes to a rest the front half is not collapsing but you do-- you have a large portion of the path leading to the ziggurat is now just rubble and rocks okay the rest of it is fairly easy to do because you find the closer you get to the entrance based on the previous collapsing elements of it have started to show cracks like the actual weight because it was just a smooth transition there there was no load-bearing platforms or any sort of general structure to the interior of this cavern so you guys manage to pummel your way out a large spinning punch on this side and this side as you're rushing out and as you do (impacts) you hear it slamming and hitting the ground behind you until you guys emerge through it looks like you're running straight at a wall because the illusory wall is still there but you both just out the other side immediate hot daylight hits you the blaring sun of the marquet sky clear blue sky no clouds you're now surrounded by a series of browned and leafless trees with these large canopies that have the same pear-like fruit hanging from the branches looks like fruit make a nature check it's hard to tell but it looks really tasty so looks tasty okay you take a bite and it's got a fairly moist center you can see now like a cactus the fruits here most of the moisture is retained within these fruit elements the flavor it's not sweet it's quite pungent actually it has a bitterness to it it's like putting your tongue in a bunch of lye just as a breeze blows a bit of a dust cloud through which coats your sticky hands with heavy desert sand you chew for a minute and feel the crunch of granules inside your mouth where you inhaled (crunching) back to you guys you were looking for the other entrance investigation check so who's helming the investigation of this and you're aiding her so go ahead and take it with advantage all righty i left on my collapsing music so as you glance around and do a pass over the next 20 minutes or so it's as fast as you can but it takes you a while to scan and get a feel for it you do see what looks to be because you felt the wind was coming through from the interior you see a small well-like crevasse where the rocks have collapsed inward you can see glancing over the top the dark five six-foot-wide hole that leads deeper into the mountain don't hear it okay your vision watches as it-- okay the arrow now burning it leads you into this dark space it lights up the interior the arrow gets about maybe 60 feet before it hits a rock and shatters it's not straight down it has a series of platforms and it looks like it was designed to be climbed down so it's a bit zig-zaggy it maybe went 50 60 feet and it hits a platform and shatters you lose your vision but it does appear to be a sizable tunnel used for entry you watch as she leaps and-- cloud of dust there is no sign she impacted she's just gone you just see the side of the mountain you glance in the inside with what little bit of daylight is ricocheting off of the stone interior you can see the edges of keyleth's elemental form swimming through the rock because she can do that are you following the actual path make an investigation check 15 okay you get about a third of the way down and you realize that one of the platforms that you can land on has uncharacteristically a softer cushion to it everything else is just stone slabs this one has almost-- yeah (laughs) like a spring air mattress it's crazy no it's like a woven dried palm frond-like cloth that's rested over it okay you continue southward scooting you can sense the very exterior of the wall that leads to this path so you're staying away from it as you glide through the rock and earth eventually you come close to the very top breaching the dome that leads down into the chamber where you had your battle naught but an hour ago as you poke your face through you're looking down you can see the dark sphere there hovering you can see the large pyramid structure below it probably about 60 feet below you you can see the entrance to the tunnel that leads into here there is a small ladder up along the wall that previously you didn't notice because of the lack of light and attention to the ceiling portion but people were either climbing up into or climbing down from by the way it's fantastic you all hear through it (earth elemental grumbling) the grumbling low voice of an earth elemental speaking to you through the earring easily enough you go by and you start kicking through the tunnel as you go you can sense near proximity where any of the various weak points are in the stone systematically go through it collapse it piece by piece until eventually most of the tunnel is useless and unusable how long can you maintain your wild shape oh you're fine then you emerge a little over an hour or so of doing this you emerge from the top you watch as keyleth (rock impacts) looking like a large version of fantastic four's thing it appears to be taken care of all of the entrances have been collapsed there's no way that you can imagine any average person can find their way into this you can-- you maintain your mental acuity and statistics when you're in there the texture and timbre of your voice you can hear words but it's almost like words being made by slamming rocks together make a wisdom check 13 that's enough as you sit there in silence with your eyes closed beseeching the attention of your patron which seemingly wasn't present when you attempted to in the proximity of this doorway the familiar soft omnipresent voice creeps into your psyche as she tells you it seems that the bender of fate is feeling the tug of destiny it's almost as if you're coming towards me if you sense this path is the right one follow your instincts perhaps we'll meet soon enough all right so you guys reconvene how do i describe the smell it's reminiscent of discovering old lemon juice that has grown sticky on a surface like a dark mahogany wood surface kind of like a bar floor we'll go with that make a nature check no there are elements that have gone bad on the ground and have been covered by sand as winds blow through it's like desert noni it's extremely healthy and has a lot of practical medicinal use in fact it's traded specifically for its use in various herb pouches yes a vafall fruit no listen to sam he's got the pronunciation yes the ones on the outskirts of the mountain range are small but the deeper into the valleys and ravines between the large spire-like mountains you do find a few that are probably large enough to utilize through your spell his mouth is filled with fruit (laughter) it's getting really heavy this is really heavy i don't see any similarities (laughter) all right so as you finish concentrating on the outside of one of these large 15 to 20-foot-tall leafless fruit-bearing trees in the center of the smoldercrown forest the doorway shifts open revealing on the opposite side the dark sunless night of whitestone okay you guys arrive it's early evening you can see the windows of nearby homes shops and various structures near the square are beginning to glow from the interior light of small lanterns and candles in the distance you can see the perimeter beacons being put along the castle walls on the exterior of castle whitestone you're back home all right at which point lionel keeps asking can i put him down yet can i put him down ooh that helps a lot you make your way to the castle doty's delivered to the workshop taryon okay (laughter) all right so you guys now have the run of the castle what do you wish to do okay as you approach cassandra at this hour she currently has a recently steeped still-steaming cup of tea resting on the table towards the window side the front window side of the general dining hall area of the castle where you usually eat your supper she's facing away from the table and has a thick robe over her and has the tea and is in the process of reading through books her hair's pulled up tightly and some of it's a mess in front of her face she's very much in work mode she's poring through books and as soon as you enter she reaches over for her cup of tea oh hello everyone she gets herself a little more presentable i've got the assistance of eskil ryndarien everyone else seems to be a bit busy at the moment but allura is doing the best she can research on her end as well how much time do we have well you have far better means of acquiring these people than i do i can merely send missives and requests she takes it and adds it to her tea he is he's currently inspecting the ziggurat again he's setting his notes up where he previously set up research quarters during the incursion of the conclave she's in emon she's still part of the council there no he's back in emon okay okay you make your way down there and you can see it's still fairly dark in that chamber most of the lights have been snuffed except for a few torches that are set around the central platform that was built about mid-height on the ziggurat where you guys had the council meeting with raishan that one time and where most of the research is being done there up top you see a number of guards the pale guard are assigned to keep watch you see jecht the manservant of the realmseer eskil there as well currently you see eskil ryndarien is spreading out his thick scrolls and books and they're all across the big central wooden table and he has his thick spectacles on and he has a number of candles already set up and he's deep into getting his space prepped and acquiring whatever information he'd put away since the investigation was put on hold yes oh it has been some time lady vex'ahlia i've heard you've come up in the world wondrous yes what do i have the honor right so you brought me all the way out here and now i can't do my work that's great no that's par for the course it's basically most of my life oh you're right i didn't know that i've only spent six months with the thing that's preposterous siphons only work one way my dear nothing's coming through there you know this how what here he looks you over really intensely if what you believe you saw is indeed another one of these siphons then perhaps we should take a little more care jecht please continue gather everything we're taking this outside wonderful good to know goodbye they gather up the materials the pale guard escorts them back into the hallway and he's now talking to jecht off on the side he goes well then we can go ahead and stage ourselves in the grand guestroom with the nice big bed yes he looks over his shoulder as you say this oh you're eavesdropping now as well that's wondrous so i can tell yes the big bed the one that helps with my back looks fine to me keeps walking did not appear to be cursed from your glance at it unless you're having a closed conversation she's already poured some into her tea the silence the stark absence of sound is completely sundered by the sound of shattering porcelainware the tea that she had recently barely sipped on is now shattered and spilled across the ground she stands there her hand open as it slowly curls back she stares off into the distance clenching her fist very tightly yes we do no running but you'll take care of her she's escaped death once already who knows how many times she has before you have to end it don't destroy her body destroy everything she is shatter the soul whatever it takes end her brother she takes the flask i need a moment alone please i'm going to be sick you close the door and there in the hallway waiting opposite the door is keyleth at which point you hear behind the door a muffled (retching) okay you speak with the rest of the standing chamber you begin to do your research make a history check 22 you've read through most of the books here between you and jb who's spent some time also reading quite a bit there's no mention of the symbol itself and there's very little information on the whispered one on vecna it's interesting there's almost a gap in history there are subtle mentions of this figure this once-powerful mage that had begun to look into the secrets of life prolonging it the fabric of reality and then it's just missing from history and you recall all the books that would cover that time period you remember hearing stories from allura regarding the whispered one originally there's no mention books that you feel like should cover it historical recalling of wildmount which if you recall based on some of allura's discussion on the whispered one's previous existence as a mortal largely vecna's work was done over on the wildmount side of exandria i don't either no he's a barbarian i think it is we have to work out the 5e classes for the hamilton characters get on it critters anyone else wishing to accomplish anything else grand poobah if this is indeed your request they will do their very best to do so within an hour or so you are presented with a bowl of various textures of shredded cured and prepared meats to loosely resemble a salad i guess it's like a giant poke bowl you look at the wait staff and they actually sir it was chef varon you look over and you see this one and you've seen a couple of the chefs here you haven't interfaced with them too much you're not a social figure necessarily more of a demanding figure when it comes to the food and the meal but you see this gentleman with this thin john waters pencil mustache this thinning hair that's short but slick with a bit of pattern baldness going on he's a bit thick around the waist and he's sitting there with a big beaming grin of pride oh well grand poobah i image that would be your honor to give i am but humbled to present you with such a meal so the choice is yours oh well we've got quite a variety i wanted to provide an extravagant walk through the various creatures that we prepare here in whitestone would you like me to continue we have two-week salted goat meat on top of that we have hickory-kept long angle-smoked fish guts mixed in there with a wondrous mix of minced steaks we've spared no possible expense on the various pieces of the cow we've from that point forward presented a sprinkling of pork belly that's been ground up and salt-cured as well over the period of about two months usually kept to our various steam meals but i thought this was a special occasion so it has a very sedimentary layers of the planet-type feel to it where each reveal occurs it's a whole different genus of animal you're eating nature in a bowl they came salted gofibepo it is gofibepo of course grand poobah he begins writing these things down all right all right you would need approval from lady cassandra of course to put this in the familial-- well if you were to make this the official meal of whitestone that is entirely within-- you heard him folks grand poobah has spoken gofibepo yeah oh it is delightful it is delicious and it's currently being submitted to the senate of whitestone for approval to become the official dish yeah with a constitution check it might improve your speed all right so what else do you wish to do as it is now getting close to the midnight hour here at whitestone okay now percival keyleth pike i believe you're helping out in the library as well well vex arrives to meet up with you guys in the library of whitestone whatever you're doing scanlan i don't know the sun tree has been around since before-- the history you know is back in the age of arcanum this valley housed a temple to ioun which was corrupted and in the calamity the battle between the gods and mortals that changed the epoch the knowing mistress suffered a grievous wound from tharizdun the chained oblivion and in that battle pelor the dawn father delivered enough of a blow to the chained oblivion to defeat it and aid in locking it away with the temple still lost beneath this valley that was when the sun tree seed was planted by pelor to be guardian over this space a god called the chained oblivion the chained oblivion tharizdun yeah a mad god of chaos and destruction from what you've come to understand and the research you've done since the name has come up-- right now mind you the information is still very hard to find he's not a god wants to be or at least wants to and there is some obsession with the ascension of a mortal to a beyond-mortal state which has only been achieved by one being before you got some of it and a lot of it dealt with ley energies there are certain lines that stretch across invisible lines that stretch across exandria where the magical powers that hold together the planes and protect it through the divine gate and other elements-- you don't know that but you do know that whitestone resides right beneath a nexus these ley lines were shifted during the calamity and now one of these nexuses is right over whitestone which is why this location was chosen for the ritual that the briarwoods were assembling in looking up the background history you would know that king bertrand dwendal of the dwendalian empire was given information in regards to the briarwoods who were essentially accused of forbidden necromancy and were to be arrested and put on trial and that's when they fled westward towards tal'dorei and then encountered your family seemingly the bridge from what you can tell there was no way plans or means of even building a bridge and a bridge has been attempted in the past over the shearing channel and it's just too-- the cliffs are too steep and too windy and the water beneath is too strong which is why the prospect to the previous sovereign was such a possible good thing to make a deal with the briarwoods at the time but there are no plans nothing in their notes spoke of actually making a bridge it was more a means to get into the graces of the royal family you've seen a few actually tary is fixing doty you're terrible since he arrived yeah you're not there all right so you're all going to go in for the evening and we'll come back to this in the morning sorry go ahead okay okay so you all find your evening's rest preparing for the next morning in whatever means you wish to prepare for we're going to take a break we'll be back here in a few minutes to pick up this next length of the journey and see where it takes us we're giving away on the break a purpleheart dice box from wyrmwood get that scanlan wood yes so for that contest you need to come over to twitch chat and i've actually forgotten what word we chose for today (laughs) what was the word thank you whisper the word is whisper so go ahead and when prompted enter whisper into the chat room to enter and we'll come back after the break to announce who the lucky winner is we'll see you guys in a few minutes (cheering) [break] that it does apparently anyway welcome back you may fight one later (laughter) he's actually eating out in the garden he has one of the little tables set out there it's a nice morning out in whitestone right now it's chilly but the clouds have broken a bit you can see some blue skies a little bit of sun's breaking through he's out there with jecht his associate who's in the process of cutting his food for him while eskil's sitting there still looking through books and occasionally reaching over and plucking things from his plate to eat as you approach him he doesn't even look up he goes yes what do you require good morning to you as well i suppose it is weather yes it's done i've researched it i don't know what you require as much as is in the tomes i have at my disposal yes it's a plane of negative energy and elements of it are used to funnel the transition of souls from life to death or back a number of it is scourged by undeath and those that skirt that process it exists as a mirror plane much like the feywild there are elements that resemble exandria but twisted shifted it is a very barren very broken dust-filled dark-- not a very pleasant place really elements of it yes good you should be precision is recommended it would need some alteration it's possible very careful alteration you need it to be a very narrow fork in order to properly channel the spell and this does not quite match the proper division of magical energies it could be physically altered to do so but too much and you ruin the minor enchantment and attunement i don't know i'm no metalworker i imagine not too much he leans back looking slightly offended i have means to communicate with individuals of importance yes i have absolutely no interest in any of what you just said i'm not a messenger service for individuals' parental units who's your father right of the wind people whatever right okay he thinks for a second begins to run his finger in the air and you watch as there's a faint scrolling of soft bluish-white light (poof) turns to smoke and vanishes all right he knows you're going to be off doing stuff in the shadowfell and probably won't be back for a while you're welcome (thud) you're welcome i will call into this favor later i will they're delicious (frustrated noise) it's still in town (laughs) i will say if you're spending a good portion of the morning going around asking being your charismatic self and well-versed in gathering information in a marketplace you do find two chalices for sale that would match the specifications required to cast a heroes' feast the finest chalices this side of wildemount it's crazy this one has an anti-dribble chinnage for all those nights you're drinking too hard and you don't want to spill all over your front pouch that will cost you extra five gold for the sippy cup each cup because these traveled quite a bit they'll bring you about 1200 gold pieces apiece hey you think i haven't been busy after you left school (laughter) found a new occupation chalice collector actually that sounds like a perfect reason to buy them make a persuasion check vox machina you say you know these folks his eye widens on one side well i've not really seen or know much about you folks but i've heard tales of you that real dragon no shit well i mean tell you what he pulls out a piece of paper and starts scrawling on it he pulls out his inkwell and starts dipping it if you would do the honor of signing this official document that says that these were sold to none other than lady vex'ahlia of vox machina that i can use as proof of this transaction for my own promotional purposes i'll be happy to give you both of these-- yeah basically i will happily give you both of these at a discount of 1000 gold pieces apiece sure go for it your insight 14 hard to read (laughter) a pleasure doing business with you milady hands you the two chalices they're beautiful one's more reddish gem-encrusted the other has a platinum spiral that runs around the base of it they're both beautiful and intricate yeah okay wait that guy looks familiar i forgot to also say we have a winner by the way kiajade congratulations i should have mentioned that i got caught up in the story thank god that's never happened before but congratulations all right you've acquired your chalices what other business do you guys want to take care of okay make a tinkering check dexterity well no this would be intelligence it's a new concept you're trying plus your proficiency 19 sure you manage to make about 12 pieces of silver shot you know for the most part because it's not as hard as other forms it's going to be but it is susceptible to enchantment okay you take the silver shot anyone want to try anything else make an investigation check 21 you look like you're looking for something to buy my lady do i i happen to have one vial of holy oil good for two applications traveled a long way and you're a little late in the shopping day i was all full on them but they've been flying off the shelf my apologies three applications with the vial that you have look you've already done some good business with me i'll give it to you for 150 all right i'm not hearing music we'll check that in a second anybody else want to prepare anything okay you find him it's early morning they've finished their early round of training for the morning and some of the early pale guard recruits are in the process of rushing off and taking a small lunch break he's currently taking a lot of the equipment from the training grounds and setting it aside in the various weapon racks and generally cleaning up the space as you approach he looks over his shoulder as he sets some of the practice blades along the edge good all's well just keeping things going got a lot of good up-and-coming folks working on it it's a process thank you very much i'll keep it at my side he takes the basic dagger out of his sheath and chucks it into the corner thank you thank you very much there's still a ways to go i look forward to it stay safe all right if you get really close at night you hear this faint (screams) he puts another pillow over it all right so what do you wish to do guys it will take you a while to do so you could temporarily bless them with the bless spell but to infuse them with the blessing would be the equivalent of a small enchantment so it would take you a couple of days or something each of you don one of the symbols all right you find your way down into the subterranean tunnels beneath whitestone winding through the caverns until you enter the chamber that contains the ziggurat where you initially faced off with the briarwoods as you climb to the top there before you you see standing in all of its glory the black as you've called it spinning orb of death approximately that large now and it's this dark void that as you get close it has this weird vibration to it and there it is suspended about four feet off the ground at the top of this ziggurat yeah you put the necklace near it and you watch as the sphere this weird grayish aura around it begins to emanate faintly almost like the closer it gets the brighter this weird gray aura tends to get and the wider it grows all right i would like you to make a constitution saving throw 20 okay you take 11 points of necrotic damage anybody else you don't know that you just saw him vanish everybody going in all right everyone make a constitution saving throw please 17 22 points of necrotic damage 11 points of necrotic damage 22 points of necrotic damage 22 points of necrotic damage 22 points of necrotic damage 22 points of necrotic damage so as you leap into the sphere you feel as if the gravity that holds you to the ground or sometimes the ceiling bends around you and your limbs are wrenched forward like someone has you in a full nelson that doesn't end your body is about to be condensed and crushed when you feel the symbol pulse and the gravity lessens somewhat it's still tearing into you and you feel this coldness and this numbness come over your body as you feel like you're a square peg being pushed through a round hole physically pushed through against your will you begin to yell out in pain instinctually before it comes to a stop and you all land to your feet out of breath the numbness begins to fade to immediate pins and needles just pain across your entire body you feel like someone just raked a number of tacks across every surface of your skin and as the pain begins to throb you can feel the blood pulsing throughout your body as it all shoots to the surface you still sense that you thanks to your symbols around your neck you managed to withstand a much more dangerous arrival as your eyes focus you already feel the chilled air that surrounds you like a cold cold winter morning the sky above is sunless and gray like an overcast horizon without clouds to texture it breached by distant mountain ranges like so much broken glass you see behind you immediately the other corresponding siphon floating bright gray-white in color and glowing the same color that you saw briefly shifted to in the ziggurat near ank'harel beneath it you find shards of ruined objects piles of long-dead bodies flesh and bone rended and twisted like they'd been put through some rapid tornado on different sides of their body and you see a lot of these shattered pieces of wood and metal were all a number of objects that were thrown in here during the experimental phase when you guys first uncovered this you look around and notice that you stand atop a rectangular platform of dark smooth stone about 15 feet on each side beneath the edges about 20 feet down 'til it comes to the ground so you're on an elevated stone platform that the siphon is affixed to above floating about four feet above the top of the surface and you look down to the ground immediately around you and you see just dry cracked badlands it seems to spread out making up the majority of the shadowfell around you surrounding your location your sight clarifies to see what appears to be hundreds of buildings and structures that form this shade of an ancient city like a town a sprawling village half the structures toppled and destroyed piles of rubble and rock the ground itself seems to jut up in places these tiny shooting spires of black and gray earth that the city has either been built around or seemed to have grown through as you look past that you see movement throughout the streets in the distance but before you can focus on that your vision immediately sticks towards in the center of this circular-like city the standing ominous commanding massive spire of obsidian black familiar to both of you through two different types of vision you've experienced a jagged monolith that exudes ancient hatred encircled by dozens of dark winged beasts that watch over the dreary skies who here is proficient in history exactly the two of you make history checks with disadvantage because you lack proficiency yes you being a bard you pick up information in passing with disadvantage each of you you have no inclination of where you stand or what's before you all you know is you stand now on the cold plane of the shadowfell the echo of the prime material you do you're welcome to just so you guys know you are all standing out in the middle of the open on this large stone platform looking down in the center of this giant city-- there is no ziggurat there is a large black spire but that's in the center of the city maybe two miles off there are buildings you see two structures maybe 50 or 60 feet from you on each side and then going forward from your current position it leads right into the city so this structure is on the outskirts it's right on the perimeter make a perception check you glance and in the faint gray sky above you around the glowing white-gray orb this side of the siphon you see a very very faint aura of bluish-purple that is weaving into a thread a rope almost various strands that knot and twist to form a cord a very barely visible cord that just drifts up towards the very top of that tower for miles and there at the top of the tower you see a vibrant sparking pulsing purple glow and from there you can see two other distant strands that arc off into the very faint other edges across triangulating around the other sides of the outskirts of this ancient city you see the faint glowing white-gray pulse of two other siphons affixed to two other platforms all these strands converging at the top of the tower how long does it last you can there's a difference between casting a spell and enchanting something it's a loose enchantment to bless the ammunition that takes a while to focus on they're solid they're stone buildings they're homes though plain and cracked there are sections of wall missing in places as you look about the grounds here and you know this because you've ransacked and been responsible for the ransacking or the rubble of westruun but this city appears to have been some time long ago under siege you see signs of battle you see impact you see roofs that were burned and now lie as just black husks this area has seen warfare long ago and the signs of it are old and it looks like the signs of life that exist in this space the movement you see of figures in the distance wandering through the streets there's no immediate threat to this city but you get the sense just looking out that something big happened here a long time ago okay so you guys have moved down from the platform and you cast pass without a trace so i'd like everyone to make a stealth check please adding plus ten to your roll okay so to stay stealthed you have to find some place to be stealthy you're not stealthing out in the middle of nowhere where are you going to find-- okay you guys dart off to the left it appears to have once been a two-story structure but the upper level has since collapsed and part of it is falling into the bottom floor as you begin to approach the doorway on the inside vex'ahlia you hear what sounds like a faint crunching sound on the inside there are there is one window on your side and the doorway around the corner you glance inside and as you peek over the top in the brief bits of light coming through the shadow in here you can see the collapsed piles of broken stone and wood planks that used to hold the structure of the upper level together you can see what looks like furniture that's been destroyed simple basic this is not an extravagantly decorated space built for function more than anything but moving amidst the shadow you see what appears to be a humanoid creature of pale gray skin elongated limbs long clawed fingers bald head pointed hooked ears and what looks to be slightly broken jagged yellow elongated teeth in this jaw as it's currently munching on what looks to be a small furred rodent of some kind (crunching) it is very undead what's the radius nothing else catches your attention no you watch as it finishes and walks toward the doorway vex'ahlia as you're off to the side you watch as this creature leans forward and goes into a sprint and then leaps up onto a distant rooftop (leaping noises) just leaping from rooftop to rooftop as you're watching that leap another movement catches your eye and you see another one about three blocks down you can see there are at least a handful of these creatures stalking through the ruins leaping from building to building from floor to floor a small furred creature you didn't get a good look at it you got a fair look at it apparently so does the creature there's something you didn't know about otters laura it's hard to tell at this distance you're so far out of the city you've only been able to notice a few shapes from this distance you'd probably have to get in a little closer and spend some time watching their behavior to pick that up make a wisdom check you close your eyes for a second no none make a perception check no not at all as you go up the side and step over onto the rubble you see a large broken what was once the floor of the top floor that slid into this giant decline this slide of rubble if you will at the top you can see what looks to be a broken weapon rack that is empty no weapons on it but you get the sense that this small structure was a perimeter tower outpost apparently not in the structure no nothing at the moment no very briefly yeah you can make something that looks undead-adjacent all right what do you guys do make a performance check no for the next eight hours not concentration you can't be surprised you have advantage on all attack rolls ability checks and saving throws and other creatures have disadvantage on attack rolls against you all right all right so are you stealthing through you guys scatter just enough to dart between alleys and find shaded bits and leap from base of building to alley keeping a cohesive unit as best you can the first thing you notice the further in you get even within just the first couple of blocks of the city you see broken swords you see pieces of armor and you see figures walking through the street ahead of you you see hundreds of scattered skeletons decomposing bodies shambling through but they all walk in patterns they're not scattered mindless there is some will or direction to their movements you see them wearing ornate armor with designs and symbols on them that look old and tarnished and scratched some are moving as troops and occasionally you see an individual wander off but they're just sort of walking around and scanning i'm going to have scanlan you roll a history check and pike roll a religion check yeah add a d12 to it got to get the dust off man okay you looking over there a lot of the armor that these skeletons are wearing it doesn't fit with the shadowfell the silvers the golds the tattered blue cloaks there's something regal about some of these armor sets as old and ancient as they may be it doesn't seem to match the sense and feel of the shadowfell while you're having this thought pike you glance over and look at one of these pieces of armor and you recognize the symbol it's like a stained-glass circle with a gold star in the center it's the symbol of pelor many of these bodies these undead wandering the city seem to have been soldiers that fell in whatever battle that once besieged this city and many bear the mark of pelor that was but that was on the prime material and that was in the vicinity of the alabaster sierras no none of the buildings the structures resemble whitestone no not really yeah yeah lot of ikea no but you do get the sense-- some of the architecture here does resemble elements of some architecture designs that remind you of wildemount but like old wildemount like no modern structures definitely from centuries back as you continue to wander and keep your eyes out you occasionally hear the distant (creature shrieking) you watch as the (wings flapping) winged dark beasts are circling overhead no not yet you have not seen anything like these before black as night against the gray sky from this distance you make out no details in their bodies it's almost like a moving shadow above you wherever light would hit to give you some sense of structure it's just absence void it's just a flying shadow possibly make a perception check 12 i mean there are some buildings that look like they have some structure and the further into the city you get the more you see that this becomes a little less destroyed but you begin to see some figures moving that are not armored undead not zombies and not any of these quick-moving creatures you see three figures walking back towards the orb where you guys came from in the same black cult robes hoods off they would appear to be human but they're cultists they're just walking through they're about 100 feet up a little further than that coming your way towards the sphere where you guys were three of them okay so what do you guys do okay so the two twins follow and the rest of you duck into a building off to the side okay you guys i need you both individually to roll stealth as you tail behind them the cultists are basically walking past you guys going the opposite direction of where you were traveling and both the twins just vanish from sight you're like well what if-- gone again you guys pace behind them jumping from alley to alley occasionally they'll stop and do a walk over there's not a sense of paranoia but they're very watchful their attire while still cult robes is a little more intricately adorned and you see the one in the front is carrying a hanging lantern that gives off this weird smoke behind it like a censer yeah but it gives off this faint glow and they walk and make their way slowly outside of the city towards the pillar where the orb is and they just look around it walk over to the few buildings to the side divide a little bit to a perimeter reconvene at the base of the orb and begin making their way back to the center of the city all right the three of them walk back leaving a small censer trail behind the smoke the almost incense-like smoke burns off within a few feet after they eventually cross right next to the doorway and window to where the rest of you are waiting both of you guys roll for an attack are you aiming at two different ones same one it's an automatic crit if you hit and you have advantage on the hit because they don't see you but still it's nice 26 both hit go ahead and roll damage both of you doubling your weapon die damage and your sneak attack three of them yes you also double the bramble shot damage because it's a crit 85 damage rogues man it's what they do as the three of them walk the two on the outside both at the same time (impacts) crumple no noise just fall to their knees face down on the ground unmoving the one in the center that's holding the censer turns and looks back and sees-- that is a 16 fail that's right because 21 so as soon as he turns around out of one of the cracks in the stonework nearby you can see some dry grass-like gray brush there is what appears to be some faint hints of local plant life but it all looks like gray dry grass or you know after a morning freeze when you see elements of a field that have that weird textured almost water plant look to it it's clusters of that but curled and one of those whips out with this one long grayish almost fleshy-looking vine that wraps around it and yanks it inside the house (grunt) gets yanked in grog you catch him go ahead and make an athletics check grog he struggles against your grasp and it's nothing it's like holding a baby in your arms okay what does he have to save on that okay make a ranged attack roll d20 plus your dexterity you have advantage because he's currently restrained by grog okay so as you chuck it the three feet it impacts and you watch as the orb swells and expands and all of these chain-like plates of dark reddish iron metal wrap around him constraining his hands his legs and locking him into place around his jaw and his head and his mouth it has a little slit that you can remove to the side all good magical items do liam that's what you call an artifact okay you guys both attacked first make a stealth check because you both exposed yourselves with the attack and there are creatures overhead shrieking okay you watch as one swoops nearby and you hear the (shrieking) and you guys dart by doesn't seem to take notice you drop back into the building and there you see your quarry now bolted to himself through a series of dark iron metal plates he does not have both eyes left eye is missing you see him now this is a man in his mid-40s salt and pepper hair seems to be an unkempt beard around his chin hair is maybe about ear-length a little tattered now since he's been roughed up and manhandled a bit his skin's a bit yellowed a little jaundiced you get the sense he's probably been living here for quite some time and he doesn't look healthy the smell is awful it's hard to differentiate from the general smell of decay and dust that this entire realm seems to be suffused with but the smoke that billows off of this is like fresh putrescence mixed with a very very strong charcoal roll an intimidation check you unlock and he just goes (laughs) i don't have to tell you anything this pain is meager i've felt far worse i've given myself far worse pry and poke all you want he doesn't flinch i'll just pluck it right back out do your worst maybe the fact that you're already here means that you have no way out so i fear not even if i perish i die with the comfort of knowing that you'll perish soon after that is the comfort in the whispered one so you knowingly came here you are both foolish and simple so you said you have questions the sentinels that is what they are for us but they are known more formally as gloom stalkers they are hungry ever hungry you will it does not matter the past means nothing when you give up your secrets he shakes his head you will get no information from me you see the gaping socket and as he goes to blink one eye you can see the marking on the inside it looks like it was burned out so you watch the outer edge of the flesh and muscle twitch whenever he blinks that is that's an 11 all right his grin glazes over and he goes but of course i am from the outskirts of a far eastern wildemount village named zuvan it was built on the ruins of orthanus i was a poor man but i found purpose i don't know i was taken with many others who had given themselves to the secrets of the undying king i awoke here mauled but living and was inducted and that was when he took my eye he one of the acolytes i do not know they shriek they eat they watch i do not mess with such terrible and wonderful instruments it protects those of us who are not as esteemed in the arts of necromancy to not be bothered by the roving long-dead soldiers of the last war on thar amphala thar amphala thar amphala the city built for the whispered one long ago he just looks at you strangely it's where his essence has slowly reclaimed the space he will live soon i have not seen her but if she is not out then perhaps the ritual is soon she is probably at the top of entropis yes i do not know the specifics i am but a watcher on the outside of thar amphala i have not gone in since i gave my eye we are the remnants i am to watch the outskirts of the city i am to escort those who would bring various things in preparation for the ritual the ritual is to restore him to bring him so that he can complete the main purpose the ritual of seeding when he the undying king returns to this world and we bring what we have gained what we have brought from the other plane that seed will be taken to the ritual of the space i do not understand the details but for many months now these siphons they have been building the seed they have been preparing for his return and from there he will complete what he started so long ago soon things accelerate that would be you my friend i'm checking the spell just to be sure yeah so by about now after these questions have come through his one eye blinks and he goes (grunt) it matters not he already knows you're here do you roll a strength check (shriek of pain) there is a smear of crimson down his face as the other eye has just been turned to paste (mechanical clicking) it all unfolds and returns into the sphere do your worst with a sickening snap you can hear as the spinal column is severed at the base of the neck and he goes limp in grog's grasp actually he has almost nothing on him but the censer he has-- actually no he would not have one of the necklaces because he does not he has a symbol a similar symbol but it's much smaller more just a basic holy symbol of some kind same shape but it doesn't have the same thick iron presentation as the ones that you guys encountered yes and that is the same symbol make an investigation check okay you do find some furniture most of it's very basic tables maybe a couple chairs a couple of cots that are mainly wood boards with a thin cushion on it the existence here was not to be-- it's a very plain city of worship you can see everything was built here to gather worshipers to gather the remnants or whatever they were called before the last time that vecna fell and the city was assaulted it's on par with so now still under the guise of various undead holding a wandering burning censer procured from the now-dead eye-popped corpse of a wandering cultist you slowly make your way deeper into the city of thar amphala towards the tower of entropis where seemingly the cult of the remnant are attempting to bring vecna back to physical form for an even greater ritual thereafter and that's where we'll finish tonight's episode we'll return next week to pick up from there guys so happy i know i get to touch people's hands i know we're such huge nerds this feels so much like the home game it makes me happy next week pajamas and mimosas what better way to celebrate a vecna arc in the shadowfell so guys thank you so much we're back next week i want to give another big thank you to the amazing crew and people here at legendary/geek and sundry that have been working almost around the clock to make this set work to make this table work to make the equipment work the lighting the audio we've taken all of your suggestions we've reached out to the community to try and make this as best and as comfortable as possible for us and you guys i know it's a work in progress and you'll watch things improve as we go as we learn and figure things out so thank you for your patience but seriously if you get the opportunity show some appreciation for the people who've been working really hard to try and improve this experience for everyone involved thank you guys you're all so amazing (cheers)
