announcements woo okay shit no liam all right what is it thank you liam we've accomplished a lot tonight i'm glad we could do this together (laughs) all righty so without further ado let's dive in to tonight's episode of critical role [opening credits] which involved both taryon and keyleth having their first taste of soul and eventually percival on the way out too you encountered the owner of the establishment a dark-haired red-skinned horned gentleman wings folded against his back who was eager to rent you a place to stay for the time being and you guys decided to figure out what your plans were at which point freddie and greg-- percival and grog-- went downstairs to have a conversation with this entity where he revealed himself to be named ipkesh and was interested in possibly working out sort of a criss-cross quid pro quo-type negotiation with your team after returning to discuss the possibilities of this up in your chambers keyleth made her way out to locate the possible location of hotis as a workaround as she exited the front exterior of the establishment and went into an alleyway to attempt to transform she found herself followed by a chain devil and some sort of a somewhat scarred and mutated-looking dwarf they confronted you and were asking about their interest in the white one seeming speaking about one of your companions vax who had taken on the form of an albino tiefling when you entered the plane we left off at a tense moment and that's where we pick up this week as you stand in the darkened shadowed uncomfortably hot air in the center of this alleyway behind these buildings crushed in these very thin spaces with what looks to be a thinning exit behind you and these two devilish entities--or devilish entity and some sort of a messed-up dwarf-- beginning to flank you with what looks to be grotesque murder or thrill of coming pain in their eyes and faces-- what do you want to do (laughter) via what are-- what are you using what are you using are you using alter self so you're casting shapechange no you cannot but however you did not quite cast shapechange last time-- -- we had spoken so you're doing it now okay so as they both begin to slowly flank from the sides of the alleyway and you're holding your ground insisting that this 'white one' they're asking about belongs to you they didn't seem to buy your attempt at claiming territory so you begin to mutter the incantation beneath your breath your hands move and you watch as you do so the chains of the chain devil begin to-- continue to grind and shift around it like a hundred serpents of grinding metal and the dwarf figure she begins sauntering up on the other side with this heavy limp as you watch the flesh tearing with small tendrils revealing beneath like a series of worms are almost emerging from various folds and gashes in the flesh of the arm you complete your shapechange spell as they're pulling in on you what do you turn into oh sh-- okay yeah they have challenge level 12 so you can do that okay so yeah the one that the pit fiend summoned next to it so you have actually encountered it as you finish the incantation your skin goes to a pale white your eyes becoming dark deep red with these little burning golden coals for pupils the rest of your skin grows fair but thick with a very very fine series of scales across it as these giant black red wings emerge from your back and unfold as they extend past you in both directions enveloping both sides of this alleyway both the chain devil and the dwarfish entity stop in their tracks and take a couple of steps back looking at you intensely make an intimidation check with advantage because you are you look like a higher ranking devil (laughs) 25 so as you asked for their name the chain devil-- the chains begin to slow and come to a halt and what was originally curling upward in this aggressive stance begin to just fall limp to its sides and just takes another step back no need to worry we apologize for the intrusion the chain devil bows its head and begins to step back and you see it ushering its hand this way towards the dwarf the dwarf which is looking confused and begins to hobble backward and they both just back out of the alleyway in a very submissive apologetic physicality without even saying a word yes it is make a perception check 22 you glance up and right on the edge of one of the three- to four-story curved iron towers you see what appears to be an impish-like creature perched on the end with what looks to be faint shimmering gold armor that's just peering down at you from the top of the alley it doesn't react its head twitches a little bit and it just sets back in itself looking at you its eyes these gleaming black shining discs in the darkness it just watches you and as you exit the alleyway from where you came the two devils that attempted to assail you there no longer anywhere in sight the-- okay as your form changes as you turn the corner-- -- into the tavern yep you watch the wings (whoosh) unfurl her skin going pale-- it did not have gold armor the one that you saw at krieg's well that was in krieg's-- technically it wasn't in krieg's house-- that was in father what's the character's-- yeah it was the first-- when you first came to emon it was the ally to your father vax and he was the one that was found slain or was in the process of being killed by-- -- by entities yeah yes yes okay the ring has no specific magical properties to it but it is a signet of some kind there is a symbol on it-- roll a religion check actually this would be religion yeah okay that he was in yeah so the two of you both conjecturing about it the symbol here is one that you picked up specifically in the tome you did research earlier it is the symbol of asmodeus asmo-day-us it seems from best you can tell-- make an intelligence check actually (laughs) as far as you guys know it looks pretty damn important that's the only thing you can ascertain let me see i mean if you focus on an item you can use that item to try an improve a scrying attempt if you're looking for a specific individual or location but i don't think the scrying spell directly allows you to to-- vex at this point is watching the whole thing and she goes well to be perfectly honest i haven't heard much detail about this deal that you apparently seemed to make what do we make of the deal yeah you said 'fairly promptly' it fits partway down your pinkie but it gets caught on like the first knuckle it's like he went to claire's it would only take one person and they have to be on the same plane of existence you would know that based on the enchantment 45 turns towards you and trinket goes-- (bear grunting) saunters up and looks up at doty-- (bear sniffing snorts) fogs up the metal for a second on the outside-- choose your dice (chuckles) all right so the-- it takes roughly five or so minutes to try and bring one of the nearby tables over without burning the shit out of your palms-- -- that could possibly facilitate an arm wrestling match between a giant metal man and a grizzly bear no it's cooled off by now so as it's all there the giant metal man trinket comes up-- and trinket not really-- trinket doesn't grasp trinket just goes-- and just does like a claw strike at his at his hand-- -- because that's what a bear does and so the giant open palm of the automaton gets slammed by the strength of trinket's claw and this is going to be the one way or another the fastest arm wrestling match you've ever seen i need you to go ahead and roll a d20 and add trinket's strength modifier roll a d20 and add doty's strength modifier ping the bear's claw goes full swing doty's arm gets thrust back and almost seems to pop out of the socket briefly-- -- before pops it back in and this very large looming bear just-- (aggressive bear grunting) -- looms up towards you do you do anything as the feeling of ever-so-slowly trickling warm urine soaks the right side of your armored leg trinket's nose slowly brushes up against the side of your ear and face and goes (sniffing grunting) (slurp) licks the side of your head and then the last little bits of trickle end as trinket turns around and lumbers back towards vex which by the way there's now a (sizzling) it's starting to actually-- all right so you guys-- nope that is specifically a creature mmm no it's a location you haven't seen it so what's the form you're taking okay so you guys gather your things-- correct (laughs) all right so as you guys make your way down into the main chamber there's one more devilish entity that's in the process of feasting on what looks to be a small cauldron of some sort of broken bone and dark purple and bluish flesh and it's just tearing into it as ipkesh is at the same table where you guys previously spoke with him he's sitting there with his same glass of wine and as you approach he gives a nod towards you and he has a piece of paper on the table he slides it forward have a read see if it's up to your preferences i will give you the piece of paper actually (chuckles) it's a contract no you have to leave this here kind of yeah would you like me to read the contract out loud okay hold on a second so not necessarily in theory only one person has to accept the contract to lock this in you only agree to the first pact and when the first pact is complete you do not have to trigger any of the other pacts the contract remains in effect should you ever decide to trigger the pact it immediately comes into play yeah you don't have to accept-- yeah in perpetuity so you don't have to decide now on the other pacts but at some point down the road if you're ever in a situation where you're like 'oh shit we're all about to die i 'invoke the second pact' boom you get a bunch of devils to help you for the next month you invoke the pact yes one person has to sign the contract and only that person's soul-- well you're-- and you say this in character (laughs) well there is room for negotiation of course very well please return when you have a better idea of what you would like to see adjusted and i will do the same he takes it and rolls it up and it vanishes below the table as you exit it does not get dark there is no evening here in dis he has taken a scan of the group but he doesn't seem to be flinching he is just there and eager to talk some more so as you guys exit the establishment into the street the heated cobblestone still glowing a dull maroon and black you watch as what looks to be some sort of strange mist-like form emanates from a crack and turns into a screaming specter that-- (gasping) -- and drifts further down the street past you what do you guys wish to do you've got 25 minutes before your spell is up the bastion of flesh no the bastion of flesh is-- the safe passage to the bastion of flesh that is what the contract enables you should you fulfill your part of the deal not an object it's a location (laughs) you wouldn't be vex if you didn't no i mean-- unless you guys have anything in your possession from that battle then no you did but also-- no the objects would not reform with him he would reform without-- all the material possessions that hotis had on his body when you killed him were left behind make an investigation check all right you don't ask around because-- it's a bad idea and you start getting the idea too whatever's coming down they get the stink eye and you just-- turn tough gaze and keep walking and eventually you come upon a facility of some kind that looks to be made of almost-- pieces of black and rusted sheet metal that's jammed together in a very patchwork fashion you don't see a doorway more than you see a triangular opening where the various interlocking pieces of metal aren't fully flush from the inside you see a soft reddish-orange glow that flickers ever so gently as you glance inside you see a few makeshift braziers that are flickering with reddish-orange fire and what appear to be some gleaming shelves lining up strange glowing collections okay as you guys enter-- you take-- you take three psychic damage-- -- from attempting to think too hard yeah just a bit of blood trickles out of his right ear i assumed you didn't want a giant bear walking around well it's taken a while to find this place so you're about ten minutes before your spell ends this is a very big city you guys so as you walk-- this is the only thing you've seen so far that looks to have any sort of loosely welcoming or not heavily guarded 'don't come in or you'll get killed'-type exterior and as you enter the low-lit inside you see these rickety-looking shelves that contain small glowing gems or crystals of different colors and sizes like weird geodes that are cut from natural deposits and across the way there is just a stool and what looks to be some sort of humanoid creature that is slumped forward and breathing heavily with these elongated dull green color on the skin a series of small spines that protrude from the shoulders and back-- yeah like jagged long thin spines and as you enter inside it turns up and goes yes you come to buy pretties what do you seek no no i do not go there because it is for fleshy types and he nudges this long jagged chin these gnashing teeth that are crooked and overlapping as it spits as it speaks in your direction what make an intimidation check with advantage literally i do not know the-- the nature of this city is to be rebuilt always rebuilt aways changing the archdevil he worries he's paranoid everything must not be the same as it was i know not where it is i know not where the bastion is i'm sorry those who work those who are within those who are under the guidance of the prison's masters they know they know it's on his pinkie i can not help i don't know and he just lowers his head in a shameful worrying you can see his knees are quivering ever-so-gently make an insight check okay legitimately this creature is pretty pathetic as far as devils go that you've come across and in the threatening presence of an erinyes that is asking for information it does not seem to have it is legitimately awaiting a terrible demotion that it doesn't feel it earned i don't know i don't know you see him looking around spastically his eyes are shooting around the room at all of you and around looking at the geodes at different directions almost like a weird iguana face he says the torturers the chains i sell pretties i sell pretties pretties used for rites used for magic he stands up now and this creature that looked so pathetic when it was squatting down on this stool these long thin gollum-like legs it stands up and is now head-height a good foot over most of the party-- gangly the spines extending from the back of the head and the arms and the elbows as it stands up now as it slowly stalks over to one of the shelves and pulls off one of these strange purple geodes the various crystals jutting out of different sides and it turns around and brings it forward this this carries pure condensed soul energy geodes robbed her from the fourth layer as he takes it and holds it in front towards you you look inside and you swear within the slight glimmers of light that shake through from the nearby braziers you see almost dozens of faces pressed up against the crystalline interior shifting past similar to that giant sphere that orb you saw being passed through the city when you first arrived this is what i have got i'm sorry i'm sorry he looks to you and looks back mistress i'm i have-- this it lumbers over to this far corner and there's a pile of what looks like burlap and refuse and partially eaten partially rotting away chunks of flesh and just rummaging through them looking over the shoulder with a scattered look and pulls up what looks to be a long-decomposed and somewhat mummified humanoid arm the fingers are kind of locked up in this way and there's a small brass bracelet around the center of the wrist he shakes it and you hear it rattling you can hear it rattling against the bones and as it shakes one of the fingers snaps off with a poof of dust and hits the ground oh sorry he picks it up and tries to put it back on but it won't go back on (sounds of disgust) okay the bracelet essentially acts as a divination beacon it's attuned to a secondary device that can keep watch on this one apparently whoever previously wore this was doing so under the intent of relaying their travel or experience to somewhere else and then met a very terrible end maybe not everything you encounter is going to be useful guys to whoever has the other object that's paired with this that you don't know what that is essentially it is magical it is functional you don't know how old it is or how long it's been there but it is magical you can see the brow furrow and there's a moment of instinctual anger and frustration like a kid who had his lunch money taken but he's still like (angry breathing) goes and sits down on the stool once more the long knobby knees almost jesting up to shoulder height as it sits its arms draped over the front and the fingers dragging across the ground in front as it does as it looks up take it yes yes he takes it and goes i will be a favor to the mistress no no no his hands clasp together overlapping in front of him he's looking up at you with this new grin almost like now there's been a moment of acceptance or a moment of some sort of in his eyes a union the creature's looking very confused but nevertheless eager to listen for the purple stone -- 1500 gold pieces as you throw the sack there is a-- (grunts) and sets it down next to it stands up grabs and takes the geode off the shelf and hands it to you mistress is pleased yes yes all right as you guys step out of the facility into the center of town you sense the final moments of your shapechange spell-- -- beginning to dissipate maybe i don't understand he leans out of the door with you and points towards the iron tower as you're about to leave he grabs the back of your cloak and pulls you in points past your shoulders his long jagged curved claw and you notice as two more of these flying entities that scoot by one of them perching on a building across the way wearing the golden armor stop and the whisperers and then pushes you back out of the street and you hear the shifting of metal behind you as a large slab is shifted to close the front of the shop all right okay make a perception check 24 okay-- okay between the two of you looking up there are-- at the peripheral of your vision and the bits of the green ash clouds that make up the sky as the occasional flashes of lightning streak through it from within you see the shadows of hundreds of flying entities that seem to be just running paths keeping watch many just stop and perch for a moment glancing over the street and then take off again many of them wearing the same gold armor these whisperers appear to be everywhere and watching everyone there is -- there are a handful that seem to be genuinely interested in keeping an eye on you but you also see other ones that are genuinely keeping an eye on anyone else wandering the street it seems that way yes okay yeah it's a ritual you'd have to set up for it all right so you head back and you're scrying on the chain devil you saw before okay all right what's your spell dc all righty actually it pulls from here-- it's going to be a wisdom save-- hmm okay hmm you finish the ritual and as you focus there's a flash of red-hot energy in your eyes and then the spell comes to an end okay you head downstairs-- okay as the two of you head down you can see-- there's that one central table to the left western side of the room that has almost like a trough look to it with the jagged edges currently has four imps that are perched on the edge that are just tearing into bits tearing it off and chewing and they all stop and look up at you all four at once as you walk down and they all just slowly chew as you approach and walk into the chamber no they are not wearing armor ipkesh is present but not at the same table he was earlier he's currently at the bar area talking with his rotund barkeep the thick greasy guy sits goes oh yeah he looks over to ipkesh-- winks at you on the house it looks like-- you know steak tartare where it has that purplish-red color to it imagine that but there's a series of jagged bone shards sticking out at sections of it like whatever it was carved off of had been pulverized before it was butchered yes but with the bone still present within and it is seeping this sludge-like bloody fluid that is just pooled around it on this iron platter okay okay well there are no utensils using the bone as the utensil okay as you spool it up pop it in and chew it's-- it's very gamey it's warm but the flavor it's-- it's very iron-like kind of yeah and a similar texture the bones do tear into parts of your upper lip it hurts i'd say in the process of devouring this one bite you do suffer-- you suffer two points of piercing damage as you're chewing-- vax you watch grog squinting his eyes a bit and chewing as bits of blood begin to dribble down the sides of his chin but a bright red color not the color of the meat that he's eating no you do not you chew it you swallow it it hurts and grinds its way down hits your stomach there is a slight numbness to the inside as you eat it but that's the most you get all right you bite by bite begin to finish the meal i'd say for the remainder of it you suffer another three points of piercing damage but you do finish the flesh in front of you nope his already somewhat greasy ruddy cheeks go to a blushing smile thank you yeah it's pretty awful all right you guys head back up so what's everyone doing no no if you complete the third pact-- you still live but then when you die your soul is forfeit correct and if by any means at any point you break the contract-- this would be a conversation to have with the scribe all right so all of you head down into the main chamber of the tavern and there returning to the table where he once sat you see ipkesh no wine glass but the paper folded out in front waiting patiently with his hands folded in the front yes please if the rest of your friends complete the contract your soul is fine if you don't complete the contract you are in breach just you once you are there you are on your own however i can ensure that you are brought there unharmed i can imagine that can be arranged to the extent of my capabilities yes just as you have limitations as do i but where in this is it fair for me to suffer for your stupidity not to my knowledge no those chambers specifically reside within the iron tower that's where they imprison the extremely dangerous ones the bastion of flesh is where they keep all the living mortals that were captured on this plane and not yet fully corrupt they would however if you so wish i can arrange to have them maintained in your presence as you do that he grabs the paper and pulls it over and just takes his finger and writes it across and as he does it amends the words in the contract in front of you to include the guide to lead you to where you're going as well as allowing your equipment to also-- unharmed and unspoiled and within your grasp i do not you may okay he seems honest you get the sense here he doesn't gain anything if you all fail if you complete both sides of the contract and then he dies he gets nothing so-- (weird skype noises) if-- i dunno but yes so you get the sense that the purpose of this contract is in hopes of eventual corruption i have nothing to gain by revealing your presence i can write up a different contract for you if you like he kind of leans in and squints hm it is a signet of the cult of asmodeus it is a trifle here but is used on your plane to assert belonging yes the herald is quite powerful the herald resides within his stronghold-- you would general guarding throughout the stronghold i'd put it at about a dozen maybe those are his forces locally he has guards throughout the city but they're scattered thus the importance of this is to go in unseen and unheard and if you run into resistance squash it before it can make any noise nothing too serious the bearded variety maybe a bone devil maybe two i don't know oh this is a pit fiend but utugash is strong but slow slovenly sluggish has reveled in his own opulence for far too long i mean it seems to be the contract wouldn't be binding on his end if it wasn't you don't have to write the entire name (laughs) we'll say you do in character okay as you finish signing the ink kind of flashes and glows and it burns into the parchment ever so slightly to the point where you smell the scent of just slightly singed parchment it curls up away from you and into his grasp as he takes it hm pleasure doing business now and he snaps his fingers and you watch kind of apparate on one shoulder one of the imps that you saw earlier-- -- when you arrived that kind of saw you and rushed out when you were coming downstairs it appears on his shoulder this is vasa he will be your guide vasa v-a-s-a vessar is your last name vasa is different vasa will guide you thankfully the stronghold is near the torture pits so there is general din and sound and agony to surround so that might offer you some solace in being unheard but be careful i know rest prepare enter where is easiest always the path of least resistance get the jump surprise and silence when it's time to leave i can help you travel mostly unseen should you avoid some of the more piercing eyes of this domain i can provide maybe one or two very well rest i'll be here waiting don't worry i'll know when he's down as i'm sending vasa along with you and once this is known just wait because the alarm will call the guard specifically the ones that work for me no one that seem to be under his employ no otherwise clear them out all right as you guys make your way back to your room to discuss we're going to take a break we'll be back here in just a few moments we have our tiger maple dice tower giveaway at the break from our friends at-- oh my god it's all in pieces still oh god but yeah it's all magnetically put together i know you can make it-- that all magnetizes together it's pretty rad so yeah do we have a code word for the chat i pick the code word will be 'pact' p-a-c-t so go ahead and come over to the twitch chat room use the word 'pact' in there to join the chance giveaway exactly awesome see you guys in a few minutes hello guys and welcome back all right so before we get in real fast we have the winner in chat the winner of the dice box is iccara iccara congratulations (cheering) yeah panels and signings and all that fun stuff so folks near and around the seattle area come up to sakura con and say hi yeah okay bringing it back in so you guys have signed a contract what do you to prep what are you doing now you're locked in nope and poison you guys technically are still under the effects of a feast depends on how soon you get there the feast lasts for 24 hours it's been probably if you start resting fairly soon it will have been maybe four to five hours after you used this-- or ate the feast with the eight hours' full rest you're still looking at almost half a day left it's up to you up to you all right you guys have an evening's rest in the second layer of hell within the iron city of dis the beds are warm they're very toasty it's like trying to fall asleep in middle of the summer in the valley with no air conditioning it can be done but you're sweaty and it's not very comfortable maybe yeah it does help somewhat you're the most comfortable sleeper in the entire group all right i need all of you guys to roll a wisdom saving throw if you don't mind that's correct yep okay vax okay you guys all awaken rested as you know in a similar way you're rested after being out open under the night's sky on the side of the road in a campsite it's not the best rest but it's enough to at least continue with some wind back in your sails other than that you are feeling a little bit hungry you're feeling fine and actually it cooks pretty easily there are portions of the iron metal especially on the bottom floor that cook it pretty well all right and you manage to cook a decent-- and the boar meat's been frozen for a while so it's not the best but it's better than bone splinter meat chunks how much did you have half a boar meat half a boar between all of you guys including grog's appetite i'd say that's about it that boar is gone oh no wow we just had a very oregon trail moment i'm proud of us not since the beginning yeah all righty no you have no idea as you head downstairs you do notice that ipkesh is sitting at one of the chairs at the far end of the bar the usual keeper of the establishment is not currently there there is nobody else in the bottom portion it is empty and the imp vasa is currently resting on the shoulder of ipkesh as you approach just to be safe best not to have individuals knowing of our present arrangements or your group exit applying to me vasa will be able to bring you to your location vasa's mastery is in not being seen and keeping beneath the eyes of the whisperers vasa will not be able to aid you in the confrontation for vasa is as strong as the parchment you signed yesterday mm-hm and he pulls from a small satchel on the side of his long black and purple robe this small leather case that is locked on one side and as he pulls it open and reveals this very very tightly wound piece of parchment and he hands it over this is a silence spell i could not procure two unfortunately but this will aid you the whisperers they do not see through illusions but they do see through invisibility at least-- not all of them the bigger ones if you see any that are larger than our winged compatriot here those are the ones to avoid that sounds if that is within your capability that sounds very reasonable vasa could show you the way in yes so this is animal shapes into a-- what form are you taking right but what form are you taking animal shapes basically you guys can become a large or smaller beast micro-- no i mean bird-size would be about as small as you could get i mean there are fiendish variations and there are rats that exist on this plane though life for them is not very enjoyable so shall vasa guide you very well taps the edge and vasa's been watching goes come follow me and takes off of the side of his shoulder you guys have spoken with an imp before and the imp (fwsh) out the window grabs onto the side of the doorframe and then scurries onto the outside and turns back around and looks inside come come all righty that being the case you guys step outside onto the street and you watch as vasa disappears down the same alleyway that you previously had nearly been assaulted in keyleth you guys i need you all to make stealth checks jesus all right so for the first leg of this journey as you're watching as vasa is darting from edge to edge and occasionally almost dematerializing and turning invisible and for a moment you have to stop and look around and then you watch his form appear off in the distance and shoot up a tiny little lit flare to gather your attention once any large whisperers pass overhead and this process of rubberbanding behind vasa continues over the next half an hour or so going deeper and deeper into the city and as you go vex you're keeping a pretty close watch on where you're coming from though you're also seeing large groups of lemures which is how it's pronounced as i've been corrected and i'm so glad it's pronounced that and not lemurs because that sounds awful as hell it's lemure i know and they're not cute they're horrible fleshy tortured souls you see clusters of lemures throughout the city as well as low-level spine devils and some other fiendish creatures that are in the process of rebuilding and reconstructing buildings and tearing down others you start seeing elements of the city are constantly in a state of being restructured rebuilt sometimes more grandiose sometimes more awful and terrifying and you get the sense that the city is in a perpetual state of flux that gleaming iron tower still just beyond your visual sight whenever you have to readjust your vision across the horizon i need you guys to all make another stealth check for these different steps of the journey doesn't-- so as you guys are moving along watching vasa vasa eventually gets out of sight for a moment and you all stop and pull back and you see a flash of light that signifies vasa calling you forward and that it's safe and as you all move forward you watch as taryon and percival were both looking behind keeping watch on your back and by the time they look back you guys are already about 20 feet ahead and as they rush forward percival straight up-- his foot hits the edge of where two of the iron rifts in the ground the plating that meets up this part of the alleyway he stumbles forward landing hard on his elbow and giving out a (groan) of his breath and as he does you hear a (imp sound) and you watch as a small impish creature in golden armor begins to crawl over the roof of the nearby building and look over the side okay i want you to go and make a deception check no you have to roll if it's intentional (laughter) yeah nine okay so you watch the creature (imp sounds) and slowly crawls along the top of the roof as you go and split off from the rest of the party you hear behind you the (imp talking) some sort of conversation and then a second one appears and one continues to follow you while the other one continues to move with taryon yeah you watch as after he gets back up he breaks off from the rest of the group okay so you're both now being followed by two of these-- you all just made it past this open walkway in the street turned around another alley and you watched this happen across the way they're about 15 20 feet from you in an open road the imps are on the other side of the road from you right now if you want to you can try in a moment okay one of the two imps breaks off and swoops down after it and immediately runs over and starts scattering across the ground trying to catch it as it tumbles off of the side the other one continues to follow after the two of you the bigger ones do some of the whisperers do some don't he said be wary of the bigger ones they see through invisibility and possibly other things you do yes okay make it with disadvantage because you are being actively watched you can turn around the corner and attempt it but you know it is aware that you walked there so your ability to slip out of its view once you break from its line of sight is going to be this check sure let's try it go ahead and make your stealth check okay so as you turn around the corner you step onto the side of the wall hearing the impact of the boots across the iron side thankfully it's enchanted boots so the damage is relatively minimal but you do hear the very faint sizzle of leather on hot metal what are you doing tary all right so as this one is following percival around the corner the one that was going after you that was distracted by the stone you turn invisible and it glances around and has lost sight of you for the moment and it continues to push after percival as you head down this alleyway and you guys are parallel following on the side watching this from a distance but staying out of sight without making yourselves visible percival you look up and you see this strange eerie green glow that begins to drift in your direction you watch as these spectral arms begin to drift up out of the ground and this elongated horrifying face pulls up from underneath the darkened cobblestones of the street and this specter entity drifts in your direction it's some sort of a ghost-like creature you've seen a number of these emanating and drifting through the city some in small clusters some individually they seem to wander aimlessly throughout okay that takes a minute to do it you glance over your shoulder and see it and it is currently crawled around the side and it's leaping from these windowsills these small iron squares that are about that big that are built into the side of these walls here it's leaping and flying from section to section staying immediately 15 feet 20 feet behind you do you want to go and follow it's about 20 feet behind you yeah yeah about 15 feet up all right go for it roll for an attack it should say under your ability here i'll pull it up if you want this is for the throw or is it the creature's saving throw which is it which of the two let me go look actually this is the tanglefoot bag so what you do is it splats against it and you watch it (choking noise) it gets stuck and sapped into it it's moving now at half pace it's having to pull through this substance that's glued to its feet and it's trying to tear away all right you turn around the corner now and you see first off taryon appears because when you throw the bag it breaks your invisibility yeah so now you see percival and taryon both appear and this one impish creature is now currently partially glued to a wall and is fighting trying to pull its way out okay yeah so go ahead and roll no it is aware that there are threats in its vicinity so it's not a surprise attack but it does not see you so you have advantage on the attack it is considered a sneak attack if you hit it yeah that hits how much damage is the first attack 12 damage it's sneak attack because it didn't see you so right as it's pulling away from this tanglefoot bag this explosion of glue it's like (rasping noise) and the dagger just slips through it and you watch as it goes in four different pieces and retracts into the tanglefoot bag muck once more it got completely shredded and the sections are withdrawn back and stuck to it as it is slowly now dribbling out of this massive glue on the side of the building which is now starting to bubble from the heat from the side of this structure okay the impish creature that was distracted by your stone is now attempting to catch up i want the three of you to make one more stealth check since you've all revealed yourselves okay you guys darting into the shadows rush around the corner you hear in the distance the clattering of tiny imp claws and the impacts of it doing the same perch-to-perch gliding through the alleyway you turn the corner and join up with the rest of the party you hear in the distance some sort of a distant barking call in the language you don't understand you gather that they've acknowledged that there has been a whisperer slain in the alley so you might want to hurry as you guys collectively catch up with vasa and are led further into the city you begin to hear now this horrible grinding sound of metal that becomes omnipresent farther down this labyrinthine network of alleys and streets you can see the glow of red and orange that previously just emanated from the horizon is now beginning to light the sky around you it's this light pollution from some sort of nearby source as you turn one of the corners you look and see giant pyres of molten metal and fire there is a gargantuan forge where people are-- i say people these devilish entities-- and hundreds of lemures are just heaping large bits of iron ingots and scrap metal from fallen buildings and tossing them into this forge every time they do there's a burst of flame and ash and cinder come pouring out of it from there you can see refined metals being pulled out and brought to other elements of this city beyond that as you glance over you can hear this faint echoing sound of hundreds upon hundreds of voices all moaning screaming squealing in torturous pain you don't have a view of what's causing it but this whole area of this city just brings this terrifying presence of all the torment you'd expect from somewhere in the hells as you pause a moment vasa darts back trying to usher you forward in the direction of the sound come come follow and then vanishes once again appearing on the other side of the street and then beckoning you once more for the last leg i need everyone to make one more stealth check all of you okay as you're waiting for the right moment to cross the street you wait for one cluster of these tiny winged not quite imps they're a little larger than imps with this dark bluish-green spine protrusions out of the wings and their heads are these giant bony ridges that go back and they have these long spears and about two dozen of them come down this street in a vast cluster almost like a bat storm a whole bunch of just randomly flying and angrily screeching creatures and as you wait for that to pass the minute that sound goes past you dart across the alleyway and make it to the other side and turn just in time for the large heavy footfalls of what looks to be some sort of monstrosity multiple arms that are stitched to this large golem-like creature it's humanoid but it's about 15 feet tall and it's just covered in stitches multiple chunks of different faces that are all just sewn together in places you can see this series of gems that are imbedded in its shoulders and part of its throat that all pulse like separate heartbeats that are out of pace with each other and as it stumbles forward you see a chain around its neck and it's being dragged by this tiny imp that's just pulling it forward and tugging on it it doesn't even make much of a noise other than a perpetual gurgle but it's just some sort of flesh-stitched automaton that's being dragged forward to its next physical activity at the behest of whoever owns it a few moments later vasa brings you to the outside of a large jet-black metallic and stone structure a heavy thick-walled stronghold with a series of what looks like-- imagine a thick bramble forest made of twisted iron that surrounds the base of it about five feet high there are small gaps where you guys can try and squeeze through for the more lithe folk grog you're not quite sure how you're going to get over this without tearing bits of you apart there's about a ten foot gap between this strange metal bramble fence and the outside of this stronghold grog you get inside you release him out on the other side all right well done at which point you now have doty on the other side just going (smashing noises) no effect you guys have been good enough to keep far enough ahead that this wandering metallic automaton about 25 feet behind you hasn't drawn any strange attention yet no steam vents that you can see it's just this tangled mass of thick metal cables maybe about a foot thick that have spikes jutting out of them it's climbable but there may be some damage taken in the process doty then reaches out and (metal noises) and it takes a few moments but doty begins to actually force the brambles apart and you can see bits of the metal (clinking) and bits of the spikes jutting through and breaking parts of the armor from the opposite side and are piercing it it does manage to pull enough of an opening where doty squeezes through and gets to the other side however doty does suffer 12 points of piercing damage in the process but emerges it's pretty noticeable it's about that big around roll a strength check it takes you a little bit of time and you manage to squeeze it together you do take three points of piercing damage that's essentially why he's able to do it on a roll of 15 because of his siege ability you do manage to squeeze it back together and close the hole now vasa you see is now up on the side of this wall and this stronghold has nearly no openings on any other side however there is a small sliver of an opening it's almost like an exhaust on the higher end there and vasa is currently perched up onto it about seven feet up it's about a foot and a half high and about two and a half three feet wide he pulls a patch out off of his robe and tears it off and slams it against the stone as it does you watch as what was once solid black metal a tiny seam of orange appears in a large rectangular pattern and then opens ever so slightly on a hinge that wasn't there before as you guys peer inside ever so carefully do you guys want to-- make a perception check it is very dark inside there's a faint bit of almost like candlelight out of view you can see there's a shifting glow internally that seems to have a life of a small flame make a perception check okay as you glance inside of it you can see there's a series of chains dangling from the ceiling carrying hooks on them a number of these hooks seem to have a dried reddish caked blood-like material some of them have bits of flesh still stripped and dangling from them there are two tables in this chamber each table seemingly containing some sort of a humanoid body that is placed on it and strapped down one appears to be in two pieces there is a torso and there are legs and the center piece that once held the parts together is nowhere near in sight too shadowed to make any details from this angle as you've just peered past the door but there does not appear to be any other moving or living creature in the chamber that you can see as far as you can tell you take a moment longer and you see the one on the far table is breathing all right roll a stealth check okay as you slowly slip into the chamber closing the door ever so slightly to make just the faintest creaking of metal on metal you slip into the chamber and you can see there's shelves with various torture instruments just strewn across it it looks like a terrible nightmare version of percy's work chamber back in greyskull keep there are two doors in the room one on the north side and one on the eastern side and the body that's on one table you can see appears to be human older male there are signs of some sort of physical scarring on the body whether it be necromantic or corruption-based it has been long dead there is a very strong smell of decay the other table you do see the slight moving chest of a living dwarf a female dwarf that appears to be passed out unconscious and has suffered quite a bit of torturous wounds you can see hundreds of small scratches and jagged dagger wounds in the side of the shoulders and arms the face and is currently strapped down to the table you are yes divine sense to sense-- within 60 feet of you all right nothing coming from that dwarf but there are a number of other sources throughout the fortress not in the room but within 60 feet of you you get a view of the chamber to the north of you and a chamber to the east of you the eastern chamber nothing the chamber to the north of you just beyond that door there is a signature yes you guys all quietly make your way into the chambers okay she's not naked she's wearing basic cloth clothing but a lot of it has been torn and soaked deep deep crimson with blood a lot of it appears to be torn from stress and tension there are claw marks from all over this chamber from various demonic entities that have torn through here but the table she's on as well the body suddenly stirs on the table noelle if you want to step on in you hear a noise and as you come to in the darkened room with just the faint glow of the candelabra in the corner you glance over a dart and you see a series of shapes filtering in from a door that you haven't noticed before in the chamber and begin whispering to each other and then looking over to you occasionally one of them suddenly goes hello and the rest go shh as you get a close look at her too you see she has darker auburn red hair with a shock of white-gray in it shaved on the sides one gnarled ear that has been chewed and torn and a series of scratch scars across the front of her face she is manacled to it both ankles and wrists are manacled to this table make an investigation check yeah what did you get she's hard to read she seems brusque and honestly chained to a table and probably tortured yeah it's too late you cast cure wounds go ahead and roll for it you hear taryon say that as soon as you finish casting the spell into the dwarf woman you add your wisdom modifier where once you're groggy the sudden flash of the divine energy and the healing power that sifts through your body it brings a moment of respite and calmness to you and you feel a lot better than you did a few moments ago what did you roll vax yeah the manacles are not trapped all right so go ahead both you guys roll to pick locks dex bonus plus your proficiency bonus okay you guys take a quick moment and very deftly and very quietly the twins in unison release the manacles and you instinctively sit up and rub your wrists with that you're back to full because you've been resting for a while and recovering from the wounds of the last torture session the chamber has low flickering light from two different candelabras one near you guys in the corner and one near the center doorways over here you guys do a quick pass you look around and there are some chests around here and you carefully go through some of them that are left open and you do not see any of your equipment within the room there are a number of torture implements yeah of the things that look most useful to you there's a giant iron fork there are chained hooks it's a two-pronged long thick metal fork but as a dwarf you're stocky and strong with your background as well it's not really an issue at this point you hear a (click) sound and a door beginning to open on the north end of the wall make stealth checks taryon and grog with disadvantage with disadvantage you got a 19 holy shit oh plus-- yeah yeah you can get on the table if you want all right but you do it noisily all right so the door opens and as it does-- a creature comes through similar to ipkesh another humanoid this one a little thicker burlier with a medium-grey hair that is kind of a tangled mass all into dreads right past the shoulders big leathery red wings red skin horns at the front and has a big sword it kind of is pulling out of a sheath on the side of it as it comes in looking around the room which-- immediately kind of steps into the chamber as you guys all hide off to the side shit and is going to turn around and just go running in the opposite direction okay so this going to be a surprise-- not a surprise round it knows you guys are there but this-- this is going to be a roll for initiative everyone roll some initiative (laughs) oh man all righty so top of the round we have 25 to 20 anybody 28 jesus christ okay oh 21 nice all righty 20 to 15 18 all right 16 15 to ten ten to five five to one oh all righty percival you're up first you see this devilish humanoid-- -- beginning to pivot and turn you are right there okay okay right the doorway is about the size of him so you-- i mean it takes up the entire doorway essentially and it's just pivoting after it notices you guys so you're gonna have to make a tumble check to try and make it past him an acrobatics roll but yeah okay so you're trying to basically as he goes to spin around you dash forward and roll into a tumble to try and pop up on the other side so go ahead and roll acrobatics check 22 natural 20 on his end so as you tumble not even noticing-- the world spins as you go into a roll and suddenly there's just a flash of white and there's just a foot a massive boot in your face as the individual slams a kick into your head to stop you from tumbling forward and you stop in place so you're currently prone on the ground but you still have your action if you want to go for it you are prone you have disadvantage on your attack rolls yes that hits 15 misses that hits go ahead and roll damage twice and tova you're up next so be ready all righty 18 from both strikes yeah all righty all righty so as you land on the ground you pull your sword out and just swipe three times in the air two of them striking across its thigh and the kneecap it still stands but you see it took a nice sizable chunk out of it that ends your turn percival tova what are you doing you're currently still up on the table sitting up you have the greatsword at your side and you watch as the-- one of them one of the new people stumbles onto the ground and then slashes at this creature a couple times and it's right there kind of still trying to find its way out what're you doing all right so as you leap in the air bringing it down go ahead and make both attacks first one this would be a plus ten because it's not magical i believe right unfortunately neither hit the one-- yeah the first one it hits the front of its armor and just scrapes off the side the other one you swing back and it slams into the stonework and it just ducks underneath bonus action anything you want to do before it tries to run away you watch now you see the clothing that was on her before wasn't torn from torture but her form rages into this bipedal humanoid bear with rippling muscles the same scars across the face and begins to just growl as the greatsword now looks almost small in comparison in this mighty kind of humanoid bear's grasp that's the end of your turn all right the devil-creature is going to go ahead and turn around-- -- and attempt to move this way to the door both of you guys get an attack of opportunity as it rushes away yes 'cause you're still prone that hits go ahead and roll damage that's 2d6 for the damage on the greatsword it'd be plus six because your strength is five and plus one there for the weapon plus six total okay and if you ever roll a one on the dice or a one or a two you can re-roll it once you can roll each one once like if it gets under that it's part of your great weapon master no yeah so 13 points of damage all righty so you hack at it as it's running away but it still manages to go-- get out over this side it goes to the next door and throws it open okay you guys still can't quite see what's in that chamber beyond from your perspective and is going to move in it just gets about that far into the chamber all right that gets us to vax's turn he's just moved-- he's out of sight of you currently because you're over here yeah you don't see him you can if you run to where the doorway is open you can see him as he's just disappearing into a darkened chamber beyond go for it misses 29 hits okay that is a 12 no okay got you cool all right so the dagger (impact sound) and you see him stumble for a moment as his wings kind of instinctually curl up from the sudden burst of poison in his system so you do have some more movement if you wanted to okay so you're going to stay in the doorway that brings us to vex's turn vex your turn yeah it's all good i mean he's not-- he's staying low and your brother knows not to block the whole path so-- go for it go for it 20 hits all righty okay all righty so both arrows (impact sound) it tumbles forward kind of like falls to one knee for a second and is still picking up and running so that finishes your turn that brings us to grog (laughs) easy enough for you five ten 15-- 30 35 40 45 50-- you can just get within melee range-- (cheering) -- because crazy barbarian speed you also reveal the rest of the chamber-- you see two of the-- this chamber contains a bunch of-- a bunch of looks like cells of some kind that are locked off with doors and two of the lemures the weird fleshy tortured spirit things kind of lie in the corner that all of a sudden see you as you charge in and just pay attention to your appearance so what are you going to do okay is this your bonus action go for it yes that hits 21 points of damage all righty that hits go ahead and roll damage okay as you rush forward slam once into the back of his shoulder he kind of falls to one knee again still wounded by the slashing to his thighs and the arrows out of his back the wings kind of unfurl a bit and he turns around looking like he's about to point his finger towards you-- -- there's like a flash in the eye like it's attempting to have some sort of type of-- but before it does you bring the hammer down onto his face whack and as it does it just caves inward and falls to the ground unmoving that brings us to taryon's turn okay you're right here all right so that's five ten 15 20-- 30 35 40 you get all the way into this room you still have 20 feet of movement left as you enter next to grog and see two of the fleshy masses of tortured souls kind of starting to make their way in the direction of you and grog you have your bonus action that's it because you cast haste and then did your movement very well you run up towards one of these creatures and as you get closer as you see it becomes more and more apparent in your vision the more horrifying it gets as you get closer what's doty going to do doty's movement is-- doty has to spend half of-- it's difficult to get through the doorway-- and gets about that far doty actually pushes vax out of the way it has to bend down and get into this central chamber doty can use the rest of the movement to get into the room with you doty can get right there and that's all doty can do this turn all righty that brings us to keyleth's turn yes grog can see both of these things here you mean can taryon see this way you mean taryon can just barely begin to see a hallway that goes further that way over here you mean you don't see anything in there there's nothing in your room right now what's this here that's doty that is grog you don't see anything in the chamber everyone's just kind of-- your new friend turned into a bear and everyone ran through a door that's even better all right you can just get into this chamber with your movement you can if you used your action but that's all you'd be able to do this turn yeah not very stealthily or manly so any strength checks you make are with advantage though you already have that while raging when he rages he gets advantage on his strength checks okay cat's grace so you have advantage on any stealth checks you make all righty that ends keyleth's turn back to the top of the round percival you get up that's half your movement to your right there is a hallway and then a doorway yeah right there these cages are empty currently yes which one this one is currently closed that's as far as you can get right there all righty that ends your turn percival tova yes that means if you want to on an attack you can take minus five to hit to add ten to damage that's great weapon master and then you have great weapon fighting you can reroll any ones or twos that you roll for damage yeah because it's low light you rush in the one that was initially left is slaughtered on the ground but as you rush past stepping over its corpse you see another fleshy mass lemure the creatures that have been following you around since you got here yeah go for it roll for an attack correct you do it's an additional plus two that hits go ahead and roll damage 21 points of damage as you rush forward you come down with the greatsword and slice right to the center of this cluster of flesh it's just (burbling) and falls to the ground sloughing in two pieces quivering and then disperses you do have a bonus action yeah a big old thick bear loogie onto the corpse as it slowly turns into a liquid it steams as it falls into the cracks and crevices of the stone floor all right that's tova's turn that guy's gone this lemure 15 foot of movement another one comes up behind you but it has to use all of its action to get to you these creatures are not very dangerous if you're far away as that shambles forward another winged creature turns the corner inspecting the sound and as it turns the corner and sees you taryon shouting as you ran forward with the spear and the creature right as you're about to attack gets slashed in half in front of you robbing you of your glory you turn the corner and see another winged humanoid this one female with a very intense scowl on its face you can see the fanged teeth out of its mouth and points towards you i need you to go ahead and make a wisdom saving throw with advantage 18 okay you feel an influence begin to press into your brain drawing you into a strange brain space and you clench your eyes and force it out your will strong enough to resist the effect upon seeing this fail and your vision go clear it glances about and sees everyone else charging into the room and then backs up again into the chamber this way that far with the rest of their movement and that's as far as they get that brings us to vax you do you are indeed all right i will say if you don't move grog is blocking a large portion of this space so i'll give you disadvantage on the attack even though the creature's very easy to see fair enough so go ahead you're unaffected 22 it hits go and roll damage yes oh grog is not grog is about ten feet away from it tova's right next to it okay you eviscerate the lemure you watch as you jam your dagger through it multiple times and each section you carve off of it it splits open leaving these stringy tendrils of flesh and tendon behind as it wails and shrieks to the ground slowly dissipating into a thick sludge make a perception check as you make a glance around the room 24 you unfortunately do not you do yes you can you can back into that corner here and go ahead and roll your stealth okay well you don't get the plus ten because you already cast hunter's mark which got rid of pass without a trace so 30 but good to know vex you're up that's as far as you can get there and then trinket emerges in the chamber next to grog goes over and is right next to the destroyed corpse of the devil humanoid earlier the face smashed in guys you all hear vex say that trinket does manage to just catch up with it yeah he can 28 hits yeah go ahead and roll damage are you using your action to give him a double attack okay because you're not actually attacking anything so go for it so it's two attacks so the first one's damage 14 all righty 26 hits 17 there you go so look at that so trinket rushes in with a double swipe as soon as the creature backs around the corner and it goes to turn trinket comes rushing around the corner and tears into it with a claw and a bite into this female devil who is pushed into the wall and torn into the chest terribly you guys just see and hear this in the distance you don't actually watch the impact happen but you hear the screaming and trinket roaring as it strikes into it you get the sense that it's going to be real hard to try to maintain a sense of stealth in this stronghold now so that ends your turn grog you're up okay go ahead and roll a stealth check actually i'd probably say it's a bonus action yeah grog not an issue you get up there right with trinket we'll say for the purposes of this tiny alley you're in an uncomfortably close due to your both massive sizes you have to move to the side around trinket and come down with the hammer if you want that hits 18 points of damage all righty that hits go ahead and roll damage all righty as you slam into it multiple times the hammer reaching around the side of trinket it's being pushed against the wall and you can see she has this giant slash mark on the chest a big part of the neck has been torn out and you start bludgeoning her on the side of the shoulder and she's (growling noises) is really really frustrated that ends your turn grog taryon you're up it is as soon as you run around the corner you see this mass of fur that is trinket this mass of muscle that is grog and this tiny little bit of a devilish head of this female as you're holding your pike you do have a little more movement yeah because it is a reach weapon you can over trinket go ahead and roll an attack yes you can do that the front of it bursts into flame and you appear on the side so go and roll an attack 21 hits ten all right the fire's reduced by half so it's eight eight points of damage you do 18 unfortunately does not hit that hits 15 because fire half the fire damage as you jam it over trinket the second one gets it in the throat that'll do it you poke and as the lance slinks into the side of her throat which is the only thing you can really see at this point over trinket she grabs up and instinctually catches the lance as you're pushing it in and you shove it in going ahh it's like a slow saving private ryan knife push she's like (gurgling noise) and just falls limp on the edge of the lance crumples to the ground doty immediately pulls the small chamber in the side of the torso that holds the book and-- all right that ends taryon's turn keyleth okay what's the casting time on locate creature locate creature okay it's one action you can do it okay you immediately sense a very large heavy source of energy right in the center of this chamber here you hear a very very faint sound of shifting stone it's very faint that's it currently there is no immediate threat so you guys can take a moment if you feel like you need to which one over there okay just your room that's all you're really aware of so as you look over in that corner you can see it's this series of five locked cell doors some of them have small bars in the window some of them are just solid doors but they're all slammed and locked you don't know okay all right keyleth are you doing anything else it takes ten minutes to do that sorry is tary leading the charge here all right so you're following tary everyone's moving over to the hallway here then doty is pushing forward this way tova are you following all righty staying back you're the back of the pack-- well middle of the pack right now well first and foremost-- not before you all started moving forward you can if you want to but you'll stay behind everyone for a little bit yeah make a perception check with advantage because of your keen senses so what did you roll for your check 20 (sniffs) you are familiar with this smell utugash it is a combined smell of sulfur a dry earth and grotesque decomposition and the smell is very strong and you can already follow the scent it does lead into this next chamber which is just an open wall it isn't a door that's closed-- there's no door it's just an open wall that leads into a chamber taryon you're leading the charge you said yeah so you step up and move as you do i need you to make a dexterity saving throw 19 as you step forward something beneath your foot (click) and you look up just as you-- as a piece of a circular stone opening that you previously didn't see before suddenly pours a heavy amount of extremely hot boiling oil down above you and you step back just out of the way as it splatters across the ground sizzling there yeah he doesn't get saving throws he gets skills from you but he has advantage on saving throws from traps you step forward make a perception check all right as you turn around the corner and look in the interior is very low-lit what little bit of light-- i know you have darkvision but there is-- what little bit of light you see is two sources of very very low deep red light these two giant pools of some thick red liquid that are just emanating this very very faint glow inside you see there is a giant chair that is affixed into the center of the chamber as well as an altar in the center upon this chair you see similar to what you battled in the city of brass you see a massive pit fiend the wings lazily uncurled to each side the corpulent mass of it is just this giant belly that hangs over the front of its knees it clutches to its side and it's using currently to keep one of its arms propped up is a large axe and the other hand is just resting on the side of the throne and you see it just sitting there tapping its fingers looking straight at you as you enter-- as you step into the middle of the hallway there are a series of-- clusters of bones throughout the entire room you can and it leads to what looks to be a portcullis gate an iron gate of cross bars that has-- is closed currently yeah i will say it's 1045 do we want to pick up at this
