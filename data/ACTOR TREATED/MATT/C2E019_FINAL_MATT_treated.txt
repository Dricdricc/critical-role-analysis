tonight's episode of critical role [click tv static] [groovy critical role theme] apparently going back full circle back at 255 and zero last we left off the mighty nein have been caught up in the political turmoil of the empire noticing that the king has declared war on the eastern realm of xhorhas specifically the kryn dynasty there was an assault on one of the garrisons in the east there were many lives lost and the sky now darkens you've begun to decide what it is you can do and what your current plan of action is as you began to gather your things as you decide where your next trajectory would be you were summoned to the king's hall and brought before the lawmaster of the town of zadash she implored you if you're interested having proven your mettle in the past and in the victory pit not too long ago if you'd be interested as signing off as legionnaires to help aid protect and do work for the empire at home while all the military forces of the righteous brand had moved to the east to engage with the enemy you took it under consideration and left went back to gather some more supplies at your inn you were delivered a missive from an old friend kara saying the the gentleman would like to speak with you that was where we left off mighty nein having just returned to the leaky tap being briefly met with kara who delivered this information and then vanished back into the afternoon what would you like to do if i recall it's later afternoon and we got there it's late afternoon i believe you make your way across the pentamarket to the familiar down dank and broody interior of the evening nip tavern you pass by clive who gives you a nod you head towards the hidden staircase down to the subterranean tavern there a different sound catches your ears there's the familiar sound of warm music and tavern flair but you also hear rowdy shouts and cheers and the occasional sound of something heavy against a skidding table as you slowly descend toward the base of the curved staircase to enter the main chamber you can see some folks are sitting at the tables the gentleman is in his far corner at the back and they're all watching a small circle of people in the center as two individuals in the process of beating the shit out of each other bare fists bare knuckled people are making bets laughing and cheering and throwing beer and various objects into the ring to mess with them it is mid-craze scuffle at the moment as you guys step down into the main area the large ogre bodyguard stands and turns back his low guttural grunt come through his protruding jawline with a (grunt) and gives you a sign to continue inward all right getting a glimpse here as you watch a bit of parting between shoulders as everyone's standing end to end you hear this heavy crack and the two people nearest to you bow backward apparently one of the two fighting individuals being thrusted into the circle is immediately pushed back into the center you hear another couple of swings go before they both breakaway you can hear the heavy breaths of them now exhausted pouring with sweat you recognize them one is louis one of the agents who fled from the research facility that you were then going after and the other is thed the halfling fellow with the neck tattoo that you saved in the sewers not but a week and half earlier they are both bloodied-- yes yes they are both bloodied and tensely attempting to pummel the other into unconsciousness the people seem to be happily cheering it on as they go there were three people that went there and fled the research facility yes jester ascends to one of the nearby untaken tables and watches down into the mix thed crawls upward fists up in front of his face trying to guard he goes for a duck and comes in for an uppercut louis slaps it away but it still manages to catch the edge of his jaw he slaps his head a little bit to the side and as such he pushes off and gives a kick to the chest of thed who falls back a second and goes to his back leg and comes forward with a huge haymaker louis tries to back out of the way but it comes at an upward angle slams into the side of his temple you watch as his face goes starry eyed for a second as he tries to grab the edge of one of the chairs to catch himself thed runs up and then knees him right in the center of the chest and stomach region and you hear the (pained moan) the whole group goes oh around and you watch as louis pushes off the chair and steps back and tries to back swing towards thed thed slaps it out of the way and goes in for a headbutt it's at this point that louis appears to have pulled something from his back pocket and as he swings his hand upwards a scattering of sand and dust goes into thed's face who backs up going (pained yell) starts to rub it right into his face he begins to step away trying to get his fists up louis uses the opportunity to go forward and sweep his legs out from under him as he hits the ground chest up he goes into a double handed hammer fist right down into thed's chest the air escapes him once again the crowd goes oooh there's a slight in the back from the gentlemen who's trying to watch over the shoulders of everybody this first time he's acknowledged your entry he gives you a look over going a bit of a smile from the distance louis goes for a secondary blow however thed manages to push off his smaller halfling form able to dexterously dodge out of the way he's got one eye partially open the other one watering thick and he waits and paces himself for a moment louis however follows up behind it very quickly and goes for a knee straight to thed's face it slams in and as he backs up you can see the nose is permanently pushed to one side and blood is pouring down the front of his face he has a hand up you can't tell if he's going to say he's going to stop or if he's trying to defend and there's no one looking over this battle to stop it if it happens louis comes in to try and finish off what he started thed waits for the final moment and then ducks down below gets underneath and between the legs of louis and lifts throwing him up ass over tea kettle until he slams on the back of the ground he turns around wiping the other eye out of the way he pulls his leg up and attempts to stomp down onto louis's neck and connects immediately there's a (choking) and he's holding him to the ground and jamming and grinding his heel into his throat everyone's shouting get him louis is desperately trying to pull the boot of thed up off his throat but thed's able to keep it down he's pushing and pushing he spits blood right in the face of louis like onto one of his eyes the consciousness of louis begins to fade eyes roll back and then eventually as the rest of his body goes limp they pull thed off yeah they cheer and lift him up and carry him off they pull louis up into a chair and start slapping him and pour water in his face he comes to consciousness and spits out a tooth and then the crowd's energy begins to die down a bit and they drag them to different sides of the room and the people being to go about their business get another drink at the bar as you're doing that some of the crowd that had began to disperse suddenly turns and starts tapping each other (laughing) do you wa-- okay you both charge into the center starting seemingly with no purpose other then the necessary adrenaline to kickstart the rest of your evening i need you both to roll initiative roll initiative okay but-- hold on let me check real fast saving throws not ability checks you don't get advantage on your initiative you feel this sudden strange surge of adrenaline and energy time around you seems to slow ever so slightly as you watch jester starting rushing in swinging towards you faster than you expect though what are you doing at first level okay so it's a relatively soft punch as you're using it as a delivery method for the spell so it doesn't do any actual punch damage however you do have to roll to see if you connect so a melee spell attack go ahead and roll damage i believe that 3d10 necrotic let's thumb wrestle and you shoot him in the head like what suddenly your energy is instilled within your body your vision goes wide all the colors come into focus and you look up to see jester to distract yourself from the sudden sensation you've never experienced before the one thing you see is this fist connect with your chest and you all watch as a series of blood vessels in the sides of beauregard's face and neck suddenly burst and splash blood in different directions you see white for a second your body racked with pain and you recoil briefly from the sudden shock to your system you've got two attacks now you don't have your shield for this because you're fist fighting so your ac is technically two lower what's your ac normally yeah you roll damage and then she has to make a saving throw i believe it's a constitution saving throw seven points of bludgeoning damage as she begins to pummel you repeatedly across the front of the face down into the side of the torso and i need you to roll a constitution saving throw please jester okay as she continues down your torso there's one portion on the back of your armor where your spine is exposed beyond the clothing you're wearing and after she finishes the round she uses the momentum and strikes straight into base of the spine where the nerve would divide down to the pelvis and your entire body locks up all your muscles all spasm at once you are stunned the haste doesn't give you a fourth attack what does haste does is it gives you-- an extra attack action yeah you have your bonus action so yeah you can attack with your staff if you want to whatever your main attack is and then you still have your bonus action yes correct hold on she is stunned attack rolls against her are at advantage you roll again this hit you do pull back and hit the armor unfortunately and your fingers snap back a bit you feel the numbness from the attack mm-hmm that hits roll damage that's six bludgeoning damage to you as beau recoils from this and steadies herself from this round jester you are unable to move you're sluggishly trying to get your joints to function again you try and speak and it comes out in a stuttering phrase that fades away your tongue not listening to your impact travis marisha and too close to home that ends your turn back to beau you are no longer stunned let me double check and see when the actual stun wears off until the end of your next turn so you still have advantage on attacks against her 12 points of bludgeoning damage as the staff slams right into your clavicle shoulder area almost knocking you off your feet correct yes technically you're still stunned until the end of her turn 18 hits this is still the second strike with the staff after one knocking her back from the shoulder blow the wind gets knocked out of you from a sudden blow to your stomach area all right go ahead and take your damage all of a sudden your vision goes black for whatever reason where we saw the brief burst of the veins from the first strike from jester you watch as bits of crimson begin to pour out the corners of beau's mouth as her eyes go over black you don't have advantage it's just a straight roll for your attacks eventually your vision comes back but your knuckles hurt from the fact that you just punched twice in the thickest parts of her breast plate because of haste you do yes and that one has advantage that hits roll damage and with that-- jester got one good opening blow and then-- i mean partially but you also chose a fist fight against a monk which is a rough scenario the whole crowd goes yeah jester's unconscious you watch as one of the patrons of the bar comes up with a small jug of water and throws it in her face she's at one hit point not at the moment no and you're still affected by it at about this point in the conversation the adrenaline leaves your body and you almost keel over you become suddenly super lethargic and exhausted the crowd begins to go back to their scenarios some of them seem confused by the display of joyous hugging afterwards some seem to be down with it and are like yeah this is what it is about sitting on one of the table edges you see dweez the little creepy gnome who you met earlier who's like (breathy laugh) at this point a familiar voice kicks up from the back corner friends come sit thank you for such a fine display of sportsmanship apparently the gentleman now sits there his comfortable attire today comes in a billowing linen a dark navy blue shirt that frills at the wrists you can see his rings and jewelry available as his fingers are crossed and partially stapled-- steepled in front of him not stapled to him that's a whole different thing ah oh god you spend an hour here and you'll be fine thank you for coming so quickly rather tenuous times these are wouldn't you say word is the breach of the ashguard garrison was a massacre and now the skies there hang dark with ill-magic i'm glad that's hundreds of miles from here though now with the bulk of the military moving east and the crownsguard stretched thin we should begin bolstering our plots yes well a distracted empire is an easy empire to bend to our will or at least to not pay attention to what we're doing oh i have no interest in political endeavors just the more confused they are the better for business i have a few possible jobs here if you're interested i don't mean to act so quickly but word comes to me that you had been summoned to the king's hall i would hate to think i missed the opportunity to get more work under your wing before losing you to some unfortunate state-based conscription first order of business should you be interested he leans forwards and sets his glass a little further from the edge his voice hushes a bit as he leans in i've some friends to the north whom i've been needing to reconnect with allies who would be very profitable partners in these times i'm rather strapped for attention at the moment and i have a hard time trusting some of these other louts with detailed missions anyway if you have any interests-- indeed you glance back over your shoulder and see louis at the bar who's still dazed and drinking a giant cup of ale and wiping the blood off of his whole torso if you've interest in making coin doing some interesting work and getting to see most of our beautiful imperial countryside i can go on an old friend of mine named ophelia mardun she has a base of operations about 350 miles northeast of here past nogvurot and the quannah breach on the outskirts of shadycreek run i'm sure you've heard of it a sovereign town outside of the dwendalian empire and outside of the law that uses the savalierwood to keep the crown at bay spoken of as a haven for criminals thieves murderers but really it's home to the truly free entrepreneurs of wildemount and criminals thieves and murderers now ophelia is unable to enact on any partnerships at the moment as her current business is tangled up in some of the local riffraff and she's requested aid in stabilizing her situation what i propose as you've already proven yourselves effective problem solvers self-starters with enough sense of honor to see a deal through is for you all to travel northward past the silberquel ridge to shadycreek run to parlay with ophelia help her in absolving her from her current mire of complications and return with her here to zadash for this task completed i offer an advance of 500 gold pieces and a purse of 4500 gold pieces upon returning with miss mardun within the month yes she will once you manage to free her from her predicament i do not that is the intent and language she used when last we had correspondence i think the nature of her business much like ours is meant to be on an absolutely necessary basis only i'm sure once you speak to her you'll have better information on that i do if this seems to be beyond your depth i'd hate to see the coin go to someone else but i understand understood that underground tunnel that you've already visited happens to be a major artery for our smuggling business leading straight up to the lebenda swamp the lebenda swamp is a useful place to lose things or people until you need to find them as well as a direct route to my contacts in berleben we've been rather worried that no shipments have made their way south by the river in weeks after sending your friend up to berleben last week it was discovered that our safe house and storage facility in the swamp has gone dark one of my men as well as a handful of theirs in berleben went to investigate and never returned now the swamp-folk are a superstitious lot an unfortunate facet with working with them and the like i'm sure of it my contacts in town are refusing to investigate recounting howls from the deep swamp i would need you to head up to berleben locate a fellow named febron keyes usually hangs around the keystone pub in the puddles the puddles is the part of the town that is heh sinking he's my point man for shipments and the only one who knows where our safe house in the swamp is that hasn't gone fucking missing meet with him secure the safe house and its contents and return to me consider a 250 gold piece advance and a purse of 1750 gold pieces upon completion heck if you can handle both (laughs) and with timely mind there might be a bonus oh he's in berleben he should be fine this is all based in the swamp febron keyes (chuckles) he's memorable based by his fairly emanate lack of teeth his one wandering left eye a bit of a skin condition but he's good at the work he does keeping his mouth shut and knowing where the secrets are and not giving those secrets up he's been pressed for it a few times and has proven to be trustworthy and i admire that the sooner the better as the longer these shipments continues to elude us the more money we're losing like i said a timely manner there may be a bonus those are the two at the moment if those don't tickle your fancy i'm sure we could have another opportunity in the next week or two i just would hate to see these go to less qualified individuals of course you mistake this business as some sort of a push for an inherently equal pay my friend i don't know what business the crown wishes to offer you but i can guarantee you it has a ceiling make a persuasion check you're leaning on one leg a little bit unintentionally leaning in i'm sure we could provide a few supplies remember we try not to dip into our own contraband but we could assume that we could provide some things yes we can provide paper and ink sure of course well drink be merry you know where to find me there is that yeah it's more like a shufflepuck thing with the sand on the side yeah the darkest table is the one that is tucked right inside the spiral staircase where you enter which normally has somebody sitting there but at the moment it looks like they're getting a drink if you swipe it now you'll probably piss somebody off but you'll get the table as you guys approach you can see the same muscular thuggish individual with the tanned skin and the thick bracers around his rough and tumble exterior begins to approach with a large fully filled flagon of ale who stops sees that you're sitting there and grumbles to himself and finds another seat but you are as private as you can be in this relatively not private space you have a table the branson of wildemount okay he's back at the far table he's currently drinking and it looks like he has a small book of some kind that he's thumbing through sam and make a perception check in this low light it's hard to see but when you were speaking to him earlier there was a layer of general moisture across his skin the shirt he's wearing now is a navy blue linen billowy shirt open in the chest a bit you can see a bit of his chest hair and frilled at the sleeves you have a map for that you have to go around the silberquel ridge lebenda swamp quannah breach northeast of nogvurot actually northward is not xhorhas technically just east yes the greying wildlands are in the north you don't get an exhaustion point you just become stunned for a round yeah you're fine no it just stuns you for one round which in combat is really bad oh sorah she is she's not right by the gentleman she's actually sitting at the table in the-- or sitting at the bar 15 feet away from him but she's always in his direction she's perpetually hawking his presence and ensuring that nobody tries anything funny and that she can get there quickly if she needs to he's in the process of thumbing through a small book he's finishing a sip from his goblet and watches you push ah that was quicker than i anticipated which one very well and you're not choosing the shadycreek run i need it to be taken care of so if you won't do it i'll find somebody else who can time is of the essence here you can indeed if you do both i'll be happy to reward you with something nice at the end of it because that's quite a feat very well well i'm happy to know we're doing business together once more i would recommend if you're heading to berleben and lebenda swamp to take the bromkiln byway we do have the river but one you have quite a number of individuals that aren't the most quiet and there are certain things that exist throughout that 70-ish mile journey you'd be taking underground either way it's still 70 miles to berleben that's a long journey to take underground if you are-- not quiet and inconspicuous our smuggling run usually goes in groups of two to three at most to keep it quick and unseen you've already been there yes which is why i'm saying if you choose to otherwise that's up to you but i would recommend taking above ground on the bromkiln byway it's a well-carried road it sees a lot of foot traffic shouldn't be that dangerous and it's nearly a straight shot to the swamp whatever decides to take up residence down there you have five horses if i recall seeing as how you're accepting both that would put you in the business of acquiring the advance from both so that would be-- dweez please retrieve the advances 750 there's a brief break before you hear the familiar chuckling and three large sacks are put up onto the table 750 gold the advances for both missions dweez gather what we can spare from the supply cabinet please he wanders off for a moment and comes back with two small over-the-shoulder satchels he sets them on the table (chuckling) opens the little lids for them and pushes them forward you watch as one of them falls forward and clattering out a few inches or so some vials in there the one on the right should be able to tend to any wounds you sustain along the journey the one on the left can aid you should you find yourself pricked with some terrible disease disease not poison unfortunately we have not that two vials in one of healing they're both of greater healing the other one is cure disease we can provide you with paper and ink should you be so interested dweez none that i've cared to remember that would be more of a question to my ally there if you don't mind speak with febron he is very familiar with the area and can give you the information you seek no i would not ensure such a mission to him he glances past you in the far corner you can see him now leaning over the bar two full cups in starting to get a little dazed on the stool his hand does this anything else you require anyway if our business is complete i appreciate your patronage i look forward to our continued partnership and i wish you all the luck thank you dweez comes up from behind a moment later with a stack of regular parchment and ink he hands it over it does not look like it would be the necessary enchanted or prepared inks that you could use to scribe spells per se but it's parchment and ink that's up to you i can't pay you unless you come back but if you complete them both and do so in ample time i'll be happy to pay you when you return from both just send word if you could upon clearing our safehouse precisely all right thank you very much good luck he just glares at you glowering at nott as you all step away from his corner of the chamber you've almost cleared out-- between you and other patrons in the recent weeks they've cleared him out it's not an endless emporium as you do that he turns around and a hand slaps onto your shoulder the finger and thumb of it go from the front of your chest to your small back as it grapples you and spins you around and goes (grunts) and then releases you four (laughter) he starts pulling at his jaw it's almost like getting a charlie horse where you can't stop the muscles and he tries to stop it eh he probably deserved it you guys ascend the stairs back into the main front of the evening nip and the rest of the afternoon is yours what would you like to do okay caleb is just-- well there's some things massacre in downtown zadash this afternoon as you guys charge over to the pentamarket you make your way to the exterior of the invulnerable vagrant stepping inside there is a rather chill customer-less interior as two of the regular pumats sit at the front as you step into the chamber oh you're back so soon i figured you had completed all your intended means of purchasing i can go ahead and look you're starting to really diminish our stockpile that i'm pretty sure we can supply is that right you checking the back i know it was there yesterday we got plenty of incense don't worry we got you covered he comes back in with two sacks of very strong pungent smelling incense that when burning has a more pleasant scent these have been treated specifically for rituals and various arcane means you get 30 gold worth of incense at your disposal and the 100 gold worth of enchanted inks and scribing materials and paper that you can utilize to make those notes and transition it into a spellbook that's one of the few items we have left yeah i apologize it's a little embarrassing we've all been talking about how it's really embarrassing it's hard to have a shop without inventory oh yeah right over here goes and pulls one of the boxes from the shelves it has a glass top and he presents it to you there's a velvet interior with two little alcoves inside where these very beautiful silver bracers with scrolling and runic sigils carved into it across the band are present these would make a better defensive capability for someone who does not themselves partake in the use of armor well that sounds like it's meant to be 1200 gold pieces what okay they'll be here waiting for you thank you thank you thank you thank you i apologize didn't mean to send you into an existential financial crisis but it's a really powerful enchantment and-- fair enough okay well pumat prime worked very hard on those when you come back to get them i think you'll be very happy with amount that you've spent to keep yourself alive i'll go ahead and bring it up with the big guy himself fantastic yeah okay thank you you guys hastily make your way to the cart the rest of you guys gather the carts and the horses you have at your disposal prepared yourself for exit from the town eventually caleb and beauregard catch up to the rest of you what would you like to do roll for kitty biscuits the bromkiln yeah the bronchial byway the life breath of the land i enjoy it and i'm sure every dungeon master out there who watches knows exactly how i feel when it happens you gather your things up into the cart the horses begin to push off and you make your way through the city streets of zadash to the northern wall you can still see some of the townsfolk coming out and going about their day but the general air of tension and nervousness still holds court throughout the city's streets there are clusters of crownsguard they're escorting the righteous brand to the eastern side you make your way to the northern side of the city where the signet wall district begins where you have the large fortresses where the military stays and the barracks that surround that region to the large gate that exits the building out into the rest of the marrow valley as you make it through the large raised portcullis along with a few other folks that are in the process of making their own journey into the north or to the west or to the east you step out onto the dirt road into the green blowing fields the cold breeze that's blowing beneath the graying skies of wildemount and you push off being here for a while it seems strange but also welcoming to be back on the open road for a moment you glance around and take a deep breath as that clean post-rain air still seems to linger in the vicinity as you make a sweep on the horizon with the rolling hills and patches of trees catch your vision off to the far east on the outside of the signet wall district you see hundreds if not thousands of soldiers all gathered and making their way east in small troops here the mainstay source the bulk of military power in the center of the empire makes its way to war you see horses siege engines and large ballista on wheels all being carried and prepared for the journey to the borders of xhorhas and beyond with that you pick up and continue northward making your way long the amber road towards to where the bromkiln byway carves off to your destination first i want to ask you guys what pace are you travelling at you can go slow pace if you try to be super stealthy normal pace is fine fast pace you go quickly but you threaten exhaustion if you continue to push that way you're looking at about a 75-mile journey with the cart and the horses you're looking at about 30 miles a day at a normal pace you're probably looking at two nights' stay on the road before you reach your destination laura and you guys push forward and watch as behind you the large looming walls and towers and buildings of zadash that had been your home for weeks disappear slowly behind you once again you're embraced by the wilds and open landscapes of the valley you take a moment to reflect upon the insanity and craziness of the urban atmosphere and the peace as well as the unknown that comes with traversing such an open plain i'd say you have maybe a few hours before the sun sets right as you hit the intersection between the amber road and the bromkiln byway the sun has set the sky is dark the clouds prevent starlight from coming through and what moonlight would be visible is choked giving you only the faint glimmer of the moon's location behind the cloud cover what would you like to do it is at your current location make a perception check with disadvantage because it is nighttime then you can both make individual rolls or one of you can aid the other you take your advantage on your roll as the night has fallen and you spend the better part of the next hour trying to look for any physical representation of safety or cover it is just open rolling hills and field there might be places where you could stay low and perhaps keep relatively safe but nothing that sticks out to you unfortunately what do you plan to do which is a good thing because it gets cold at night out here it'll only get colder the further north you go even at night here-- most mornings in wildemount at least this area of wildemount all the grass is frosted the windows are frosted few moisture survives the evening without some sort of frozen state as the temperature begins to plummet continuously after sunset you begin to find a place to set up camp for the evening beau takes the torch ignites it and sets a small fire you begin to set up a small circle and maintain warmth by taking what bits of-- and it's very sparse vegetation if you want to check for anything to keep the fire going roll a survival check you manage to get some brush gathered you're probably not going to be able to keep the fire going all night let's say if you throw in three torches that'll keep a modicum of the flame going through the night not the most heat but it'll be enough to prevent you from dealing with the biting cold as you rest through the night who's taking watch as the rest of you manage to find yourself asleep for the evening jester and fjord take the first watch do you wish to make a perception check which one of you is helming advantage keeping an eye out there other than a couple bits of whistling wind that blow through in segments you don't pick up anything shifty and your watch comes to a close without issue next watch who's helming perception check on this so you're aiding technically because it's night it would be a straight roll the goggles are only a radius this is a general awareness so it's just a single roll you're helping her to maintain keeping your senses around you and looking about the watch seems to go through uneventful i know with that your watch comes uneventful third and final watch nott and molly who's helming this one advantage on yours actually it would have been the first one i started to realize it's advantage but disadvantage because it's night as you guys get part way through your watch conversing muttering about the recent events the sun comes up uneventful (as luigi) let's-a go (as matt) with that morning comes without the necessary heat the fire the torch goes out and right as the frost begins to cause you to shake yourself awake the morning comes melting the dew and you are prepped up on your cart and ready for the next length of your journey if you wish to see if she's telling the truth roll an insight check she's hard to read she seems honest and forthright in what she's saying who's helming watch as you guys are traveling make a perception check for me that's enough as you guys are continuing about midday or so you're hitting the noonday sun and some of the clouds have broken up briefly you notice a tiny distant curl of smoke over one of the hills just a lazy little line of darkness across the-- it looks very localized you cannot see it's over one of the larger hills that's blocking what its source is it's about a mile or so off of the road if you were to go ahead in that direction it could be it could be chimney smoke it's not a billowing column continuing onward about ten minutes later you get just around the edge of where that hill was and you can see the source of the smoke there nestled between a small cluster of trees and a bit of natural rock formations a small shack that the smoke is coming from continue going forward on the road yeah it's about a mile away yasha's going to the shack is it just yasha okay so yasha molly and fjord are heading to the shack as you guys make your way up cresting the hill down into this small localized valley toward where the shack is with the clusters of trees and the edge of a small forest cluster is a little bit past it you approach the shack and as you get towards it you get a better look at it it's made of simple masonry and stones lodged together to create the outer walls of it it can't be more than 20 feet by 20 feet in size it's not a large abode there is one brick chimney where that single curl of smoke that was visible off your end was there there's a wood chopping block on the outside with an axe embedded and left in it with couple of pieces of firewood off to the side there's a tanning easel set there for whoever has been utilizing it there is a front door you see a window that has no glass in it it's maybe that big or so it's more for keeping an eye out or looking through it perception check looks fine you get off the horse this soft paw starts tapping you in the face command right you still blow and the fur gets in your nose fjord you head around back in the back there's a couple of cured and salted meats that are hanging from the back of the ramshackled roof that ends and curves down a bit over time the weathering has caused it to curl under there is another doorway that leads in the back it looks like there is no window back here there is a single window out front and there are two doors in the front and back of it you hear a little bit of rustling a couple heavy footsteps you hear a large metal rod shift and it creaks open about two to three inches there you see what i can only describe as an elderly full-blood orc his head wreathed and tangled grey coarse hair like a crown around the top of the head that goes past the mouth and over the chest to about mid-point there a foot-long beard around his chin that ends at about the bottom of the clavicle or the sternum muscular and hunched his gray-green skin looks thick and weathered and folded crow's nests under where the nose and the mouth is the two heavy tusks protruding from underneath the lower jaw his eyes are sunken and bloodshot around the side of the yellow sclera one hand opens the door while another one remains out of sight as the face pushes forward to inspect you a low voice says your business everything is fine have you news to share good to know the door begins to close leans further in make a charisma check okay all right glaring at you with one eye peeking through there's a bit of a grunt and the breath emanates and it smells of heavy pepper and dust a bit of smokiness to it the door opens slightly more and the head peeks through to give you a good look over maybe for trade what do you have to trade reaches out and-- gold doesn't hurt other passersby tools are helpful vegetables fresh produce maybe he opens the door a bit further and looks to the left he looks to the right you're off to the side of the wall though so you don't see him and he doesn't see you he goes come in and opens the door fully and steps back you can now see he had in the other hand a really nasty-looking somewhat rusted battleaxe that he had right around the door just in case he goes and sets the loop of the handle of it and puts it over a knob that's in the wall and then steps inside his small hovel as you look in the inside it's fairly bare but there are lots of furs that have been skinned and cured that are up on the walls that are hanging from wolves from badgers different other creatures that he's probably hunted and brought in here for the tanning process you see hanging on the edge a handmade piece of hide armor that has been recently stained and as soon as you get close you can smell the stained scent off of it you get the sense here based on the tanning stuff set up outside that that's probably part of his trading business it's also for trade or purchase also i have meats i have pelts he thinks to himself for a second and considers the time and energy he's put into it handmade 15 gold pieces i give you two pounds of meat he coughs a bit goes over and starts grabbing the armor and pulling it off of the knob and setting it down grabbing some meat he opens the back door and steps out and starts pulling it off of some of the racks of nails on there yeah you're staying where you are okay make a perception check ten okay he grabs the meats sets them in a small sack ties it up hands it over the armor he preps and folds and sets over hands it to you i'm aware good luck he closes the door you hear (deadbolts locking) you guys mount back up on your horses and make your way back to the rest of the group on the cart it's hide armor it's well-made hand-crafted hide armor for anybody who would have use for it whether it be using or reselling it that's up to you you guys continue onward for the rest of the day until eventually the sun sets and you find yourselves with evening quickly taking the sky who's helming the search for a good place to camp perception check with advantage because the sun is still up so he got advantage you glance off and maybe about 30 minutes up the road you can see a small forest maybe two or three miles in diameter it's a cluster of trees and would probably be a way to camp off of the road make a nature check it is meat it's good it's a little dry but it's salted it's cured it'll keep for a while a little chewy make a nature check it's good yeah you can do that you manage to set up right as the sun completes setting you build up this little campfire in the center you set up your bedding around it the cart is a little ways off unless you're putting the bedding in the cart and putting that there next to it okay you put the cart there thread around the edges okay who's taking first watch roll a normal roll because you are keeping an eye through darkness night vision is only out to a certain radius you both maintain the first watch as you continue looking out towards the darkness beyond the visible trees that are refracting what little bit of light makes it to their bark looking into the shadows your watch comes to an end uneventful make an investigation check it takes you a little while you start getting a little nervous because yasha just vanishes in the darkness saying i'll be right back and is gone for like 40 minutes you do come back with a handful of small posies they're nothing special but they're flowers you guys finish your watch who's taking the next watch all right nott and caleb who's taking point on this go ahead and roll this would be a straight roll for you the lanterns they're helping you see the close vicinity i'll say sure how far can the lights go out what's the range yeah so roll with advantage 22 nice you guys are sitting there for a bit enjoying the time by the fire conversing caleb you're keeping an eye out beyond the various tree trunks you hear the snapping of a twig and you see some shifting of shadow a few things as you glance around and he's pointing this out and you begin to come to consciousness-- at that moment as soon as you finish casting mage armor there's a little flash of arcane energy and two arrows come shooting out of the shadows right towards you natural 20 and a six which would bring it to ten all right you suffer five points of piercing damage as the arrow catches you right in the left pectoral muscle and i need you to make a constitution saving throw you feel this burst of poison begin to pulse through your veins you are considered poisoned as you guys all see this happen you glance around and you can see a bunch of small shapes beginning to skitter from around some of the trees this growling sound almost barking sound there's a few strange furred wolves emerging from one side two or three of them their eyes glistening as the light from the fire manages to catch it from an angle behind them these two heavy forms begin to emerge and one of them goes oh no they've awakened gonah i know emmett and we'll come back to roll initiative here as we're going to take a quick break no we have a water break we'll come back on that and roll initiative as your guys' campfire caught someone's attention for our wyrmwood giveaway tonight-- tonight we're giving out our fantastic ziricote dice tray from our friends at wyrmwood i'm pretty sure yeah this is the wood that i use on mine very slick tonight's keyword is memories if you want to come into the twitch chat enter the phrase once more than once and you'll be disqualified and unfortunately it's only available to friends in the us and canada except for quebec but we'll come back with the winner here at the end of the break thank you we'll see you back here in a few minutes [break] glancing around you see a cluster of goblin-like creatures coming out of the nearby forest helmed by two large ogres that are yelling across the way it is very shadowy and dark you can't even see a cluster of wolves also are circling from that side i did not have the cart and horses with me i thought i did and i left them at home we'll say that they got spooked after the arrows were fired and are off the side of it to that note everyone i need you to roll initiative oh my god oh shit i-- (concerned sound) okay all right to that note friends 25 to 20 20 to 15 15 to ten wow ten to five jester and yasha at the same time top of the combat round after the arrows were fired and caleb is wincing and pulling back from the blow as these creatures begin to come out of the shadows preparing for their continuation of their assault beau you're up first you're right there caleb nudged you awake looking this way as he nudged you you see the wolves these goblin creatures here and this large looming ogre that was shouting across the way to the other ogre who's now pushing past the tree and coming into view as you dart past it'll put you right there as you rush up grabbing your staff from the ground getting the sleep from your face you run towards it swing ten misses both first strikes attack that's your attack action you swing twice you're still groggy from being woken up and your blows go a bit wide the ogre laughs as it palms away one of your strikes as you get into a stance you look down and there's the wolf growling its jaws open its teeth exposed the goblins are taking their turn now i rolled really high on their initiative they are goblins as now you've gotten a moment to look you see them in their greenish skin they're wearing bits of cobbled-together leather and hide and pelts of whatever they've scavenged around they have bits of red and purple paint smeared on their face in some war paint style they're all like (goblin sounds) you speaking goblin know that they're essentially shouting commands don't engage pull back and fire they're all keeping their distance at this point this close up to fire they're starting to back away and rotate firing volleys of arrows again towards everybody in the center that's going to be two against caleb one against nott two against yasha two against jester and two against fjord actually it should be only one against fjord because there's only eight goblins yeah so two against caleb that's cocked that's going to be a 12 and a six okay both miss both deflecting off of the mage armor you put up before that's going to be one against nott it's going to be an eight you duck out of the way and it goes vanishing into the darkness beyond that's going to be two against yasha that's going to be a nine and a 23 you take four points of piercing damage and you need to make a constitution saving throw four points of piercing damage and make a constitution saving throw 22 the arrow hits you and you feel the poison pulse through you flex and grit your teeth and your body manages to prevent the poison from taking root into your system that's going to be two to jester that's going to be a 14 and a 19 that's five points of piercing damage to you make a constitution saving throw natural 20 you manage to shrug off the venom of these arrow strikes one against you fjord that's going to be a 15 misses as you have your shield now you did you took five points of piercing damage just splinters across it with that they all begin to dart back behind cover this one vanishes over here this one's going to dart over to this space there this darts behind here they both vanish behind the tree there they all just dash into the shadows and vanish behind the various trees around you that finishes the round caleb you're up with fjord on deck all righty wisdom save 16 is the dc all right for that ogre over there that's a failure he's going to be slow all right then the other goblins there that's an 18 it succeeds that one there that's another 18 two in a row sorry about that right there all righty you are maintaining slow concentration on him no he's just poisoned that being the case that finishes up caleb's turn fjord you're up with molly on deck as you suddenly watch him already a sluggish creature moving at an even more sluggish pace the shadows around all of a sudden jump off of the nearby tree trunks and cling to the interior of its form around where the nooks and crannies are almost like a small-scale venom symbiote at times southeast around this way or this way okay that's ten 15 20 25 you do get past this guy who does get an attack of opportunity on you if you'd like okay five ten 15 20 25 30 that's where you get there right there as you rush past you spin around with the sword and shield in one hand i mean you haven't drawn your falchion yet yeah so you just spin around releasing from your grip-- you do one attack for each that does not hit the second one hits the first one the goblin has a shield affixed to its wall and it knocks it out of the way the eldritch blast just poofs without any sort of impact the second one does hit the other-- it poops the other goblin goes flying back about five or six feet tumbles to the ground and is not moving finishing fjord's turn molly you're up you do is this with your rite of the dawn the scimitar gleams with this faint glowing radiant energy this luminescent glow to the blade as he swings towards the singular goblin make your attacks if you'd like 16 hits yep correct 11 points of damage that'll do it you rush up and carve right through his torso you do that's (counting) 30 you can get right up behind with that goblin go for it as you swing towards it it manages to take a shield and deflect the blade and your scimitar sticks into the side of the tree and you have to pull it forth and dislodge and prepare yourself for the next round that finishes molly's go now the ogres take their turn this one right here next to beau as you charged up and attempted to pummel it go in a defensive stance (chuckles) he's going to make two greatclub swings towards you with disadvantage because you have your-- even with disadvantage that is a 19 to hit i rolled a 19 and a 13 that hits the second one that is an 18 and a 14 the second one misses the first one as it swings down towards you with heavy aggression that is 13 points of bludgeoning damage as it slams into you and you hit up against the tree as you barely catch yourself and right the second swing goes through and with that you manage to pull underneath your defensive stance ready to go and you jam the club into the tree the tree actually shakes sending a bunch of leaves and a couple of birds scatter out from the inside as the ogre pulls the club back correct with that the ogre goes ahead and-- actually he's just going to move over here and is going to shout at the dogs go carve face the dogs get ready to pounce ogre only has 20 feet of movement yep yeah he's like (heavy movement) (confused grumbles) not within distance however pulls a javelin out of a small pouch on the side and right there in immediate view is the tiny goblin that at the moment the ogre thinks might be one of his own instead is going to assault the mage that affected him with the slow spell and still throwing it slowly it goes in your direction it's the only action it takes though that is going to be a 23 to hit natural 17 that's the javelin which does-- (pained inhale) 14 points of piercing damage the javelin sinks into your stomach and embeds itself about four or five inches into your torso to the point where the javelin's now holding itself out from your body you immediately grab it and the shock hits you that it managed to drive itself so deep inside you aren't even aware of the damage it's done to your internals it's put you in a state of shock that's going to end that guy's turn but it gets to make a saving throw to try and resist the slow spell that is going to be 15 your spell dc is 16 yeah it rolled a natural 17 minus two not very wise these guys so he remains slow however i need you to make a concentration check it's a constitution saving throw you manage to maintain your slow spell on him no issue the ogre's turns are done nott you're up over this side all right 15 20 okay it is essentially because you're aiming for such a small piece there i was going to add five to the armor class but a natural 20 hits as he's pulled back and clutching himself you hit the book that's harnessed under his arm you feel the impact-- nope you fall prone on the ground i will ask you to make another concentration check because you are averting your gaze and attention from the creature you are focusing on ten you're fine ten is the dc you had to hit yeah just out of the corner of his eye i do need you to make a deception check but with advantage because you managed to pull this off pretty well so far this is just to convince others 18 as far as they're concerned caleb is dead well in order to do the bonus action strike you have to have attacked with your action it's either two attacks or something else you have a bonus action yes i'll say sure make a deception check yeah i know 13 okay this would be deception okay they look at you confused one of them looks over towards the horses the other one seems to be holding his ground but it looks like one of them is in the moment of looking off to something else that ends your turn jester and yasha you guys are up yeah as far as you guys know nott just turned on you with the rest of the goblins and shot down caleb okay there you go you move over stepping over the campfire you heal 20 hit points caleb do you continue to play dead okay the spell doesn't have an effect on caleb sacred flame is an action though isn't it that's okay you can move you still have like 20 feet of movement at half movement you grab and start dragging caleb face down through the dirt to about there is as far as you can get him through rocks and sticks twigs and shit are getting caught in your hair yeah that finishes jester's turn yasha what are you doing to this guy you step forward past there and you get right up into the grill of the slowed ogre as you guys watch here the campfire suddenly dims the flames flicker and cool to this low orange glow from the vibrant yellow flame it was before as yasha steps past the flame behind the shawl two large skeletal black wings emerge from the back of her shoulder blades it has that effect but it's still visible i'm pretty sure the effect is only within ten feet you look at a somewhat translucent skeletal wing structure with membranous undead-looking wings as that happens this dark energy emanates from her body and for a second the white tips of her hair go completely black as she steps forward striding with her blade in her hands-- currently nott you're the only one who can see this but her eyes go jet black entirely full darkness a void of light where her eyes once were as this happens and she strides forward charisma saving throw on his point there well you're more than ten feet unfortunately he does succeed however you do manage to maintain the rest of your ability yep you have two attacks oh no this is an action to do that so no you cannot attack this round no because you get two attacks for the attack action but that's your action yes you may as you step up to this ogre your wings unfurled you give out this heavy yasha roar that echoes in the space around you as your wings flex out even further this dark energy pulling in and the ogre's like (confused grunts)-- looking taken aback by this unexpected display of power going to have to look into that is that your turn yasha all right it is the wolves' turn there are three wolves these wolves here watching you drag caleb backward all rush in to charge against you no because they moved outside of your range there this one does you get one attack of opportunity against that guy go ahead and roll for it if you hit him he gets-- that's cocked 12 hits go ahead and roll damage he doesn't get to move 12 damage as the wolf rushes from you you crack down with the staff it yelps it's still standing but it's hurt really bad it's limping and turns around towards you with this heavy growl this angry glare at you it's going to attempt to attack you with disadvantage because you're still in your-- 18 and a 17 plus four that's going to be-- i'm rolling really good yeah i know it's almost like i have a dice that lets me do that and double fours on the d4s that will be ten points of piercing damage and i need you to make a strength saving throw yes 19 okay it does not knock you prone as it strikes you it attempts to push you off your feet and you resist it using your hand against the tree to push yourself back up and get back into position the two other ones however are going to go against jester and because they have pack tactics they both have advantage on their strikes against you because they're coming at you from flanking you as a wolf first one is going to be-- a 20 on the first one not a natural 20 no that's going to be double 19s on that one jesus christ i'm rolling really good tonight both hit you i am i'm excited the first one is going to be eight points of piercing damage and the other one is going to be nine points of piercing damage i need you to make two strength saving throws yes yes two of them please you manage to resist being knocked prone as they both begin jumping at you and clawing one of them bites towards the back of your armor you throw it to the ground you almost get knocked off but you kept yourself there between the two of them standing caleb at your feet he's going to attempt to make a dexterity saving throw that's a natural four nope that's full damage on this wolf here 15 points of damage that wolf suddenly is blasted in freezing cold energy as you yell in response to its assault as you pull back and look the wolf is frozen solid and tumbles into a bunch of ice chunks off the battlefield that ends the wolf's turn top of the round beau you're up go for it yep that misses the first one hits six points of damage so you have two more strikes against the ogre as well 19 hits 14 also hits roll damage on both of those d4s on those nice 18 points of damage on it that finishes beau's turn it is now the goblins' go you come after the goblins don't worry you're coming this one here who's up against you molly is going to throw the shortbow over its shoulder pull out its scimitar and lash out towards you that's going to be a 15 to hit that hits then you suffer five points of slashing damage it strikes across you backs up pulls its shield up and is getting ready to defend itself from whatever assault you bring back at it it's going to stay right there because it's liking the tree cover to its side but keeping an eye over its shoulder to fjord who tried to fire at it previously these two goblins are going to step out and they're going to both fire at fjord who is advancing towards them that is going to be a 20 to hit and a ten to hit you resist the poison no issue this one is going to use the rest of its movement to dart behind there this one's going to move behind there these two here that are along with nott are going to ignore nott this one is going to start moving this way towards where the cart ran off and it's off the grid there this one is going to saunter up right next to nott and make a shot at yasha that's a natural 17 so it's going to be 21 to hit you are raging though so you take half damage which is good that'd be seven points of piercing damage reduced to three so you take three points of piercing damage you do have to make a constitution saving throw all of the arrows they have are dipped in some sort of a toxin or venom it poisons they get the poisoned condition with that even in your form the poison begins to take hold and where the wound catches you off the side of the throat and the back of the head the veins begin to pulse black as the poison begins to take hold you are poisoned you don't take any additional damage but currently all of your attacks are at disadvantage it does actually poisoned disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks it's pretty rough that ends that guy's turn there's one goblin back here seeing that molly is currently engaged it's going to rush up behind and attempt to flank the back of him it's going to make a strike with its scimitar with advantage because it's flanking you that's cocked even its highest roll there is a seven plus four that's 11 it goes to strike and you see it coming hearing the little footsteps behind you you duck out of the way as it strikes hitting air and now you're holding them off on both sides i think that's all of them that have gone so that is going to lead us to caleb correct to get these two here go ahead and roll the points for sleep it's not concentration so you get to maintain slow 20-foot radius the 20-foot radius sphere 13 hit points total this one falls unconscious that one stays up ten foot radius then that would be there half the size fjord you're up five ten 15 20 all right go for it as you draw your falchion out of the side you focus on it and as you do so this spark of electrical thunder energy engulfs the edge of it as you strike downward that hits roll damage an additional 1d8 18 point of damage with that as you cut down into the goblin the blade sinks in partway through the torso and then the burst causes it to tear apart in two different directions exploding spattering across the tree and the side of the ogre that's ten feet in front of you doesn't seem to notice no it's an action to use the cantrip then you get an attack as part of it so you have to decide between doing two attacks with your invocation that you took or-- your movement you're not quite flanking you have to get one more square to be flanking with yasha but yasha can possibly move and make that flanking on your turn if you'd like that ends fjord's turn molly you're up 19 hits that works eight points of damage as you carve through it cuts a giant gash down the front of its body to part of its thigh it's wounded very badly but still standing carved that goblin right there that'll hit what you do is you strike once and it sticks into his body then as he's still living you double down push and force it the rest of the way down carving it in half and it splits in half and is destroyed striking down overhand towards it behind you total of 12 does not hit he's ready for you and the shield catches your blade it sticks into it for a second and shoves it off with you i forgot to attack with that other ogre last turn but that's okay he was slowed it's fine now the ogres go this one is going to continue to pummel you as now you've pummeled it so it gets two strikes against you that's going to put him at a nine so the first strike misses are you going full amplified the second strike also has disadvantage that's going to be a 15 both swings go wide as its eyes suddenly are filled with blackened blood and it can't see where you are it hits the side of the tree and the tree actually tumbles over onto the ground there the other ogre who's now in front of yasha as you approached it it's caught off guard smash scary thing it's going to take two strikes towards you yeah it was one action as multiattack that's going to be a 14 what's your armor class that's going to be a 13 second one misses but the first one does hit that is 17 points of bludgeoning damage halved to eight it's still (grunting) it's like it's trying to push through molasses every time it strikes or swings at you it's going to attempt to shift around not even noticing fjord there at the moment around this way fjord you do get an attack of opportunity against it that hits roll damage it is not it is considered technically a giant nice that finishes your reaction on that ogre's turn is done nott you're up okay that hits ogre is a big target you do ooh nice as it's looming around it gets struck by fjord as it's trying to stomp around yasha trying to pull away from that situation you shoot towards the base of its skull and it sticks in and the left arm for a second goes numb and it has to flex its muscle to snap the bolt in its neck leaving part of it still lodged in the base of its skull but at least now it's got the use of its other arm back and goes to clutch onto the club still moving slowly and sluggish with every movement that's your action okay (laughter) as you do so it was literally holding the shield in front of it and you just shoot the shield (growl) that finishes your turn nott all right that finishes your turn that brings us to jester and yasha jester wisdom save for him that's going to be-- right dex it's a 13 roll damage oh shit where do you want to place it there you go roll for a strike on that wolf 16 hits nine points of damage to the wolf it clubs down-- (yelp) you watch as one of the shoulders breaks it's barely standing it's like (groaning) does that finish your turn up to you what do you want to do okay yasha what are you doing you have disadvantage because you are poisoned still you're raging but you have to roll twice and take the lower unless you do reckless in which case it will balance it what was that first one the first attack 16 hits second one is 13 still hits it's a big target its ac is lower because of the slow spell he's like super-easy to hit his armor class is effectively nine right now that's true 23 for the first hit how do you want to do this (cheering) as you pull him over the blade it pushes up into the clavicle and up into the throat it emerges actually knocking your bolt out of the body because the blade managed to shove it outside of it and as it slowly gurgles to the ground and collapses the hex is gone the slow is gone and the ogre is gone i know i hit my sleeve it's all good i got it yeah magnets what's wrong with that you have another attack if you want to move and attack something else oh easily you saunter up aside from beau beau as you're pummeling you look over your shoulder and have yasha arrive eyes black giant skeletal wings fear effect only happens when you initiate it it's not-- correct 2d6 plus five you do get to deal extra necrotic damage to it equal to your level because of your transformation an additional five damage to this 21 points of damage that finishes your turn they've been beaten around quite heavily at this point and it looks like some of them may have been previously wounded from something else you have carved a giant chunk out of its torso that finishes your turn the wolves go one of them is still asleep the other one that's currently being harried by three of you is going to attempt to strike-- ah damn it there we go lollipop it's going to attempt to strike at you nope that's a 14 at this point that finishes the wolf's turn the other one is sleeping unconscious top of the round beau you're up five damage that hits roll damage (whacking) (snarl) you actually jam it in part of the giant wound part of its muscle is flopping over from where yasha had struck him all right two strikes hits all right seven and six nice you're pummeling its torso and its belly is (jiggling) that ends beau's go it's now the goblins' turn yeah they're going to flee this one's just running you don't have a melee weapon ready because you have your crossbow out yeah it doesn't work that way sure i'll let you do that strength bonus not dexterity okay that hits go ahead and roll damage one damage plus your strength modifier what's your strength modifier you do one point of damage to it as you slug it in the back of the head it runs off the board in this direction this one is going to run this way yes you do go for it that hits go ahead and roll damage five points of damage you strike past it it keeps running charges this direction the ogre right now being surrounded and watching the rest of its fellows run away is backing up and looking where emmett oh yeah thank you he's blocked from my position he is going to seeing everything else fleeing scatter as well just runs off the map that finishes their go caleb you're up okay you're casting it at level two yeah so it's two missiles each go ahead and roll damage 1d4 plus one per missile he gets hit by both continues to run he's wounded but still alive seven for this one the one that's running past molly both missiles hit it from two different sides and his head pops open from both sides of the force damage hitting it its body runs for like three more steps before it (boom) onto the ground on its own okay finishing caleb's go fjord you're up molly you're on deck okay you have your sword in your hand and the shield okay so you drop the sword cast hex to strike this fellow go for it that hits hits roll damage for each do that twice because you hit it twice 13 points of damage how do you want to do this (cheering) okay beau's been pummeling it yasha carved into it it's looking like it's ready to flee as it turns around this way it sees this flash of greenish light out of the corner of its eye looks back they both impact right in the chest outside of its shoulder blades in the back two blasts of crimson leaving these two smoking holes in its chest that you can partially see through and it falls back knocking this tree over in the process the rest the surviving goblins have seemingly scattered leaving you in the battlefield with one wolf that is unconscious (laughter) that finishes fjord's go molly you're up go for it yeah roll some damage the wolf is misted you get right up next to beau and that's the extent of it there that ends your turn molly ogres are done nott you're up you start giving chase you run you see him you get up to this point and you can see where he is he's 60 feet away from you he's right where he is essentially and you got that far he's 30 feet from you go for it yeah that hits go ahead and roll damage mm-hmm seven points of damage to him all right he has seven from him yeah magic missile yeah that's enough you release the crossbow it falls to the ground breathing hard and tries to stand up falls down to its knee again and then collapses on the ground no longer moving nope not at the moment okay you move up to it we'll get to that next round for the narrative purposes of this nothing is currently engaging you in combat the wolf that is on death's door is currently unconscious and bleeding out from the spell that you gave it make a perception check with disadvantage because it is dark and at night nah he's gone it darted off one survivor made it for the purposes of ease here you've managed to finish off the wolf that's currently unconscious really quickly molly you're standing next to it and it's on the ground you had the bonus action because you didn't use it you're going to run up and put it out of its misery you guys gather at this point and with your wounds the poison still (throbbing) in your veins for both you and caleb around the corner you see there's the horse cart about 30 to 40 feet from where you are and there's one goblin grabbing a bunch of sacks he's like (excited panting) he turns around and sees all of you standing there in the clearing and goes-- he goes into a full sprint in the opposite direction roll damage level one that is a 12 so i think it succeeds it's unfortunate 20 you watch him run these what would be five missiles anime gundam-style the goblin (panting) (poofing) it's harried repeatedly with these missiles impacting him it's pretty rough with that silence falls upon the field your cart regained and the goblin running off spooks the horses a bit and they pull the cart another ten feet or so but they eventually slow down at this point the wings fold and vanish her eyes come back to normal color the white tips of her hair return you don't see anything you seem to be relatively alone it's less a xhorhasian language and more one that you're not quite certain why you understand it make an investigation check you don't recognize them short bows scimitars grungy some of them coated with excrement and other things to make them nasty when they carve through and infect wounds large greatclubs that are carved on some of the scimitars they look nasty no but there are a few pouches that haven't been spilled or utilized entirely of toxin with that investigation check you manage to pull five vials of toxin unused each one has a single use on some sort of a weapon yeah it's middle of the night maybe one or two in the morning there's a crack of thunder the rain begins to come down as one of the slowly encroaching storms begins to pour down in the middle of the night taking the final watch roll perception for me if you don't mind disadvantage for the darkness sure what did you roll as you complete the final watch the rain doesn't subside the flashes of lightning and the rolling of thunder makes it a bit difficult but the exhaustion of the previous battle manages to combat that enough for those of you who want to complete your evening's rest you do until eventually the glow of the morning's light brings you all to consciousness once more the rain reduces itself to a drizzle you gather your materials do the best you can to warm up shaking yourself in the cold damp morning gather your cart slowly head back towards the roadway and continue your journey towards the labenda swamp and that's where we will end tonight's episode if i didn't have anything to do tomorrow if i wasn't flying to canada tomorrow i could keep going yeah i think you did he was too busy with his own anyway thank you guys we'll pick this up next week on thursday from there as we have about a day's worth of travel before you get there with enough speed you will get there before the next dusk
