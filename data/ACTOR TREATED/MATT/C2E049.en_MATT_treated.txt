idea that you sleep-rune sometimes officially played too much d&d not possible anyway i think with that we can go ahead and bring ourselves into tonight's episode of critical role [water bubbling] [thunder] [explosion] (chanting) role critical role [dramatic critical role theme] welcome back everybody last we left off the mighty nein had been returning from nicodranas they had made their way northward from the menagerie coast left their ship in the care of their favorite tortle to earn money at sea while you're away you made your way northward past the wuyun gorge back into the dwendalian empire passed through trostenwald and alfield and met up with bryce for a bit to catch up and then made your way toward felderwin upon arriving you discovered the city was still visibly scarred from the recent assault that it had seemed to suffer at the hands of the kryn dynasty from xhorhas upon perusing the streets you came to discover that the location that nott was leading you towards was in ashes this apothecary upon inspecting the vicinity you did not find a body but you did find a basement where you found ruined furniture a few traps a chest and a mysterious chair that has grabbed the nation's imagination y'all going to die you thought the gazebo was bad anyway so however you also found that apparently the person who previously had lived there was nowhere to be found and the son of that individual was being held at a nearby home of another person who lives here in felderwin you went there with nott nott took the form of a halfling and proceeded to speak to this child as her son after a bit of interesting conversation and curiosity you said goodbye and you turned to find these two powerful magic users that caleb had identified as members of the cerberus assembly were walking their way towards the ashen ruins of the apothecary deep in conversation that is where we left off so mighty nein what would you like to do yes i can do that we have lady vess derogna yes she's an elven woman in fine flowing clothes of green and black deep green with black designs across and around the edges of the billowing sleeves jewelry around the fingers a number of rings and a series of necklaces they each contain some sort of a circular gem that dangles from them like a little collection of colors she has short medium brown hair and appears to be of not a young elven age necessarily but not as old as her current compatriot which is martinet lunidus da'leth who is the archmage of domestic protections he had long white hair also elven they are both elven yep keeping tabs on that that's really the extent of what you can see at this distance you are currently a few houses down standing outside of old edith's house and in the moment of the tension of the conversation you had just had and the intensity of nott's disposition glancing and seeing them walking up and stopping right at the cusp and talking to each other yes from where you're standing here not terribly far maybe a ten minute walk you could loop around a bit probably go southward you're not that far from the samir river you can scoot a southwestern direction in an arc probably make it 15 minutes to avoid them entirely all right moving past the handful of people in the city that are noticing this strange band of adventurers that have wandered through you make your way past the outskirts and you can see the river itself cruising right along it would be a beautiful landscape if there wasn't this intensity of emotion and the distant haze of long-grayed smoke that still hangs over the vicinity of the partially burned farmlands nevertheless nott leads you over towards one of the shaded banks under a few trees and you come to a stop make a perception check glancing about you do not see anybody keeping watch what you do notice however is that a lot of the patrolling righteous brand the small bands that have been keeping tabs are all gathering towards the southern edge where the farm fields of the felderwin tillage hit the town of felderwin where as they were scattered they're all amassing in one space correct that's as much as you've heard make a perception check your emotions are transfixed and even though you look around your attention's still focused on nott nothing catches your eye so you're casting lesser restoration okay technically alcohol is a toxin yeah so i'll allow it you feel this warm glow emanating from caduceus' hands and then in that moment the fuzzy numbness that you are accustomed to sitting in especially in places of great fear or emotion fades and everything's back to being crystal clear there's not much in the way of a waterfall unfortunately you're in the center of the valley so what hills there are are just hills the river here continues cutting through the valley but you're probably a good off the top of my head 40 or so miles from any elevation to cause a major waterfall you're next to the river and what little noise it's making it's nice there was that one inn that burned down but there is one inn you know called the goldfield tavern and lodge that's one of the more traveled inns a lot of people that come in and out of felderwin that's one of the more popular destinations there's northeast and southwest northeast would be more in the direction of the fields and clearer view southwest would be further away from civilization there's little clusters of trees here and there cast it twice you have two more as the sporadic phrases make their way through the arcane weaves of the various magical ley lines that invisibly traverse the exterior of exandria they make their way towards bryce's ear somewhere in alfield and they respond a moment later all right i'll do my best please don't send too many more (laughter) through the city okay it'll take you a while okay make a perception check for me caduceus as you guys are passing around the southern edge heading towards the western side of felderwin okay keeping an eye out the main thing you notice it seems like a majority of the righteous brand have gathered and are heading northeast they are leaving felderwin correct you don't know you're too far away you haven't really asked any specific questions to the local crownsguard best you can see here-- the flames have been long out what brief cinders and wisps of smoke that had been slowly burning themselves out over the past couple of weeks or so are on the very tail end it looks like felderwin has fallen to at least a semblance of temporary neutrality the people are going about their lives the tillage-- the damage that has been done has been done and now it's just trying to pick up and move on you're in the wagon you're now on the western side of the village where you can see the northward tillage all around caleb roll an intelligence check for me on the notes where it mentions beacons-- it seemed to be the case yes no not the people that are currently with you now no the people that are in the city there isn't a uniform robe there is no-- and you would know this too even mages in a union aren't like let's all wear similar uniforms they all very much see themselves as individuals in a circle hmm oh right yeah no for students and everything there would be uniforms but as far as members of the assembly proper there's no consistent uniform amongst members of the assembly as is the nature when you get to a certain level of arcane capabilities even working with other mages there's a general for the most part an idea of well i'm still better than them okay you guys make your way towards felderwin proper through this conversation the majority of the righteous brand has moved on heading northeast towards the front lines crownsguard are still present and there still is definitely amongst those that are here-- and nott you can say that there are more crownsguard present here than there usually are probably just to keep an eye now that the military has moved on you make your way towards the center of the city leading them towards the goldfield tavern and lodge heading inside it's fairly empty you place the cart outside for the time being towards the bar on the far end you see the familiar face of simone deepwell he's the halfling the barkeep and owner dark brown skin short gray-white hair very cheerful demeanor he seems to be excited at the prospect that folks are stopping in with all the chaos that's happened as he leans over the front of the counter and goes-- okay just a gnome the rest of you keeping it as is most of the illusions you had in the city have faded at this time since you've been traversing the exterior you got it anyway simone leans forward and goes why hello there what can i do for you you looking for rooms for the night how many is that book a room each how many three three rooms all right well we got plenty of space with events being as they have been that'll put you back about let's say one gold one silver for the three all right no worries fumbles through some keys and passes them out to you feel free to distribute as need be if you need anything let me know yeah you could say that you could say that i mean 'ruckus' is a word i certainly hope not we've kind of seen kind of the craziest thing felderwin's ever seen in most of its history since war with the dominion so i sincerely hope not i mean it's one less competitive inn but poor jer i just feel bad for everyone that lost their homes and businesses in that affair it's not good yeah they've been here a few weeks just walking around just in case they came back no they came in without warning just tore through burned things and left yeah see the only real alchemist around here was one of the homesteads that burned down unfortunately but there's the crossroads not too far from here big trading post in the middle of the marrow valley which you've been to before that's probably your best bet oh that was the brenatto apothecary last i heard brenatto went missing could probably ask the crownsguard i don't think they've updated anything but-- most of the folks here got killed in the fire so might best ask them i can imagine no worries we have two meals here one shortly after dusk and bright and early in the morning right after sunup you got about an hour window if you miss it well there's plenty of-- should be plenty of food amongst the city to find so good luck nah you've still got a few hours before sundown so just come on by and go ahead and get me and my wife cooking you mean herbs and spices yeah i mean there's felderwin general has all manner of various flavorings if that's what you're looking for yeah felderwin's not known for its excitement necessarily but keep your eye out who knows what you'll find with the right questions i don't know i've seen some wild folk come in these doors in my days i'll tell you that much not all as colorful as you though so can't say my experiences are a good basis of comparison if you catch my drift you and me both now all them soldiers are out of here at least i'm going to miss the coinage but i ain't going to miss the riff-raff yeah no worries i'll see you around dinner time then if you'd like to make an investigation check to wander about the town to see if you can manage to muster some supplies actually you would-- yeah take some advantage on that felderwin would be one of the few places in the empire where the wildmother would be very popular if she weren't outlawed and you get the sense that there might even be an unspoken worship to her amongst this very rural farming community you manage to go to both felderwin general and with nott's help sneak into one of the elaborate specialty herb-growing boxes specifically for the purpose of various medicinal herbs we'll say over the period of the next 30 minutes or so you gather what would be about 25 gold worth of-- okay anyone else got anything no but you're getting closer you do know there is a female human physician in the town there's a number of physicians and people but there is one named demi leric who is the altruistic member of the community doesn't charge but accepts donations and is often the first to try and help out those of the more meager lifestyle in this farming community (laughs) more or less sure easy enough to find as you're glancing around because they're fairly present and conversing you see one set of three that are walking past the one seems most energetic in conversation is in the process of regaling the other two with some inane tale scrawny human-looking fellow looking like he's mid-30s or so chin scruff but can't quite grow a full beard like me apparently i'm still getting used to it hey yeah can i help you can't say i'm too familiar with hair tonics per se if you're looking for anything too fancy i'd probably recommend heading on to zadash not anymore unfortunately that was one of the buildings we lost to the cricks a few weeks back hell if i know cricks ran in here and started killing people left and right and left in the same hour they arrived it was like a swift nightmare tearing through here let me tell you did you ever have one of them terrible dreams where something comes out of the darkness and tries to grab at you and cut at you it's burning eyes of evil and dark armor of shadow and nothing well imagine a bunch of them popping out of the ground and cutting down your friends-- hell if i know a bunch of ground-dwelling weird dark elf folk well i fought a number of them myself trying to protect my buddies here but not everyone was so lucky oh no just-- i'm just doing my job ma'am the one that was here that's right over-- you go head down two blocks and to the right follow that on for about seven eight or so buildings on the left it's hard to miss it's the second one on the left that's burned down here's to hoping indeed is there anything else you're looking to find out you'd probably have to find somebody who was a little more in the thick of it anyone else want anything okay it takes you a little while not too long with nott's help guiding you in that direction but finding the right building-- because the sign itself that has demi leric's name on it is itself smoke-covered from-- it's across the street from one of the buildings that was damaged by the fire as you walk over towards the edge the door is partially ajar wait just a minute now sit down it's going to hurt a bit longer come in you open the door come inside it's a very simple establishment immediately the smell hits you of various smells like medicinal herbs and very strong chemicals you see four five cots that are set up two of which have recovering townsguard that are bandaged up and currently laying down one of them appears to be asleep the other one is sitting there with a fresh set of bandages put over burns you see demi turn around human woman maybe late 20s early 30s or so heavyset bright smile bright eyes but sleeves rolled to the elbows and all business she turns around and the fingers are hit with whatever material was used to apply the burn bandages to the one soldier she wipes her hands this viscous oil-like substance and wipes them on a cloth well can i help you all right certainly feel free to go and ask incongruency all right well i mean they're pretty sluggish right now but that's for obvious reasons we've had a few strange complaints maybe about a month two months ago just a wave of general a nauseous-- i assumed it was maybe some bad food that got through a bit wasn't too serious it was a bunch of people complaining about the same thing in a very short period of time i assumed maybe it was related yeah they were all in a cluster right in this region which is why they all came to me yeah no worries i mean the town was attacked and people were killed and burned that's strange yeah he was right down the street no to be honest i was busy trying to treat who i could that was not a good day one night really around midnight suddenly buildings were up in flames people were screaming i looked out there and there were cricks running through the street be my guest great well if you think of any other questions feel free to ask what was the part where she then goes and one more thing for our younger audience columbo was a television series okay there is one that appears to be asleep who looks to be a little more combat wounded the one that's semi-conscious is mostly burns he seems to be he's sitting there going (pained breathing) (pained yelling) what is wrong with you who are you great jeff (laughter) he's got two apostrophes between the fs look man not everyone in a fantasy setting has awesome names yeah when i'm not laid up like this yeah no that's why i was really appreciating your entrance there very thoughtful i accept your recompense at this point demi's like wait wait wait no no no he's already had enough yeah that's where i got all this was trying to get people out of the flames managed to get his son out it seems yeah cricks got him and ran yeah back to the fucking hole they headed northward yeah was four of them yeah i saw the fire they pushed me into when i tried to stop them well me and two others but they didn't you know fare as poorly as i did yeah yeah it is i mean it was crazy they came in quick fires were set before we knew what was happening i guess the last place they lit was the apothecary thanks his eyes go wide so you're from the cobalt soul perfect anybody else doing anything before you guys reconvene is there anything else you want to look for or are you ready to gather no i'm just curious if you've completed your investigation-- there's no escape taliesin there's no escaping you can go look if you want to jeff's a great name that's why i used it okay so you heading to the tunnel first by this point you guys gathering yeah dusk has happened you can eat first or miss your meal the meal is actually quite fresh being a farm town it's nothing fancy but everything's hearty and quite delectable heading your way outside of felderwin to the northeast side where it begins to border on the tillage itself there's a group of about eight crownsguard that are circled around three-- what would have been the exit burrows from this distance you can see it's like a sinkhole it's caved in a bit from this distance you can't see any further than a few inches to indicate that that seems to be where it was and the guards are keeping a perimeter just in case anything were to return as you approach he's like hi can i help you yeah that's what i hear too as far as i know i'm just stationed here but they've been looking this thing up and down for two almost three weeks now the guard the righteous brand some of them fancy folk from rexxentrum yeah i mean they're all fucking fancy from up there but some of them elvish people i don't fucking know they don't talk to me no i certainly hope not from what i can tell wasn't just the cricks then one of the other guys one of the soldiers goes like i was here i saw it yeah no i mean they didn't dig them something dug it for them it was a big old mouth made of teeth just carved out of the ground and then withdrew and then they poured out yeah yeah i hate this job fucking ran what do you think i'm going to do the other guys look at him like (scoffing) and he's like what you would've done the same something like that yeah no it broke through but just came out a few feet and then it pulled back in we were like 'what the fuck is that' then the cricks came running out i mean it's possible i don't know it was big from what i saw it was maybe i don't know ten feet wide i was over there he points off maybe a hundred or so feet away yeah at this point the other first guard you were talking to goes hey what's your business here anyway make a deception check he nods for a second and goes all right so i guess have a look around it's already been given the once-over many times so take a moment if you need it he points over the third one and he goes they've been digging that one for about two weeks but eventually gave up they collapsed them behind them and there's only so much you can go if they dug all the way from xhorhas do you have any idea how long those tunnels would go for don't really have that kind of manpower here in felderwin the soldiers all left so i'm not going to keep digging eh go for it how many you got and you're all investigating all right just no funny business i'll be keeping an eye on you i would say if you were attempting to blink into a solid space it would shunt you out of the space and you would take a little bit of force damage general rules for shifting out of ethereal space into matter you approach and see there are three tunnels and they're scattered maybe 300 feet apart from each other approximately between 200 and 300 feet the first one you're at here sinks in about ten 15 feet and it looks like crumbled stone and earth with patches of fresh dirt and the roots that were upended as it tore through folding over onto the pile it looks like it's been left as it was you go over and inspect the other one and the same guard and few others walk with you to keep a close eye the one in the middle this is the one that's been dug out it's just pitch black below okay you cast light the soldiers take a step back as soon as they see you make a gesture and brightness seems to appear yeah the tunnel goes straight down well close to straight down it comes at a fairly steep incline there is a rope affixed to a heavy wooden pike that's been banged into the ground do you head down inside your walk technically can only go something that's five feet inward you can't just glide through stone there you go you head down inside and off to the side of it there's a small pile of dirt and rock it looks like a lot of it has been moved off of the premises for the time being as you head down and continue to walk it evens out it probably descends to a depth of about 50 or 60 feet below and continues at a steady decline on for about another-- as you continue to walk continuing to walk you get to a full close to 200 feet in before it comes to an ending point there's a few carts at the base carrying dirt and rock up you can see shovels and pickaxes and all sorts of materials that have been left behind by the team that gave up trying to excavate this tunnel looks to be yeah make a survival check okay there are all sorts of footprints in here there have been soldiers and crownsguard and all sorts of people in and out of this tunnel you can see cart tracks and everything but you can definitely tell that the edges of the top of the tunnel have a smoother natural carving to them whatever creature it is definitely burrowed with that roll i'd say you do make out a few footsteps that resemble more armored boots that are more unique against the profile of the general crownsguard and/or righteous brand soldiers in both directions okay nothing in the vicinity catches your attention unfortunately okay nothing catches your attention there either just so you're aware thunder step as most teleportation effects you have to teleport to a location you can see i mean if you want to get real crazy roll the dice travis and i see what you're doing that's interesting it's a cantrip so there's definite limitations on its ability i'll say two things one roll just a straight wisdom check for me 13 okay you close your eyes and focus feeling your feet connecting with the earth below you letting the wildmother's power suffuse your torso your abdomen your legs and your feet into the earth below as you begin to release that low vibration the hum carries through your body and into rock below and the vibration carries into the ground and due to the nature of this cavern you're in it echoes pretty loudly in this space you all can gently feel it and the guards in the back start looking around a bit nervous not quite sure what's happening one of them runs off afraid he's like it's going to collapse you've run it for awhile you've cast the vibration into the rock what are you going to do to try and listen for make a perception check you immediately rush up to edge of where the stone is the most solid piece of it that's on that side and listen you feel like you can very vaguely hear what might be gap a ways in at some point you're not sure how far away it might be and you're not sure how big the gap may be it could be just a small pocket it could be a continuation of the tunnel but there does appear to be some minor element of vibration that carried through with some differentiation at the full end of this tunnel i'd say you're about 80 or so feet deep as you guys gather your thoughts and march back to the inn in the evening air over felderwin we're going to take a break we're going to be right back here in a few minutes in the interim we have

yourselves in your respective chambers what would you like to do jeff weirdest use of prestidigitation i've ever seen mysterious merrie melodies like (whoomp) you guys get an evening's rest in your respective rooms the morning greets you with the smell of food being prepared as you head downstairs as all of you and two other patrons that are couple of other farmhands-- they look like farmhands their names are chair together they are chair sam and you're a chair good i love it you have your meal the day is yours what do you wish to do okay that would be probably either on the tillage itself or some of the small grove clusters along the river that you guys were talking earlier i assume you're casting divination a reminder it is a specific question concerning a goal event or activity to occur within seven days whatever you're trying to ascertain it needs to be involving a specific goal an event or activity within the next seven days i let it go a little bit last time only because it was a question of what were they doing right now it's like well that's an activity that they were doing i guess choose your words carefully is all i'm saying an event or an activity i mean that's a broad spectrum so be specific you close your eyes and concentrate it's a beautiful morning actually it's a chilly morning but this far enough south in the empire hasn't hit snow yet the full winter hasn't come into effect so it's still green fields and mostly blue sky with bits of clouds as you concentrate the chilled wind picks up a little bit across the wind it begins to form words through your ears (wind blowing) (whispering) ghor dranas anyone here who's proficient in history make a history check if you don't mind yasha's with you guys what did you roll i'm seeing how much detail you get 19 good yasha first pipes in and goes well i've heard the name it's far further north than where i lived and we avoided it because a lot of the beast folk live that way meaning the others who wander the wastes there are men who are like bull warriors as well and bugbears and other goblinoids some are wild and angry and hungry and we had to protect or raid them first others they work with the kryn that's farther north but i've not been there i have not no you would not but with the history checks you guys did pull on ghor dranas ghor dranas is important to the history of the age of arcanum when the gods walked the earth both prime deities and the betrayer gods there were various areas that were considered their realm of influence on the mortal plane outside of their home realms in the different inner and outer planes a number of these citadels of the betrayer gods were concentrated around xhorhas and the surrounding landscape that's where the most intense battles took place of the calamity was on wildemount ghor dranas was the name of the center of their tenuous union essentially in the final years of the calamity it was where all of the betrayer gods would go to plot the undoing of the rest of the free people and their creators in exandria what remains of ghor dranas is where the kryn have established their empire their dynasty it's essentially the capital city of the kryn dynasty yasha pipes up and says from all that i know people in my clan saying that that area up north is perpetual night from what i hear yes as a note just to remind you if you're thinking of distances and times the attack transpired weeks ago so you're not right on their tail consider that in what you're planning mind you your options are your options there are many possibilities here many you don't quite know where ghor dranas is you know it's east right now the war is right here these are the garrisons put that in the center there by the brokenveil bluffs these are where the two the ashguard and rockguard garrisons are one of the garrisons has been lost to the kryn and they are currently holding it at the border bladegarden right there is the foremost front of the military now the conflict right now is being held-- from what you've heard so far your information is dicey at best because you've been gone for a while the last you know this is where the focus of the conflict is there you go you get a very clear image of the last memory that nott has of yeza okay what message do you send there's no response and then a very faint one hello i don't know it's very dark i have to be quiet but thank you that's it do you change your form or do you show up as yeza you find your way to the exterior of edith's house a few moments pass a door opens hi can i help you yes hello right yes can i help you why are we heading to alfield oh okay how long are we supposed to be staying okay oh that's nice does alfield-- do they have-- i've never been to alfield so i'm just wondering-- never mind she turns around bryce got it she turns back to you and goes thank you you too all righty you guys go and search for-- you find jeff there as soon as you walk into the door demi's off to the side reading a leather-bound journal that she's either reading or making notes in she looks up and she goes aye no she pulls it back you look over to jeff who's like oh no yeah what about them i mean they can't abandon-- that's-- no what are you asking what for to alfield that's easy my friends can probably do that it's just to alfield and back they can say it's under business no you still have to pay them this is under the table technically hold on (groaning) he sits up and stands up slowly the two of you limp down to one of the tiny little seedy bars that doesn't even have a name on the front i'm going to put it out there you don't have a trustworthy face they're not going to talk to you i need to introduce you don't you touch me i'll take that you guys make your way in there's a handful of folks here you see three very very old farmer-types that this is their retirement is coming here everyday and complaining and drinking themselves to an early-- earlier-- grave you do see two crownsguard that are working their way slowly through an ale and chatting to each other as he walks in hey and oh what's up hey buddy you're walking around that's great he's like (straining) yeah i've got a job for you what's your name again beau this is jordan and jay they're going to go ahead and help you out with this how much are you paying it's to alfield and back it's an escort you see the gentleman who was introduced as jordan goes well to and from alfield that's a number of days' travel including night camping costs board staying there in alfield i'd say for the each of us round-trip puts you at about 35 gold pieces you're a hard negotiator i respect that it's a deal okay where did you meet this woman he's like look she's been this way but she pays well apparently and i want to help you guys out i'm going to go lay back down and he starts making his way back with your stick i missed the deal who are we escorting edith all right i got it no worries we got it taken care of we got you taken care of we're good we're just going to finish our drinks and we'll start getting our stuff together geoff has made his way partially back to demi's place with your staff oh jeez okay (groaning) what is wrong with you huh i don't like you okay he makes his way back you've hired some crownsguards under the table to keep an eye and escort edith and luke over to alfield to meet with bryce where they're going to take care of them to some degree yes what do you do make a perception check fjord your head turns to the left and you're like where are those-- that cloud looks like an eagle you caduceus do a pretty fair look around you do not recognize anyone that resembles the figures in question there are elves around but maybe two or three since you've come here there aren't many elves in felderwin most of the empire elves are further northward in the zemni fields you've seen a few and a handful of half elves but none of the type that you are looking for these are not the elves you're looking for okay would you like to buy more pockets or pouches i mean unless you're walking around like rob liefeld character-- yeah and you grow more and more teeth your feet vanish easy enough you head over to the felderwin general helmed by dupont briggsman this young dwarven salesman tanned skin light brown hair a bit of a chin beard he says are you looking for pockets you said well belt pouches i've got money belts if that's what you're looking for i've got something that you could probably affix that would be similar maybe so just the two let's say eight silver all right there you go passes it over make a sleight of hand check for me he is happily picking out and handing over belt pouches as you completely disorganize his probably very carefully and intentionally placed system well done you sense a faint smile over your shoulder matt and all right making your way-- oh oh yes you see each tunnel has somewhere in the neighborhood of five to six guards stationed to each some of them are just sitting down bored with their posting they've been told to keep watch but not a whole lot's happening until you guys approach you're heading towards the center tunnel which is the one that already has the fairly deep dig and as you approach the guards all stand up some of them are holding spears and are using them to get to their feet they look over in your direction these are not the same guards you spoke to last night the width of the tunnel as it is the cart's going to be a very tight fit let alone getting two horses to pull it for you underground they all look at each other and one of them who looks probably to have a little more authority who has probably been assigned to be the head of the rest of the crownsguard steps forward and goes yeah what of it and by whose guidance are you assigned to do this they've signed authority you make a deception check you make an intimidation check made in felderwin yes the guy looks at both of you and his chest-puffed moment of bravado begins to slowly deflate and goes right okay what are you looking to do you just inspecting yeah yeah i don't really-- no oh just do your thing he steps aside the other guards they're eyeing you close they still have a job to do they don't trust you implicitly but at least they're stepping out of your path to let you go about what business you're attending to you can climb down because it starts off pretty decent where's the cart being left or are you bringing it down with you okay the cart has been set at the inn then are you pre-purchasing board for it i mean it can stay there as long as you're renting rooms there but if you just want it to be kept there it's a little bit cheaper but you still have to pay in advance for how long you intend to leave it there for storage right you come back and talking to simone deepwell he's like all right so three weeks you're saying a month okay just the cart and the horse all right i'll go ahead and talk to babs about holding the horse we can go to-- oh okay well for board on that it's going to run about three silver a night we'll say for 30 nights it'll be-- that's 90 silver so nine gold pieces for the month (fast forward noise) back up to the point you guys make yourselves down into the tunnel three guards do follow behind at a distance just keeping an eye on what you're doing oh shit into okay hold on here a beast of any challenge rating that is equal to or less than the target so it can be a cr seven or lower actually technically because-- as you guys rested for the evening and you've completed your journey here and you've begun this next venture-- technically for the night you guys would hit level eight this is a heads up we'll deal with that shortly but for the time being a cr eight or smaller beast you could be you go to monsters and you would choose beast then for the cr range you would put from-- i'd say for safety one to eight welcome to the world of the druid look up from levels one to eight you know what laura make an intelligence check okay there are beasts in the wild there are wolves there are cats there are bears you've run across a number of larger versions of these more dangerous and ominous ones like when you were in the savalierwood briefly you came across a few dire wolves use your creative mind on what other possible dire creatures might exist you can try it whether or not one exists the creative imagination of jester creates a polymorph form as you watch her body expand and extend into a massive honey badger maybe six feet from nose to tail tip with a series of bony protrusions that run down its back like two spines large teeth and claws that definitely arc and curve outward to about five six inches beyond the center of the paw unretracted you watch as the guards take a step back like uh how long does that last it lasts for an hour no you are a dire honey badger all right i will say-- go ahead and make an athletics check for me adding what would be the honey badger's strength a dire honey badger-- i'll say plus three so roll a d20 add plus three it's going to take you-- it's a good period of time here of you carving through and taking a break you would've had to cast it in advance but i'll say in watching this happen-- bless only lasts a minute but for that time period you get a little further and we'll say you start getting more and more exhausted and then you reach a certain point where the spell expires and your form reverts to a very sweaty exhausted jester you've carved quite a way you've pushed probably an additional in the past hour-- oh man another hundred or so feet into the tunnel i'm going to go check right now for you at level eight you get a second 4th-level slot (boosh) back into your dire honey badger form go ahead and make another athletics check add plus three plus a d4 ten okay anyway you push on for the next 40 or 50 or so minutes getting an additional 70 80 feet before eventually one of your paws goes through you carve through and you reach the other side of this collapsed tunnel as the molten l-- no i'm kidding no we've all made this mistake taliesin granite granite make a perception check 14 as you look past there's no light source in there and the hole is only large enough for you to kind of fit your torso through as you glance in but in the distance you can see-- what is the distance on your darkvision 60 feet pretty sure it's 60 feet it's a pretty standard 60 feet for-- got you the tunnel widens and drops off like a cliff you hear a very very faint sound it sounds like running water they're behind you yeah don't want to run into that cr creature you're not there you guys are all back in the tunnel it's been dug through and all of a sudden jester creates a small hole and then plugs it with herself you just see the back of jester halfway stuck almost like winnie the pooh trying to exit the domicile okay globes appear by the way i'm trying to remember did you guys take the gray vial with you or did you leave it behind got you cool before we moved on i just want to make sure the globes appear are you on the other side of the chamber did you go through the hole correct all right you step through and (bloom bloom bloom) the orbs appear and it illuminates the chamber and it is a chamber what you've stepped into appears to be a subterranean cavern about 30 or 40 feet ahead of you it drops off and looks to be about a ten-foot drop before it hits another straightaway as it curves to the left you've already smelled the minerals and the hard water smell of the interior of this chamber you glance over to the side and let the orbs drift over a little further and you can see a river it's an underground river and it seems to have carved its way through this lower portion of the chamber it vanishes further below into-- make a perception check coast looks clear marisha and but you also notice as the orbs move through there are crystal-like i want to say like quartz crystals that jut from certain portions of the ceiling and elements of various-- i always mess up on this stalactites i've taught myself a million times since i was a kid and it always transposes-- i know i'm always like-- ugh never right stalactites that come down quite a bit from about a 15-foot-high ceiling from where you're standing that almost reach the floor where you are but over this point where it hangs-- or where it ends and goes further below do you send the orbs out further are you all going through as you're doing this the one guard is oh hey uh-- make a deception check it's riding a line i'll allow persuasion only because you're being vague enough with it that you're riding the line he goes okay i guess just give us a holler if something goes down give a loud holler we're going to probably scoot back this is a bit creepy (surprised exclamation) well good luck okay he turns around the guards start leaving you hear this very faint echoing voice going they're fucking crazy so you guys make your way through the tunnel and join caleb as you all step into the interior you can also take in that smell of long-sealed underground water hearing the rushing of the small river you can see where the path continues on and with the dim glow and the darkvision where it curves forward you can see a faint natural arch that looks to be a continuation of the tunnel make a nature check seven probably make a perception check this is perception because you're looking at things in the distance as opposed to carefully checking what's on the floor 17 does not appear to be trapped as you guys begin to step forward into the darkened subterranean shadows of this newly discovered tunnel system and wherever it will lead you eastward we're going to go ahead and end tonight's episode there yes you should that's what i want out of my dungeons & dragons experience you take a d8 die-- sam you've played this game for-- you reroll ones there you go that's better man six six six oh oh it's six plus your constitution modifier but when you level up it should add that automatically in d&d beyond yeah so you just add the number you rolled yeah you guys get to choose to either add plus two to one of your ability scores or plus one to two different scores or choose a feat this'll give you a week to consider you don't have to consider it right now spell sniper yeah your melee attacks do additional poison damage it does not help your healing distance unfortunately it's attack spells spells that have an attack roll that's the key like guiding bolt you double your range but it doesn't affect your healing correct it doesn't break the game it's just slightly op we'll see what people say anyway you guys have a week to decide put some thought to it and for the rest of us thank you for tuning in for this emotional rollercoaster of a fucking episode we'll see you soon enough until then have a wonderful week we love you and is it thursday yet
