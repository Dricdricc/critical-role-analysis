hello everyone and welcome to tonight's episode of critical role where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors sit around and play dungeons & dragons before we dive into tonight's episode we have some announcements to get through so hang tight for just a moment we have two fantastic sponsors for tonight's episode the first of course our fantastic returning friends and allies in this campaign two d&d beyond sam thank you sam yes may you enjoy your ever-future in race car beds thank you d&d beyond for being our friends and allies in this our secondary sponsor tonight is the fantastic company thinkfun's shadows in the forest game for those who haven't seen it this is the reimagining of the classic game waldschattenspiel-- i know i pronounced it terribly-- but thinkfun licensed it maybe shadows in the forest is the only collaborative board game that you actually play in the dark in the game you play as shadowlings they're these scattered gnomish-like creatures that hide in the shadows and live in the forest and it's really cool you all have to work together to try and meet under a singular tree on the board while one of the players plays as a lantern an actual physical lantern that gives off light and so you can only move within the shadows and if the player moves the light-- it's really cool it's really cool because if you're playing one of the shadows and you're caught in the light you can't move and if the person who's playing the light manages to catch all the shadowlings in the light they win but if all the shadowlings manage to meet under there-- it actually uses-- it's pretty fun so you can check it out on amazon and it's currently at 20% off there for a limited time so make sure to pick up your copy now if you plan to it is shadows in the forest and it is awesome and i'm really excited to try it out next up lets see travis do you want to go ahead and talk a little bit about operation supply drop thank you guys for your amazing support

could-- well thank you laura with that my friends i think tonight it's time to dive into our episode of critical role [tv static click] [groovy critical role theme] the mighty nein had made their way to the menagerie coast got swept up in a bunch of chaos and found themselves out at sea amongst the swavain islands taken in by a pirate crew captained by captain avantika basically at threat of death otherwise sent to an island to investigate a temple learn about seals that possibly are keeping your patron uk'otoa at bay made your way back across the lucidian ocean towards the city of darktow actually actively partook in some piracy polite piracy sure whatever it takes to help you sleep at night and found yourselves at the pirate city of darktow surrounded by the dragshallow reef where you had just arrived with both ships the squalleater and the mistake the crew you had hired out of nicodranas looking very confused and concerned at their current fate given the fact they were just hired hands at sea you were ushered up along the sheer cliffs alongside darktow isle a long stone shelf within the cavern where the plank king himself greeted you bid you entry to the revelry this extending band of pirates across this part of the ocean laid some ground rules and sent you on your way and that is where we left off mighty nein as you descend the rain-covered stone steps that descend down the side of the cliffs-- how's that for alliteration in a phrase making your way towards the now-darkened evening city of darktow the distant glimmers of interior firelight slightly emanating from open windows you can see folks walking through town the light drizzle threatening to stifle the low torchlight being carried from location to location you can see the outline of dozens of ships that are locked into the shipyard that surrounds the city as well as the crooked outline of nearby barricades set up across the reefs that surround the island avantika proceeds before you what would you like to do no just avantika her crew went to the bloated cup which is a tavern correct you assume you're headed back there correct yes possibly a weird answer well when we return into the bay we are to essentially give the materials or at least a number of what we've managed to acquire we are supposed to essentially-- what is the word i'm looking for what is the word i'm looking for tithe i would say-- you're going through customs and you have to-- declare thank you you must declare the amount of which you have recently come upon and from that there is a tithe offer to the plank king roughly about 25-30% but we do not pay for our ship repairs we have free asylum here within the island and we are under the strict law that if anyone double-crosses anyone else within the bounds of the city they will have the hammer of the plank king down upon them that is the way of life more or less yes they're not much into governing more just-- a union with a very hard-headed and forthright union leader nah i have my own specific interests they're much more narrow why do you have aspirations i didn't think so well some of us do there has to be more to you than just this contradictory-for-the-sake-of-being-contradictory aspect eh come let's have a drink huh first round's on me well she lost a stone technically as far as i have been told at the very least-- this was before my time joining the revelry-- there was a disagreement and the previous plank king seemed to be in the minority of the side of this disagreement and the current plank king was in the majority so they stormed the caverns of the previous plank king and tossed most of his corpse to the rocks below to his credit the current plank king has done a very fine job of maintaining organization in the revelry he doesn't bother me he leaves us well enough alone we follow the rules we maintain all of the benefits of being under the banner and i'm left to my own devices there are a number of unsavory types but i've made a bit of a reputation of being a little-- eh people don't like to tangle with that too much eh let's see open on the seas about 12 13 years i got sick of following somebody else's orders i'll tell you over drinks this is not the best place to have these discussions eh perhaps after a few rounds come to the bloated cup as you guys finish descending the stairs into the city itself you catch there are quite a few patrols through the city you can see the torchlight being held by each as they make their way just keeping an eye out you get the sense that there's probably quite a number of volunteers or at least individuals that are intent on maintaining the semblance of civility here within darktow itself leading close towards the bloated cup it's not that far from where you had set your ship within the shipyard it's a fairly large two-story tavern very wide across its bottom and seems to be at least one of maybe two social gathering sites here within the city once the sun goes down three blocks away you can already hear the music chatter laughter and yelling as you approach closer begin to look from the outside in the warm light and the movement of shadows across the open windows shows you that the place is pretty jam-packed as you begin to make your way into following avantika to the interior you hear the shouting and burbling and clinking of glasses as the far corner has five or six individuals you're not sure if they're paid musicians or just sailors who happen to have a bit of experience with a fiddle a drum and a flute of some kind as the music begins to play you can see there is one table that has a lot of avantika's crew they've pushed a bunch of chairs clammed together-- clammed-- crammed together with some bits of dried bread and somewhat soft fruit some cheeses laid out and two large pitchers of ale already waiting at the get-go right off from them you see a smaller table with everyone you've hired from the mistake including orly all sitting there clutching their glasses looking around scared shitless as soon as you enter their eyes turn to you and they go-- (laughter) at which point avantika goes come have a seat and pushes one of the other tables out of the way of a few other people that are already sitting at it she takes her hand and scoots it across the table and they both go (annoyed grunt) and spit on the ground and get up and move away immediately you get the sense that there is a power dynamic avantika seems to have at least some modicum of respect amongst the rest of the riff-raff within this tavern pushing the tables together kicking a couple of the stools over it looks like there's enough spots at the table for most of you one or two of you might have to stand or find a place next to the rest of your hired help as you guys all sit down drinks and rounds begin to be passed to each of you conversations already mid-discussing you hear bits and pieces about how the blessing of the serpent has been upon us this past month being on the ship with most of the crew they haven't been terribly social with you they've helped you and guided you in learning a few things but there's still very much this separation and attention that you're the newcomers and a strange new shiny thing in their captain's eye this is the first time you've seen them a little bit three sheets to the wind as a group and they're talking openly avantika has a definite zealotry to her but you start noticing members of the crew and why they are with her or at least now that they've been there they've also bought into these tales of uk'otoa you get the sense that they believe that this path that she's following will lead to her success and by default probably their success make an insight check for me okay that'll do that'll yeah okay you get the sense that vera who's the older human the tough-looking woman who was her quartermaster before it was passed to fjord is definitely the most invested in this idea this spiritual journey they're all embarking on with captain at the helm you also feel that ipess who's the gnome second mate that you've encountered previously in a very similar way is completely invested eyes wide his general banter tends to be a little crazed and sporadic but whenever they're talking about the great serpent now with phrasing of the leviathan as the title has become more prominent with discovery there's a reverence to his eyes and an attentiveness that is out of character for him so you mark vera and ipess as two very intent believers behind avantika you get the sense that bouldergut the ogre half-understands it and is more just excited because everyone else is excited it's like a dog that gets really wound up when everyone around is talking loud that's bouldergut a number of the deckhands appear to be invested but they're less intensely driven and more just excited that their captain's excited and maybe starting to consider that there is something to this now that they've seen the things they've seen and the powers that she's acquired that's a good spread of what you've managed to gather okay vera is sitting directly to the right of avantika and there's not much space to sit next to her but you could grab a stool and squeeze in to her right side there is no hard feelings i understand the reasoning and the captain's word is law i am excited to see the great things you accomplish as the quartermaster of our ship precisely and for the captain i can only agree aye aye captain looks to avantika avantika right now is deep in the cups at this point a figure turns around the corner you see a male gnome short maybe in his 40s or so with spiked hair it's thinning on the top but you can see he's taken thick balms of some kind to try and make it look intensely young and failing halfway big mutton chops that come down to a very pointed chin and he's dressed in fairly decent clothing a nice silk vest with billowing sleeves out of his shirt with some bangles that clink around his wrists he comes and finds you on the opposite side and looks across to avantika grinning he goes well well well it's been a while since we've seen you 'round here she turns to him and goes ah sorris you're back from that fool's errand i see how was the shattered teeth he goes eh foggy and cold as shit how goes your cloud-chasing journeys love she goes grand we might have scored a fine shipwreck and a promise of salvage eh looks back to him you up for hire perhaps he goes eh tempting but nah i'm still fresh off the water want to enjoy myself a while she's like all right very well we'll be in port for a day or two while we get some repairs done if you change your mind well just start shouting i'm sure we'll find your annoying voice easy enough he goes (giggles) sure that is eh you're all new 'round here at the moment no at the moment i'm a civilian and a drunkard no it's a series of islands to the south of here sorris sorris kay what's your name fjord all right me no i'm a sniper things why are you so curious speak for yourself sir what's your name make a deception check he goes okay phillip and what's your specialty what do you bring to the crew that's actually pretty good that's pretty good me i've got a few odds and things mainly with a longbow good shot there but an eye that can see things on the horizon mainly live up in the crow's nest you know keep an eye out he's joking right avantika goes i'm afraid not his bailiwick apparently is being curious and clueless of course bar fights are fun that's part of the reason we live here if it's a member of the revelry thieving from another member of the revelry and it gets found out it's brought to plank king plank king makes a judgment based on that some sort of reparations or-- (thud screaming impacts) more or less why you looking for a fight always i never throw the first punch so anytime he taps the side of one of his jowls you hear the ruffle of his fingers through his somewhat curled muttonchop on the side grabs a drink and without breaking eye contact-- roll an attack 15 hits you do one point of damage plus your strength modifier boom right across his chin he falls to the ground turns around rubs his chin that was a surprising bit of power there for someone your size come at me he dives at you roll initiative oh he beats you at a 17 15 plus two for a small size he is quick and he jukes to one side turns around and goes for a haymaker to the side of your face that's cocked that's a 14 to hit ping ah go for it make another attack roll are you just doing damage or are you trying to shove him and knock him prone okay that's your athletics check actually he's going to make his acrobatics to try and dodge natural 19 he manages to leap in the air and your tail hits the side of the table and (thudding) to one side the drinks begin to spill and one reaches out and grabs them prevents them from being knocked over as soon as you turn back and say that you look and he's not anywhere to be seen then you hear this (footsteps) under the table you glance down as you watch him leaping up from between your legs and the table to uppercut you right in the chin that's 18 to hit he just manages to hit you you take three points of damage crack right from underneath the chin you feel your jaw clink into your teeth there's a horrible screeching sound it hurts you can feel the numbness in your face from the impact after he hits you he darts off around from behind and he's probably going to go in for a hold but you have your go go for it you go to swing for his head and he grabs your hand and goes ah-ah-ah he goes to pull you forward to go for a headbutt crack right in the front of the forehead and the nose you can immediately feel the blood beginning to pour from underneath behind you guys watch the crowd a lot of people's attention have turned to this bar fight a few of them are now backing up and getting their drinks ready to watch somebody else at the table goes (impacts) and punches somebody else and starts another aspect and now there's another bar fight beginning down the side corner it's your go oh wait yeah because he finished the heatbutt so you go three points of damage every time you get hit he does three points okay go for it roll for an attack yeah that definitely hits another four points there all right ugh his eyes squint and roll backwards a bit and he goes down into a crouching position (grunting) rights himself in almost a muay thai stance yeah that's 11 he tries to swing and you parry it off to the side without an issue go ahead and retort go for it 16 hits because you're grappling roll again for your athletics he rolled a natural one literally a natural one he tries to squeeze out but you've got a firm grip on his wrist and you pull him back in you're now holding him to you he's grabbed no never it's his turn he's going to go try to slam his head backwards into your face ooh natural 18 that's a 24 take another three points of damage crack it hits you for a second you're afraid it knocked a tooth out but you feel with your tongue and it's still there yeah he's still grappled ooh nice roll for an attack 19 hits takes another four damage crack it scrapes across his temple and it almost gouges an eye and he turns and he's like ah you're rambunctious aren't you he's going to attempt to throw you off over his shoulder pull you into a roll you get to make an athletics or acrobatics check against him as he tries to break from your grapple breaks free and slams you onto your back you're now prone from the reversal but it's your round so you can get up or attack if you want to sure yeah she's drinking and watching one leg up on the table and she's glancing over watching this transpire you're going to sweep as you get up roll for attack 13 does not hit you sweep and he leaps up and then from the air tries to come down onto your leg with the full force of his tiny gnomish body natural 20 we'll say for the purposes of this because the nature of the 20 we'll make it double full damage because it's fist fights that's six damage to you from that crack the leg and the knee doesn't dislocate or pop out but you can feel it get pushed to the limit and it hurts like a mother leaps up and like not too bad come on bring it one eye's a little bit-- not swollen but it's starting to squint from pain blood's leaking out of his nose and his mouth and it's smeared on one side of his cheek and he's (chuckling) i like you too-- 16 hits that's another four damage on him crack crack this next series of hits come at him and he's like ha yeah it's nothing i can take it bring it he's going to come forward and try do a series of pummeling in your direction natural one the sheer impact of the last blow seems to have knocked his block off and he starts doing this series of pummeling in the wrong direction instead pushing toward caduceus he moves out of the way he batters at the side of his sleeve there and ha how's that did i get her wait looks around and finds you hi your turn one and a half he goes huh thank you make a persuasion check he looks at you for a second yeah good point i could've taken you anyway we'll pick this up another day he comes up and goes for a handshake grabs your hand pulls you and gives you a soft headbutt it's a little sore on both of you and both of you wince pleasure to meet you what's your name okay sorris pleasure to meet you as well as you guys are having this conversation you hear behind you (grunting crashing) another table behind is broken and you can see a person unconscious across the shattered pieces of wood arms curled in t-rex style the crowd goes (cheering) everyone who was mildly disappointed at the lack of finale to your fight has now focused on the other one that has completed with the smashing of furniture the person on there left scrapped up and wrecked the other individual one eye swollen shut square-jawed burly-looking guy going yeah everyone cheers they're just watching the scrap was only between two or three people and one of them just went down the other one called it off after that and the declared winner everyone's briefly focusing on then as fast as everyone cared everyone sat back down and they're back to drinking you get the sense in that moment this is not a rare occurrence around here it is a very curious question i imagine there are probably some books that wouldn't be what is commonly considered contraband or heavy resale value most of the time when you are boarding a ship you leave the books behind if you're looking for books your best bet is to go to the sundry square during the day it's about four blocks to the left after you leave the outside of here just outside of the shipyard it's where all the awnings and ships are you can certainly ask around maybe both i don't know that is possibly a few around if i recall well and she sits looks around everyone at the table and gestures for everyone to lean in a bit it looks like we are to after a couple of days of travel and supply-gathering make our way northward to a location that has been brought to my attention by our quartermaster there is a likely chance that if there is some sort of treasure there it would be of importance to our mission however it is a salvage mission meaning there will be some diving so i am looking for a few things to prepare for that so a few of us can comfortably make our way beneath the waves beneath the water my friend that is up to you you are welcome to stay behind however if things go correctly i don't think there will be any worry of drowning trust me i have a few connections that owe me a favor or two here on the island anyway i need a day to acquire what is necessary nevertheless-- at this point she looks up at somebody past you and goes we're having a private discussion you turn and follow her eye line and you see a human female with curled blonde hair the curls have fallen in the moisture and the rain from the outside dressed in a thick ragged black coat holding a cup and she goes aye don't worry about me just didn't expect this shore to drag you in quite so soon there's a moment of tension no you have not seen this figure before they both stare for a second and she turns and walks off to a far table yeah don't mind her it's allison she's-- what's the word a right cunt oh best of friends no just a very nosy co-thief at sea doesn't know where to stop poking where it doesn't belong no former competitor anyway no we've crossed territories once or twice and she has a habit of trying to embellish truths to the plank king anyway hand me the map if you don't mind oh map's here actually avantika lays a map out on the table a cube will do as avantika points it out she shows the crew and says in two days travel we will make our way outside of the dragshallow reef coasting in northward for protection to about here we begin looking for our salvage at which point orly who's glancing over the side rubs his chin and goes hmm i don't mean to question the captain's m-m-main objective however that looks like it's right around where the diver's grave m-m-may be she looks back and goes perhaps but does it spook you do ghost stories make you shiver turtle boy orly glances back at her with a narrowed stare and goes as long as i'm staying on the ship i don't m-m-mind he goes and sits back down at the table at this point sorris goes oh is that where you're going you're going over to the diver's grave well that's certainly an off-limits location for most salvaging thanks to the cursed woman eh do you know much about your history close but not at all make a history check you can with disadvantage because of your lack of experience with the naval history you can make a history check as well okay doesn't quite catch your attention you've heard mention of the diver's grave as it was a series of poems from a book you once read the thing that comes to mind is the name dashilla you instinctively mouth it-- dashilla-- and he goes ah dashilla the dreadful you know about this one eh ah poem i've not known but maybe the song you've heard some of the crew around nod remembering and he goes and grabs his cup and claps it twice to the table and the crew begins to filter in as the song progresses and he goes-- so he finishes the song (laughter) sorris goes (singing) where once the waters rolled calmly by where ocean's heart did sing there stalked a lass with a hungry eye and claws that grasp and wring with lantern lure of a glimmer pot with treasure in her eyes below they swam to the gold they thought would await them as their prize everyone starts clamoring together with the third verse (singing) yet each of them went to surely die their graves to not be found for dashilla and her hungry eye collects the lost and drowned there's a moment where they all begin to clamor the drinks together and clink them and begin to drink them (applause) he looks confused so you don't know the poem or the song do you want a reprisal (clears throat singing) where once the waters rolled calmly by where ocean's heart did sing there stalked a lass with a hungry eye and claws that grasp and wring with lantern lure of a glimmer pot with treasure in their eyes below they swam to the gold they thought would await them as their prize yet each of them went to surely die their graves to not be found for dashilla and her hungry eye collects the lost and drowned he goes but that's just an old wives' tale you know a myth well i sail over it we just don't really salvage that what in the middle of the ocean why that'd be daft good luck looks at avantika (singsong) good luck with the missus and turns around-- you surmise that's who he's referring to avantika goes don't pay him any mind it is a myth and if it's not well we just finished tangling with a hydra and an entire island of snake people you're not seriously worried about a woman eh i should have an answer to at least most of our troubles by the morrow just be patient not any more than you would that is the idea no it's best i do it alone it's more of a older business relationship i don't want to make him think that this is a how do you say untrustworthy trade if you will well oversee the repairs to the mistake i believe they've begun before the night is over for a bit we probably will not need it for this endeavor so it will begin and when we return from darktow it should be complete not in particular they'll be looking around here they'll be preparing gather their materials anything you think you require for the trip at sea go ahead and gather it go amongst the sundry square purchase what is required and then hopefully within the next 48 hours we'll be back out on the waves drinking in the back having a conversation with somebody and keeping one eye over at the table seems just perturbed not directly intent but occasionally narrowing her eyes in the direction of avantika it is good if you are going to do a night walk alone or together as a group is much better than alone well the laws say you're not to steal from another pirate in here but only if they're caught but there are others out there perhaps who see fresh faces and think well easy prey best not to cause a huge commotion immediately after arriving nobody does that right one would think yes anyway i am a bit tipsy and i'm going to find myself an evening's rest the rest of the night and tomorrow is yours good eve as she gets up some of the rest of the crew stands up you see bouldergut in the back stand up as soon as the captain stands up and goes like we going come on this way walks by puts her hand on your shoulder and into your ear fjord as she whispers she goes i'm staying upstairs second room on the left and leaves make a perception check actually caduceus just from his passive perception has seen this what did you roll 15 you see there's a momentary pause as she walks by and the hand on the shoulder that catches your attention you can see the lips move and make out the essence of the conversation the rest of her crew slowly gets up and some of them stay to drink some of them go out to find their way in the night you do recall walking through the city a number of individuals stopping at the edge of the docks and pissing into the ocean i mean-- it's entirely crafted of alleys no i mean it's not very jam-packed around this particular tavern/inn but there are some nearby buildings where there are alleys this place is surrounded by streets because it's right there on the front near the shipyard okay and what do you do okay as you take her hand she pulls back you get a closer look at her there's this heavy scar over one eye that keeps the eye mostly closed you can see there looks to be a ruined eye beneath there that's healed over and is not functional she wears it proudly as a point of intimidation or at least a badge of whatever gave her that scar as she pulls back a little bit her other hand going towards the dagger on the side that's now revealed from behind her coat you palm her the note and she looks and takes it-- she crumples it with a terse look and lets it fall to the ground you guys walk out into the cold night air the heavy mist has fallen across darktow and you can barely see beyond the outskirts of the city where the ocean begins you can still hear the waters coming in against the rocks on the outside of the island but you cannot actually see where the water connects beyond that you can see the outline of the ship masts that are set at the end of the shipyard that are vanishing into the mist that surround you what do you do okay you find what would be considered an alley behind the inn and tavern here we have the direct connection from campaign one to campaign two sam has taken a shit live with both characters in-narrative congratulations what are the rest of you doing caduceus you went out for some fresh air jester make a perception check okay the crowd is pretty vibrant around here a quick glance around you you don't see anybody specifically paying attention or interested glancing now looking through the back there is this staircase that winds up to a secondary floor and it looks like there probably is lodging avantika left for the moment what are you guys doing caleb outside at the moment no for the record you guys do wait for about an hour and a half two hours-- no sign of allison right i'm just letting them know that's how long they would wait before they know that she that she's not coming you all make your way gathering once more in the bloated cup (laughter) right back around oh man all right so what do you guys do orly seems to be playing the mother hen with marius playing assistant to that i would be lying if it wasn't deeply inconvenient if we're staying behind i'd say give me about a hundred gold to watch over the nest around here when you return we'll hopefully-- i understand perhaps you m-m-might be coming back for us then i'll return whatever was not spent marius comes over and goes right now hoping no tragedy just come back and get us off this fucking hell-hole if you don't come back i don't know travel from here to there and back about four or five days round all right well i wish you all m-m-much luck i am hoping that is never the case guess i'll just make some coin in the interim i mean standard deep-ocean folk sharks other underwater beasts perhaps m-m-mermaids and other such dangers probably some worthwhile loot there amongst the sediment oh a few hundred years maybe no ships go down all over the coast there are quite a number of creepy stories on every part of this here coast can't say i do m-m-my apologies come back yasha leans in and goes if there is any trouble should i i trust you just-- tell me when you want-- sure okay you guys leave the tavern okay as you exit-- caduceus you notice this-- but jester as everyone's leaving you to the back of it you feel a hand grab your arm for a minute you look over to the side and you may not have noticed earlier but vera had been in the inn in the tavern vicinity she pulls you back from the rest of the group for a second and looks you in the eye with this intense stare you can see the wrinkles on the sides of her face pushing into this tight crow's nest on each side her irises bloodshot she goes he would not be the first she's left in ruin and he would not be the last i will take care of him if he cannot she releases you and spins around and walks off to her room you saw them discuss but you weren't-- at the point of talking and looking you wouldn't have made out the words necessarily you guys are here in the open night air you're pushing midnight here at darktow it's pretty misty there are not heavy clouds in the sky and the moon seems to be not a full moon but it seems to be fairly bright but because of the mist it diffuses there is this general faint moonlight throughout the entire vicinity of the town what that does is it makes distant visibility a little harder much like fog lights at a distance there are a number of patrolling individuals-- no uniform to them but they walk around torch in hand looking through the streets keeping an eye they're armed armored but haphazard and no uniform everyone here seems to be a part of the revelry-- including yourselves now okay both you and beau make perception checks please since you're both keeping eyes out okay you're keeping a gauge on any of the wandering patrolling guards to make sure as to not to speak too loudly or in the presence of anyone conversation either shifting temporarily or coming to a lull and walking by in silence but you manage to snake your way through a relatively quiet town beyond the various taverns this late at night you do wander through what you assume to be the sundry square eventually through this wandering there is a makeshift pavilion where it's dotted with tables and crates under ratty awnings and canopies but it's all closed and dark there's no lights it looks like none of the materials for sale are left behind it's mainly just a structure and materials are probably brought there in the morning and are placed out for trade sell or whatever make a history check you do know darktow before it was taken by pirates about 45 years or so beforehand it was just another city of the clovis concord it belonged to the menagerie coast and it was one of the central port stops for a lot of the trade routes making their way to the coast then it was taken by the revelry and they reinforced it and made it defensible they didn't slaughter everyone there because they weren't there to kill everyone they were there to take it over they killed those who were in their opinion incorrectly placed in charge any dissenters and then anybody who agreed to join the revelry join or die type circumstance everyone who had previously been at the island were absorbed into the revelry some of them have continued their life there some of them their bloodline has continued to be those that maintain other forms of business not everyone is technically a pirate there are a lot of members of the revelry that are just civilians of darktow and maintain the island (laughs) sure (laughter) yes hear that taliesin has plans for you orlando no no it had two glass doorways like windows but they open like doors and latch shut roll initiative ipess ipess is a gnome yeah i mean there are quarters on there you can stay in yes you're not sure some of them you saw found rooms up top above the tavern you were in others left for the night you don't know where they went not really not here no you get the sense that darktow doesn't have a lot of offerings for travelers since most of the travelers that come through here are part of the revelry only a few of them stay offshore you passed a number of homes of people that live here or spend a lot of time here and have in a boat from the boat the bloated cup is right off from where all the docks join and from the shipyard so it's maybe about 300 feet away all right you see this really uncomfortably frazzled owl that's been jammed in a pocket as you begin to settle towards your directions for the evening here under the shadow of moonlit mist within the pirate city of darktow we're going to go ahead and take a break we'll be back here in a little bit to see how this-- i'm excited to see what the fuck is going to happen next before we leave we do have our wyrmwood giveaway our fantastic friends at wyrmwood have brought this fantastic-- oh this is pretty wood this is a lacewood tabletop dice tray it looks like bronze dragonhide the way it looks against the-- it's so pretty leather inside there it's awesome one lucky winner will have this at the end of the break jump over into the critical role twitch chat that's twitchtv/criticalrole to enter the codeword tonight is pirates plural pirates enter the word once to enter any more than that and unfortunately you'll be disqualified only people in the us and canada excluding quebec can enter because of stupid international gifting contest rules anyway we'll be back here in a moment with the winner see you then [break] we have fjord going to the upper floor of the bloated cup what are the rest of you doing at this moment okay yasha is doing what as part of this probably with you she's a bit conspicuous if things go really bad she'll be ready to help out on that side of things there you go make a perception check 13 okay looking out along the docks there are two particular watch-outs that are assigned to that particular part of the docks where the squalleater is currently wet anchored you also see two individuals on the deck of the ship not holding torches but you can see them through the fog one of them walks and moves that's what you see the docks are pretty open here there isn't much of a place to hide this isn't a major shipping region most everything is taken off the docks and off the ships and then brought into shore so there isn't a bunch of errant piles of boxes and barrels per se the docks are pretty open best bet would be somehow under the docks but most of that is in the ocean or trying your best to wait for a moment when people aren't paying attention all right as you guys are having this conversation beauregard manages to circle back and come back to you oh you'll fit right in in darktow you got it all right what are you using it's resistance it is a concentration so that would override your enhance ability that's all good no worries it's a little bit of a juggle all right while this is all being set up-- you have your-- while you guys begin to set your ways fjord you make your way to the bloated cup where do you head do you want to knock at the moment no make a perception check no no sign of bouldergut i know make another perception check you don't hear anything through the door there's a slight pause and you hear some rustling and some shuffling a voice goes who is it who the fuck is this piss off i'm sleeping there is make a perception check don't hear anything (faster heartbeat) maybe a faint bit (knocking) just open the fucking door okay the door comes open you see there crunched down in the room head hunched forward is bouldergut who's been holding vigil at the doorway (grunts) pats you into the chamber you get pushed in avantika's sitting on the edge of the bed currently reading through a book with the window open outside and goes quartermaster bouldergut if you would be so kind as to keep watch on the hallway for a bit bouldergut goes okay if i hear any-- if you hear anything don't bother okay she leaves the chamber closes the door behind her closes the book sets it on a small table that is my favorite kind of person going on the better part of a decade we actually both met when i was first beginning my career well very busy with our attempt to make it to darktow and keep things organized in preparation so lonely a few how about i show you instead so you begin keeping her busy or she keeps you busy actually would be more the-- while that's happening you guys made your way back to the inn it's a very muddied view of the ship because of the mist but you can still make out the major details of the outskirts of it from this far away correct you have so yeah you can all right the best new abracadabra there's a brief moment where you feel like the air's been drawn out of your lungs and you feel as if you're being suddenly thrust forward from behind somebody pushing the small of your back with such intense speed that you feel like your neck is about to just whiplash terribly backward then suddenly you come to a stop and you're both standing in the middle of avantika's quarters on the ship it's dark all right what's the range on that the range on message 120 feet he's out of range correct you haven't made it there yet yeah because you guys instantaneously traveled he has a few more minutes before he'll reach range you can but there's a lack of color it's mostly some shades of black and white and gray there are two sets of small curtains that are currently tied off on the sides of the windows that can open onto the balcony as a general note i would like you both to make a stealth check as you go about your activities just a moment 28 and what's your total okay you both are (whooshing) for every piece of wood that begins to creak as you step because it is a lot of aged wood that makes up this ship begins to (creak) you stop yourself and then shift the foot and you manage to make your way across here without any of the wood creaking there are a number of candles you could see that there's-- okay like duvet over the window perception check for frumpkin i'll say at disadvantage because of the mist unfortunately okay you can see the torchlight from the two guards that are on the actual docks and one of them's keeping an eye out on the water and one of them's keeping an eye on the docks they're stationed to keep an eye out not just to what's happening within the actual shipyard but also beyond as far as they can into the mist for any ships that are arriving in the middle of the night but frumpkin cannot see the people on the actual deck of the ship yeah all right technically yes now that you have the candlelight there gently there quietly what are you looking for okay do you want to each make an investigation check or do you want to help one or the other make it then both of you make an investigation check please no you do not you took charisma and wisdom so you do not going through the desk the first thing that happens is one of the drawers gives you resistance it's locked the other drawers you pull open there is blank paper a quill a couple of small little ink pots the next one beneath has a folded piece of cloth that you pull out and inspect it looks like it's a cover either for the desk or something else you're not quite sure what the purpose is checking under the desk you don't find any other hidden chambers or anything that marks what you were searching for nott you were looking for-- glancing around there is a shelf unit with a number of books on it you pull back some of the books and look behind it along the back of the actual bookshelf itself you don't find any hidden pockets in there there's a small cabinet underneath and you open it up and there's a series of wooden and metal cups wine goblets and various types of imbibement containers pushing through there you do find one panel on the back that's a bit loose and you slide it off and behind there you see a small leather book make a-- the weird perception/investigation thing for traps this is the eternal debate back and forth go ahead and consider this a perception check it depends there's a difference between noticing something's off and then ascertaining the nature of whatever's off that would be an actual trap since you're looking for traps specifically for this one and not noticing something different i would say allowing this to be an investigation i know yeah i know it does not appear to be trapped okay you pull the book back and as soon as you pull back there's a slight tug on it like something that gives resistance and then comes free a little piece of cable or twine falls to dangle from behind one side (hissing) this room begins to fill with a very faint fume looking inside the book there's a bunch of scrawlings what languages do you know you do not recognize any of the languages in the book you put the book inside your pocket okay make a lockpicking check 15 it's not opening okay make a strength check okay you pull the drawer it breaks open loudly you pull the drawer open look inside it looks like there are a few small jewelry boxes that are resting inside you take them all okay the drawer do you put it back okay you shove it back in the edges are splintered it is very apparently physically damaged you also hear footsteps descending from the outside of the door there is a rug yes okay first off-- what's your constitution modifiers okay with the little bit of conversation that's there that's reduced the time you're just now hitting the time where your breath is starting to hurt so you both holding it dive down and then what you-- okay as you're doing this you hear a voice going hello and you hear the rattling of keys you guys by the way you're down now on the lower deck this is the deck where most of the crewmen quarters are and you're down in one of the bedrooms you glance over to the side and there's a person sleeping in the bed right there the blanket coiled over they're like (snoring) a bunch of jewelry boxes yeah you look inside and there's a bunch of jewelry jewels it's an actual small jewel collection on the person who's sleeping just the one jewel okay all right you hear the door above open (creak footsteps) hey anyone the person who's sleeping is like (snorts grunts) okay both of you guys make a stealth check okay you both quietly duck down (footsteps crash) your carpet falls down the guy comes plummeting through hits the floor (grunts) the other guy suddenly goes what pulls out a dagger towards the other guy who immediately is like (yells) goes and starts stabbing into the carpet (yelling) you do also hear the coughing of the man who was stabbed yeah as he's inhaled whatever had been released in the room okay you peek up and look the door that looks inside of the chamber-- okay first off make a constitution saving throw all right so you are considered confused yep i'll tell you here in a second what's going on now you get the sense at this moment that the other gentleman while coughing managed to resist the effect of the fume in the chamber you did not you do notice the doorway is still open because he just came inside to look and across the way you see them both coming up the stairs because they're making their way up from the crew quarters to the area near avantika's chamber which is right by the deck first while that's happening i'm going to go ahead and roll a d10 you can act normally so you can do that so you do okay you both head down in the chamber they walk up past make a saving throw again a wisdom saving throw yes constitution to see that the toxin took hold and now it's wisdom to resist the effect that's another failure you're both sitting there quietly as they are walking across in front you watch as nott-- suddenly her eyes go wide and she begins to drool a bit and the body locks up you're unable to speak unable to move you hear now a little bit of raised voices and you can now hear this on the dock one of them's going what's going on the other one's like i have to get this guy to a doctor he got stabbed the other voice goes by fucking you you twat he's like i'm sorry oh fine they start leading him off the ship one of the guards begins to lead them off the docks does lesser restoration-- i don't know if it does anything for this spell no that does not affect it so i need you to make another wisdom saving throw nott you do manage to resist the confusion effect aw i was so hoping you were going to attack her would've been fun caleb does not answer in the room you're in right now no okay go ahead and make a performance check yes you are so sorry buddy for all that you've been drinking over the past 24 hours the tension has caused your bladder to retain everything and you're barely eking out a sputtering stream there isn't anything to knock over these are open docks all right you guys can't paint on nothing okay you do that and as soon as you do that the paper falls as a plank of wood it takes you awhile to do that it's a few minutes to paint the wood properly to have the effect kick in you can mark off another two square feet in the time they're doing that what are you guys doing one of them has already pushed past you with a wounded man the three of them making their way while he escorts them off of the docks so there's only one man left on the dock by the ship he passes by you as well they don't seem interested in this you feel unsafe in darktow welcome to darktow he shifts in close and he looks at you real closely and goes actually i don't think i've seen you around here before we're going to go ahead and have a conversation off the docks please follow me he pats you on the shoulder and starts leading you off the dock still going it's taking her a few minutes you're still doing your distraction travis you're doing good a few moments pass when you finish painting the wood falls while that's happening that moment is occurring you and yasha in the tavern are keeping an eye you watch as one of the crewmates comes walking in rather rapidly and goes and talks to somebody in the corner that you recognize from avantika's crew i heard waldok got stabbed for some reason waldok i know exactly i'm curious i saw him he got stabbed right out there and he points out the door and you can see him motioning towards the bar you seem him bleeding out i mean he's not dead but for his level of life experience he's taken a significant amount of damage and if left it will probably eventually get infected go for it and roll that's enough to bring him back you concentrate on him he winces and you watch as the wounds close up there's no mark no scarring he looks at the wound and goes mr clay thank you very much i appreciate that you're too kind really zoen goes see no hard feelings right and waldock decks him across the chin zoen falls to the ground grabbing the side of his face i think i'm going to do that he gets up while that's happening and that's happening and that's happening what are you guys doing okay make a strength check it takes you a few minutes you have to take your dagger and score it a bit and then try and press it again better part of three or four minutes to try to find the right edge to bend and break it it does eventually break unevenly into three or four small crumbled pieces only on oneself but yes there you go taking the form of avantika and ipess right okay all right you guys are disguised-- make a stealth check-- sorry a perception check the mist makes it hard to make out much detail you do notice glancing up there is an individual in the crow's nest i'd say about 40 to 45 feet as an estimation okay all right what's your dc dc 14 no did not succeed with a natural eight plus two ten in the main mast of the ship that goes up the crow's nest is in itself a circular platform at the top that is used primarily for keeping a watch on nearby land and details in the sea around as well as direction it's a vantage point for someone to keep an eye on the area around the ship there is somebody stationed up there to keep an eye on the ship overnight or at least there for as long as their portion of it was you can't make out the details of the figure from this distance you just see a figure there okay as you finish the spell a moment goes by and you hear (panicked shouting) fuck shit you look up and you see this individual trying to bat their cloak on the sides of this before shouting help while stealthing or just running okay they have major disadvantage to try and spot you because they're distracted by the flames make stealth checks okay you guys both manage to scoot over to the edge of the ship the seaward side all right you're heading off-- it'd be the starboard side correct you head over to that which is the starboard side of the ship there's the ocean below you a person screaming up top and getting more and more frantic yeah unfortunately perception wasn't high enough you both leap off the side into the freezing cold ocean water still going to make a splash thankfully it's mostly drowned out by the sound of the screaming from the top of the crow's nest as you both break the surface and glance around the vicinity you can see some of the torches that are shifting from the other parts of the dock to come over and see this commotion that's happening the screams get more and more intense before they end with a (yell) (impact) as this person felt there was no other recourse with the flames gathering around them then you hear (screaming) yeah whoever it was they landed they're alive but they're not doing that well they broke something on the way down now the screaming is less frantic and more a pained scream while the rest of the various watchers of the dock start making their way over while you guys are swimming okay so you're probably following under the docks all right both of you guys make an athletics check that's right you're walking actually you didn't have to make it because you're walking 19 all right the water as it's coming in the waves are crashing against the rocky edge and shore of darktow isle right here one end of the docks you can hear the footsteps passing overhead they pass by you guys make it over to the edge of the rocks and with the water pushing you manage to not be dashed against the rocks to any point of personal injury you manage to climb up i need you both to make a stealth check to try to make your way back onto land without being sighted by any of the nearby guard all right you both are-- oh you're soaking wet actually yeah because you dove into the water before jumping in otherwise you'd have taken the impact damage from that that's true it's all good you both climb up on there dripping a bit wet you especially soaking a lot of the guards and the torches are making their way there other ones are still starting to make sure they aren't losing track of their post what are you guys doing they're coming toward the screaming and yelling there are still others there that are patrolling and keeping an eye they don't all of a sudden go someone's yelling everyone lose their post that's true it's borderline but it's starting to calm a bit some of them have gotten up there and they found the hurt guy the spell lasts for how long no the-- correct for one minute so it's faded by now as you guys are walking by you hear the guards going like what's wrong he's like ugh i'm hurt he looks up and goes but it was on-- it was burning what the fuck he's confused and in pain and lamenting why he jumped and what's going on the guards are trying to calm him a bit and they're now starting to think something's up you can see now somebody is giving out directions to the other guards something is definitely not right and the docks are now going into heightened search mode okay while you guys are doing that caleb you see all this happening yeah make a perception check yes 12 okay you're just watching this whole thing unfold you're lead back to the top of the docks the figure has their hand on your shoulder and calls over somebody else he goes hey waynon looks like we got someone who's stowed away here to darktow he looks over to you and goes what's your business make an intimidation check nine he doesn't appear to be shaken by it but at least he finds a bit of truth to what you're saying he's like let her go don't go wandering these docks at night by yourself for no fucking reason he just turns around and walks away you guys start heading back tracking this trail of seawater behind you on the docks eventually beau you turn around and you see molly and keg walking your way all right you all eventually reconvene you eventually complete your time with the captain if you passed by bouldergut and you looked down yeah caduceus is down there he's actually in a healthy conversation with one of the members of the group a round is brought to you no okay in the shit alley as it has now been deemed you drop your various disguises i mean you're damp okay good luck okay as you step out of the inn you watch nott and jester walking towards it they did beau you probably approached right before they did fjord you're sitting over and you watch them all talking just outside of the inn i mean there are guards walking-- the commotion seems to have died down at the moment make a perception check from this distance i'd say with disadvantage from this distance yeah glancing over you don't see any torch-bearing guards but you do see a figure that is doing a visual pass on the deck of the ship you see one that's maybe 25 30 feet from you that's just walking through the street turns around hey i don't know it's not my jurisdiction tonight probably one of the guys closer to the ship okay okay make a perception check or actually this would be an insight check make an insight check you only see one figure you recognize from the crew okay you only see one figure that you recognize from the crew and they are recovering from a series of stab wounds and are deep in their cups waldok he takes it and goes thanks (hiccup) attackers it's just fucking him he points over at the other guy who's just like stop rubbing it in i'm sorry you fucking jumped into the middle of my room at night while i was sleeping what else am i supposed to do he's like not stab me asshole that's zoen make a deception check okay you talk to them about how you're sad you couldn't have been there you can see waldok's like-- waldok's not really caring as much more just like no it's fucking his fault and zoen's like oversharing caduceus one of the guards is keeping an eye over there with the torch he's like yeah it looks like there's a break-in of some sort a guy was stabbed got him safe another man broke his fucking leg and he's being taken care of sure i guess this way he brings you over to the dock and you look over and there's this guy you know his name is bart he's one of the deckhands and he's over on the side right now just going (pained groaning) and you can see it's snapped like bone protruded and everything okay you may have to set the bone first make a medicine check you walk up to him and he's like no no no no (pained gasp) (relieved gasp) (gasp) he looks down and you can see there's a wave of relief on him as he doesn't have this like protruding fracture it's set still you can see the bone but it's much better-looking than it was go for it with that medicine check a level two should be sufficient i don't know i was up in the crow's nest and suddenly it-- 21 suddenly it's-- oh my god thank you it was catching fire i was trying to put it out but it just kept growing and growing and i could feel the heat and it was-- i know i don't-- what do you mean what make a deception check he goes like no i don't think it's that it was sudden and it was intense and then it was gone it's fucking crazy yeah (groans) he stands up and like he's leaning on you for support but once he gets to his foot it's fine and he's like oh man all right you lead him over some of the port guard are like going through the ship now and they're going through-- okay you all gather into one of the chambers make a perception check lucky seven the room seems fairly secure okay it has some sketches in it the language appears to be some sort of either a cipher or a personal shorthand what languages do you know probably yeah okay you open the boxes they're a series of gems some rougher and probably been scrounged up and found that are with some scrapes imperfect but still valuable maybe three of them that are still well cut and have not been given any abrasions there is a dull green jade necklace that does emit a minor magical essence to it make an insight check make a deception check you can tell that she's lying we'll say by now you've completed it i know so you can respond as you go through it it's hard to follow since it's shorthand like it's broken sentences and it's pieces they look to be notes from dreams it goes through discussions of mentions of vandren mentions of being given the mark the eye on her person after a ritual that was shown to her by vandren the dreams began the dreams involved this great eye coming to her with phrases written down provoke consume learn reward it begins to discuss images that involve having to fight through dark waters having to follow signs being promised power with gifts and actions that show leadership and drive towards this entity it spoke about vandren guiding her and then spoke about him getting cold feet spoke on him mistrusting the dreams and his weakness it spoke on an attempt to then gift vandren as a sacrifice but he got away then discusses the search for vandren for months and months to no avail eventually changing focus to instead continue to improve the joyous boons and earn the yellow light of the eye more dreams with patterns of figures in her way people that were close to her that she felt were barricades chains that held her back and getting rid of them you're not entirely certain what getting rid of them means but at least out of the path finding others that begin to also learn of the joys and the promise of ruling the sea and how no matter how much darktow is the center of the revelry and the power of the plank king who can possibly not choose to bend the knee to those who control the oceans they sail on it then goes on to talk about other notes and scavenged bits talking about the finding of urukaxl of the difficulties in hiring people that would go there the hiring of jamedi to search out finally over time you find some other notes about another location from another dream she had that involves three land masses of different shapes there's a few notes and questions around it but one of them is saying archipelago seems to mark these as a possible-- then it goes into a few brief phrases about the newcomers discussing how the mist was taken it's not a lot written in this page all it says is i've found another chosen perhaps this one will be more useful than vandren it does not say that that's where the notes finish it is very unclear it's a personal cipher glancing through it looks like you either learn it here or whatever it would be used to try to decode it is not present in the book you get the sense that this written cipher is not a verbal language it is specifically written for her own notes and own purpose so you couldn't speak it but if you want to go ahead and decode it yeah i'm saying you couldn't it wouldn't be able to--sorry i misunderstood you couldn't speak it go ahead and make an intelligence check fuck dude fuck what does that put you at a total correct intelligence modifier is eight it would be plus five then that is exactly the dc you would have needed to do this it is set at a very hard dc you only could have done this with a 20 you motherfucker goddamn it okay all right no here we go it'll take you the better part of the night you probably won't sleep which means you won't get your spells back it'll take you the night to complete it you will not be able to sleep which means you won't get your spells back and you'll suffer a point of exhaustion i'm just letting you what would take you know you can do this immediate excitement and disappointment it doesn't have the name fjord hmm not necessarily well now would be the time to share it if you hadn't well the safe in the bag you still have yeah the big one you ordered yeah that wouldn't have gone in there yeah all right so who's holding what okay all right all right so you guys will take sleeping shifts mark yourself with one point of exhaustion caleb you don't recover spells the rest of you get a full rest to each of your doors shortly after sunrise he's just finishing making most of the cipher all right so you have to have the book to make the cipher so you go ahead and go find jester are you guys in the same room that would've been-- that's the process that happened you hand it to jester to go ahead and hide how so make an investigation check this would be perception i guess no it only lasts for an hour 13 looking around no the room is shoddy in some ways but it doesn't have large holes you can hide gems in a voice comes to the room and goes hey wake up all right you see bouldergut out there with one of the guards and willow whisk who's the cook jeremiah who's rubbing his eyes bouldergut goes all hands on deck company meeting now goes to the next door says the same thing through the doorway all hands on deck company meeting yeah yes pets you on the head a little bit eh heh heh goes to every room and says the same deal it's a long hallway series of chambers most of the doors closed looks to be four and four and there's a stairway that leads up to a third level the next minute goes by and two more figures show up and they go we're going to the ship now gather your things there's no more waiting come on you get a sense from the vocality here that things are not right probably relating to events that transpired through the evening by the way all of your doors now are being held open and they're expectantly waiting the crew doesn't trust you and they haven't really since you've been here they're not like cool guys let's go there's very much a we're getting everybody in there and shit there's going to be conversations you gather your things head outside bouldergut's keeping a watch from behind other members of the crew are being gathered and ushered in as well as the crew from the mistake and orly everyone's being brought over towards the docks you guys at this point have been brought to the docks now and you're being pushed toward the direction-- you can see the squalleater there waiting and there a number of figures already on deck make a perception check you don't know you don't see anybody necessarily you have bouldergut walking behind you and other people are being ushered in sure i don't know i wanted to sleep longer i know i want to just eat breakfast make a persuasion check yeah just follows your eyeline over okay so all the jewels (bubble noises) into the water okay make a sleight of hand check 15 okay you drop them off the side as far as you're concerned no one noticed bouldergut was in the back and there were a few other-- first off you have waldok zoen are with you guys bark you see being brought over from another side as well it looks like he either stayed somewhere else or was somewhere else when he was gathered up by the crew and the guard the guard only-- none of them go on the ship but they lead you over to the edge of the dock and watch you all go onto the deck and begin to walk away okay you guys walk along the plank up onto the deck and there you see avantika vera the rest of the crew are all there you can see the crew of the mistake are brought to the edge of the dock and are held there waiting you guys are brought up on there you don't know where the mistake is docked you didn't see it when you came in there are probably 20-plus ships that are all across the docks here as you guys are brought to the edge of the ship-- well you're on the deck right now the deck of the squalleater avantika sees you approach and goes good morning everyone good morning well i apologize for the problems this should only take a moment to discuss it appears we've a bit of an incident overnight and i wanted to let everyone know there may have been some issues rifling through over here waldok was so unfortunately shivved by one of our compatriots and shoots a glare over at zoen who's like i'm sorry i'm sorry but it has come to our attention that there has also been well to be perfectly honest a break-in to my personal chambers i know some of my personal belongings have gone missing and i wanted to ask if anybody has seen anything throughout the night i already spoke with a few of the crew who were here before i have not spoken with you waldok did you see anything waldok goes i was sleeping and suddenly this piece of shit fell through the ceiling and landed on top of me and i was just-- it was the other way around waldok got stabbed so waldok goes i was walking and i heard some noise inside your chambers i went to inspect it unlocked the door went in and things seemed fine but then i fell through the fucking floor onto zoen and he was sitting in bed sleeping and he just fucking started stabbing me zoen's like you woke me up what am i supposed to do and where the fuck are we anyway we looked at the floor and somebody had broken the floor probably snuck in somehow the captain goes thank you for that also it appears that bark here had strange delusions and fell or leapt apparently from the crow's nest did you see anything in particular he's like i mean it was crazy it caught fire and then i jumped to get away from it and there was no fire she goes so it appears that there may have been some sort of distraction well has anybody else seen anything of particular interest last night and by the way caduceus i heard that you were very helpful in helping our compatriots with their wounds i appreciate you being a team player oh certainly not to be perfectly honest whoever did this does not understand the rules of the city very well hmm vera vera's sitting back there and nods you see her fingers trace this weird symbol in the air that leaves a slight trace her eyes flare for a second and she goes but that is okay because i can that's where we're going to pick up next week (screaming) next week we pick up in the shipyard of darktow on the
