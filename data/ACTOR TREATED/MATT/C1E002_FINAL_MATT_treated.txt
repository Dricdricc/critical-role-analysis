ahead and do a little recap of what happened last week so the party has been hired by their friend arcanist allura vysoren in the city of emon to head towards the dwarven town of kraghammer as a good friend of hers and one of the members of the council of tal'dorei has gone missing this being a halfling paladin named lady kima of vord who was on a vision quest as part of a pilgrimage and was drawn towards some dark evil she said was manifesting somewhere deep beneath kraghammer and hadn't been heard from since so the party was sent there to go ahead and seek her upon arriving in kraghammer shenanigans ensued they made some friends made some enemies wandered the town brother sisters walked around as if they were married bears almost got into fights in rings and eventually the party made their way towards the bottom ring of kraghammer proper talking to lord nostoc greyspine who is-- yes greyspine indeed who is the head of the greyspine mines at the bottom of kraghammer where supposedly this paladin disappeared to after having a conversation with him a bunch of goblins and ogres began to spring from the mines and attacking the workers the party swooped down to aid realized that the goblins and ogre's weren't attacking they were fleeing from something else of which emerging from within the mines proper some strange naga-based hydra-ish abomination the party then proceeded to slaughter it final blow dealt by scanlan via lightning bolt our resident gnome bard and that's where we pick up so as all of you are still riding the adrenaline of the battle scanlan feeling the tingling in his fingers as the little bolts of arcane energy kind of (imitates electricity crackling) spark throughout the rest of the nearby workers and miners slowly converge in and begin to walk up to the party and someone starts that was great that was well done fantastic where'd you learn that one of them comes up there ah i could've done better than that and they start just shouting off at each other and pat each other on the back a few moments of this progresses before all of a sudden there's a hush comes about the crowd and you see about five or six carvers pull their way through carvers being the guards of kraghammer with lord nostoc greyspine himself stepping through he looks at the rest of the group and goes all right so you've certainly proven yourselves in battle i would like to continue this conversation that we had back in my office if you don't mind he turns around and begins to walk back okay essentially go ahead and make a saving throw with advantage this'll be constitution what'd you roll so thirteen that'd be enough so after you finish casting the spell you feel the poison leave the rest of your body you can kind of take a breath to yourself the rest of the miners kind of look about and awkwardly staring back at nostoc as he walks off kind of looking back like what are you gonna go talk to him it was delicious is what it was all right so as you head back to the ramp that heads up from the mine enclosure itself to the top of the realm which is where the greyspine industries mining facility is you are brought into the building again brought back to nostoc's office in which he's not sitting he's kind of pacing behind his desk waiting for you as you approach as you enter the room he stops pacing turns around puts his hand on the desk and says please enter and close the doors behind you (loud thud) a flatulent dragonborn eh (group laughs) lord greyspine is fine well let's be clear we dwarves don't need help from outsiders we can handle our own business just fine as what the discussion was based on previously you're searching for her and last we saw her she went down into the mine you're welcome to as far as i know she's down there somewhere hopefully still in one piece getting to that you see these small intrusions have been bad for meeting our quotas with the bronzegrip metal warehouse and export shipments employees have been forced to collapse a non-negotiable portion of our tunnels to prevent incursions like this without my approval and this is a pattern i wish to stop at once thus i have a proposition for you now i will give you free reign to our mines i shall get the proper approvals to make sure no carvers bother you as you wander the city's lower ring and i will contract you to delve past our tunnels and investigate the source of these creatures where they come from where they live and if there is some sort of a leader who gives them their commands eliminate them for this i will reward you with not a trifle sum 25000 gold pieces plus 250 gold per beast scalp you provide upon returning the brazen halfling bitch went in there without my approval and wandered into the mines not to be seen so if she is down there i hope she's in one piece i can't guarantee it but if there's any place to find her that's probably it not beneath this mountain it doesn't of human closers great how does that help us dwarves he sits back for a second the types of creatures i do not know i mostly deal with the business and just know that there's some bullshite going on down in the mines you could ask our foreman hieris he's dealt with the cleanup each time we've had an incursion like this so if anyone has information on what these creatures are he'd be the one to talk to he's a foreman at the mine proper this deal was not sewn in yet so no but we thank you for your aid make a persuasion roll you can see this long distant angry dwarven mistrusting stare rubs his chin his well-kept blackened beard and goes huh but a sip as it was a gift his nose squints at the sound (sam imitates a jaunty flute) all right so go ahead and make a - (laughs) make a sleight of hand check on this yep you add a d8 to it as well correct as he's listening to the gnomish music and kind of pushing it away with his hands like stop i don't- no i appreciate it but i don't as you do that your wineskin goes to full (imitates liquid sloshing) swollen to its brim you switch over to one of the cups you pass around the drinks all of you manage to get your drinks passed around to a contract it's hard to tell dwarves live quite a long time he would be equivalent to like a human forties dwarven time somewhere in his mid-hundreds i'm sorry what ah balgus that's the brand of what you brought me if you'd like to do that that would just be taking a short rest outside probably not in the office proper you can leave and just sit down and get some rest you can as well so while you guys are taking a short rest you're able to use any of your hit dice to heal up naturally that is your natural healing not to full it's a continuation grog yeah on every hit dice you get an extra d6 so you got a slow jam just for the sake of the slow jam all right roll an investigate check a brief discussion with a few of the other wandering dwarf miners that are in the outskirts of the buildings' facilities eventually it leads you over to what is a small secondary building maybe 200 yards off from the main property that apparently is where hieris resides and keeps watch over the entire establishment all right the rest of you going with her why not why split the party so the the group makes their way over to the outskirts of the building opens up and a very nice portly looking dwarf with a big tuft of a chinstrap beard big reddish ruddy nose leather apron on and he opens the door aye hello nice to meet you what can i do for ye i am i am foreman of this here fine mine oh have you from who really oh all right well how can i be of service aye nasty lot it always makes my weeks that much more interesting unfortunately at least five or six terrible kinds he starts rubbing his chin for a little and goes we generally deal with the occasional goblin den we stumble across when opening new tunnels that's part of the norm other nasty underground beasties however over this past few weeks we've seen some real nightmarish things slither out of the shadows many goblins stitched together like some kind of ball of screaming green lint slimes and oozes that would mutate and change color rapidly before seeming to dissolve on their own unstable-looking really in their form if you will aye aye perhaps but they're not undead per se they're still alive at least from what we can tell whatever agony face them in their physical form we even had one brief run-in with what looked like a duergar that had swollen and sprouted eyes and mouths all across his body that was a sight aye duergar and he spits to the side filthy lost souls dwarves of old that turned to a darker god thankfully they live far beneath the mountains and usually far north enough to not worry about it but one of them found its way up here in this strange awful maw-covered form it was terrifying and the smell oh ho ho anyway we've even seen a few creatures from the surface that normally aren't found down here as well which is strange they don't wander down something's bringing them weirdest thing oh and i just heard we had some weird many-headed serpent thing that just got killed down there that was you and he steps onto his back leg shifting his weight and cocks an awkward eyebrow really aye i do not within our mines they're usually well-guarded or they were of the mines yeah i do he starts going through his notes here it's kinda haphazardly scrawled across a piece of parchment but he hands it over to you no we've closed it off each time oh no we've had a few tunnels they've come through but we've managed to collapse those and make sure they're not coming through again no no not to my knowledge at least i mean most beasts we find are in one piece not several together it's a bit disturbing to be honest i told my nephew about it and he was crying for hours laura and oh no we've killed them as they come out each time right they don't take anything back not to the mine this is all proprietary this is the business we run so we don't have any internal or secret entrances that would leave us open to a sort of a thief to come in and steal our mithril oh i highly doubt that not with the way our carvers are trained that's what i'm talking about fine dwarven study finest of military classes aye proud of 'em i had a cousin who was once a carver raised him there his whole family brought him up on that side military weapon training every day couldn't come out and play with the rest of us i felt bad for him but he grew up to be a right nasty dwarf aye unfortunately he was slain in one of the incursions that duergar i was telling you about but such is the nature of the fighter i suppose i appreciate that to be honest he was kind of a bastard but um-- don't miss him too much but i appreciate the thought that's very kind of you i mean still avenge him i'm not sure he had parents we were related somewhat i'm not gonna say too closely ah yes ah yes (group laughs) not a short rest it has to be a long rest there you go of course i'm happy to it doesn't have to be last you're welcome to stay as long as you like i don't get visitors to often up here in my booth oh well i have to stay here work at least for the next six hours aye but i have some dried fruits i've got some meats inside i've got two chairs and you could fit in my lap and he kind of pats you on the head right fair enough also apparently my mic's a bit loud if you can turn it down a bit for you guys forget that you heard nothing it's a strange echo in the caverns of kraghammer anyway-- of course anytime when we're not busy but when i'm not busy you're welcome to come by oh i'll save a batch for you you half-elf lass i saw it was a good wink aye made me tingle in my shoulders that might be the diabetes but-- (group laughs) for those who are asking that's west country is the accent cornwall as far as you guys know it's somewhere in the neighborhood of sunsettish afternoon you can certainly check house thunderbrand you later rested shot arcane magic at the home of arcane magic in kraghammer there you go correct you catch him with a handful of dried fruit hmph hi he reaches over and grabs this really awesomely intricate piece of clockwork on his desk it's this brass cylindrical piece that as he pulls out you hear this (tongue clicking) fring and springs and things making strange whirring sounds oh i reckon it's about two hours from sunset as far as i know aye depending on the store few hours you sure you don't want to stay goodbye good luck you hear the door open behind you and he starts waving at you guys stay safe the bag of holding not so much a freezer the mildly rotted turkey leg (imitates moist impact) across the floor the remainder of what was once meat now a slush sloughing off the bone as it slams across the stone floor you see he immediately steps back and his face squints back it's the thought that counts as he closes his door okay that's really kind of you all right thank you kindly he takes it from you with trepidation you can see he probably hasn't encountered dragonborn often and he's like thanks right thank ye closes the door technically in character you guys head to the house thunderbrand all right so tiberius leads you to where it's residing once again you come upon what looks like a very out of place very well-kept green lawn that stretches for a good 60 feet before you see this really beautiful-looking alabaster and gold building slightly domed with these four towers to each corner with these blue pointed crystals on top of each tower he points out to you as you approach there are a series of stone sigils carved into the stonework that surrounds the exterior of the lawn go ahead and make a perception check what'd you roll rolled a one naturally best you can tell stonework's pretty solid yeah as you look about it's hard to tell the nature this looks just like a lawn with a well-framed stone exterior but there's no fence there's nothing keeping you from walking into the lawn and towards the building no nature check required there is no light source other than the green rocks that generally permeate the interior of kraghammer to give its kind of strange luminescent atmosphere this kind of dull red glow that's around the entire city other than a couple of sparks of lantern light there's no light source i forgot that wasn't water (coughs) from what you can see there appears to be a large almost like beachwood light wood double door in the front of the compound so you walk towards the grass you step onto the walkway that leads towards the front of the building as soon as you cross into the threshold where those stone sigils are you make a dexterity saving throw (travis laughs) 12 so as you pull your cloak around you and take a few steps to jaunt upwards suddenly there's you guys hear it the strange (tongue clicking) sound and a poof poof of arcane blue energy kind of just pulses around his feet you instinctively begin to pull back but as you do there's a blast of blue electric energy that (imitates explosion) streaks out from all around you shocking your body and throwing you about 15 feet back straight onto your shoulders you (imitates grinding) skid to a halt (imitates thud) you take 14 points of lightning damage yes your muscles eventually relax okay go ahead and-- let's see yeah so we know what's going on all right make an arcana check 13 okay as you concentrate and these kind of shimmering bands of arcane energy wave off your hands toward the enchantment they impact and dissipate without effect they seem to be okay so you pull the flying carpet mary poppins-style out of the bag of holding (imitates soft thud) where do you create the unseen servant yeah all right so the distance unseen servant can be summoned-- i believe you may be able to actually summon it within the boundary of those arcane sigils 60 feet so yeah you go ahead and you walk up to where that sigil is you finish your spell you cast unseen servant which he says every time every single time you see this strange shift of air as some sort of humanoid form then materializes in the opposite side of this boundary and stands at your ready and command it's about a 60 foot walk it kind of saunters over you guys see this kind of shifting barely barely visible form make its way up to the front door in the distance you hear a dull (knocking) eventually the door slightly opens and you see a hunched figure with bright white chalk-white hair kind of look out the doorway oh where's he come from looking at the form in front of him yeah that's where you come from all right opens the door comes out you now see this dwarven figure hunched very very old with a long very very well-crafted brass staff looks like a black or purple gem at the top spectacles at the tip of its nose and it begins to kind of shift its way over towards you (breathes heavily) eventually making its way yes walks right to the edge of the sigil puts his hand up and the unseen servant vanishes he goes so you have my attention he puts his hand up and there's no sound coming out of your mouth (travis laughs) this is the one who would-be attacked our home abode not more than a few hours ago apparently he needs to learn respect for other people's property if you're looking to but trinkets and magical oddities-- you've come to the wrong place this is a house of study this is where hardworking dwarves of arcane persuasion put their lives towards pursuing-- --the magical forms and fields that-- i'm sorry your sound is back make a persuasion check the dwarf gives you a disapproving brow shift and goes look i mean no disrespect but understand this is a dwarven house of arcane practitioning and study don't see any dwarves among ya i think our business here is concluded if you're looking to buy stuff we produce and sell through the value of valor house of sale bah challenge turns around saunters back looks at you smiles for a second as he looks at you and goes ah how nice to meet you where are you from roll a persuasion roll with disadvantage (all talking and laughing) that's your first roll now roll again no you have disadvantage eight he goes i've been practicing the arcane arts for over 250 years he raises his hand and the alter self spell dissipates where stands keyleth that's the first true thing you've said since you've called me out of my home no it's a powerful wink but not this powerful not the way this conversation's been going 19 he glares at you two and goes i've said my piece good luck to you all (group groans) he turns around and starts walking away as he's still walking away you hear him shout over his shoulder and when you bring them then we'll talk till then good day and don't bother me when i'm eating at which he shouts again at a booming booming prestidigitation voice it's thunderbrand you hear the door slam boom the value of valor laura and so after a bit of discussion you manage to make your way around town you eventually find your way to the value of valor which is a-- (laughs) it's a stone building like reddish brick it looks in construction with fine purple-- (laughs) fine purple tapestries in the front that show various battles of old dwarven history of two glowing enchanted permalight lanterns hanging from the front and an entryway that is currently open and a warmly-lit interior welcomes you yes all right that's not what it's called (group laughs) it's the value of valor guys come on (whines) a giant boulder falls out of nowhere and crushes grog (group laughs) you walk inside there's not a lot of folks inside looking about the establishment but there is one person sitting at the front desk which is a beautiful long oak table with a red trim that hangs to the ceiling not a dwarf actually what you see there appears to be an elven individual sitting at wait hair pulled back behind the ears very very slight thin build and smiles as you enter and says welcome to my establishment may i help you yes well they didn't have one (travis and sam laugh) and i found there was perhaps money to be made in starting one i've been here for over a hundred years dwarves have a hard time buying from those who are not dwarves but i've made my established connections with business individuals so what can i help you with of which intensity are you looking for so looking for a superior healing potion i've only got two of those currently i can sell you the two superior healing potions those will run you 1500 gold pieces each he gives you a keen look and says tremaine superior healing potions 1500 gold pieces very well make a persuasion roll he says and i appreciate this perhaps offer once you return from your mines-- --with these magical accoutrements you are more than welcome to bring them here and we'll make a deal he extends his hand to a shelf on the side labeled dragon parts and to answer your question three what was your question sir he gives you a very concerned look both of you and he goes and he goes i work in trade meaning gold pieces for my wares if you have interest purchase if not i have other business to attend to greater in the new edition the greater healing potions run 300 gold apiece so three so five seven eight anyone else require a moderate healing potion pathfinder to 5e as he pulls up his arcane calculator it is 27 2700 gold pieces for your nine greater healing potions he kind of glances over his shoulder and says ah we haven't had much a request for arrows in a while we have bolts for crossbows as that seems to be the staple for the carvers of the city i have two sleep arrows perhaps if that is of interest to you arrows (whispering and muttering) all right 500 gold with that that is a total of 3200 gold pieces i don't believe i have but should you come across one i would be interested to have a look if you don't mind mm potion of waterbreathing i do happen to have yes i do i have four of them available and they run 500 gold apiece 1000 gold that brings us to 4200 gold yes he gives you a keen look and goes we don't get many requests for this but i think this may fit you and he reaches below and pulls up a fine piece of mithril chain elven in make mm hm he says would you perhaps be interested in this elven chain hm chain does make a bit of a racket might not recommend it unfortunately he goes ahead and accepts your gold go ahead and mark off 4200 gold for those all right very well thank you for your patronage i look forward to hopefully having you back when you return with whatever artifacts you manage to find well of course they come in rare ordinance in this city it seems you hear under his breath a little bit of a mutter apparently it's like elves don't like dwarves it's weird what would you like to put together interesting okay as you guys head back to the inn where you've rented rooms for the week which would be at the iron hearth tavern balgus is not in the tavern no no sorry he's got a home true [bear noise] trinket goes down begrudgingly you find a couple of sacks of grain that can probably work okay you think they're probably not gonna last the night with those bear claws but you don't care it's not your grain okay trinket is very happy (imitates bear eating) tears into some meat you guys make it back to the tavern for an evening's rest for you-- go ahead and make a tinker's kit roll for this i would go ahead and make it an intellect modifier to your roll 10 you spend and toil away for the next four or so hours trying to find a way to get this trigger to work twice you nearly sprain a finger you manage seemingly get it to function then the arrow itself splits and shatters you can see there being something to it but this night it's not gonna come to you it was a terrible roll all right so you guys go to sleep wake up the next morning fully healed spells restored well rested and ready for the day you think it's day it's hard to tell still this underground circumstance is really messing with you guys all right all right you make your way down to the bottom ring of kraghammer to the mines proper the miners have gone back to work and from what you can see there's just an all around crazy business with people cleaning out still trying to clean out the ichor that's on the ground left over from the battle you guys had the day before you make your way to the front of the mines and immediately three of the carvers that are standing at the front approach as you begin to walk and then upon noticing you kind of like step back and put their weapons to the side acknowledging the orders they received from lord greyspine trinket has come along with you i assume trinket comes with you unless you say otherwise (laughs) no (group laughs) they're busy working you make your way into the mine proper it goes back for a good 10 minutes of walking and of winding you can see the actual track of the minetrack leading around you come upon a couple of dwarves that look over their shoulders begrudgingly at you guys as you pass going hey eh shh and go right back into mining whatever remains in the inside of this it looks like this portion of the mine has been nearly picked clean the dwarves that are in there are probably just wasting time to get their pay for the day you go further back and eventually it opens up i think i have the map available cool we can put it on there perhaps for the most part i'll be describing it as you go so it's not too important yes following it you get to a portion of the mine that is very busy you can see since this is probably one of the portions that wasn't collapsed in previous incursions buy whatever creatures these were you get the feeling that this one has basically taken most of their workforce to try and find and carve a new vein or find a new path to pull things from you get towards the portion where all these dwarves are working and you notice that some of the doors have been shattered knocked off the hinges you imagine whatever creatures were barreling through before this is probably where they came through you look around what are you looking for that'd be more of an investigation roll okay that'll be an investigation roll for you as well all right (loud thud) you are you have just essentially started on that map all right you are-- a natural one oh man this has turned completely back from the first game you guys are failing consistently let's turn this around let's turn this around you make your way towards the supply room as you head to where it was one of the dwarves is guarding it not a carver just one of the miners that was hired for this purpose is standing there leads you into the door kind of opening it for you awkwardly going all right whatever you're looking for fine go inside looking inside there are just racks and racks and racks of pickaxes shovels utensils for the purpose of mining and constructing there are wooden boards lying down there are just giant barrels of nails and clipping utensils and things that are used in the continuous expansion of a mine elevator can pretty much hold all of you guys all right as you guys are walking over to where the elevator is you do notice there are two places in the mines where there is just large piles of rubble and part of the ceiling has collapsed you can see that there were portions where the mine expanded much deeper into the mountain that were detonated or collapsed in the idea of preventing any further incursion by whatever these creatures are pouring through you also can see that there are some dwarven corpses being loaded out from the mine below as well as goblin corpses individuals that were caught in the attack that happened yesterday before it managed to emerge from the mine and you do so quite quickly (spits) it's rapid it's amazing all right so that heads away from the elevator there's a spiral staircase on the map on the lower right hand side that's where they're coming from it seems to all right you guys go ahead and approach the elevator it's a large wooden platform with a series of chains my terrible hastily drawn map there for you yeah i know it was actually more designed as a dm utensil but you guys needed a map-- --so i gave you my map so i'm taking it back (group laughs) it's-a mine no i'm keeping it it's all right so you get back to the elevator there's a large 15 by 20 platform with a series of chains and there are two dwarves in the back that run a giant iron wheel as you approach they kind of give you a look like well are you serious about going down [travis laura and marisha] yeah as the winch begins to release it-- trinket is a little nervous as the light spell bursts out from his staff you all kind of have to cover your eyes for a second but the lower area is opened up (imitates loud thudding) you guys hit the bottom floor you step off the platform and you can see there is a secondary minecart that leads from this elevator that curves to the left and leads deeper into the mine proper to the right of you is the spiral staircase and you can see now two of the other miner dwarves are dragging a dead body across (laughs) you can attempt another investigation check investigate investigate but you advantage on the roll because you're a ranger tracking 17 alright so as you guys are going to ask somebody about this your ranger gets down and begins inspecting the floor where you can see there were struggles that apparently occurred you can see slash marks on the ground you can see bodies or the impacts of bodies where some of these dwarves have been pulled away a few minutes later you can see tracks dwarven tracks of bodies being pulled and dragged not in the direction they're going but further down the tunnel as you look and follow that track you notice that maybe a good 200 feet to the left of the cavern there is a new tunnel breach that is currently open about a 20 by 15 size tunnel that is fresh and blasted out from the other side you can see rubble and rocks strewn across the floor all right with his light spell it's fairly bright otherwise it's fairly dim and it does echo grog grog grog grog (faintly) grog-grog grog following the tracks you can see the dragging of the bodies does indeed go in the direction and into the newly carved tunnel in this mine network what you do notice is the dwarves' bodies that are being dragged away you can see footprints of those that are also pulling them aside you kind of figure out the idea of the pattern of the footsteps that are leading in that direction most of them are also dwarven in shape so there are you can gather dwarven feet dragging dwarven bodies deeper inside however there are two bodies that are being dragged with no footprints whatsoever from the dragging marks there is no blood there's no signs of them dragging dead bodies off at least no there's no struggle either the walls here for this tunnel are about 15 20 feet in width and about 10 15 feet high no all right you push further in (liam imitates sword being drawn) --of following this tunnel with little variation steadily declining and winding as it progresses three hours go by this tunnel goes extremely deep whatever managed to dig its way up here came from pretty far under this mine nope no change in physicality no sign of struggle yeah all right go ahead and roll a stealth check all right there we go your luck is changing now you feel pretty stealthy you guys look like wait where the hell did vax go about four hours-- no it is still it is stagnant air (laura coughs) even more stagnant now four hours of traveling deeper into this tunnel's path until-- as the four hour mark of travel into this tunnel presents itself the tunnel finally widens and opens as the sound of distant water rushing reaches your ears as tiberius steps into this opening the light cascades into this new cavern a large beautiful open space presents itself a good 100-foot-up ceiling from what you can see a roaring river is now pouring out of the nearby rock cascading over a cliffside into a waterfall down into this deeper giant cavernous space the tracks continue in the direction of that river you detect no magic you roll stealth let's go ahead and take a bio break-- --as the mystery begins to unveil (group laughs) be back here in about five ten minutes folks so keep an ear out we'll be right back and everyone runs off to take care of their business all right (marisha speaks gibberish) (laughs) hopefully more to come down the road we'll have more fun things for you guys so anyway so bringing it back to the game at hand as you've stepped into this large cavernous space you can hear the rush of water as the underground river begins to turn into a waterfall and drifts into a smaller body of water it's just out of sight beyond this cliff face into this open cavernous area you guys also stealthed and what did you roll for stealth 17 got it all right all right as you guys step into this space there are sections of large rock portions of stone that just jut out and block off portions from your view of this area giant stalagmites and stalactites that just permeate the entirety of this cavern which has been long just building and building with elements drawn from the ceiling from the waters that flow through you also faintly see a light source-- --behind one of those rock pillars in the distance make a perception check 18 you hear a very very faint sound in the distance (sharp noise) that's not the sound tiberius yes you do you hear a (clicks tongue quickly) (continues clicking) it's hard to tell at this point it seems to be just kind of loosely atmospheric the very very faint light you see no it's adjacent to the water to the right of you (continues clicking) okay you both creep forward pitch darkness falls upon all of you do they all right so go ahead and roll a perception check light light light light light as you glance about in cave bear form you look up and all you can make out is shifting movement across the ceiling (group groans at once) and both dislodge all of you hear two loud cacophonous thunderous slam sounds-- (imitates loud thudding) --on the ground next to you-- (screeching noise) all right there is a surprise round all right so you guys are stealthed off to the side there there's trinket that's what i do so there's the water there rushing off into the waterfall that goes further down the waterfall is right here so the river kind of pours over falls into the water below there are some of these large rock elements here you cannot tell what's beyond this area which is where the light source is coming from (imitates thudding) they are (group screams) you've had one brief run-in with a single umber hulk in the past they respond to the something so this one shifts up over there and this one moves up to there gleans past you as it does not notice you this one comes towards you percy attacking you with each of its claws and its mandibles the first strike comes at you with a 13 to hit with its first claw what's your ac you woomf just manage to dodge out of the way as these giant-bladed claws sweep next to your face the second strike comes to you at a 21 all right so the claw finds purchase across your torso (imitates claw slicing) the armor catches most of it however the slash does leave an impact on you as you can feel the taste of iron in the back of your throat you suffer nine points of slashing damage and just as you pull back the mandibles time to crunch down upon you and that is going to be a 27 to hit you take 14 points of slashing damage as the mandibles slice down clamping onto your shoulder you manage to pull free but in doing so you wrench the pointed portions of the mandible across your shoulder pulling open the flesh in this horrible jagged pattern that brings us to the other one who is attacking grog all right so go ahead and roll your d8 to reduce his attack roll d8 all right that would have been a 20 to hit that brings it to a 17 so as you begin singing out as it pulls back with-- --its mandibles to strike at grog it (clicks) looks off to you for a second goes back at which point grog has put his axe up to its face and is holding it at bay as its mandibles are tied in with its blades and the handle of the axe is trying to hold it back it strikes at you with its two claws grog that is going to be a 27 and a 14 okay then from the one claw that gets you you take six points of slashing damage all right everyone roll initiative (group groans) all right so 25 to 20 24 nice we got some vex up top 20 to 15 anyone all right got some scanlan up there 17 17 percy keyleth 15 wait uh 14 14 grog and tiberius all right cool top of the round vex before you do that-- as you're going to reach back you look over into its strange glistening black dead insect-like eyes of the umber hulk and you feel this strange wave of mental confusion hit your head go ahead and make a-- go ahead and make a saving throw this is going to be charisma saving throw so you roll d20 add your charisma saving throw at the top of your character okay so it's 13 all right the wave of confusion takes hold over your brain (group groans) we're gonna go ahead and find out what happens (laura groans) all right-- you reach for it and you space out for a second your hands fall to your side and you stand there trinket is looking for some sort of cue from you of what to do no but trinket's looking to you for some sort of direction and is getting none this is a very clustered space too can barely see you over this i know doesn't matter if you're stealthed he couldn't see you but you could see him okay (travis laughs) are you averting your gaze from the guys or are you looking at 'em directly this is confusion i don't think-- mm this is technically a confusion effect so yeah so as you finish your song you're like-- doesn't seem to be having an effect unfortunately okay just go ahead and roll feeling him that's a d4 plus five yeah you got it percy you heal-- it's a four so you heal nine hit points and it's your turn what do you got percy you are right here in front-- so averting your gaze you take a shot you are at disadvantage on the attack roll just disadvantage yeah all right okay roll again as you have disadvantage because you're not looking at it directly that hits go ahead and roll damage 14 points of ice damage nice okay also at disadvantage okay so as you go to fire it's like you-- (imitates gun firing) fire the first shot averting the gaze and you feel the actual metal get extremely cold and you have you have to shake it out like aw damn it okay so your action is just trying to fix the gun all right that brings us to-- keyleth just as a note your inspiration dice that you give can be used on saving throws as well no you are a bear which i will for the sake of this give you the kitty minxie is the form but you are a bear okay okay so fog cloud the entire space it's a 20 foot radius i believe if i recall from the one he did yesterday everybody gets obscured vision well to cast you have to get out of creature form remember so you're a bear all right so you move up to there go ahead and do your full round of attacks okay are you averting your gaze or not darkvision means you can see in the dark you are a bear i'm eating at his leg i'm not looking at his eyes i'm not like waxing poetically at how sexy he is i know that's true make a charisma saving throw yes (travis laughs) 16 you can feel the oppression of the umber hulk's gaze but you shrug it off your bear mind not affected by the measly tricks and traits-- -of these strange underground entities roll for your four attacks 14 misses (group laughs) yeah hits also hits 20 damage nice all righty so as you shake off the effect you reach for it lashing out two large strikes the second one gets a distinct carve into the back of the umber hulk's hide you can see a portion of its chitinous back armor gets kind of pulled off in a chunk and it (snarls) reels back from the impact and readies itself for a second round of attacks there you go they go this one turns towards and moves this way to focus on the cave bear that just thrashed against its hide while this one turns and moves in towards grog but now turns and sees the-- actually no it stays there fixed to grog so making its multi-strike against you keyleth that is a 26 to hit that's mandibles 17 to hit with its claw and 18 to hit with its claw all right so you take six points of slashing damage from the first claw eight points of slashing damage from the second claw and then the mandibles deal fifteen points of slashing damage as the umber hulk just turns to you and as a reaction to your assault-- the last one was 15 just unleashes an array of strikes against you (matt growls) that brings us to the other one who's attacking you grog that is a 12 to hit pretty sure misses another 12 to hit 'cause it likes to roll fours apparently for the mandibles it's a 20 you're taking damage fool that is 18 points of slashing damage against you you haven't raged yet you haven't raged yet it isn't your turn yet i know you're about to be so angry you're gonna be so angry 18 points of slashing damage the mandibles crush down on your body and you can feel them pierce into your chest your exposed musculature is then torn in a jagged form as you feel the blood begin to pour down the front of your torso that ends their turn vax go for it that hits that one that's the one yeah he doesn't know you were there you were stealthed not in his face not in his face it's back three okay okay so as you leap on its back grab purchase on one of its chitinous plates bring your first dagger forward and jam it into the side of its head as it pulls back you hear a (snarling) as it reacts to the immediate pain and begins to reach one of its claws to try and knock you off as you do you put the blade back into your belt grab with your other hand pull your other dagger and slam it into the other side of its head this time it shrugs you off and you manage to just land on your feet barely behind it still faced away from you that brings us to grog (travis grunts) rage okay okay all right all right i'm gonna check one thing real fast i will say situationally because of the fact that your rage that you have advantage on the saving throw against the confusion effect [marisha and laura] oh your mind is so filled with aggression so make charisma saving throw yep roll again you have advantage let's see what happens so-- (group groans) --as you rage-- --you feel the influence of the umber hulk's gaze pierce your eyes and the fury fills you and you reach out and slash with your axe however it does not reach for the umber hulk go ahead and roll an attack grog there's a loud clanging sound as a giant angry swooping bladed greataxe misses tiberius's head by inches before slamming into the stone right up against the side of the wall you can just see now this kind of loose crazed look in his eye (growls maniacally) tiberius you're up no that's your turn cast dispel magic okay no it is a magical force forced to make a save go head and make an arcana check (sam and laura sing along with tense background music) 17 the chaotic influence in your brain begins to dissipate and the rage-filled gaze begins to fill your eyes once again this time clarifying on the umber hulk in front of you so the stone beneath tiberius's feet rises up creating a column fifteen feet above the rest he is now raised on a platform i'll put him right there looking down upon the battlefield all right vex you're up are you looking at it or are you averting your gaze well the confusion only lasts one turn this here this here this is rock this is about 25 30 feet up and this is where the light source is coming from you can't look over that way okay (taliesin and marisha imitate birds) you shooting this one for ranged you would not get a bonus for that unfortunately so are you shooting at the one behind you this one okay all right so make your attacks with a disadvantage as you're kind of keeping your eyes back and shooting in its general direction plus eleven hits you do yes yep that also hits yeah so both attacks hit did you want to use your bonus action for anything all right so you throw hunter's mark on this umber hulk there but you're like you're my quarry ugh keeping your eyes back you go ahead and pull your first and second arrow (imitates bow firing arrows) letting them loose kind of letting a little bit of faith take your arrows to the wind both finding purchase on your foe you can yes so total damage of nice (liam imitates arrows firing) all right anything you wanna do with trinket he would have to use one of your attacks to do that trinket's just hanging out no healer this week what could possibly go wrong scanlan you're up all right what's the dc the difficulty class on your spells 17 alright 19 so as the two umber hulks are there the one that's in the center of the group (snarls) --snail form on the ground there's a tiny tiny little snail on the ground now that looks very confused very confused which is ironic for an umber hulk to feel confused next'll be percy d8 percy you're up (sam imitates flutes) gotta do my app you're inspired so who are you shooting averting your gaze right so go ahead and fire at disadvantage 14 with the disadvantage will miss unfortunately (imitates gun firing) the fire shot arcs off into the distance-- add the inspiration dice 17 will just barely hit (group cheers) 17 fire damage nice okay you hear the shot hit and you hear a cracking sound as one of its plates actually freezes and shatters off of its body exposing kind of a fleshy undercarriage this umber hulk is starting to look a little rough that brings us to the top of-- do you want to move or stay where you are back here there okay good all right that brings us to-- laser pointers we have use keyleth you're up keyleth okay after seeing grog get confused i turn and i go straight for his throat and i'm trying to drag him into the creek travis and okay okay so go ahead and roll for a grapple does anyone else-- can i have the book real fast just to be sure we know how we're doing this it's a contest yes so you can make a grapple attempt in place of one of your attacks all right so it is an athletics check no you use the bear's stats right what's the strength yeah yeah roll the dice add plus five (group cheers) natural 20 (clapping) you reach forward and latch onto it with your claws and your teeth onto the umber hulk alright so that's your first attack you can go ahead while it's grappled and attack with the other strikes okay you pull (imitates thudding) you both plunge underneath the water's surface take a big old breath right beforehand and i'm going underwater it's now its turn it's going to try and break your grapple 20 okay you maintain your grip on the umber hulk it's thrashing in the water trying to get its way to the surface (snarls) still slashing about so it's gonna make its attacks against you 14 hits you well no you keep your armor class i'm pretty sure nah let's see real fast actually on this one exactly here we go you gain the scores-- it's 12 plus-- it's whatever the 12 is plus your proficiency modifier i think is what it is for now we'll say it hits 'cause i don't wanna hold this up no you gain its armor class yeah you do yeah it hits you all right second strike that's also gonna hit you all three hit you you take six points of slashing damage 11 points of slashing damage and 6 11 17-- total of 26 points of slashing damage so you lose your grip as your form reverts you are now back to keyleth's form in the water no because you used your actions to grapple it so you're now just back in the keyleth form underwater you catch your breath and realize you're now underwater in near darkness with an umber hulk right on you vax you're up over here all right go ahead and roll a ranged attack so just roll add dexterity 18 you throw it arcs over lands in the water (imitates water sucking) goes under into the waterfall no he threw the snail over the waterfall that's an attack it's the world's easiest grapple throw correct make an acrobatics check try to tumble through them yeah you're fine and where do you wanna go well it was the attack to throw it you would have your second off-hand well you have disadvantage 'cause it's currently in the water thrashing about and it's hard to see well that's not very good 15 grog you're up go ahead and make your three attacks grog (liam sings opening notes to under the sea) 26 hits hits hits go ahead and roll damage grog as you come charging forward just (grunts) leaving bits of foam cascading off the side of your mouth your eyes just glazed over with white you bring the axe down into the water form towards where the splashing is keeping mindful that keyleth might be in there somewhere but you're very much see the larger form in the field so yeah so damage on the first strike eight 16 that's 24 34 okay you help keyleth out of the water at this point the snail form which doesn't have a whole lot of hit points has taken enough damage to alleviate itself from the polymorph as the spell fades as the snail form is destroyed the other umber hulk begins clawing its way up the side of the mountain burrows through the actual stonework-- --(imitates explosion) and bursts out of the ground right behind you vax (imitates explosion) but that's its turn all right that brings us to the top of the round tiberius okay roll for it roll for the attacks yep any directed spell like that you have to roll and add your spell range modifier what'd you roll disadvantage so you rolled an 11 total yeah you miss so as you aim your firebolt (imitated fire shooting) you're just averting your gaze and it jumps over and arcs through the rest of the carvern lighting it as it goes like a flare that leads to scanlan actually no vex is up and then scanlan sorry you you go for it so two arrows notched (imitates arrows firing) disadvantage on each attack 20 hits go ahead and roll for the second attack both hit go ahead and roll damage on each the other one was yeah but you could switch over your hunter's mark with your bonus action so a total of 24 points of damage all right got you (imitates arrows flying) the arrows end up piercing part of the armor each sink in a good solid six seven inches or so it angrily (wet snarling) at the impact but it wasn't enough force to send it back at all but it knows exactly where you are that brings us to scanlan all right so because you're kind of averting your gaze to look away-- no because you don't roll to attack but it gets advantage on its saving throw because of that aspect arcs out from your fingers (imitates lightning) 28 okay 14 points of damage to the umber hulk as the bolt of lightning cascades through its body it lights up for a second as you see the crawling fingers of electricity kind of shoot through its plates indeed as the bolt grounds itself the rest of the water on its form evaporates from the sheer force of the electricity you see the umber hulk still standing angry in pain and standing although it's still looking a little worse for wear you don't wanna do that to an umber hulk (group laughs) percy you're up that was the disadvantage awesome that hits all right well done it's for attacks skills and saving throws not for damage 11 points of damage from the first one correct yeah okay it's 11 points damage gotcha so as you rear back your shot (imitates gun firing) it resounds it hits the plate shatters it on the other side of its chest you can now see this weird purplish goo beginning to spill from its wounds you see it's holding itself up and it's having a hard time keeping physical form there keyleth you're up call lighting it is yeah it gets a bonus on its saving throw though or advantage which it makes 3d10 all right go for it it is no longer outdoors-only 11 damage to the umber hulk which is halved he made a saving throw to a six yeah it's now its turn it turns and runs past to the one who shot it with the angry lightning bolt (travis laughs) reaching back with both of its claws swiping at you scanlan that is a 23 to hit 25 to hit yep you take 13-- 24 38 points of slashing damage this is the sound i make (high-pitched wail) (group laughs) that brings us to vax 27 hits definitely it is considered flanking because scanlan is there oh yes how do you want to do this (group yells triumphantly) as it's looming over scanlan who's on his back it's tearing into him and starting to gut him best it can he's screaming from beneath you rush underneath tumble bringing your dagger up and slam it right under the bottom of its abdomen as you do it (snarls) looks down towards you and right before its gaze can meet yours you yank back with all your might basically scissoring and jagged drawing the blade up the back of its body as you do it (imitates vomiting) leaps forward it's now-soft torso and belly left open from the armor plates being shot off spills a number of its warm innards right onto scanlan's body and form and then it collapses on top of him you take six points of crushing damage as the umber hulk collapses on top of you okay for which spell is this cure wounds level two 2d8 plus five you roll so as you heal him touch him with the spell you wipe the umber hulk ichor off of your hand that's uh okay so you still hear the rushing of the water down below you now stand at this portion of the cavern the dull glow in the distance of some sort of light source in that direction the rest of the caverns opens up this way grog goes running grog who's interested all right you guys head out eventually you come around the corner to see what looks like a campfire it looks like a setup with a small bundle of what looks like bedding there's a campfire set up it's mostly out at this point like there's still a little bit of a flame flicker to it but it's just embers for the most part does not appear-- grog starts hacking away at the bedding (travis grunts) (arrows whooshing) three crossbow bolts come flying out of nowhere-- --two hitting grog grog you take seven points of piercing damage which is halved to four because you're raging as you can see what looks like three small-- and some strange beast you've not seen before seems to be accompanying one of them it looks like an oversized swollen brain with a set of claws it's just like a large brain with a set of arms and legs like a panther going off the same intiative order they've gone yes i know so you haven't been seen and you have the first action they are yes if you'd like to well if you dash as your action-- well you can dash as your action but dash is your basically a double move so you move and use your action to move as well that's all you'll be able to do okay just wait okay all right tiberius you hear grog go ugh you jump off your pillar saunter over here it's a giant raised stalagmite it's about 25 feet tall all you see is grog standing with three bolts sticking out of his chest now anything else tiberius gotta keep this moving do you want to use your full round to move cause that's as far as you can move currently actually you can move two more all you see is grog over there uh you can attempt to you're at disadvantage on the stealth roll but go for it all right so we'll say you're pulled off to the side there the stealth twins over there being all stealthy-like no one can see what's going on with them it's like they're related that's your turn scanlan you can go that far okay best you can see and you haven't really seen where they are so you're kind of like oh you have the idea that perhaps they're over in that vicinity on the bolts around there so you can cast over in this area which is the only thing you have view of this is a big rock right there yeah okay that's about where you can go all right so (hisses) a giant-- --green ass cloud-- --begins to fill this space here as it does they all begin to hack and cough you can hear this now between the rest of you echoing throughout ♫ constitution saving throws everything in the cloud ♫ ♫ all them are failing ♫ all right you hear a cacophonous amount of hacking coughing as all of them drop their attack stances and begin just retching nearly vomiting in the middle of this green cloud of gas yes greater okay greater heal potion is 4d4 plus four all right that brings us to percy okay good all right that brings us to keyleth okay correct wait you're gonna use wall of stone to try and push that back all right so how it works is wall of stone you can create a wall of stone but it cannot occupy the space of a creature so you will not be able to push them back unfortunately but you could lock them into an area if that's what you wanted to do it's the nature of the spell guys all right you don't have view of any of them right now unfortunately okay that'll be your turn you moved twice you had to get a long distance yeah because you were back here sorry all right so and what's the dc again of your spell 19 all right all three of the-- and you can now get a view of them they are dwarven but their skin is ashy and grey their eyes are white and pupil-less and they are all on the verge of vomiting right now they're both just keeling over one of them tries to bring a crossbow up and (imitates vomiting) has to put it back down again they are unable to act this turn the weird brain creature however-- it moves out of the cloud looks over at you grog and just bears down for a second and you feel this intrusion in your mind go ahead and make an intelligence saving throw alright you suffer nine points of psychic damage as there's a sudden blast of excruciating pain in the center of your brain it actually shakes you a moment from your rage which then fills your mind once again also you suffer-- --8 points of intelligence damage technically you immediately fall unconscious (laura gasps) your intelligence is brought to zero that brings us to-- (matt laughs) tiberius yes you're tiberius you just watched grog just go (groans) and fall to the ground almost into the campfire all right yes you can from there the brain fucker's official name okay single targeted beam makes its saving throw what's your dc it just rolled a 17 yeah it makes the saving throw so half damage it's embers yeah 21 22 23 24 26 27 22 29 damage as you put your arms out you focus this blast of just freezing cold arcane energy that slams into the side of this brain creature as it does you see it begins to freeze its entire body as it reaches up and tries to climb up it solidifies and then shatters into a hundred million pieces (group cheers) lisa loeb and then the nine intelligence damage all right so the brain just (imitates shattering) cascades across the ground and thank god vex you're now seeing three dwarves retching and coughing over kind of looking about very nervously on this one here yeah you can move to there and get a line of sight that hits okay good remembering 11 all right all right so a total of (imitates arrows flying) ugh the hacking coughing duergar dwarf is like (coughs) one in the shoulder and the other shoulder and it looks like that you (inhales sharply) as it inhales a big old whiff of horrible stinking cloud gas the arrow (imitates arrow flying) through its throat and out the back of its head falls flat on its back the other ones look nervously about one of them's just coughing out saying something in undercommon (speaks in angry gibberish) you do you hear him say quick there's our exit back back to the master all right that brings us to scanlan no no this happening just as you heard them yep then i'll just move further into the cavern there and i don't know that this works but i'll try to cast dispel magic on grog so you go ahead and you focus you cast dispel magic in grog's vicinity you see the shift of arcane waving energy it does not seem to have an effect you think at this point grog isn't unconscious grog is catatonic grog has no intelligence there is nothing home you see him on the ground drooling eyes glazed over there is nothing there i think the chat room's catching on for those who know d&d well it's all right so that ends scanlan's turn percy your laser point your laser (liam imitates ray gun) it's a tough call he has cover you can still see him then you can ignore three-quarters cover which he has so yes okay okay so go ahead and roll disadvantage on this attack or do you want to just do subdual damage which is what you're doing it's a normal attack there's no penalty to it mm hm 25 points of damage all right you run around the corner pull the gun out and aim at this like-- (coughs) where you look now you see this ghastly looking evil female-looking grey-skinned dwarf looks over at you and (gasps) reacts and goes for her weapon as you do you let loose and fire straight into her shoulder blasting through most of her shoulder exposing bone it's not a deahtblow but you see she has been incapacitated keyleth you're up that dwarf survived with one hit point all right go for it first off make a constitution save 'cause you stepped into a stinking cloud unless you wanna move back here there you go laser pointer 22 points of damage all right so the bolt streaks from the cloud in the sky slamming into this other duergar as it sparks into the ground you see bits of stone get thrown up from the sheer force of the bolt doing a sincere amount of damage to it not enough to finish it but it looks very very fucked up you can see part of its face is charred now and it's reeling from the blast probably blew out its eardrums from the cacophonous blast of the thunder that's your turn it's now both of their turn they both failed their saves with a two and a four they're both still hacking and coughing in the stinking cloud uh go bards vax you're up correct so all here okay go ahead and make a constitution check with advantage because you're holding your breath roll a d8 to add to it so as you rush in the cloud (breathes deeply) you run in pull your daggers out and because this isn't a natural cloud the arcane force puts it in your nostrils and you can't help yourself (coughs) your turn immediately ends as you begin feeling your lunch retching up into your stomach okay that brings us to grog you are a-- you are brain-dead (group laughs) tiberius you're up both of them are pretty weak right now actually so you can step over grog get around here you mean there all right go ahead and roll for the attack 14 unfortunately does not hit you aim and it manages to just pull out of the way vex you're up yes there you go yeah pull back-- (imitates bow shooting arrow) roll to attack that hits go ahead and roll damage that's enough as the arrow (imitates arrow flying) careens off slams into the chest (groans) it catches itself steps back and plummets off the side of the cliff onto the lower floor about 20 feet down smack onto the ground you yell out (speaks angry gibberish) (laura speaks angry gibberish) eight it rolled a one (group cheers) yeah nope we're picking up next week we'll say for the circumstance here you go ahead and spend a healing spell on him his wounds mend no effect on his catatonic state (group groans) well guys that's episode two of critical role (laughs) i hope you
