unless anybody else has anything else to interject i believe it's time for us to jump in to tonight's episode of critical role [click tv static] [groovy critical role theme] that is why that's a different place entirely you guys all bundled up into a singular room above the floor of the feed and mead found yourselves exhausted passed out and got an evening's rest so you've all gotten a long rest you've healed up you've recovered your abilities as the uncomfortable warmth of the morning kicks in with your small room and number of warm bodies encompassing a very tight and not very drafty space the partially humid early hours draw you from consciousness you all begin to stretch your sore muscles and decide what endeavors await you with the new day what do you guys want to do bryce had said if you wanted to continue to help with this then there was more money the door slams behind caleb briskly making his exit i know apparently you head downstairs to the only other real location within the feed and mead tavern there's crute still there off to the side and one very dirty and ashy civilian who is currently slowly scarfing a meal with a thousand yard stare looks like they had been close to the action and chaos the evening before as you walk down crute looks across and goes i see you're awake would you like breakfast laura and all right it'll be about an hour because it's just me it's just me come on the two of you jump in with crute in what is a not very well-kept kitchen but functional the gristle who knows how long it's been there it might add to the flavor who knows we'll put it at a b in panorama city you guys go ahead and help out it does manage to cut down the time for breakfast preparation eventually food is presented make a sleight of hand check you're too caught up in the meal-making neither does crute as you manage to do so swiftly practiced like you've done this before in many other establishments in the past maybe as you guys finish your breakfast the rest of the day is yours as you emerge from the tavern-- and caleb you've already seen this-- you see that the fires have now been reduced to maybe a dozen wide plumes of gray-white smoke on the eastern side of the city it rises from the ashes and charred wood remains and wood frames where some buildings used to be it seemed much more dangerous and chaotic last evening but looking at it now in the day it's no more than maybe a dozen buildings or so that were affected they were more centralized to cause the most chaos suddenly at that time of night you get the sense as soon as you look around that the folks of the city are on edge understandably so you see the people are trying to pick up their lives and move on in the face of what recently occurred the very air holds this tension as you look around you people walk past you with sacks of grain and tools their eyes wide darting around for unseen danger and glancing past the two tieflings immediately instinctually step back a bit and make a wide berth you watch children run from doorway to doorway trying to stay out of the street as long as possible it seems like it's trying to carry on but it's going to be a process some folks are rummaging through the remains of the respective buildings you glance over near where the central portion of your conflict last night took place where the candleglow tavern is and there you see amongst the smoldering rubble of the inn a single halfling man sifts through the wreckage a crownsguard helping him lift heavier beams you see as he plucks what he can of his former life from the rubble you have not met this person no you can see a halfling man maybe in his fifth decade or so he has ashy blond hair and a face cracked by smiling though now too dour and soot-covered to see any sort of smile on his face as he pulls through some of the rubble and he's making a small pile on the side he looks up and goes oh right can i help you i mean if you don't-- you don't have to okay okay as you dive in you spend the next ten minutes helping move through some of the heavier beams that collapsed there is still somewhat of a structure mainly of the bottom floor but a lot of the top floor the one that you were in last night has fallen in over time so it's moving some of the bigger beams out of the way as you're pulling through and moving some of the larger pieces of the structure the halfling man goes i appreciate the help name's thadeus thadeus candleglow it was 20 years since i was left this place built by my grandpaps reedus oh i was here when they all came in i was gone i wasn't about to stay around you know oh i did not i was in the process of cleaning dishes and dealing with a couple of my patrons one of them-- and he points over to the rubble you can see what looks to be a skeletal body that's been partially collapsed i suppose leiman's probably not going to be a regular anymore rebuilding requires something called money i think i'm probably going to gather what i can here and shop up north and see what other work i can get myself to i don't know a building establishment like this i'm not entirely certain but i could check in i assume it's probably a few thousand gold pieces for the structure that's really sweet oh this hasn't happened as long as i've been here and i've been here most of my life here in alfield you hear about these things wandering on the outside and you know crownsguard keeps you safe anything comes too close they just shoot them in the face with a bunch of arrows and shit they didn't take any of the worthwhile stuff thankfully he points over to a pile and you can see there's some brass urn or vase that's been smashed and dented by the conflict you can see bits and pieces of a few keepsakes that might be worth a little bit of money that have been brought out they just mainly took all of our food stores most of my meats most of my salted meats the dried meats the fresh meats the butchered meats they cleared out the butcher down the street that's a real curious-looking face you got there make a persuasion check but in halfling that helped yeah sorry what can i do quite a few you'd have to ask around some of the crownsguard i mean plenty of folks seem to get through this okay they only took down a few buildings i'm more worried about the folks that were plucked from their homes i haven't looked around to be perfectly honest i've been a little focused on-- and he gestures out with his hands at the rubble that was once his life well you have to present meat a lot of people around here eat meat if you're asking me then the best meat don't know about quantity but quality was-- (tongue click) well if at some point the gracious gods see fit to bequeath upon me a strike of good luck and i can get to rebuilding my friend one day you may be able to try one of my meats oh yeah burnt charred oh that's-- he steps out through where the doorframe is still standing the one that you defended yourself through most of that battle just a free-standing frame now he points over to a building across the way which is one of the buildings that was nearby he says that there's the ruddy top butcher well what remains of it and you can see that building too it's still standing and it's nowhere near as damaged as the candleglow inn but it's sustained quite a bit of damage and it looks like the roof has fallen in yeah if you're looking for farming supplies general supplies there's-- oh you could probably find something like that there the broad barn at one time it was a barn but the farm stopped giving up crop and so they converted the barn itself into what was a general store because they started selling off the tools they didn't need but that made them more money than the crops did that year so we started importing more tools and for the past 30 years the broad barn has been our commonly known general supply place there on the western side of alfield so if you want to-- of course well y'all look like you're geared up to be making a mess you going after these things he leans in real close to you getting on his tippy toes to meet your gaze and he says well if you manage to go and kill some of them dog people you tell them thadeus candleglow says hi thank you good i'm not a child but i appreciate the gesture gesture her name's gesture the adventurer formerly known as jester he takes a bite and (spitting) i don't think i have much of a choice at the moment he gives a long stare towards you that fades past a little bit beyond anyway i should get back to picking up the pieces excuse me and starts gathering more stuff from the rubble and the crownsguard behind goes over and takes the things he's already gathered and begins putting them into a small crate and doesn't engage i know seriously where are you guys off to you were told it was on the western edge of town and since most of the city is built on two intersections of main road you follow the core essential east to west path and on the way out where you first entered last night even though you just ran past it you can see there is indeed right on the edge of town almost like the town was built to fill the gap in between a very large barn that looks to have hundreds and hundreds of feet of coiled rope on the outside the front doors are wide open and you can see a number of folks are coming in and out many of them with cleaning supplies heavy pieces of cloth buckets whatever can be used to start getting rid of the remaining black splash and ashy covering of last night's destruction you also notice as you approach on the outside there's a bit of commotion you see a dozen or so crownsguard and a handful of armed volunteers that all appear to be in regular civvy farmer clothing that are all gathered in a loose huddle with bryce among them you hear a loud grating voice from within that huddle as you approach from the outskirts you see a middle-aged male gnome of ruddy complexion and slicked parted dark hair he wears very clean maroon and gold robes and that would lend an air of elegance were he not hopping around and pointing fingers you see as he starts shouting between the crew waving his hand around without any warning it was your job bryce with ruben cold dead that leaves no lawmaster to preside forcing me to take that position as well i do not need that added responsibility but until we get a new lawmaster instated from rexxentrum i have no choice bryce pipes up at this point glancing over and seeing you guys' presence starosta i've sent a request to both zadash and bladegarden for a supplementary force but it may be weeks before any would arrive can we send trained hands at my approval to retaliate at which point the starosta which has now been identified says we cannot spare any of our forces while the surviving guard are drawn so thin out of the question maintain a vigilant perimeter and deflect any further incursions bryce nods slowly can we at least have permission to hire mercenary strength to retaliate then i feel not being proactive before the gnoll force can fully regroup would put us at a severe disadvant-- at which point is cut off by the starosta yes that's fine hire outside i don't want any more of my citizens' deaths on my record dismissed he immediately pushes through the crownsguard and storms off which is hilarious to watch a gnome storm out of a group of people and off with a huff is escorted by three crownsguard from behind out of that space the crowd begins to murmur and disperse and go about their business bryce turns and smiles at all of you they've washed up from last night's damage and dirty conflict so as they approach-- i'm deeply sorry about that starosta kosh is high-strung on a holiday and tensions have never been this high since he was assigned here eight years ago so please don't take that to heart he's just a-- your words not mine no those in higher political positions rarely do it seems anyway i want to thank you all again for your aid last night i can't fathom the further death toll had you not been there and jumped in selflessly as you did thank you bryce trails off and looks back towards where starosta kosh had stormed off and goes fucking dwendalian political bullshit we've needed a more trained guard here for weeks especially with xhorhas bleeding into the valley but we're far too south to matter any request has been declined due to all necessary forces being needed at the garrisons by brokenveil if they were doing their jobs at the bluffs we wouldn't have so many reports of violent beasts in the valley in the first place but here we are at least i've gotten approval for a bit more cash to that while i do not know what your business here is in alfield if you are still interested we are in need of some skilled mercenary work well until at least this threat has been dealt with in a satisfactory way i've unfortunately not had my scouts return after they were sent the night before which does not bode well but i suspect that we should see some sort of hopeful backup sent by zadash or bladegarden within the next week or two in the meantime we're a bit of a sitting duck scenario so i've sent a few guards to go to zadash to see what other mercenaries could be sent forward we do have some folks traveling along the road and will keep an eye out to see if anybody else is looking for some coin but for now you are our first line of defense or offense if you will oh there are plenty of threats let's see famine syphilis-- you're not wrong this backwards place has its fair share of issues as i've come to learn as being not from the region but it seems to me that nothing on this scale has quite assaulted in some time i mean there have been wandering rumors of terrible things and creatures wandering past the xhorhas border for as long as the dwendalian empire has been around it's the whole reason that the garrison's up north but this far south generally the guard can keep things at bay this is a very organized thing i don't like it i don't like it at all well this is new nothing on this scale i've done a bit of research overnight and it seems that gnolls are known to be very aggressively hungry creatures could say famished to the point of obsession the deal stands 30 gold per gnoll ear proof of a dead gnoll if you can recover any of the missing townsfolk here in alfield and bring them back safely i'd be willing to pay 25 gold a head returned there is because even if they are gone we would wish to bury those we've lost i could probably muster ten gold per retrieved member of the alfield citizenry preferably all of them whatever you can find seeing what these creatures did last night i don't know what state you'll find any of them but i'm being hopeful they seemed to be heading east to a northeast direction that's where the scouts went before they left i wish i had more information for you but that may be the place to start there are some spotty woods on the outskirts of the town that alfield was built into beyond that it's rolling hills and fields there are some older long grown-over settlements that have been abandoned small-scale but honestly beyond here it's mainly fields if i might offer some advice if you do see a ghost don't engage my dear there are ghosts everywhere in this world it's far more ancient than you assume i don't know as to why but it's not uncommon from what i could ascertain whatever dark powers they worship it seems allows some to progress beyond death rumors are that when gnolls go hungry and left to feed on each other what remains rises to fight alongside those that still live honestly i just shared with you most of all that i had learned the only other bit of information i was able to pull from that was they have this thing this entity that they worship it has a name pulls out a few small notes as you're saying this they pull a small series of notes from their pocket yeenoghu let that be a lesson young halfling i don't know how to pronounce it i only read it i apologize make a religion check with advantage it sparks a memory in you information floods your mind and you recall hearing about various demonic leaders of the abyss creatures that once walked the prime plane you see images of this large bestial feral angry demon ever-hungering ever wandering to conquer and devour in its wake leaving destruction fetid meat and waves of yipping angry hyenas to devour what was left behind of course it's not so much about that more than these aren't well-to-do people in their own right and right now honestly rebuilding-- that's all right but you as i know quite well from personal experience have some coin to your name perhaps that will be of aid to you as far as i could tell whatever living things they can get their hands on probably i will say if there are any surviving captives then haste is very much key for if they are as hungry as they seem regardless of the massive volume they have acquired through the evening i know not how many their number is or how hungry they are take too long there may not be much left to find right yes the valley aurochs no this was far enough west it was mainly just a few buildings in the eastern side coming from where the woods were it seemed like they were using cover of tree and canopy upon the incursion then immediately assaulted partway into the eastern part of the city burned it from the middle and then used the flames to escape out the back what were you about to say yes are you all right i could ask around it does happen on occasion if you'll excuse me i do have something to get to but good luck and godspeed i'll do my best bryce turns around and leaves make an intelligence check the robe coloring is what caught you and the hair the specific slicked and parted comb you have seen this individual before you were younger maybe eight or so years ago eight or nine years what does this incense come from oh so it's part of an adventuring pack then it would be negligible by comparison i'd say maybe at most five silver's worth at most well there's a lot of parts to-- i think both of you do that as you both separate as you walk into broad barn there are five other individuals that are coming through and picking up thick cloth for cleaning one person is picking up a few different burn balm kits on the far end as they're checking out there is an extremely old gentleman with this giant gnarled tuft of a chin beard that merges with this halo like a lion's mane of white hair he has this really thin long crooked nose almost like engywook from neverending story but no glasses he's trying to keep a smile in the rather dark faces of the people that are coming in with the evening's events coming around as you guys walk in and approach he glances down and goes well if y'all need something y'all just let me know y'all want pickles he leans back and rummages through what sounds like a small paper bag there's a small glass mason jar with two pickles and he goes i'm willing to part with these here pickles no it's pickles it looks like he may have just pulled it out of his lunch i could part with them for around three copper he takes the copper from you he takes the copper from you slides forward the pickles and goes (laughs) good deal don't do that that is not conducive to a lengthy lifetime you want incense that's fancy it's really fancy them incense that's why i'm curious i got incense what kind of establishment do you take me for touché he wanders away from there and gathers any semblance of anything that could be considered incense to some degree it's a massive volume it's-- when he said quality over quantity this is definitely a quantity circumstance two big burlap sacks filled with all sorts of fine ground herbs and things that could amount to-- go for it no that'll be insight an elf he seems to be doing the best he can deal at this point there's three other people in the store and they're slowly filtering out it seems that most everything they have here-- a lot of them are basic farming supplies there are a few metallic joints that could be used for when you're tapping a keg they have some keg taps there they have-- oh my god (slamming) i appreciate your patronage that's pretty weird i'm going to say there sir i mean you look pretty weird that's a pretty weird request no we do not carry poisons we have insecticides for about a vial that big a silver probably have some real serious shits for a few days yeah you do it's a very diluted form of acute poison to the point where it wouldn't actually affect any larger creature but if put in a large batch of water used to spray down crops certain insects-- what are they called again i forget-- aphids things like that would die off yeah in a very anarchist cookbook kind of way he doesn't sell you acid but there are the materials available where you could create it how many vials' worth are you looking for just one this will run you about 12 gold he looks around i'm afraid we're clear out bit of a--  lot of things sorry my apologies it's a good pickle (groans) marisha and brine drinkers ugh stop it we're not really purveyors of healing potions and those that have are usually held by the crownsguard you actually asked the night before and bryce had said that they're currently being used to tend to the people that were in really bad places it's hard to walk through a war zone and be like hey guys do you have supplies yes very stale you can't tell if the sour smell is intentional flavor or just time taking its toll it'll be tart one way or the other over time you will they're scattered a bit thin and a lot of them are currently focused on either perimeter watch in case they come back or helping out those that need help inside the city within ten minutes of wandering through the city as you guys have gathered yourselves and begun heading towards the eastern side you see a crownsguard who is currently walking by with some washrags under one arm and a little streak of dried blood down the side of their face looks to be a young man probably in his mid-20s or so longish hair that's been heavily braided on the sides and then pinned to the back in a tuft of a ponytail yes we're not allowed to give out any crownsguard supplies if you're looking for a steed you'd probably have to go to the on the wind stables they're going to be your best bet right-- and points over towards the northern side of the town it's one of the buildings that's taken a little bit of fire damage it's not-- make a deception check look i mean no offense whatsoever and if-- i can go find bryce and see if we-- the watchmaster would be much more suited to-- reggie did not make that dc check reggie glances over at you he goes let me see what i can do and quickly makes his way northward to the outside of the stables about five minutes pass and you can hear the clopping of hooves as reggie comes back with a very obstinate beast on the reins dragging it towards you slowly guiding it reggie doesn't seem to be a very trained individual when it comes to handling creatures especially beasts of burden will this do hands you the reins best i could do good luck thank you thank you thank you just bring it back-- it's on loan it's on loan okay easy enough to find you placed it at a hitching post with a little bit of feed over the evening your cart and horse are safe and at your disposal they were wearing cobbled-together or scavenged bits of leather and hide armors it seemed like most of them would have had some means of disposing of their excrement they weren't very well-dressed okay while you are sending frumpkin to keep a watch you are keeping an eye out for tracks make a survival check please very quickly you come upon a number of gnoll footprints in the ground seem to be multiple cart tracks that was the one that you saw there were multiple carts with that roll i'd say you surmise somewhere in the neighborhood of about 18 or so gnolls from what you can gather on the tracks that you found you can attempt to glean information for the specific-- sure go ahead and make a survival check to see if you can even find those tracks well technically you're tracking undead so you get advantage on this one same degree you find the tracks you see there is the remnants of this gnoll horde returning towards a similar direction you find three sets of cart tracks they all converge into one path they head through the relatively thin woods that surround the northeastern side of alfield as you progress on that path out to the other side of the woods continue into the northeastern fields where the rolling hills begin these hills seem to go on for miles go ahead and make a perception check no no it's tall grass across the hills-- the grass can vary anywhere from knee-high to chest-high in places the hills towards the top can get a little more rocky there are patches where the grass doesn't grow as well and there's open dirt and broken shale after about an hour or so of tracking in that direction you come upon the rillway road which is the main road that heads up towards felderwin you can see it a little ways off the undead tracks are falling in line with her tracking they're moving as a group but there are far less undead tracks than there are regular gnolls so as best you can to keep tabs on it you'd be leading if she hadn't made an equally good roll so now both of you are leading this vibrant green for the most part the wind is picking up a little bit and you can see especially when you start coming up over some of the bigger hills you can see the waves cresting over the hillside and causing the shift of it it's a very beautiful space at this point now you've been travelling we'll say an hour and a half it's getting close to noon yes i know anyway don't think i'm not tempted you're pretty much in the middle of an open field but the tracks you can see-- because you can see the rillway road south of you and the tracks begin to shift further north as they were heading back they were keeping off the road best they can as well you also do notice that within the tracks you do find bits of grass that are spattered with drying blood you don't know how fresh it is go ahead and make a perception check perception as you're having this conversation with fjord you're just not paying attention to the road in front of you no it's about as tall as the cart at times at times it's lower you guys do stand out amongst the grass as you head over the hills or down below you are above the grass line without an issue yeah it's about up to your chest at times waist to chest it varies yeah if you wanted what could possibly go wrong i'll allow it go ahead and make a perception check jester make a strength check just a check right as your eyes catch something you drop for a second but beau's beneath you (groans) just barely holding you the elbows start to buckle a bit but rallies and (groans) holds you up above you flatten your back out and give a graceful pose as you look ahead as you guys are coming up over a hill you get a good view down and you can see between the tall grass and the high weeds that are beginning to cluster this vicinity there is a series of large hills that all break down into this valley where the grass just ends in this area it looks like it's barren rock and dirt you notice with that perception check a few carts a few broken boxes some tables or contraptions there's some semblance of civilization here amongst these hills off the road she drops you they appear to be empty okay how much do you drink okay good to know perception check for frumpkin 13 good to know it's true i feel like i passed a stone all right what's the plan guys smealth mm-hmm all right what are you guys doing with the cart and the horses okay not that big the hills themselves are-- it's just large rolling hills in this whole valley area okay you have to back up a bit to get it out of view having placed the cart where what you assume is the best you can hide it who is helming the hiding of the cart go ahead and make a survival check all right if you're aiding then do it with advantage okay i mean sure what is the marching order all right what's the order of the line then all right we have molly nott caleb jester beau then fjord okay i would like you all to make a stealth check please as you make your way through the grass as you guys stay low to the grass pushing through with your hands carefully as you go hearing the wind occasionally rise and fall with a distant (shh) the various waves of grass beating against itself you come upon where the grass begins to fall off you stay low as best you can before the grass itself comes to an end right on the outskirts of where the central area between these hills begins there as you poke your head through you can see three carts that are scattered a bit amongst a mineshaft yard the exterior of a mine you can see large wooden pan tables some pickaxes that are leaning against the side the remnants of some lanterns that have rusted there are the three carts the carts themselves are spattered with blood you notice three creatures similar to the gnolls that you saw the night before but smaller and dog-like these are just basic hyenas that are gathered around and are licking the blood that's soaked into the wood one of them ends up finding a piece of meat or something that was hanging from one side and tears it off another one comes over (whines) and bites onto it and they begin tearing and fighting over it before one of them pushes the other over and it (yelps) it goes back and begins licking the blood off the side of the wood these three hyenas are just scavenging on the outskirt of these carts not from what you can tell from this distance you can't see any entrances about 50 or so feet 60 feet quietly this plump wounded with a hint of pink to the fur around the arm where it looks like it may have been bleeding a bit begins to hobble its way silently out of the grass just beyond the edge you guys are still hidden you initiate the rite and as you do the blade begins to give a faint radiant glow a whitish-yellow light that you will almost instinctually hold low in the grass to make sure you don't become a beacon amongst your hiding you watch as one of the hyenas (sniffing) and begins making its way the others look over (snarl)-- they begin to gather up and the three almost go into this pack swoop formation in the direction of the rabbit closing in 40 feet 30 feet 20 feet with a rapid bolt one of them runs forward and leaps out towards the rabbit and skids into the dirt past it right to the front of the grassline where you are beau okay and who is doing what else the three of you rush out and attack three individual ones what are you guys doing all right beau go ahead and attack first ten you go to swing and as it sees you suddenly it backs away and your staff hits the dirt right next to it (snarls) it just barely misses it caleb you following up go for it roll your attack roll for the fire bolt right okay wait you're going for the one that jester is attacking okay go for it 21 hits go ahead and roll damage one point of damage it begins to burn this small circular image on the hyena's body (yelping) go ahead and-- with a natural one he does not that's enough with the blast of the fire bolt and the incineration of the sacred flame you watch as that hyena bursts into fire and flops to the ground while it burns smouldering its flesh becoming the meals it had previously feasted upon molly and nott that hits go ahead and roll damage the first strike just completely cleaves it in half like its momentum running almost like it hits the blade and you hold it out and the momentum just carries it over seamlessly carving through it you can have movement to close it there's one right in front of beau so you're a little ways away but you can close the gap while nott and-- yep nine nine again sam and at first it hits the dirt and it backs up you move out with your heel to go ahead and swing and it actually ducks underneath and tries to snap at your heel as molly closes the gap and-- all right all right go ahead and roll damage with sneak attack yeah molly as you rush up you watch as a bolt just goes right through the side of the hyena's head and it just falls lifeless to the ground all three of them out in a split second yeah thankfully it was a clean enough shot didn't seem to get caught or shatter against any of the bones perception check glancing about the vicinity does not look like anything else is moving or near or has noticed your presence okay like a massive shotput you watch as tiny jester with a double spin each chucks these relatively heavy beasts deep into the grass field where they vanish with a heavy thud into the field bunny appears to no longer be around you don't see an entrance to the mine you just see mining equipment you see pieces of equipment and the interior of this hill valley this short little valley seems to have been prepped for some sort of mining expedition you don't see one at the moment okay you look in the carts and they are empty you see a few wayward pieces of cloth everything in there is bloodied and caked and has streaks of it being licked up it looks like the hyenas had been at it for a while trying to clear off what was left behind from wherever the bodies that were within were taken i would like you both to make investigation checks please and you're following the tracks make a survival check because there are undead as a part of this i will let you it looks like the dust and the dirt in this vicinity has been freshly swept or dispersed intentionally meaning that once this little valley had been entered and the carts had been emptied something was smart enough to intentionally cover their tracks you however-- you rolled a 20 you said as you begin to look about the base of the closest hill facing away from where you guys had entered in an eastern direction you see a pattern of grasses that seem to be interwoven as opposed to a natural pattern there is a consistent mesh to the way they've been laid as you glance over you can see a net of grasses that has been woven and thrown over leaving a small gap on the edge where you can see the dark exterior of what was a mine shaft structure entrance it's about 12 foot by 12 foot it's pretty thick well it's thrown on and put against the grass it doesn't have sticks in its sides no it's laid on the side of the hill the scavenger levels man all righty it is too big for you to carry with you but it can definitely be taken with you should you exit all right as you pull it back you do see the wooden support structure of the interior of a mine shaft as soon as you pull it back and look inside it looks like a barricade has been partially placed up on each side you see piles of broken furniture stools and chairs that are shattered and jammed into each other to form some sort of a barricade on each side you can see dry-rotted pickaxe handles and other pieces of general wooden beams used for construction that are all pushed up against the sides with a small path maybe about three feet wide that you could walk through to enter it looks pitch black on the inside there is no light source outside of what little bit of daylight is coming through from the entrance there is a way there's about a two three foot gap between this barricade where it made its way in and once you enter through you can now see since there has not been dust put there is a definitive trail of blood that has dragged through and caked in the loose dirt and dust okay you are now officially intoxicated yep for the next hour no yeah there's no light in there about 25 feet in go ahead and make a perception check 21 what faint light is coming in from the interior-- are you looking through yeah as soon as you come inside about 40 feet in the shaft widens into a common area you see a handful of tables some chairs similar to what was placed within the barricade some sacks strewn about some torn open and scattered across the ground some that are still lobbed in the corner this is just a very high perception roll with what little light is making its way in there and that's where it goes dark and there's a (thud) as frumpkin hits a sloping ceiling no just hits the ground hits the ground stunned not in that main area not with what little bit frumpkin saw with a quick glance before it got too dark and then he hit the ceiling okay you move past the barricades heading towards the shaft-- the barricade there's a lot of stuff jammed up here at the front almost like it was barricaded from the inside long ago and then was cleared out partially going through you make it through the 35 or so feet of the shaft in towards where it opens up and you almost trip because your toe catches something and you catch yourself and you look down to see a long piece of rope that was stretched across that just got tugged and falls slack you hear a (creak) and with your darkvision glance up and see what appears to be a large log that had been affixed to the ceiling (whoosh) comes rushing towards you make a dexterity saving throw dex saving throw yeah with disadvantage you even in your somewhat hazy drunken stupor see it just in time and back up as it (whoosh) right past your nose and slams into the wall to the left of you it hits and you see the dust settle from the ceiling you guys all hear this (slamming) from the inside it is actually it opens up to be about 35 feet across from side to side about 45 or 50 towards the end and then it seems to descend into two different pathways make a perception check at the moment no but as you're glancing about you can see that there are bags of supplies that are partially sundered and torn open you can see tools some that look pretty interesting there's a crowbar on the ground across the way there's other sacks that haven't been spoiled yet you see some of the burlap is dry rotted and pulls right apart and it looks like there might be some useful things in this chamber make an investigation check with disadvantage you glance through and find a bunch of mildewed rice grain right as you hear a (snort) you glance over and from the right chamber you see as two gnolls have appeared in the entranceway and have entered up called from the sound of the heavy impacting thud on the wall but a few moments ago they both-- no he's not she is not sorry they both arrive to the top of the-- (sniffing and growling) they both grab their spears what are you doing as they're both right there rushing towards you you say this and you're going to pull out and fire at one the one to the right or the left the one that first spotted you would be the one on the left so as it's rushing towards you go ahead and fire 18 hits go ahead and roll damage eight points of damage not-- okay 11 points of damage it hurts but it's still rushing forward they both begin to rush in to close the gap the rest of you guys rush in to get to him it will take the full round to get there you guys use your movement and dash in those of you who don't have darkvision you can't see anything a faint bit of light at this point any of you with ranged abilities right now would be able to strike but before you do two of the gnolls rush in and are attempting to attack the small goblinoid female who has walked into their lair the first strike that is going to be a 21 to hit that is six points of piercing damage as the spear jams into your shoulder and scrapes down the front of your chest glances off the rest of your armor and it hurts but you're fine you're still feeling a little fuzzy anyway the other one attacks that is going to be a 15 to hit no this one you do see coming and you dodge out of the way but they're both right up in your face right now snarling and (growling) with that the guys who have ranged attacks go for it yes so you guys have disadvantage on any of your attacks rolls because you cannot see you are blind in the chamber for this round because there's just two gnolls at the moment i'm just going through actions here to keep going okay so the one that's closest to you will be the one that already took damage from the bolt so roll for attack for the guiding bolt 21 hits roll damage ten points the one that's now taken a crossbow bolt to the throat and has taken a guiding bolt this giant blast of light explodes around this gnoll as it yelps and it encompasses its torso with this glittering light now the next attack against it has advantage it is super hurt but still standing you're making your attack you were attacking the other one so you do not get the benefit still hits go ahead and roll damage on that one what are you using it's a d10 for damage that's a d12 nine points of damage on that one it gets blasted by the bolt of eldritch energy however it's still snarling currently they're both looking over at the sudden surge of newcomers okay what does that do they rolled an eight minus-- yeah it does not make the save got it great all right the room fills with light at this point the chamber fills you can now see the scenery around you nott you're up first since you're the first one to get a shot there's one that's super hurt and one that's kind of hurt correct nott they're both right up in your face snarling okay so go ahead and make your melee spell attack i believe it is right 19 hits seven it is as you reach up and grab it with your hand you watch as a burst of electrical arcane energy surges through its body you watch as veins pop up its torso to its neck before it collapses into the ground you have to duck out of the way before it slams it would have crushed you if you'd stayed in the space you were but you sidestep in time as the gnoll falls to the ground lifeless yeah okay on the other side as you're doing that the gnoll that's right there sees you rushing off but now it's more attentive to the one who blasted it there i'd say for the sake of distance since the moment you saw you fired it probably couldn't close the gap so it's going to drop the spear pull out its longbow and take a shot at you from here it's going to be a 14 to hit what's your armor class 14 all right not a great roll you take four points of piercing damage it catches you right in the middle of the sternum the armor takes the brunt of it and it mostly just snaps at the impact but it hurt it'll bruise that ends the remaining gnoll's turn next up would be beau there's one you can close the gap with there's only one that's currently standing in the room the other one's been killed it was shocked to death by nott go for it 19 hits go ahead and roll damage ten points of damage that's enough to do it it had already been damaged previously by fjord's eldritch blast and you watch as it snarls and pulls out its bow pulls back notches and releases the arrow moments after it's released with a quick burst of action you saunter up to its side and hit it across the torso with the stick you feel seven different ribs break as it doubles forward as it looks at you for a second you take where the staff has broken in and jam upward to where its lungs would be and it (chokes) and falls to the ground dead you guys take a moment here-- yeah as nott's saying this your eyes wander off of her over to the right where you see this heavy tree covered in jagged bark that's (creaking) okay there are two shafts both seem to descend both curving off in opposite directions they both have the wooden frame for support looking around it looks like this was a common area this is the closest chamber to the exterior of the mine it looks like there were a number of tables here that a lot of them have been knocked over and broken a lot of what would have filled this chamber has been pushed into the barricade you saw up front you're helming the investigation go ahead and make an investigation check you guys are looking down the shafts they're looking in the sacks both of the shafts just descend and curve out of view they go to a steady 45-degree decline you're too drunk to help you're looking as well sure take advantage then 11 okay you glance around you find there's an untapped ale barrel there's an untapped water barrel there's a hooded lantern that still has a functional bit of oil in it though it's only about half-full and very rusted over but you clear off the glass on the outside and it'll work fine you find a sledgehammer that the handle is not so rotted to the point where it wouldn't be functional but a fair sledgehammer if you wanted to break any rock or stone the crowbar that you had seen earlier that can be acquired you find a small lightweight rod about that long that has a short piece of waxed twine hanging from one end no it's not metal it feels almost like a hard clay with a waxed piece of twine on one end you had as good a chance as anybody to have come across this so if you want to make an intelligence check you haven't come across one of these no they're big heavy filled things you make an intelligence check ten okay once it's ignited and the oil's lit yeah you can open and close the hood nott you're an alchemist yeah as you're looking over it it's not beautifully made it looks functional like a lot of the tools here there isn't a lot of presentation more than function as what you bring into a mine yeah you take the rod and smell it and a familiar scent hits your nose you've worked in your alchemical time with small-level explosives as part of the elements of the alchemist's fire there is a reagent catalyst that when the chemicals mix it causes a minor explosion and then burns heavily there is an element of that but it's very very strong and a very intense scent to it as soon as you smell it it brings back memories of accidents that have happened in the past on a very small scale you immediately get this wave of cold shiver down your neck that this is a very dangerous object if used improperly yeah you can sling it in with your-- there are two paths yes okay so make a stealth check first well with advantage but then disadvantage from the drunk so it's just a straight roll yes okay good to know then you're going to check for traps make an investigation check with disadvantage dexterity-based and intelligence-based checks okay okay and which path is this you're checking you don't sense any draft the air is pretty stagnant actually seems to be on the left path you do not notice any traps anything akin to what you stumbled across as you entered it does seem to descend and curve out of the way but begin to snake a bit you get about 15 to 20 feet down before it begins to rapidly curve left and right it's only about ten feet wide you can continue if you want they both seem fairly equal you've been keeping tabs on footfalls in here there's traffic both ways make a stealth check please disadvantage oh it's straight roll because-- all right and investigation check with disadvantage with disadvantage you begin to curve down the right path and there is a slight depression on one side that you glance over and look and it looks like some of the burlap that had been torn from the sacks earlier in the tunnel had been used to cover a three and a half foot wide pit that has been laced over to hide its presence yeah it's affixed with a couple of rocks in the sides it's very light and would have fallen through it only covers part of the path the tunnel is about ten feet wide and the right side of it is where that pitfall is you notice it and go oh hmm this one does not snake this one continues in a continual curve for another 40 or so feet before you're starting to get a little far from your friends you can continue if you want it looks like it's going in a downward spiral great album as you all slowly begin to descend down the right path we'll come to that in just a second we're going to go ahead and take a break since it's a little past nine we'll be back here in a few minutes to pick up the descent further into this mineshaft laura and before we get to that however we do have a giveaway from our friends at wyrmwood as you saw last week we have another of their black walnut two of their adventurer arsenals to give away again this week if you haven't seen they're awesome well-made and if you open it up on the inside it has space for you dice for your pen a place for a mini or eraser or anything else you want to carry into your game it fits into the dice box that comes with it as well we're giving away two of these during the break to enter this while we're gone at the break you can go into the twitch chat and enter when you're prompted the code word gnoll that's g-n-o-l-l do not enter it more than once or you'll be disqualified and we'll come back from the break with two winners to this thank you so much we'll see you guys here in a minute [break] congratulations to the two of you guys danoba will reach out to you and get your contact information and we'll get those sent to you asap so well done yes all right you chose the right or the left again sam and the right okay down the path the shaft winds for about another 150 or so feet before it slowly levels out into a long chamber of multiple levels what once looked like a solid mining vein is now strewn with bones and flayed skin pinned to the rock walls with scavenged nails blood spattered across them with intent painted a jagged smile of sharp teeth on each of these four hides a faint source of light in the center flickers a small stone altar holding a cluster of candles in the central level platform it looks like about six gnoll-like figures have gathered around this stone-- i know we're going to get to that in just a second while a strange seventh figure places small wet stones upon this altar smaller than the other gnolls let's get a perception check real fast from two of you who's leading the-- we'll say since you two would be in the front then for that you jumped up first perception check both of you okay so you don't see much of the figure also right now i'll have you guys all do a stealth check please as you make your way down okay this figure looks gnoll-like you see the ears and the snout but as it reaches down and picks up these wet stones and places them in the altar giving small dark muffled barks and yipping sounds you see elements that look like smooth human flesh the more that you focus in you can see this looks to be a humanoid figure that is wearing pieces of hollowed-out gnoll-like armor a hood missing a jaw that's placed over the top of the head sections of arms worn like a glove with the hand missing sifted through it seems that a lot of the body parts are discolored and rotting a bit from what you can see from the candle light that's flickering across it long bonelike spines similar to what adorned the armor of that pack lord that you battled in the middle of the city last night are also affixed to the outsides and pierced through elements of the shoulders and head of this flesh gnoll hide that it's wearing as it growls mimicking the sounds of the gnolls that it seems to be residing along the other gnolls around look pacing from foot to foot impatiently (growls and grunts) begins to speak louder and louder at this altar as it places a final wet stone on it all the remaining gnolls begin to bark in unison together (bark and howl) they all at once leap onto the altar and begin tearing into the stones which are not stones they were glistening at this point you see hearts that are now being torn and swallowed by the gnolls at the altar they finish devouring the hearts and the humanoid figure begins to bark a few more times and then in broken common says the hunger will be fed ours and hers come and points to two of them help me carry more meat below the rest stay feast on what remains turns around and you now look across the way on the other side of the chamber darkened you see a gnoll leaning in familiar armor the one that you had battled and had left with the carts is watching from the far end of the chamber down on the lower third-level platform the weird gnoll priest i guess you could say at this point that's been helming this little ritual goes and joins the armored gnolls and steps aside and follows second and the two gnolls that were assigned by it leave as well leaving four in there in the chamber currently no the armored one leaves with the priest the candle altar yeah it's not an extremely bright light but for those of you who are human it's enough where you can make out shapes once your eyes have adjusted to the low light interior you watch as they begin to grab the bodies on the ground you can see there are now-- the grinding of bones as they drag broken corpses across the floor and begin to tear into the torsos (barking) you watch as four hyenas fill into the space where the gnolls are and begin to sit at bay waiting for the gnolls to finish feasting one of them gets close and the gnoll just grabs its head and shoves it against the wall and it snaps into the wall and then backs up and then waits its turn you can see the other hyenas that exist in this space naturally scavengers have to wait being at the lowest of the totem pole four gnolls four hyenas it didn't seem to be too much more to just keep it away from the meal if you're planning to engage should i show you the layout of where they're placed so here we have-- they all tend to carry a bow on their backs you can see now the hyenas that are waiting patiently this one got knocked into the wall they're scooting at the sides waiting for them to finish their meals you guys are right up here where the shaft opens glancing down into this chamber that was where the priest and the other gnolls had exited you guys are up on here which for the purposes of-- it's fine correct it looks like it was a stalactite that then was reinforced as a column to help maintain the structure a fifth gnoll begins to wander its way into the chamber it goes over and kicks one of the hyenas off to the side it sits there (snuffling and whining) yeah this tunnel is a ten-foot wide tunnel that continues backward if you wanted to turning you backward here there's this path here we could continue the tunnel back this way the farthest gnoll there about 60 or so feet you may which as a note to remind you from last time-- correct yeah so keep that in mind right here roll a stealth check do you still have the gift oh yeah at a closer glance you look and see one of them currently is holding a pair of legs that are no longer attached to a torso and is stripping the flesh from the thigh and leg tearing into it takes a piece and chucks it off to the side and the two hyenas fight over it another one back there you can see is clutching a scapula the back of a shoulder blade and is breaking the bones in half and sucking the marrow out at a quick glance you get the sense that some of these may have been denizens of alfield as of 24 hours ago the gnolls most of them have a longbow slung over their shoulder and have a spear that dangles off to the side or has been jammed in the ground next to them duplicity or are you doing mirror image the spell the one that breaks and sucks the marrow out of one of the large shoulder blade areas takes and grinds the teeth against it scooping out whatever's inside then throws that piece onto the ground next to it then takes the arm and begins to splinter the middle of the arm bone and try to get the marrow out of that does your spell have concentration you are concentrating on a spell at the moment beau you quickly leap and land with no sound catlike reflexes your foot does slide for a second as you glance down and where you stepped in it looks like there's a bit of leftover pieces of people okay it slowly lifts and one of the other gnolls that's eating (splat) (growling) and the other one goes (yipping) and they go back to eating what is it what are you using that spell is not concentration right okay as soon as frumpkin begins doing that you watch as the one that's nearest on this side the one that had dropped the arm piece earlier takes the bow off its back and begins to notch an arrow looking around it's going to take a shot at the bird fluttering through that is a 17 what's frumpkin's-- six points of piercing damage the bird goes (thud) on the ground and then dissipates you watch as the four hyenas suddenly rush in towards where the bird had fallen and they all go to the spot where it landed and find an arrow lying there and (snarling and yipping) the range on that is-- you're placing it where right there all right which one okay go ahead and roll a spell attack nice roll damage on that that definitely hits same dude that is a 15 that would have been his dexterity saving throw right yeah then no damage okay that ends your turn everyone else gets one action and then we roll initiative sure you won't get to hide though but you're there you're standing next to a barrel all righty who's up next fjord what you got you can pick one all of the gnolls in here look like regular gnolls what are you doing yep it appears into your space in a burst of dull greenish-blue fire and there you see it dripping with salt water across its blade you may that one is now hexed you watch as the gore that's been dripping from the front of its body seems to roll up its torso in reverse before it slips into its armor and grasps itself the darkened shadowed gore now holding it in place as the hex curse you may that hits plus 1d6 15 points of damage (explosion) that one immediately drops what it was eating as the blast slams into it as it's confused by the wrapping of the hex as it reels and almost stumbles onto its back its foot crushes one of the nearby skulls and there you see this gaping wound in its chest where the armor's been sundered there's a smoking plume of blackened horrible shaded smoke pouring from it that's as far as you can there beau that's 20 there you hear hundreds of tiny metal clangs in succession as ball bearings begin to spray down the stairs and scattering across the floor of this central makeshift ritual room as they run through the semblances of gore and the areas of the stonework that are exposed between you have spent your action scattering nice as soon as you empty those out you get back and go into your defensive position preparing for any sort of assault caleb the ball bearings in this moment are now clattering down into the ground he did yes roll for an attack that hits just barely seven points of damage the one that you had hexed suddenly goes up into flames with a (dying scream) and falls back onto the ground you are just there as the flash of red light arcs from his finger and lights up the path before it impacts and kills the gnoll caleb then steps back into the shadows trying to get out of the way nott yes but that technically did not initiate into a combat it just bothered one of them a temporary inconvenience go for it 23 hits roll damage nine plus your sneak attack because you were stealthed that one (explosion) the bolt goes through the center of his forehead and embeds itself right up to the very back you watch as it (dying scream) and falls into the ground over one of the piled corpse pieces it was tearing through becoming one with its meal and then okay make a hide check to try and disappear back there stealth on that one okay you did your thing molly you can get right into the similar space as nott there i would say barely it rolled a natural one on its saving throw good to know now everyone please roll initiative it's technically a dexterity ability check so it would be disadvantage yeah 25 to 20 fjord what did you get sorry so who else rolled a natural 20 right yeah but don't you have advantage with-- just on stealth checks that's right so molly's up first that's a fun little initiative tracker thing from our friends at axe & shield see how it helps out there 23 20 to 15 marisha and the gnolls rolled a natural 18 plus one so they're at 19 gnolls are next both of you guys are at 17 15 to ten jester got 13 ten to five they hyenas are before nott then we have nott then we have fjord molly you're at the top of the round gets the idea across the special hyena what you got molly hold your position all right natural 20 on the saving throw unfortunately sorry all right that's your turn all right the gnolls are up first these two here are going to pull out their bow and begin to fire at beau since you had been the first to appear at this point and gather their attention they both have disadvantage on the attacks that is going to be an 11 the other is two 14s in a row so it would be 18 to hit 17 to hit sorry yeah all right that would be-- yep that's going to be ten points of piercing damage to you well it's a ki point to throw it back you catch it in mid-air and reduce it to no damage as you do that the one in the bottom of the ground who is closest to you grabs its spear off the side of the wall (growling) runs up the stairs that's what i'm-- rolling its dexterity check to see if it can do so it does succeed it's a 15 it slips but it manages to make its way up the stairs coming into combat with both fjord and beau he's going to go ahead and reach out at you with that it's going to be a 16 16 misses after you drop the arrow it comes up and you parry this one off to the side and go back into your defensive stance that ends both of those's go there now comes to caleb all right go for it roll for attack it strikes part of the stone altar splintering candle wax and pieces of remnant heart chunks but no impact unfortunately on the actual gnoll you going to stay where you are right so beau you want to go with your action now go for it as you swing the bo back trying to crack him in the head it actually slips on one of the ball bearings you had left and as it manages to catch itself it falls out of range of your sweep of the bo you're like shit all right go for the attack you slip on one of your own ball bearings on the second strike and manage to catch yourself by grabbing the fur on the outside of the gnoll and using its body to right yourself and then ugh it's a little slick and sticky all right jester you're up that are standing this one has been hurt a little bit 16 hits plus five hits even more nine points of force damage as the lollipop hits it in the back of the skull and it leans forward and grabs the back of its skull with this pounding throbbing pain in its head all righty so what does it have to roll okay and the range of that one is so that rolls a nine plus zero nine just a little bell you watch as a little bit of blood comes out the side one of the hyena's ears so the spiral kind gotcha are you going to move at all or are you going to stay where you are okay that ends your turn there you go there is a whole dance number over there of multiple jesters the hyenas go now does succeed on his dex save this one's going to attempt-- leaps up to there dexterity saving throw does succeed succeeds they're actually rolling pretty high for their saving throws this one will be a three that one does not make it this one gets partway over and then falls prone there uses the other half of its movement to get up but that's as far as it can get it can't actually attack for this round it's going to use its movement to make the rest of its run up to the top of the stairs so that one does not get an action this turn because it slipped on the ball bearings it's going to be one attack against beau with disadvantage that's a natural 20 and a six yeah that does not hit not at all it's plus two the hyena rushes up and lashes out towards you and you just pop slap it in the nose and it pulls back yep the two other ones that rush up and come along the flank with the hyena to you fjord first one goes that is going to be a 15 plus two 17 all right actually it has advantage on the roll because of pack tactics it didn't really help let's see here you take two points of piercing damage the other one is going to attack you (laughs) which causes it to shatter into ice on the ground it bites you and its snout (explosion) t-1000 style it shatters into a million ice pieces yep thank you the other one is going to take a strike at you natural 20 it's a critical hit 20 and ten that pack tactics is nasty that means you for dice wise suffer eight points of piercing damage it takes ten and it explodes into ice as well both of these hyenas rush up and strike and both in succession disintegrate into shards of ice across the ground the spell is gone though right that's going to end the hyenas' turn nott you're up okay (laughs) as you drunkenly try and aim in the direction you almost pull the trigger twice but you're aiming at fjord and you're like no no advantage but he can sneak attack if he hits that's how it works you finally go and one of the elements of stone in the side of the cavern wall (impact) as the bolt hits it and goes sideways yeah you're revealed you have to find a way to obscure something's vision to you before you can hide that'll work go ahead and roll a stealth check as your bonus you're a rogue this go-round man all right that ends nott's turn fjord you're up you may go for it marisha and 16 hits his ac's 15 i'll allow it yeah you've got to say it two-handed i'll allow it so this one that had already-- 15 points of damage right this is the one that you hit earlier with it as you swing with your falchion just spinning it in your hand you arc upward as you do you watch as the gore and shadow of your hex which now seems to grasp around its chest almost reaches out to meet the blade in the middle like the two bits of lightning hitting in the center of the sky as they impact the blade carries through the momentum the strength coming from the blade not from your actual body as you do you carve through a large portion of its torso you watch as the hide armor folds off revealing this huge gash wound in its chest it (snarling and growling) it's still standing but it's horribly wounded now that end your turn fjord all right to the top molly you're up all righty go for it that hits go ahead and roll damage eight points of damage as soon as it rears from the attack fjord you watch as in a flash the cloak billows of mollymauk's arrival as the cloak falls you just watch as the gnoll's head just rolls off of its shoulders you can see the blow that struck it go for it that's its armor class hyena doesn't have a whole lot of armor eight points of damage with the one strike you turn around and look at the hyena (whoosh) with the offhand and just carve right through it wait because that didn't have the-- well the glowing one is your main hand then your offhand is the other one so what damage would it have been without the bonus four damage all right so it's still there you carve through and it's wounded but it's still (whimpering) you could have the idea is the bonus action attack happens as part of the attack action no worries you can keep that in mind next time it's all good you still beat the shit out of it with your offhand so that ends molly's turn those two gnolls in the back this guy is going to back up as he attempts to make a dexterity save fails so he falls prone uses the rest of his movement to get back up so he can only move ten more feet so he can't get that much further away he's going to go ahead and take a shot this guy is going to go ahead and pull back he's out of the bearing range and begins making his way towards the door they're both going to take shots at fjord actually one at you one at molly they're not going to fire at you because you visibly caught one and dropped it in front of them like fuck that against fjord that's going to be 19 and against molly okay that brings it down to a 14 all right as the one that is going to fire at you molly pulls back its arrow its eyes suddenly go dark and begin to bleed from the inside it suddenly (snarling) and releases it and you watch as that arrow splinters against the central column the one that does come towards you fjord however does strike true you suffer eight points of piercing damage as this one catches you right in the abdomen a little bit to the right tapping something kidneyish in that vicinity and you feel this sudden dull pain and nausea overcome you that's going to end the gnolls' turn caleb you're up you can see this one this one is technically being blocked by that central column go ahead and roll your spell attack what'd you roll no unfortunately it skitters off the central column and goes spinning out of control as the electrical sphere shatters against the stonework and dissipates the energy absorbed by the surrounding stonework yeah that would be your full movement there pretty close ending caleb's turn beau you could say maybe he's about 30 feet from you you can certainly try make an acrobatics check for me as you run off the edge the hyena takes a swing at you that is going to be a 14 you feel it snap at your heel but does not actually grasp any of your body you push off of him run across this wall leap hit this pillar and then using the momentum leap and land right in front of the gnoll there what was the other one roll both yeah as you swing down the gnoll manages to see you up in the air and side steps as you hit the stonework (gnoll laughter) damage on that one eight points of damage nice as it's laughing (laughing punch growling) its jaw is dislocated and it snaps back into place you see some of its teeth broke it looks kind of dazed and hurt by it it's looking pretty rough it's taken some hits in the past that's the end of your turn all right that brings us to jester yeah that'll do it 20 feet 13 no i'm afraid that will not hit as the lollipop comes around the corner it sees it coming and moves to get beau to intercede between the lollipop and itself at that moment you're like oh i can't quite-- and you end up withdrawing and not making the strike this round for fear of hitting beau all righty so that's a wisdom save that's six no seven points of damage as you release the surge of energy the sound begins to vibrate in its ears as it (whimpering) and it reaches up as both of its eardrums burst on the sides of its head and it falls to one knee looking like it's completely ruined and dazed and beau you have a moment to coup de grâce it you (whack) and break its neck with one swoop of the bo combined you both finish off that gnoll jester you want to move okay end of jester's turn the hyenas this hyena is going to move past-- no that one was not in melee with him that one's going to move up to you fjord attacking you fjord that is a six attacking you molly that is a 20 you take two points of piercing damage as it snaps at you seeing that they're both beginning to glance about and see that their allies are starting to back away and there's a lot of you up in this upper area they're both going to attempt to break away with the rest-- yep both of you do both hit roll damage main hand this one is hanging on by a thread it's the one you damaged last round yeah you carve that one you as they're rushing you both (whoosh) simultaneously strike back at it as they're attempting to flee and they stumble down the stairs perfect their bodies stumble to the ground and end up-- it's weird because their bodies hit the ground and the momentum carries them as they slide across the ball bearings almost like they're lagging finished the hyenas' round nott you're up make an insight check it is not disadvantage on wisdom checks 19 this gnoll looks like it's ready to fucking bolt it is on the way out of the room the tide has turned it's starting to see more and more of you appear at the top of the stairs as the hyenas and its friends are being destroyed it's going to run it immediately goes (cackling) and falls on the ground on its back and is now rolling with laughter laughter that is echoing through the halls and making its way through the tunnel make a dexterity saving throw as you hear that just as you reach the bottom of the stairs okay you get to the bottom of the stairs and you barely begin to slip and catch yourself it's a dc 12 however you continue to run (counting) that's about as close as you can get on your 30 movement-- yes you may actually make a concentration check you've taken some damage and i forgot to maintain your hex's concentration make two for me if you don't mind correct that's fine yeah you're fine the hex moves over-- whenever you take damage and you have a spell that's concentration you have to-- i know eldritch blast disadvantage because it's still prone 14 still misses unfortunately it hits and gleans off of its armor however it isn't quite strong enough to actually make a painful impact on its body and slams into the nearby rock causing a spray of dust and debris correct all right that ends your turn fjord molly you're up that's as far as you can get right there that actually is a 16 what's your dc right against whatever your spell dc is spellcaster technically we will say for the purposes of this it's eight plus proficiency bonus which is ten plus whatever your charisma modifier is yeah not a big deal for now we'll tighten it up cool so no effect there molly's turn is over the gnoll's turn it is laughing its ass off now does it make-- all right which is a 17 it manages to shrug off the laughter no it's just on the ground going (confused whimpering) it's about to try and get back up caleb you're up 13 it has disadvantage because it's still prone yes against ranged spells yeah you release it and it just skids across the ground like skipping a stone across a lake it slams into the wall behind it and (explosion) it's all good man just survive to level five and everything will turn unfortunately it does not hit all right beau you're up you have advantage because it is prone you're just getting your attack so yeah still with advantage here's what you do you walk up tap tap leap and right as you're in the air the gnoll kicks out of laughter rolls out of the way and you wham the worst funny bone pain shoots through your arm as you get up you still have your bonus the gnoll actually starts laughing again roll the attack you still have advantage yeah because it's still prone that will shut it up so as it's laughing you kick it in the head and you see it stunned on the ground for a second and its eyes kind of rolling in different directions nice heavy crack to the side of its temple okay ending beau's turn jester you're up okay that does have advantage because it is technically in melee with it nope it's just rolling out of the way of everything it's doing what beau did in the last fight but on the ground unless it rolls a natural 19 this one gnoll is just holding on so hard jester i think that ends your turn unfortunately the hyenas are dead there's no hyenas left you watch as four shimmering jesters all kneel down and shake their heads in their hands beau is over there going (gasps) this gnoll is going to need some serious therapy nott you're up it's prone yeah so melee attacks have advantage you're at disadvantage with a ranged attack you have disadvantage from a ranged attack up close and disadvantage against a prone creature right now with your crossbow it's disadvantage regardless now you have advantage on the attack 18 hits go ahead and roll damage with your sneak attack 13 points of damage how do you want to do this (cheers) as it's cackling and moving around i like to imagine this is all happening simultaneously beau's on the ground holding her elbow the weapon misses and it's rolling and cackling and starting to get up and you're like hmm there (thump) almost unceremoniously it's like (dying yip) and falls limp on the ground where you place it it's almost like the slow push from saving private ryan you're like shh shh shh (dying yips) and it expires there on the ground everyone takes one point of psychic damage they are noticeably smaller and not gnoll ears okay five sets of gnoll ears and four sets of hyena ears all right the next ten to 15 minutes or so you'll be able to shake off the alcohol okay it does not appear to be trapped (clunk) it's locked okay go ahead and attempt with disadvantage to pick it it's proficiency bonus which is two plus your dex bonus as the adrenaline pumps through your system it wakes you up a bit and even with the intoxication that's been flooding your system you steal a moment of clarity and it opens without an issue you glance at it and the chest looks like it's been bashed in a little bit like one of the gnolls was trying to get into it and eventually gave up got flummoxed and threw it on the ground as you open it up from the inside you can see essentially a central medical pack if you will an emergency pack for any of the miners that had gotten hurt or wounded there are two healer's kits in there there are a number of disinfectant herbs and funguses anybody who is proficient in medicine would know how best to utilize those i don't know if any of you are then it's a risky endeavor to maybe use one you do find a small leather hand pack that contained four glass vials three of which were shattered from the rough movements when it was tossed around but one that is still intact that contains a healing potion it is it is a greater healing potion not a standard healing potion you can mark down medicinal supplies would be what you'd call it you are not entirely certain as to how they are applied but they are probably healthy you're proficient in medicine yeah i was asking if anyone was proficient with it (laughs) fair enough the medicinal supplies you have acquired can be utilized to remove poisons if quickly applied to where the poison was put it has two uses if an action is taken to apply it to a wound whether a bite or a wound that was poisoned it can help remove the poison it's an action to apply it yeah as you step forward a little bit make a perception check you hear echoing muffled in the distance some yipping some conversation in whatever this gnollish language is you hear a deep resonant (deep breathing) and a distant (thump) an impact and a sound near (yips) that's all sounded quite a ways away like this echo had been traveling a ways down this tunnel you hear a few other cackling chuckles that echo shortly thereafter make an investigation check please okay looking about the altar you find some smaller pieces of fresher flesh that have been stretched over the edges of the altar like on the corners you can see a similar grin across the center it's all blood splattered from the hearts that were placed on there as you wipe a little bit of it away you can see stained into this loosely tanned human skin the same symbol of the jagged smile the jagged teeth that form a grin that the various tanned banners that are stapled into the stone walls show and reveal but no notes no books no parchment you've already made a religion check before and as you come up and join her this particular symbol the grin matches the memory the flash you had of this entity you gather this is probably the symbol that represents this entity you take a few minutes to look around which gives you two notifications one nothing seems to be immediately coming in to search as to what the noises were and you do hear other distant sounds impacts and cackling and stuff you get the sense that the tunnels deeper in have some activity amongst the gnolls that live below whatever they've converted this mine network to be you also see that all the bodies in this chamber have been pretty much picked of any identifiable facets if you want to take some time to really pick through it you could try do you want to that's up to you it's about an hour or so not for her it doesn't (singing) conservation it's more of a tool sledgehammer than a weapon sledgehammer nothing that caught your attention if you were to take about ten more minutes you'd stop being drunk okay so you want to wait until nott shakes off the-- the influence the booze eventually you regain-- yes that was it yeah as you guys are having this conversation you hear one sound that varies very strongly from the others that have encompassed this tunnel sequence you hear this female scream this high-pitched shrieking scream that says no my baby you guys rush down the tunnel deeper into the maze of mineshafts-- and we'll pick up on that next week also babies oh god so it's actually briney pickled gnoll ears that's true yeah there you go yeah it'll be an interesting interesting learning process of conservation of spells as you progress down-- i know that's okay that's what cantrips are for that's what weapons are for that's what i'm saying something to keep-- as you continue forward if you need to assault things all right oh quick announcement which is fun so we're going to have a guest next week our first guest of the campaign yeah you
