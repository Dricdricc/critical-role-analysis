really excited about it and you guys should check it out it's a really good service so good on you so any other announcements you'd like to make tonight anyone or are we about to start this all righty so to get you guys up to speed with what's happened recently the party upon returning from their adventure in whitestone had a meeting with the council of tal'dorei where they were able to provide information a witness and have the guidance of the now no-longer-charmed sovereign uriel tal'dorei to alleviate them of any wrongdoing in the briarwoods' arrival in emon months ago and reinstated their membership in the council dropped the charges that were against them from the city of emon and the party basically have now become once again lauded and accepted within the city at the same time uriel going through a bit of an emotional breakdown with his lack of seeming leadership in this whole circumstance it was discovered that the reason his defences were improper was because there was an individual on the actual council who was a traitor who'd been working with the briarwoods and secretly a follower of vecna from what the documents seemed to say however he had fled and the party decided to go ahead and probably do a little better job than the local guard would find out if he was too far or not they found that he was still in the city beneath the city and happened to correlate his current location with the clasp the thieves' guild of the city's current underground base which the party had previously had a few run-ins before so making their way to the inn that houses one of the secret entrances to the clasp's hideout they encountered a band of traveling musicians doctor dranzel's wondrous performance group made their way-- the magical i'm trying to remember what the actual full term was on that one that you wrote for it i know i wrote it down in a document that i didn't print out but i will for future shows so dr dranzel-- yeah there you go it had a great performance troupe yeah that's the one and discovered a number of past individuals of scanlan's performance history as well as a few new friends and got into an epic flute duel of which he threw and in doing so being a man of his word gave the remaining gold coins in his pouch to a young gnome yeah with the distraction being successful the rest of the party snuck through the kitchen into the hatch and they had an encounter with the clasp after calling out to them within their own hideout telling them that they were after this fugitive and not planning to do any terrible business in the guild and managed to convince them to let them go about their way and vox machina had a showdown with the traitor riskel daxio within his cell before he was supposed to be ushered out of the city given a new name and essentially be given free rein in the world the party then beat him down pretty hard and are currently dragging his bleeding unconscious corpse towards the cloudtop district to turn him in this is true i don't know why i said corpse a near corpse he is borderline corpse so as you guys make your way towards the center of emon the central wall that surrounds the cloudtop district comes into view and the front gates that face the southwestern side of the city reveal themselves down the thoroughfare there you see the four guards that are posted at that entrance notice you approaching and immediately two of them begin to come up to you and you've interacted with these individuals a few times as your experiences here in the city so far and they've grown to recognize you just by appearance and you guys tend to stroll up as a posse of confidence which draws their attention exactly at this point the sun is setting it's probably getting close to dusk you guys stroll up and the two guards approach immediately can i ask you what you're doing here you've got someone-- well what's the present no if there is business to be done i have to go ahead and put it up the chain of command to make sure that i'm doing my job so i don't end up being lashed for my-- well i appreciate that and i'd appreciate you helping me do my job if that's all right turns around and walks back the other guy looks back awkwardly and follows him he gives a couple hand motions and the gates open up to the inside of the cloudtop district it's just like it exactly i'm excited for the prospect of watching this happen right now you got this laura you got this this is a wonderful microcosm analogy for pretty much every session yay well done what's your strength so pushing towards the central palace the guards approach once again these ones a little more stern than the ones you met on the outside of the district what's your business at the palace the guards look over at the bear you found riskel daxio all right men the other guards begin to step forward like we'll take it from here the guard raises his hand and the guards stop very well proceed inward steps aside the guards separate and you can see they're all looking a little nervous that they basically had their job done for them it's not going to do well down the chain of command in the very near future you guys step into the palace make your way to the main hallway that leads to the central throne chambers uriel is not there at the moment the guards ask you to wait you wait about five to ten minutes or so before the doors open again and uriel is hastily walking in sitting down on his throne the rest of the council isn't present for this it's just him currently and i believe tofor brotorus the female dragonborn on the council with you guys so as you approach uriel sits down his robes swishing about him all right it hasn't been too long you requested my presence and i am here what do you need really and he stands up and the rest of the guards that came up behind you keep an eye to make sure nothing weird goes wrong they step forward a few steps and bring him forth hold him in irons chains now and all the guards go and pull him off of trinket throw him on the ground face-first he slaps into the marble flooring of the chamber little bit of blood smeared across the ground as his face glides-- he'll survive and you can see now there's a look of pained anger in uriel's eyes at seeing the face of someone he trusted for so long the guards take the manacles that you guys already had on him and chain his legs together they put another set of manacles across the back of his arms so his arms are actually held in two places to the back they lift him onto his knees and drag him up to the very bottom stair that leads up to the central dais where the thrones are on and he's unconscious head lolling about uriel looks down and wake him up someone i don't care wake him up with a resounding slap sound riskel sends a spatter of spittle and blood that coasts across the floor and his head shakes as he looks up at you you can see his teeth that were once white now glisten with fresh blood across the entirety of his smile do what you will he looks up and sees uriel my liege what would you have of me uriel takes a moment intensely staring at his face for so many years you played me and my family you played the people of this city of these lands you've forsaken the name of your father who plucked you from nothing how how can you live with this riskel takes a moment chuckles to himself this throaty gurgle as he's still trying to breathe through the blood pooling in the back of his throat life is but a stage of our existence and when you all will die i will rise again for i am his blood uriel steps back up on his throne and sits down riskel daxio you have been found guilty of treason by the peoples of tal'dorei i command that your sentence of death be held immediately quickly as you ask him that there are many parts to our one to him i'm but his blood but there are many many different pieces that make the whole his eyes narrow and he looks for a moment almost disappointed in confusion just kill me now i grow impatient with this existence i guess we'll find out please please kill me now end this paltry existence uriel contemplates for a moment he's at your disposal i only ask that you do it soon and in my sight roll an intimidation check you can see his eyes begin to roll back in his head do what you must begins to fade back into unconsciousness i don't know what you're talking about the deal with my master is power through not knowing he is the one who knows all the fact that he keeps it from us means that he trusts us his eyes dart around for a moment with a look of sudden curiosity and worry that's not possible deception check because she is helping with it and she is the source of it i'd say sure go ahead and roll with advantage 23 okay you can see now at this point his breathing is quickened and he's swallowing more regularly there's a look of sincere nervousness in his eyes his power is great there is nothing this paltry little child of a being can do to keep his will from his promise master have mercy if you want to it's whatever you want to try okay so as you pull out your symbol of sarenrae your metallic clinks of your feet across the sparse marble flooring you approach as the symbol glows you can see in pike's eyes her pupils go white as the energy of sarenrae's holy blessing begins to spill out the sides at each step riskel begins to twitch and pull away he's glancing about looks towards you grog with a look of please have pity as pike reaches out to touch him he goes i know little it is the nature of his being the ritual was once attempted before i know not if it worked i was not there you rushed in it was not time  the winter's crest the festival marks a time where the barrier between the realms is thin where the magic ley lines across this world cross and swell you forced our hand i was not there i do not know the answer and i hope it was enough at this point you can see now this look of despair hits his eyes and then resolve he goes from this fearful moment to the realization that he has already expressed more than he should but hopefully it's not too much to fall out of the favor of his lord and a smile creeps across his face for the first time since this whole thing and he grins it is time and he leans forward and puts his neck out did you want to cast the spell on him pike as you reach forward you take the sarenrae symbol and you jam it into his open mouth as it does-- yeah just like that a burst of divine light comes spewing out the sides and you see him choking on some unseen force probably a combination of him swallowing his own tongue but as you pull the symbol back completing the spell of restoration you can see the energy pour through his body and he's shaking out of fear his eyes begin to roll back and from the sound of it he's actually swallowing his own tongue he's choking you hear uriel's voice behind you say enough get it over with (laughter) trin as the blade is drawn from grog's back you can see it draws this trail of shadow behind it almost through the slow arc as he rears it back for the swing as the blade with a flash impossibly fast arcs its way across riskel's throat you can see his eyes open up with a sudden realization as the moment of pain and death hits him then a smile draws across his lips as the head slowly rolls back the blood then gouts out with the last pumps of his heart his body slumps forward the guards holding him as they can spilling a pool out in the center of the floor as this happens grog you feel this wave of exhilaration this almost ecstatic pulse of joy comes across your body this sense of taking his life with this blade the first time you've really actually used it was delightful uriel stands up guards have this mess cleaned burn the body thank you very much you did you already looted the body you hear the voice creep up and say now we see eye to eye the aura of the shadow from the blade retracts and the blade becomes an onyx blade it appears to have rescinded his presence yes it was and he sits there for a second and nods his head very well we were prepared to put out a bounty for his arrest and i feel it would only be fair to provide you with this bounty he snaps his fingers a guard comes up and he whispers to him for a second as he walks away you will have a sum of 5000 gold pieces delivered to greyskull keep this evening i appreciate it now please be on your way i have business to attend to thank you very much he gets up and walks away by now the sun's probably set and so as you step out of the palace you look up at the skyline little plumes of clouds throughout but you can see the distinct bright oranges and purples of sunset have taken and to the far east you can see the dark blue of creeping night it just set it's heading toward dusk old faithful technically would be the laughing lamia which is where you guys originally stayed when you first came to emon who's leading the pub crawl there's no ruleset for reverse inspiration but i'm going to start looking into designing that it's like the fate chips system it's great okay so who's heading the pub crawl all right go ahead and make an investigation check you'd be surprised (laughter) yeah you find about four different establishments but most of them appear to be less of the party hardy crowd and more of the my life sucks i need alcohol crowd 18 chatting around-- something off the beaten path word of mouth type place okay let's see hey man nothing wrong with that so you eventually hear about a place called howarth's howarth's howarth's sure i guess you'd say howarth's when you get there it appears to be more of a textile business but from what you've heard it's more a business that runs the front and then the real company is in the back yes so as soon as you guys approach the guy who's running the front who's this weaselly-looking mousy gentleman in his late 40s thin john waters mustache gives you a nod and says i take it you're not here for the-- yeah just around the corner back room points you over as you guys walk in there's a pretty happening establishment in here there's a harp player on the far edge of the room on the stage who's playing a very beautiful piece even though she's just playing the harp it's almost emanating the sound of multiple instruments there's probably about ten or so people in here it's not extremely crowded but everyone in there appears to be rather upper crust folks that either have descended from the cloudtop district to rub shoulders with the less elite of the town and a few wealthy merchants it's a pretty decent place for rabble rousers who have some coin to spend all right you guys get a round of drinks you look over the events of the previous weeks you chat amongst yourselves and you meet a few individuals in the establishment and make a few friends overall it's a pretty decent way to finish a rather long day of more work than you had originally anticipated as the buzz begins to wear off and the evening draws to a close you guys find yourselves getting a little hungry and this place is pretty much solely a bar experience as opposed to a straight pub and it's probably pushing close to 11 at this hour and the gentleman who's talking to you now his chin appears to have been broken at some point in his life so as he talks the jaw swivels from side to side in an awkward old disney cartoon way it's hard to really put into words his hair is spotty in places it's thinning in the front but he's well-dressed it's one of those things where the outfit does not match the persona but he looks over to you and well sir at this point in the evening food might be a little hard to procure unfortunately as far as i know okay go ahead and make a perception check okay as you're glancing about and you're talking to the bar and the rest of you guys are finishing a round of drinks you are looking around-- so you glance towards the door and an individual walks in that definitely matches the expectation of what you're looking for a familiar individual a gentleman of purple-gold trimmed robes a darkish complexion a tied goatee and a smile on his face and it suddenly makes complete sense this is the kind of place that gilmore would go to drink (cheering) vax'ildan he runs up and grabs you and (kiss kiss) you as well my friend you as well oh obviously whatever she's having they don't have any they would not serve food here no it's a finer establishment um and he thinks for a second he reaches back into a small satchel he has at his side and he pulls out a little pouch he opens the pouch and he reaches out and he pulls out a small wooden domino like in size if you wouldn't mind clearing some of these tables for me (laughs) unnecessarily knocking over the drinks off the table of one of the nearby individuals but they don't argue with the goliath takes apart some room he gives a nod over to the bartender who you can see there's been a rapport here so he's like all right i'll allow it he tosses the wooden domino on the ground for a second whispers something under his breath does a hand gesture and it suddenly extends into a wooden table into a familiar sight this is a heroes' feast (cheering) you can see in his other hand the gem-encrusted chalice from the middle of his pouch dissipates in the arcane energy he says well i figured it was a special occasion actually i've gotten word that you've been spreading the wonders of my brand though-- that's not true but you've been doing it a bit which is more than i expected to be honest so i appreciate that i really do well oh i don't know about that i've still got to finish building my shop in westruun but when that is done i'll be more than happy to look into it whitestone whitestone hmm place has been kind of dour as of late so as the drinks continue to flow you guys swap stories you converse the evening is drawing closer to like the 130-200 in the morning at this point most of the other patrons have filtered out of the bar the heroes' feast after finishing being consumed itself has reverted back down to the wooden domino which is a different enchantment to what you're used to your more druidic divine-based heroes' feast you summon out of the actual element this is almost an implement or a focus he uses for the spell each time it's a different way of getting the same effect interesting to you not being an arcane caster but nevertheless as it winds down a bit you guys are all finding yourselves settling in of course okay yes my dear weird things in particular is that what you're insinuating all right fair enough the moment you say that you see his jovial exterior harden for a second and his eyes close and he goes that's a strange name to bring up this late in the evening yeah almost is better than actually so congratulations spinning black orb of death he thinks for a second and says the only orb of spinning death i'm familiar with is a sphere of annihilation but those are generally a bit larger than what you're describing to me at the very least those generally follow around the phrase 'vecna' i don't know too much other than what i've been told historically and bits of information that i've picked up through the years vecna and he thinks for a second he starts looking about if anyone else is near the table you guys are off and throwing darts okay okay vecna he has many names historically the archlich the whispered one the dying king the lord of the rotted tower the undying king gods like titles it seems a bit arrogant in my opinion from what i heard he was born a mortal used his capabilities to attempt to cheat death in every way possible and then once that was acquired naturally went on to the next great endeavor becoming a god he attempted to ascend six hundred years ago but in that time his cult expanded across the rebuilding civilization nearly achieved it until it seemed that the remnants of good in society went and followed him to his place of worship and thwarted his ritual he was slain but as you've seen when entities of such power get to a certain point death is but a hurdle you have enough individuals that believe you're a god that willpower is strong enough to keep you enduring so his influence exists and has for many years i don't know if he's a god per se not yet but there are those that treat him as such and that in itself is dangerous because that means he's probably still out there and i'm pretty sure he's very interested in finishing what he couldn't before that's all i've heard not a scholar of the religious rites and for the most part a lot of his history's been well destroyed and kept secret it's his bailiwick but anyway if you've indeed come across any of this foul business i recommend you stay far away far away bad news yes anyway sorry dour subject didn't mean to bring the mood down on that one as you guys stand up and walk away gilmore looks to you and goes i like her much better this way all of your drinks for the evening are paid for gilmore takes care of the tab you come back with the shots-- all right pike gets a shot all right so who's drinking one shot four shots all right i need constitution saving throws from all four of you not a constitution bonus pike what'd you get okay so percy you take your shot it burns down you're fine pike bam bam the little gnome takes it in her gut grins wipes the edge of her chin looks over to grog with a bit of a challenge look on her face grog you look over to keyleth and both of you guys start slamming down the line as you hit that fourth one you can feel the burn on the inside you a little bit of that heroes' feast begins to creep up and you get that acidic you know-- have to stop a little bit take it back down but you're good but you're good you kick it back as soon as you open your eyes you're like-- you look over across the way and all you see is keyleth her expression go from a big smile to neutral to a worried frown looking to the door all right what are you doing pike okay so as you guys all-- as you guys drag keyleth outside-- scanlan you're staying all right vax is staying and pike you're staying all right as this is happening gilmore sits up and begins to finish off his drink ah it's good to see friends well it's getting very late i've only been back a few days and i have a lot of business to attend to in the morning certainly it would be my absolute pleasure oh far be me to stand in a way of a private conversation and he stands up for a second and walks over to the far table in the corner right by the stage where the harpist was playing but is no longer on the stage he sits down expectantly waiting well if you guys are-- the doorway leads into the textile portion so if you guys aren't leaving the place entirely-- okay keyleth make another constitution saving throw okay you do manage to make it all the way outside of the building before you druidcraft all over-- (laughter) it's there forever all the percyleth shippers now having a field day all right so as you sit down yes vax'ildan darling yeah well not disagreeing with you there well curiosity is the spark of arcane pursuits and knowledge among many other things well i certainly appreciate your honesty and well i would be lying if i didn't say i was a little disappointed but at the same time the heart wants what the heart wants and i've enjoyed our flirtation perhaps our paths aren't meant to be quite so entwined such is the flow of fate my friend (sighs) and he gives a little sigh of digesting heartbreak a little bit but you know there's a nod to him of understanding and acceptance and he looks up to you again with that whipcrack of a gilmore smile and says i wish you luck the path of an uncertain heart is never an easy one and should you ever need an ear to bend or a shoulder to cry on well you know where i am and if i'm not there you know how to get hold of me now you're just being a tease (laughter) walks out into the night as gilmore walks by you guys he looks over at keyleth and goes get her some water you can a proper use of divine magic pike is the best wingman keyleth as pike embraces you the warmth of her hug is also matched with the warmth of the divine energy that briefly flows through your body and for a second you feel as if you're weightless and the nausea is gone the drunkenness is still there and the buzz is still finding its way through your system but not as heavy as it was before you come a little more conscious of yourself and when the warmth fades you feel much more in control of your current state of your mind your well-being and the contents of your stomach it had been a few hours or probably about an hour since the initial feasting so she's had enough to maintain the effect but the gentleman who owns the establishment is probably not going to be very happy in the morning when he has to clean up you guys make your way back to greyskull keep as you approach the front gate of your establishment you see cordell and shayne keeping their evening watch over the gate cordell shouts down to the rest of you guys you've got guests waiting for you laura and he looks to shayne shayne looks to him counts in her head i think probably at least two hours they had your permission oh it's a bunch of them he looks over at shayne who goes don't do that cordell the gate opens you guys come inside and you find as you enter the keep the smell of a recently cooked meal is permeating the air of the keep you hear laughter and a little bit of music in the distance and as you walk towards the eating chambers the central feasting area on the bottom floor of your keep there indeed you see your recently discovered friends he is yes yes samson right now by the way is asleep on a table it's way past his bedtime he's on the edge there hello miss they told me they wouldn't miss them no no not unless he tells me to and points to dr dranzel who at this point has been like scanlan finally (chuckles) you can see now there's three bottles of wine they've been drinking that are open and about no but they were provided and i'm not one to not drink when it's not provided cordell's at the front gate no they're up on the front gate keyleth is talking out to nothing the lesser restoration didn't have quite as strong an effect on reversing the alcohol but she's not puking so that's good oh you guys as well you can see the rest of the people are watching zed's fallen asleep eselmyr's in the back corner watching everyone yeah she's the older mature elven woman who's keeping an eye kaylie is there sitting next to dranzel and kent plucker has a lute he's (musical note) on well come sit unless it's too late in the night i have a conversation i'd like to have (chuckles) i like her (laughing) she looks tired she's like (whimpering) more meats okay is it all right if i go to bed sleep well glad you made it home safe she wanders back off bags under her eyes dr dranzel waves you all in so that little proposition that we talked about at the bar earlier today the old man who didn't need his fortune allow me to elaborate a bit in a more private setting if you don't mind this is the more private as dranzel holds out his mug he goes now when we arrived to come play the winter's crest festival here in emon one of my contacts we'll say an old client of mine last year in emon right around the same time mentioned a peculiar thing apparently a wealthy lord here vanished about a year ago his estate was sold to a private collector apparently this collector keeps his name off the books and he couldn't really find out any information about who he was or what his business is but he acquired the entire estate people were curious as to what his business was as the previous individual was rather well known and the circumstances rather dubious in disappearance but i don't know really how that all went together anyway this older collector was fairly active at this estate until a few months ago the windows have darkened and stayed as such no furniture touched the interior elements unpacked or moved just went away so i'm thinking either this fellow has kicked the final bucket met his end or is off on some extended business trip leaving his acquisition and all of its contents ripe for the picking problem is we can't get into the cloudtop district kent and kaylie have tried numerous times almost got arrested and you can see kaylie gives a nod with her shoulders shrugging still got a few things to learn apparently it's the first thing i threw out there dear he goes back so seeing as how you folks have got some pull in the town i was thinking you could either find a way to get us in quietly carefully let us do our work give us some tips on the best way to stay out of sight or you could go in grab a few things come back here with the spoils and we'll take our cut his eyes look over to you i get the feeling that this kind of work is not unfamiliar (sighs) the name escapes me you do recall the cloudtop district was not at your disposal when you first came here possibly yes red brick building iron fence surrounding the outside-- actually no most of the houses there have various colors krieg's was built more utilitarian and was very minimalistic in its interior decor in fact most of it seemed unused from what you saw other than the manservant that lived there the house for the most part the bedroom everything that you searched seemed like it was barely touched it seems pretty damn close to the description that you recall i'd previously discussed a 60-40 split 70-30 (sighs) a tough bargain but 80-20 it is matt and all righty you just did fair enough well that's unfortunate we'll have to find somebody else see thinking of the people that's the scanlan shorthalt i know krieg i've heard that name i think that may be the gentleman well i don't know him is this not the greatest bard to have lived scanlan you humble us all we're happy to do so and thank you very much for your fine hospitality as you're saying this kaylie is watching this with a smirk on her face well i'm not one to turn down a soft bed for an evening dranzel glances over (laughs) good luck zed sits up the large bearded gentleman he's like i'm happy to sleep here this is fine by me just give me a flat surface he goes over to one of the tables and-- yeah he's the drummer all right jarett you mean it's been that week you guys all find your way to your rooms you arrange beds for those who need it for the most part down in the dungeon area a couple of rooms are crowded with other folks except for kaylie who is following you scanlan with a bottle of wine and two glasses as you all go to your various rooms kaylie pulls out the chair and the table at the far end of your bedroom sets down and begins to pour glasses of wine and sits across you guys have drinks and begin various conversations about-- (flute music) (laughter) interesting tale right right so you've said a number of times aye she drinks a little bit more of the wine sets it down i guess i should tell you a bit more about myself then well i grew up in kymal mostly before moving to westrunn to train at the college of the white duke finest of the bards he was my mom gave all her savings to put me up there now i only joined the troop about six months back it was my third year at the duke's when the good doctor came through and well i seized the opportunity now to be perfectly honest up-front i've already heard a bit about your tales shorthalt (chuckles) the charming of the pauper prince your rendition of the summer sunder the cliffs of dagger bay i've been hoping our paths would cross dagger bay's just a place thank you very much you know where i've heard most of these stories my mother sybil sybil a fine gnomish lass it was some years ago she came across a smooth silver-tongued flautist who blew through like the wind and disappeared (gasping) i practiced i stole lied about my age and eventually paid my way into the duke's college so i could find you prove you a scoundrel at this point you see her stand up and she begins to draw a small blade from her side her face is hardened and still as she stares at you you see a slight tremble in her hand this day scanlan shorthalt i beat you at your own song now i come to take your dignity now take up your sword don't try that with me do you even remember sybil make a wisdom check roll a d20 add your wisdom modifier 16 you vaguely recall sybil she-- golden hair very eager to escape her simple beginnings and very clingy very quickly you jumped out of there very fast from your perspective you are a scoundrel do you even realize you nearly invited your daughter up to sleep with you (laughter) you don't care you have no boundaries you take what you like and you keep walking on you trick folk now draw your blade make a persuasion check with advantage for that speech as she stands there with her blade out staring at you you can see the veins in her neck tensing you see the tear begin to roll down her cheek as her jaw clenches (grunts) and she thrusts forward-- -- and rolls a natural one as she goes to strike towards you even in that moment her will falters and the blade falls limp it hits your chest and you feel the piercing of something pushing into your flesh but no more than maybe half an inch as there's no real force behind the blade as the hand releases her weapon it clatters to the ground as her momentum carries her arms around your shoulders as she holds you there her tousled short pixie brown hair you can feel the wetness across the back of your neck and you hear her voice trembling in your ear say why why can't i do it all the years building up to this and i have the chance and i can't do it you say that and her arms tense for a minute involuntary trying to pull you closer then they relax and she steps away averting her gaze keeping her head down she bends down and picks up her blade doesn't sheathe it just holds it limply at her side she begins to walk to the door she opens the door and looks back at you her eyes finally meeting yours you can see the wet stains across her cheeks you're still a scoundrel it's what's kept you alive this long in some ways it's what's kept me alive this long i've got a lot to think about i'm going to go for a walk (sighs) i need some fresh air and she closes the door behind her there's a lot of faces blurring this is-- you worked your way through a lot of tal'dorei in those days you-- okay and with that we're going to go ahead and take a bathroom break we'll be back here in five minutes you avoided a showdown in your bedroom she was ready to we'll be back here real fast take this a quick break quick as we can because we have a lot to get through before we get to critmas we'll see you here in just a few minutes welcome back everyone so before we get back into this crazy little maury povich show episode we have a chatroom winner for our giveaway which is awesome congratulations to dr3vvn45ty you are our winner for this evening's chat room giveaway congratulations (cheering) oh right jarett sorry i'm happy to take care of this for you he loads his crossbow and plops himself down at the edge of the hall where he has a view of every single door at the south end of the keep and he's like perched and ready all right you guys come to consciousness the next morning more hungover than others depending on the individual come down breakfast has already been prepared and waiting (laughs) poor laina's been trying to keep it warm for you and part of it's already being eaten by your guests who half of them fell asleep in the actual dining room nevertheless all of you come down scanlan you eventually come out of your confused reverie not a lot of good sleep throughout the evening and kaylie never came back throughout the night yeah as you head down to the main dining area dranzel is there and he's a little hungover himself and enjoying the remnants of his meal poor laina is not designed to produce breakfast for over 11 people in a morning yes good morning scanlan about what did she do what did she do and you can see he looks a little worried now he's checking his pockets yeah make an insight check three seems pretty genuine yeah he's hard to read beyond hung over and mildly confused and you spent a lot of time with him so you know his demeanor pretty well but yeah he seems genuinely like (stutters) if she's done anything wrong let me know she's part of my troupe i take responsibility for her of course as long as she keeps bringing in the change and doesn't piss me off i think we're good takes his hat and puts it on finishes his breakfast it never got delivered i mean who are you asking okay cordell and shayne are now changing over into the next morning staff as they're getting their stuff together the morning staff would be kendrick-- -- and natibe yes you took notes but yeah as they're changing over you walk over and ask them and shayne goes yeah no we had a messenger come by and drop something off for you guys well we gave it to erwen and he brought it inside but you guys weren't home a small wooden thing right cordell's like yeah it was like a small wooden case erwen took it in they both look at each other look our shift's over probably inside the keep i don't watch your little old man-servant i'm sorry i'm supposed to watch the front of the gate okay erwen who's dressed up in his proper servant attire now that he has to entertain guests his hair is slicked back and is a scoop of a balding male dome yes vex'ahlia may i be of service to you this morning oh you oh oh yes no there was a delivery i was looking for you all but no one was home so i asked around if anyone had seen you and your guests said that you would be coming and that they would hold it for you until you arrived he's stood up and put his hat on ah yes oh (laughs) yes we were making sure that it wasn't pilfered by any untrustworthy types of course of course we're more than happy to help you being such fine hosts to us it's the least we could do and he leans over to kent (murmurs something) you can read lips as he leans over he says kent you better go get the box right okay steps away runs up to the guest room that they were staying comes back down carrying the small chest okay (laughs) it'll take you a little while it's a lot of coin you get for about the next 30-ish minutes or so you're counting through and you're starting to get towards the bottom of it and you've gotten to about roughly the 3500-4000 gold section before kent comes up to you behind and takes a small satchel and empties it into the chest as well and goes and that as well sorry keeping it separate so in case-- right you wouldn't lose everything thinking ahead you've all eventually come downstairs he said he's in love were you being honest yeah no scanlan seemed pretty honest if guarded at this point dr dranzel is like speaking of which where is kaylie i haven't seen her all morning yes yes yeah just an investigation and while you guys do that we'll wait here and eagerly keep an eye out for kaylie and-- sure not this evening no i wouldn't dream of it scanlan tips his hat a little understood and as you turn and look over at the door jarett's there with his crossbow still over on the side looking in he glances over at this point zedd the rather rotund drummer has finished eating his breakfast he's got bits of egg in his beard he spins around and goes you're more than welcome to stay here with us right grog leaves all right yeah you guys make your way towards the cloudtop district you're allowed through the gates and you find your way across the central residential area to the far northeast side of the district this is further away from the palace within viewing distance from allura's tower which still stands over the entirety of the district like this looming monolith currently empty and cold as she's over in whitestone for this investigation however you do come across the familiar site of general krieg's homestead the one you infiltrated a little over a year ago it looks like it's a little dilapidated but strangely enough for a person who's purchased this estate there wasn't much attempt to try and beautify it the ivy has overgrown the bottom of it there is still the iron gate around it it is currently closed and there are no guards posted around it it looks empty and vacant and dark in the windows it's about noon okay you guys scoot around to the back side anything in particular you're looking for perception check for those who wish to look around all right we have percy and vax glance over you take about five minutes or so paying very close attention to any sort of possible movement or light within the building nothing it is dark it is motionless the windows are closed it's a dark interior and you can't really make any details out of the inside from this point because it is so closed off some of the curtains have actually been drawn shut but not all of them a few of the windows are open outside the house the grass the lawn that surrounds this-- surrounding buildings there a number of other homes as well but this area is the more upper class upper crust aspect of emon a number of various manors and rather decadent buildings each building has its own color scheme its own architecture each thing is trying to be distinct and different in this microcosm of the societal space of emon where most of the gold passes through they have their own worries about presentation which is interesting because in the middle of all these very beautiful homes you have general krieg's home which is pretty basic red brick utilitarian and sticks out like a sore thumb by comparison or doesn't stick out at all by comparison because it's so normal-looking glancing about there are none in your immediate vicinity you're not that far from the citrine garrison which is the centerpiece of the higher military folk and they do have their own guard station about you're about a ten-minute walk from the palace which has a number of guards throughout and you do have some patrols that come through the city but in the middle of the day in the cloudtop it's not as pressing a place for guard presence so you haven't seen any immediately around you but i'm sure if you wait for the next 15-20 minutes one will probably come your way (bear noises) as he growls into your ear there is a gate you guys were around back there's the gate which is about-- the fence itself is about seven feet tall with little metal impaler spikes on the top all right go ahead and make an acrobatics check okay okay you deftly avoid falling upon one and spearing your manhood thankfully as you grab the edge (grunts) loftily heft yourself over the top of the gate landing within the other side of the browning yard that hasn't been well-kept grog walks away from you guys towards the house brazenly in the middle of the midday sun okay you're going shh follow me (squeaking sound) (laughter) grog you're already at the front door you guys hear in the distance (knocking) as grog's fist is now hitting-- nobody answers the door do you have lockpicks vex appears seemingly out of nowhere and slaps his lockpicks-- i'm sorry vax so pike i've gotten much better at that pike you want to try and pick the lock all right go ahead and roll a d20 and add your dexterity okay go for it that is a real easy d10 inspiration die for you pike so go ahead and roll a d20 add your dexterity modifier which is what yeah well what'd you roll okay then what's your dexterity modifier that's a seven now go ahead and roll a d10 and add that to it all right wow okay that puts you at a 15 which is actually directly the dc of the door even better yes with the rattle of metal plate the untrained eye and a couple times you hear the metal (creaking) beginning to bend as she having no previous experience really with lockpicks from what you know you're afraid she's going to break your toolset however she's picked up a few things while she was at sea with you know more of the swashbuckling brigades over the western shores and much to your surprise she (click opening sound) the door opens and the dark interior of the home is at your disposal as you step into the home a little bit the first thing you notice is the smell immediate pungent scent of decay hits your nose the source is not in immediate visual range and you can't really tell what type of decay it is but it's a definitively terrible smell and one that permeates the interior of the foyer foyer all right you come in it's an experience as you guys walk in it catches you off guard and you stand the main foyer open before you the only light currently within the interior is the bit of sunlight that's bouncing in from the front open doors and a few of the windows in the distance to your left is a dining room there's a big red carpet in the center of the room there's tapestries put all-- actually the decor in here is much more garish than you recall when you were last here it was very simple it was very minimalist and you got the impression that the house for the most part was not being lived in outside of the servant you recall there was a passageway across from the foyer that led to a gallery and that which had the-- yep the false wall in the back trinket comes sniffing up (sniffing sounds) go ahead and make a perception check for trinket true okay so trinket sniffs through steps into the center of the foyer pushes past the carpet into the middle of the dining room and looks up at the table and as soon as you look over trinket growls for a moment and you see there on the center of the dining room table is a meal set up drink food but is completely molded over to the point where parts of it have bloated and spilled off and liquid has-- the putrescence has spread across part of the surface it's been there for quite some time you don't know quite how long yeah you check down you put your finger across it and it is a little dusty it's not been an extremely long period of time but there is a layer of dust currently from what you can see no you've all begun to walk into the foyer yes yes the smell gets more intense as you enter the dining room sure you take a moment and concentrate and use your druidcraft the fungus begins to reform and more mushroom-like spores begin to appear out of it and sprout from the current festering mass whereas once was a nasty spore cloud-based fungus you've now converted almost into a colored mushroom-type presentation it'll probably lessen the stench over time but no immediate effect as the smell has been hanging here stagnant for quite a while what's up pike you can what is the duration on that one yeah you can do that so as you guys are walking in pike clasps her holy symbol and closes her eyes for a second and you begin to see these almost glowing orbs like these ghostly entities that begin to swirl and follow around you similar in the spirit stuff of pike's form when she was alongside you guys in whitestone who's heading upstairs the downstairs would be the path that you found last time you didn't inspect the rest of the house at that point okay as vex scanlan and percy head towards the stairway they step across the red carpet in the center of the foyer-- i need all three of you to make a dexterity saving throw correct nice (laughs) okay as you all step across there's a sudden smell of-- you've smelled it before-- it's the fresh strike of a lightning bolt or something that has burned in the atmosphere you look over at percy and both of you feel this slight bit of tension and energy in the room and you dodge out of the way at which point suddenly there is a burst of force energy from the center of the room that surrounds scanlan blasting him in the process and you feel like you're lifted off your feet but instead of being thrown upwards you slam into what feels like a roof that's far too low for the one you've seen you go ahead and take 16 points of force damage and you land (impact) on the ground prone you look up around you and there is a cage of arcane force energy right now that is holding you in place in a ten by ten foot area (crackling) this is in the foyer you guys just now went all right we're doing this go (impact) it's not even two steps into your plan yeah you all see scanlan currently now trapped in this force cage scanlan roll another dexterity check okay you can see the cage itself its unstable energy occasionally arcs across like a tesla coil and you manage to dodge out of the way and you can see now this cage not just holds you in place but it also perpetually tries to damage those who are captured as keyleth waves her hand now the entire force cage vanishes into the air i will say for the purposes of this everyone roll an investigation check everyone roll an investigation check this is investigation okay the three of you going upstairs you find no further traps you go through the rooms on the top floor you find that where previously most of them were empty a lot of them have been furnished now but most of the furnishings have been untouched like the house was being set up to be almost like a summer home or a side home but no signs of life everything seems to have the same layer of dust you found on the floor in the foyer there is no real wealth being kept here 'cause i know that's probably what you're looking for it looks like whoever had intended to this collector hadn't quite gotten to the point of wanting to move any of their fortune their masses into the upstairs area but it has been largely untouched for a number of months now what did you roll grog pike okay you guys take a little while to pore through the kitchen you find a basement you open the latch and go down and look throughout and it smells mildewed down there but from general dampness almost like recent rainy weather soaked into the ground soil there and was left to mildew a bit you don't find any other signs of life looking about all the rooms you find the music room there's the main living den area mostly it's almost like a showroom like everything was set up but then never had the chance to actually host anyone or someone to actually live there and enjoy it from what you can tell the meal that was prepared the pots and pans and stuff that were used to cook it are currently in a small basin that carries a little bit of still water that's been slowly evaporating over time with bits of dried food crusted around the sides the meal itself appears to have been abandoned not in haste there's no signs of a struggle the fork is still resting partially in the now mushroom fungus-covered pile even getting near it you're still like (disgusted grunt) but there's no previous sign of a struggle it looked like it was just made for one person actually there are a number of rather garish tapestries around a number of them are of different animals running and hunting and chasing not in a very beautiful way but the kind that you'd you know find at an airport you know like kinkade burst of light yeah they're all thematic and similar and none of them seem to have any other theme other than whoever ordered them seems to like animals no not in this current setup okay you scoot through and using-- do you have detect magic memorized then make an arcana check to inspect and see if you see any signs of-- 14 going from place to place nothing seems to jump out at you as enchanted or any sort of arcane nature the only room you haven't inspected yet is the hallway across from the foyer the one that led into the original gallery room and then into the hidden-- what's up pike yeah make a religion check okay looking about and keeping this in mind you don't see any sort of religious iconography any of the artwork any of the small knickknacks that are throughout the den nothing here speaks of any sort of religious connotation or at least whoever has decorated this place did so purely out of visual aesthetic choice so yeah nothing catches your attention in this room all right all right pike grog-- what's the rest of the marching order here then percy all right so-- all right you guys step through it's a short hallway and it leads you into a 20x80 long room and here you do see a number of tapestries and there are the ones that were left previously actually this room has not really been touched much since you came in when krieg currently lived here you can see these tapestries are much older these ones depict more mythological moments one of them shows the elemental creation of existence it's almost like a biblical-type very artistic representation of the creation of the different planes you've seen it done before-- yeah yeah same one there are a number of small cylindrical platforms that rise up in the center of this room you see on the first sets a series of bronze busts of a particular man wearing a cloth wrap a headpiece his features are still nondescript there's a lot of detail in the clothing in the neck wrap and the head wrap but when it comes to the actual features of the face it's very simple and plain no i'm actually going to ask you guys to roll a history check all righty so glancing at this the three of you-- you don't recognize the face at all and the best that you can recall is there have been tales in a far-off continent called marquet which is a largely desert landscape the few bastions of civilization that exist in this desert there is one central town referred to as ank'harel you've never been there you've heard of it and it's this little oasis in this center of this vast desert it's also where jarett is from and you've heard that the city has been lorded over and run in a very benevolent way by an individual referred to as j'mon sa ord the city has existed for about 400 years and since its existence has been run by j'mon sa ord people don't know if he's human what he is but he's apparently lived that long 400 years that's as much as you can assert and those thoughts come to you three and you see this bust these series of busts that seem to depict this individual and to the best of your knowledge that's probably an artist's depiction of j'mon sa ord which you've never seen in tal'dorei or anything of this type of construct okay sure make a perception check correct yes desert and mountains (laughs) looking about there are no traps in this room it looks to be pretty clean pretty clear also you see on the pillars there are a few other things there is a golden tea set made of pure gold on one of the pillars there is a mostly-- and very old-looking set-- not complete set of ivory-carved dominoes there's a human skull-- humanoid skull-- doesn't quite look human it looks elongated and the teeth are sharpened looks almost elvish but one eye socket has an uncut rough emerald embedded in the socket the right socket okay are you just taking a look at it it's sitting on one of the columns yeah it's part of the collection as you reach out take it and its weight and you lift it off the cylindrical pillar-- as you turn it it turns freely you lift it up off of the pillar and on that as you do that nothing happens it is in your hands however-- yeah it's heavier than you expected it would be and-- there's a part of you that-- like a slight cold chill runs down your spine no just like every person has that little part in the back of their head that says this probably isn't a good idea but whatever (laughter) so you're holding it in your hand what do you want to do it's set in the socket actually and the emerald-- go ahead and make a perception check all right glancing into the socket you can see the emerald is actually set within the socket it is set with meticulously jewel-crafted gold inlay that actually almost looks like a very deepset filigree that binds it within the socket itself like it's very deliberately placed the craftsmanship of the very very fine gold filigree and yet the uncut nature of the emerald seems strange and as you inspect the emerald itself it seems almost like while the gem itself is stationary there is the ever-so-faint image of movement within the gem almost like a freshly disturbed pond like a slight ripple of the surface of water there is just ever-so-slowly shifting within the gem sure the skull does not come from any beast that you are familiar with you've not encountered a creature of this physiology and it definitely doesn't come from the realm of nature from your understanding okay okay so what are you trying to check about the skull well it depends on what nature you're trying to ascertain of the skull are you trying to figure-- there are spells called detect good and evil you have it memorized okay all right so as per the spell let me get the rules up here real fast because the question comes up often if you want this app on your phone it's called fight club 5 on the itunes store for free you have to do some updates and uploading of your own you can find information on the web on how to do it but that way you know and stop tweeting me i don't mind it's fine all right so detect good and evil evil and good all right so you take a moment and you focus-- by the way this is a concentration spell doing this will get rid of your spirit guardians okay so as the orbs that have been rotating around for the past you know it's been about ten minutes they probably would have faded anyway gently dissipate you focus your intent on the skull and this object while it is not a desecrated object per se there is an essence inside that does not strike you as moral there is something about its very nature that does give you pause you are unable to ascertain the nature given the fact that you would have to take some time with it to really do so but you get the feeling that there is some power within it but probably not the kind that is very fortuitous for someone of your persuasion yeah you go ahead and take the top off the tea set and look inside it is empty it is polished and the light that comes in as you open the top just refracts the image from the outside of the tea set and it's just beautiful craftsmanship the actual gold itself is very smooth on most of the tea kettle and all the cups themselves all have very very intricate scrolling on them that have been handcarved in it's a beautiful set this is like a royal gift this is something that you know people who trade across political boundaries use to you know send goodwill to the other side this is probably worth quite a bit you look on the bottom and it has the initials lm the street cousin of vecna yeah some of them are set on the side there's a stack and then a few of them are set up-- it's literally placed in like a nice presentational like qvc style turn it and look at all the cool dominoes type okay all the dominoes (scattering sound) scatter and fall off the sides (clatter sounds) and clinking on the ground some of the ivory chips a little bit on some of the corners nothing bad seems to happen it stands there cold against the very well you taste it as your tongue touches the ivory of the domino it tastes somewhat salty all right you guys make your way to the far back wall of the room and there is that same tapestry that you saw before it depicts a large storm cloud that is roaring over the cliffs you open up the tapestry and it's just a flat stone wall okay as you lick the wall your face (wind sound) passes through the wall (laughter) as your head passes through you look about and you can see stairs that descend for about 40 feet into darkness yeah there's a tapestry in front of it yeah okay as you take the tapestry and you put it around you grab on the ends of it and you jump in the air it jumps with you and lands with you it's a very heavy tapestry most tapestries the amount of craftsmanship that goes into it the material-- this one in particular it falls very very heavily against the wall and doesn't really gather any air or-- okay as you throw the tapestry on top of the skull-- nothing happens it's just fun to mess with you guys all right so you guys progress down the stairway delight glancing in the next room and this is a small chamber you guys have seen before it's about 30 feet across on the far end there is a small circular stone platform about six inches thick that has deep inset runes carved in a circular pattern across it it's less polished than the ones you've seen at the lyceum in emon but it is definitively the last teleportation circle you took to the cavern that housed general krieg where you had your encounter correct you actually distinctly recall the pattern to the best of your ability now i want you to go ahead and make a wisdom check 20 yeah you recall the exact pattern through leading the way stepping from stone to stone to stone you guys following his pattern you manage to make your way all of you including trinket who has to (bear grunts) guide you through you make your way all the way across the room to the teleportation circle and this is the end of this portion of the hallway what do you wish to do go ahead and make a survival check true i was giving this more as a means of giving the trained tracker a better look into this i'll give you a simple perception check as you're not quite sure but with keyleth's help that will give you advantage it's hard to tell this room itself is pretty dark the little sconces that hold this low flicker of eternal arcane light they're just gently flickering on the sides of the walls in the low light it's hard to make out any details of the ground and for the most part the stonework here seems unchanged there were four orbs and then one eye showed up in one of the orbs and then all four cracked okay as each one of you step on individually onto the platform there's a brief moment of the wind beneath your stomach being lifted and you feel those butterflies hit as suddenly your imagery shifts and immediately you find yourself standing on a similar platform elsewhere as you step off as you feel force pushing you forward as each individual starts appearing behind in rapid succession immediately you notice the air change to extremely cold looking around you can see there directly near you there are a few stalagmites with a little layer of snow and ice on it and there are a couple patches of ice that have solidified on parts of the floor across the way you can see immediately a large portion of the entire tunnel has collapsed there's just piles of just rocks and stones that have filled about 60 to 65% of what was previously general krieg or as you found the name to be bonescythe-- brimscythe sorry brimscythe's chambers all the rocks have crumbled onto where the dragon hoard that you were rage-looting before currently resided now just held beneath the boulders and rocks there are pockets of the cave that are walkable to the left it ends to where the boulders and rubble had fallen to the right it continues outward towards the outside of the mountain where you guys recall stepping to the edge of the precipice and you notice that this mountain was veryvery high up in the mountain range somewhere in the world where there was just ice and snow-capped mountains as far as you could see into this valley of high crags you recognize it as the cliffkeep which is the large mountain range to the north of tal'dorei which contains kraghammer the very south base contains gatshadow and it's where the umbra hills leads up into-- you don't know where in that range it's a huge mountain range but it's in that range make a perception check (sings) make a perception check everybody who wants to look around percy keyleth all right the combined vision of you three glancing about you see there are scattered bits of gold and silver occasionally visible around the floor but they're all independent and probably thrown about during the scuffle or the collapse you guys notice there are bits of dragon bone trapped beneath the rocks exposed elements of these bones appear to be scraped and already sundered by somebody harvesting the remains the long-decayed remains of brimscythe you also notice there are two tunnels to the north and south side of this chamber across from where you guys entered they're smooth about ten feet in diameter and both carve into the heart of the rock 20 okay the way these tunnels are created and you've seen umber hulks and things of that nature carved through there is a rough aspect to that digging and burrowing process where the earth itself has an uneven you know a general purposed direction but is in itself a very haphazard just grab and tear what's in your way type form of burrowing these are round and smooth okay you guys can do that no in fact one of them is burrowing through the actual rubble on the north side by where the hoard was buried okay as you step up and look about the rubble the best you can make out is parts of the rock and you know the rock here has been set since the collapse of this side of the tunnel there are a series of scratch marks across the set stones and rocks here meaning that something large has rummaged through the rubble here something with bladed or clawed appendages has been here and has very viciously or hurriedly attempted to find its way through the rubble you also notice there is to the immediate left and northwestern side of this cavern a small alcove that just disappears into the wall out of sight no that was there before yeah you and dragons-- yeah as your favored enemy make a-- make a nature check with advantage because it's a dragon dragons are magical entities this would be more arcana they're magical entities i'll give you either/or what did you get okay these marks across could very easily have come from a dragon a very large one you also notice that there are elements of the rocks amongst this rubble that there appears to be soot and singe marks across it there are a couple that can burrow and dig through rock and stone in particular the blue dragon the one that you guys defeated in here can burrow naturally as can the white dragons they're natural burrowers though not the most intelligent of the chromatic dragons you also know that some of the metallic dragons also like the brass dragon is a burrower not that smooth those come from something else you inspecting the alcove as you look inside the alcove immediately you see in the shadow and what little bit of light is coming from the outside part of the tunnel and it is pretty obscured here i would recommend putting a torch up if you have one okay you spark up a torch you inspect the inside of this alcove and immediately you see the reflection of the light across the surface of something something humanoid standing there in wait you draw your weapon and aim it what you can see as you take a moment is an older man wrinkled in face eyes open mouth agape in fear his arms out before him back to the wall on the inside frozen solid investigation check it's hard to tell what may have frozen him the temperature here is very cold he may have just frozen to death but his face his expression leads you to believe that this was more a moment of duress more immediate than a slow subtle over time his clothing is very very well-made there is embroidery across the sleeves and the base of these robes he appears to have jewelry on him he has not quite a fu manchu but a mustache that extends beyond here the hair is braided and goes to his lower back he is human hunched and that's about the most you can make out at this visual state the resemblance is uncanny no on top of being purely human and no one you've ever recognized no the northern tunnel the smooth tunnel as you bring your torch over whoever's inspecting the north one you don't have to but as you guys look up having low-light vision helps in this circumstance as well you can see a little bit of a glistening as you peer into the smooth tunnel ahead of you you can see that where the rock was burrowed through a portion of it has opened up a pocket and there's a small fountain of gold spilling into the tunnel not like a perpetual-- it looks like whatever tore through here gold pieces that were buried as part of the collapsing tunnel were exposed and spilled into the tunnel the frozen man is very dead what elements of the individual that you've heard about does match some of the description of this individual okay the spell does require the corpse to be able to speak so you would have to thaw him okay it's going to take you a little bit but using your simple druidic powers you're using cantrips essentially or your fire hands yeah so it'll take you a little while but you begin to thaw the corpse what's everyone else doing you guys step along you go with vex into the tunnel you're watching the south area as they pass you and you're currently thawing is trinket coming with you guys or is trinket staying with you in the tunnel okay cool and you're with you start scooping the gold and you can see now some of this appears to have been taken someone has been through here and it looks like there has been some attempts at looting this area it looks like someone has already pulled in here and there's an empty pocket there but you start pulling gold out and scooping it into the bag of holding as you guys are walking away you feel this lurch in the floor all you guys begin to feel this vibration in the ground it gets louder and more violent you see the coins on the ground beginning to rattle and move make a nature check it feels like an earthquake as the shouting has happened towards the center of the room the ground explodes there is a blast of shrapnel shale that bursts in the vicinity no one is immediately there so none of you are harshly impacted but you see erupting from the ground a large form begin to burst out of the ground okay you guys see this form now in the low light emerge ten 15 20 25 feet up this long cylindrical mass curves up and begins to shift as it does like a giant arm it twists around and stares at the room and what you see before you is this elongated wormlike structure where a giant mouth opens up with rows and rows of sharp teeth on the interior of its toothy maw deal with it it's the perfect circumstance for the term as you see strands of saliva pull apart and you see a very hint of color beneath the dark surface a deep purple tone to its thick segmented hide no you have not and that's where we're going to leave tonight's session (yelling) so next week we're going to pick up with that chaos we'll all pitch in i'm kind of serious don't do that we'll pick up at the start of this encounter next thursday things with tremorsense are fun you'll find out you haven't had a chance to count that's what adventure is you really don't have to but it was an option (singing) critical role
