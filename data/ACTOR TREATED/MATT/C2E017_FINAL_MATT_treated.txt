welcome back everyone as we watch laura complain about her macaroni salad macaroni salad is the wild west of culinary delights daredevil laura bailey ladies and gentlemen bringing it back in the mighty nein in the city of zadash long in the dwendalian empire you've made a small name for yourself in a few factions you've done a deed or two for the king's hall here in service of the crown you've done a deed or two with the knights of requital that involved getting caught up briefly in a manhunt as you were loosely responsible for the death of the high-richter the high judge of the local court managed to make an introductory trade a deal if you will with the gentleman this subterranean figure of not the most legal of maneuvers you delved deep into one of the subterranean river tunnels beneath the city of zadash for him managed to clear out and recover materials from a long-buried research facility from the age of arcanum upon returning the deal was solid you managed to smuggle out horris who needed to be away from the town for the time being while this investigation was happening in doing so also managed to clear your names of the death of the high-richter upon returning back getting a few deeds done now waiting for this to blow over and hearing word that there is no longer a manhunt for a number of you in cahoots to this you begin to prepare for the coming harvest close festival now we're getting close to the third of the month of fessuran you've all managed to prepare in the ways you want got a few things on your side you've delved into some of the mysteries of the beacon that you maintain you've retrieved your forever alcoholic flask that's where we'll begin today friends as the early morning creeps up upon you the chilled morning air has left a bit of ice and mist crawling across areas of the city floor from outside your window here in the leaky tap tavern however though it is a gloomy morning there is already a general air of celebration around glancing across more people are now shifting out into the street and city around you music is beginning to creep into the vicinity and you can hear muffling through the nearby walls as you all awaken hearing this outside what do you wish to do yep just more understanding of the same notes you read before from what remains of the tome you managed to quickly grab the cliff notes of it as you glanced through it and the more information you pulled from it filled out that your thoughts on those tidbits were correct yeah there's been a few days you would've had time it is the morning you have awoken-- she takes the beacon focusing on this strange artifact that you procured from the grip of the xhorhasian assassin you feel yourself extend into it and now being your first time to focus on it it's a lot to take in you feel your essence shift into this space this strange dimensional between though not fully understanding it you're brought the same image of dozens of yourself and this sense of infinity there before you you see the strange gray mote and you reach out in the way that you saw caleb's hand reach at that moment you feel it shift and vanish into your chest the warmth sifting into the center of your rib cage and then your eyes focus once more and you're back in your chamber all right roll an attack i mean if you're not dodging yeah then you hit her well it's one plus your strength modifier you take four points of damage from a sheer punch to your shoulder okay i think she is dodging this one so roll for this one i'll say you're proficient in unarmed because you're just punching sure you add your strength modifier and your proficiency modifier she does manage to step out of the way now being more defensive from giving her a dead leg as you ask this question yasha is not in the room you have a map nogvurot is actually northward a little bit east of rexxentrum all right so you guys start heading downstairs who all is gathering down there with them all right everybody yasha you napped in the side alleyway in the open air sleeping with one eye open being careful as you wake up in the cold morning mist the mist has caused this dampness around your chin and hair-- your glorious beard right there frost beard no it gets really cold in the early morning and bits of frost have gathered at the edges of your hair so you brush off it a bit as you gather yourself and look out past the street the music's already starting to swell very strongly from a distance and a few musicians come by playing on their own some folks are starting to rouse and begin cooking things the smell of meats and fresh morning meals are beginning to find your nostrils and you decide you probably should check in you come in the rest of you all gather in the bottom tavern area of the leaky tap what would you like to do there's a new female who's running the bar she is now also coming to consciousness she's coming around to preparing the bar passed out face down looks to be in her early 50s or so long black hair that goes just past the chest area-- respectfully choosing words laura past her heaping bosom what do you want me to say laura bailey forward-thinking feminist (laughter) it's all right that's not going to happen anyway this female you haven't seen before who's in the process of running the bar very much in the same way that you saw wessek the dragonborn or previous before that claudia human 50s long black hair what can i get you easy enough to do i'll be right back and she goes and fetches you a drink all right so for this part of the festival-- are you going for an ale or a stiff drink not in the tavern currently it seems most everyone outside is walking in one direction though a lot of the folks that are starting to gather are all heading past the entranceway and heading in a leftward path from looking out from the tavern there you go you have seen people walk with various drinks in their hand without an issue before fjord has left the schrödinger's skeleton conversation go for it molly gives chase at this point now the chilled late morning beneath the cloud covered skies the streets are filled with all manner of people and families walking with baskets and colored streamers behind them the large banners of silk of the autumn colors that were previously being placed up in the streets are in full display the gentle wind is causing them to flicker and flap as the music weaves with the sound of the fabric small bands of bards and musicians mark nearly every street intersection filling the air with music poems and cheer it's a very stark difference to the lock-down that held the city over the past week and a half or so the closer you begin to follow the crowds as they move along hearing the chuckles of children and the conversations and laughter that seem to burble out of every street corner it pushes you in the direction of the pentamarket that's when the smells of spices and incense begin to come in waves as you follow the sauntering crowds eventually that smell overcome by the smell of cooked meat pies and roasted vegetables billowing from the various food carts that line the corners of the streets before you the flickering of the wind is now this weird syncopation that's blending with the sound of the distant drums and ocarinas and flutes that are beginning to pipe into the strange din in the streets you see a number of games of skill and chance that have been set up in the distance too amongst the crowds as people begin to weave through to the left you can see someone loudly proclaiming want to play trebuchet anyone and down the way another voice calling out king's vault you can see more games in the distance beyond there more stages are set up with food and it's a veritable smörgåsbord of celebration what do you guys want to do the guards are relaxed but there's definitely a large presence and in fact a number of the games are run by the guards in fact trebuchet as you approach you see two guards male and female that are both in the process of lifting a three or four year old girl and she has a sandbag in her hand they're like one two three and she throws it and it gets close but stops before the basket but they cheer her on yay and set her down the kid runs off and grabs the bag and comes back and they lift her again they go one two-- and they give her even more of a swing so she gets a little more distance it hits the edge and then tips off to the side and they go aww and the crowd who had gathered around awws with her the little girl smiles and gives them a hug and then runs off one of the guards turns as you guys begin to approach and shouts to the crowd trebuchet anyone wish to play five copper for three throws sipes the other guard goes all right pulls up three of the sandbags and hands them to you that basket there and that line there you see that they were in between for the kids' reach but there's about a ten-foot distance of small thin carpet that's placed behind the line leading to this open wicker basket that's about a foot and a half wide you have to throw overhead facing away you are more than welcome to try i'd love to see that happen that is not necessary as you stand there you take the sandbag and in a trebuchet-like motion lob it overhead without quite looking assuming the direction go ahead and make a dexterity check with disadvantage please you lob it and hear (pained grunt) and everybody goes oh and you turn around you turn around you can see the mother of the small kid that was first throwing and she's rubbing the side of her face she goes ah it's fine looks up at you and goes come on she grabs her kid's arm and they both leave deeper into the crowd all right try again as you one two-- you go to heave the sack and as it does it gets caught on part of your breastplate and as you pull upward there's a (ripping) as sand goes scattering into the sky around emptying the bag and pouring over you into your eyes (spitting) laughter starts to gather in the crowd around and some small clapping well you have one more throw which one of you is taking the other throw oh perfect there you go that's ridiculous jester yasha how do you want to do this they literally shot put fjord about three or four feet (surprised grunt) no he gets about four feet before he goes face first into the carpet the carpet balls up in front of him as he skids for another foot foot and a half with his feet up in the air before they come to rest there's a dust cloud there's a loud gathering of voices going ooh and then silent as the music plays in the distance the female guard goes and straightens out the carpet to get it right five copper oh that's right then by all means because you're looking away it's not a hard dc but-- 19 (whoosh) (thud) whoa the crowd begins cheering yeah they hand you a second one at the end jester you throw it with all your strength and it goes straight up hits you in the top of the head and dangles off one of your horns all right as it arcs it lands there's a little poof of dust behind it only gets about four feet from you unfortunately however we do have one successful in and they reach over into a satchel on the side and pull out-- a fresh strawberry for the victor it's actually pretty tasty fresh sweet it's delicious oh we don't sell the strawberries you can buy them further in here you pay for the prestige of a victory and a strawberry if you get all three you get a candied apple while this was transpiring you guys go to catch up while caleb and nott have approached the young half-elven woman who is shouting king's vault as you approach you see she has her hair tied back and she's barking with this utmost confidence king's vault come play anyone come to the front show us your majesty of attention well you place either a silver or a gold piece up and i will-- and she pulls up three silver cups i will place it underneath one of these mix it around pay attention guess the right one get your coin back plus one get it wrong coin stays with me simple game yes at least onto the table she takes the center cup (click) cup's over it all righty that being the case i would like you both to roll a perception check strangely it does not as soon as she finishes the rotation she stops and goes very well and you has to be the right one has to be the center she tips the cup indeed the silver is there congratulations with that your earnings doubled and gives you a secondary silver a silver of course coin goes down cups over it now there's a small crowd gathering now people are starting to watch there was a victory apparently and some cheers she begins shifting and shifting and shifting and shifting eyes focused on you starting to look strangely at you very well choose now go ahead and roll a perception check you were paying attention all of a sudden you lost it looking up at her eyes you were so caught off guard by her staring at your fairly well-concealed goblin visage but seemingly not enough as she has a curious raised eyebrow that spooks you for a second you go oh shit you lost track of the cups total of 20 on the perception okay what are you going to pick make a sleight of hand check as you begin to pull your hands up and mutter your incantations she goes ahem no funny business i could tell ha ha now the middle she pulls the cup back empty aw a good try scoops the coin off the table well if you have 200 gold you are more than welcome to place a gold piece up here as well very well take care of your green friend there at this point you guys turn around and you see the rest of your party has caught up to you fjord covered in dry dust you glance around keeping an eye open as you guys continue you've now hit the deeper edge of the pentamarket the crowds around you are fairly dense at this point there are people laughing and talking they're carrying various baked goods that are fresh out of the nearby carts or oven the smell creeps into your senses and takes over from that point children run past and bump you in the side some are holding two ends of a streamer and the streamers continue past and flap around hitting people it's adorable and delightfully intense the guard presence is very much felt here but everyone is in high spirits you get the sense that everyone has been waiting to get to this festival to this moment here it's a much different atmosphere than the gala you had seen a week before in the tri-spires oh there are quite a few mead stands so it's easy enough for you make an investigation check very easy to find through a couple of sleight questions to some of the noncompetitive barkers you manage to find a small meadery stand that's near the outskirts of one of the large arena structures that you haven't seen used since you arrived in this city as you approach the older guy there with this curled and unkempt chin-beard that looks like part of it isn't growing on the right side you approach and he has all this thick dark jugs of mead and he is like hey you want some mead i have mead that'll get you fucked up might taste like piss still he picks up one jug (sniffs) that one and hold it out for you to smell it's pretty strong it smells slightly acrid but not in a bad way just in a strong mead way welp depends what you want do you want strong or do you want tasty you got to pick that'll be a nice fair filled cup for a silver he pulls up three jugs he says this end tasty this end fuck you up this one little bit of a little bit of b grabs the same stuff that beau got the heavier thick stuff pours gives you a cup full of it that'll be a silver piece takes it it's strong the aftertaste isn't too bad it's the initial weird sour vinegary impact but then the sweetness comes in afterward it sets well and it's strong as you guys are walking around and keeping an eye you do see there is another stand that has an elevated platform called titan's grasp there are four soldiers of the righteous brand the empire military that are currently manning it they're wearing their plate mail of silver and dark-crimson design a large cubed stone two feet by two feet is set on top of this platform with a metal bar that is wedged beneath it that it's leaning against the metal bar has a cylindrical center point like a fulcrum there is a large hammer that one of them is currently holding to the side as you begin to approach you see one guy there who's currently spitting into his hands grabs the hammer (grunts) as he hits the metal bar the stone goes (slight scraping) barely shifts he sets down the hammer and everyone's like yay and he goes i moved it steps down off the platform you approach the four soldiers that are up there one of them comes up to you the one who has the hammer at his side after retrieving it from the last person goes hey all right are you willing to play some titan's grasp eh ashley and all right it's five silver an entry single swing but winner gets the current pot which stands at-- and he turns to one of the other guards who goes through a small bag and goes that's going to run about 43 gold all right one swing you one swing for you take as many as you want no one's turned it over this morning yet who's going first oh i like that your friend's got confidence in you all right big missy hands you the heavy hammer it's not too heavy in your grasp it's not very well balanced either it's not a battle-ready hammer it's designed for this type of a show experience you get the sense this hammer would not be the most effective for this it might be intentional it's your turn people start gathering you're up on an elevated two foot platform there they have the metal bar fulcrum all set beneath the stone hammer's in your hands what do you do this is a strength check yeah you have advantage while you're raging roll twice take the higher and add your strength modifier 17 (grunts) (ringing impact) you hit the metal bar the stone (scraping) falls back into rest it's a heavy stone the stone is resting on the lower part and there is a fulcrum round centerpiece to it you're trying to hit on this end to push the stone to roll over it moved slightly and falls back into place good try that was very strong there lass don't worry well pay another oh you did tell me this when you're counting this bud go ahead second swing you get advantage while raging so-- you pull back and the one guy is looking over to one of the mates on the side and starts laughing suddenly (impact) (scraping) (larger impact) the stone shifts slams on to the other side all four of them go (gasp) (cheering) now suddenly the crowd around that you didn't notice gathering start cheering yay looks over to the one guard who had the pouch okay then congratulations hands it over yeah go for it you take a moment to count through while staring at him it comes out to roughly about 43 gold worth of silver including the ten silver that you put into it or not including the ten silver so in addition to that it would be 44 gold worth but it's mostly silver pieces all the guards go over and shift the stone back over onto the fulcrum they pull in and bring out about a gold piece each to throw five gold back into the pot they go all right back up who wants in the guards are going wait into the-- yup roll a strength check add your strength modifier (resounding impact) as you slam down again the stone goes (impact) it rolls over a second time seemingly the fulcrum set after you knocked it over prepared her for a better slam as it hits the four soldiers of the righteous brand look at each other we're going to take a break here for a second return here in about 30 minutes they hand the money over to you get five six gold they're going to inspect the hammer inspecting the fulcrum inspecting the stone and they're basically in the process of wondering if they had somehow been cheated out of this they can't find anything at this point now the smell of warm candied fruit begins to waft past you you glance over and can see there is a large cart that is selling all sort of sweet fruit that have been coated in sugar some have a sticky syrup exterior and there are candied apples available for purchase depends on how much you guys want to purchase if any you can see the older woman who's there who a little bit portly with a big smile rosy cheeks pulls from behind the counter-- they're still cooling off you can see a small tray that has about six caramel covered apples that you see are still gleaming in the little bit of light that's coming from the cloudy sky all right that's going to be-- two copper each for seven that'll put you at 14 copper there's six caramel apples here and you have seven with you candy apple all right for you and the six for you (shouting) all out of caramel apples for the time being but return here in an hour there's this little girl across the way who's like-- you approach and she gets scared as you get closer you can see she looks a little disheveled probably one of the less well-off people of the city of zadash you don't see a parental figure in the near vicinity just runs off go ahead and make a perception check she disappeared into the crowd it does not appear that there is a strong presence of tome and/or book retailers as part of the celebration unfortunately there's games there's food there are celebratory tapestries in the colors of autumn you see small pressed crests of the empire that are used to either hang over your door as a good luck charm or to use as decor on the interior a lot of it's knick-knacks and general collectibles most everyone out here it's a craft fair on top of being a celebratory-- there's a bunch of random odds and ends that people collect or purchase to add to their home interior glancing about you do see the occasional person of the cobalt soul robes but they're not selling anything here okay (laughter) yes actually there is one that is an insignia or an interpretation of the symbol of the platinum dragon it is silver threads among a standard sky-blue coloring there's several different dragon heads that are woven into the pattern there's almost an embroidery for as much as you've known about the platinum dragon and the religion it's surprisingly gaudy one of the people running the booth quickly as you see a mid-30s half-elf man with a bit of chin scruff and very short hair leans around the corner and goes oh for the platinum dragon this one was handcrafted by me and my mate over the period of about two months hand embroidered very difficult very exquisite for the entire piece the central piece you're inquiring about that'll run you about ten gold pieces we have smaller almost doily-sized renditions of it back here he takes the back and unfolds it entirely but can't quite get the full arm length to get up there he's like this one's about six and a half seven feet from top to bottom can be used as a rug should you be so inclined and you aren't quite a fan of the platinum dragon and want him beneath your feet-- right away he takes it begins folding it up with one of his other compatriots they take the twine and manage to fasten it in three places he says we're happy to bring joy to you and the house of your great deity they hand you this relatively massive tapestry that's almost seven feet end to end as this is happening you see that there are two other games you're now seeing the central space here you've walked past this structure it's this small forum-like circular stone building that's been emptied and closed now there's crowds walking in and out the front doorway and around it are where a lot of these games are set up you do see one that has a big banner that says eagle shot there is one large central platform where it looks like this is where a lot of public presentations are given here in the pentamarket it's currently set up with a central table and a number of members of the righteous brand as well as one that is a very well-adorned human male with brown hair that's pulled up into a topknot he has a big thick beard looks like a handsome fellow and he's currently barking out something about the military you're too far away to make out the details of it that one has a wooden carved sign that says soldier's spirit it's currently put on the edge of the stage the hearth of the allhammer would be on the other side of this large forum-like structure eagle shot yes as you approach there are two crownsguard that are helming a small compact archery range there's a series of trees that are at the very back that mark what would normally be an alcove in this small park but within this alcove there are three archery targets that are slightly off from each other at different distances they have a rack with different bows and a whole cache of arrows that are set to the side the first guard turns around oh little girl good to see you what can i help you with what do you--  which you still have a bolt nocked in this hand crossbow he's like put the--  little miss you shouldn't be waving that around in public i'm not sure how you got a hold of that where's your mother unfortunately by the rules you have to use one of the provided bows please put-- sir your daughter is a danger to the general public right now well she has not been trained proper use of that in a space in which is it safe for other people to be around i'm just saying could i see that for a second takes it the crossbow and pulls the string back removes the tension hands it back there would either of you like to play some eagle shot behind them somebody like-- the other guard behind is currently setting up an older woman who is in the process of getting the arrow lined up and it keeps falling out of her grip and the other guard's like no put it here and getting ready finally fires an arrow and it goes and disappears past one of the trees oh no very well that's one silver piece for three shots closest bullseye if acquired you get a rat from a cage he pulls off from the side here you see a small stack of wicker cages with rats inside them get yourself a pet rat if you go ahead and get that middle bullseye about part way across that range there you win yourself one of these finely crafted wooden swords they have this decently whittled wooden sword the center cross hilt for it is strapped with twine tightly swings it a couple times and sets it down lays it against and it rests and hits the ground off to the side now the farthest one over there-- and you watch as the old woman pulls another shot and it almost hits the far target before it gets stuck in the tree about ten feet behind it hit that one way back there and that one will get you this he pulls up a haphazard stitched doll with button eyes like the stitches are too wide so it looks like the crosses behind it are visible there's no mouth there's like matted twine hair some felt-like material that's made a crown and a cape of our fine king bertrand dwendal he gives you a look like you said a bad word he goes i suppose he glances back it's probably about 80 feet it is an attack roll and it's a short bow he said about 80 feet but the farthest one's about 100 feet which means it is in its second range increment so the one in the back is at disadvantage well let's go ahead and see rogue proficiencies it's a simple ranged weapon you should be i'm pretty sure you are yep simple weapons you are proficient with the short bow who's going first if you don't mind me asking of course understood hands you one of the short bows off of the side and three arrows they're all right in their construction oh-- i-- no continue which target are you aiming for the farthest all right with disadvantage add your dexterity modifier i do not think you're proficient-- well as a wizard you might be actually for simple weapons nope no you are not well it's simple ranged weapons but those count as simple weapons it gets about 40 or so feet before it gets stuck in the dirt he's like that was good you nock your secondary arrow take a shot this one gets about five feet further and almost hits a squirrel you hear (squeaking) and it darts off into a nearby bush this one gets 40 feet which is halfway there before it hits the ground and sticks into the dirt as soon as it finishes there's like a that was good go fetch that the other guard runs out and grabs the arrows to retrieve them that is surprising well a fine harvest close to you friend and for your daughter hands the bow over and a set of three arrows proficiency and your dex mod this one arcs it almost gets near the target but ends up veering off to the right and ends up vanishing behind one of the secondary targets near the tree he says yeah that was better than your father this one hits the actual base of the far target misses the target entirely but it hits the actual plank of wood that's holding it up it hits the bottom of the target no bullseye but you hit it he's like that was actually very good right away little missy grabs three more arrows one silver for three shots six more shots all right there you go as you pull back perfect bullseye into the farthest target there's this brief pause as the guard spins around and goes what--  middle one is not at disadvantage both arrows-- we're talking like disney robin hood-style one arrow next one splits the first arrow the guard's still recovering from the first bullseye he's like what both hit at the same time the guard looks slowly over towards you well done here's your doll two swords two rats you now have in your inventory two rats in rat cages two wooden swords-- a hand-stitched doll of king bertrand dwendal while this is happening jester you make your way around the large forum and there you see the hearth of the allhammer you've passed it before and you can see it's the domed iron structure it's been left to rust a bit at the edges the tops of the dome are polished where it's easily accessible but the very peak of the dome is a little bit red brown rusted there are a number of open arches in the inside and you see the large central forge that marks the center of the temple you do see the large anvil that marks there has the symbol of the allfather printed on each side and acts as both a ceremonial anvil for the creation of religious artefacts and items as part of worship and as the central statue for worship itself that is the closest thing there is in this temple to a central focus of worship it's not busy on the inside because right now everyone's focus is on the actual celebration there are three individuals that are manning the interior of the temple one of which is the herald each temple in the city has a herald that's the keeper of that temple it's a female dwarf dark brown hair and three long braids that trail past to the middle back with a chainmail robe on that descends past the knees and is currently sitting on a bench and eating dried meat out of a small pouch and people watching as people walk by the temple nobody's in there actively worshipping at the moment do you go in trying to avoid attention or are you announcing yourself as you arrive as you walk in a voice in the corner from the direction of where the herald was goes miss if you need something don't be afraid to let me know we're just sitting around of course what do you disguise yourself as you no that's not an extension of-- okay as you come around the corner and make your way in you saunter in the far end of the temple through one of the arches that marks the interior come in through the shadow and the herald once again goes if you need something right over here all right that's fine goes back to-- (chuckles) already seems taken aback by your presence what do you want to do well i mean there's people in there there's the herald who's sitting in the back eating on the opposite end of the anvil and there's two other folks that are on the outskirts of the arches looking out into the crowd just people watching as you begin to pray the two others that are on the outside who've noticed you enter their attention doesn't wander to you for too long before they go back out to the celebration people walking by and people watching in general you're on the opposite side of the anvil from the herald who's still chewing on her meat what do you want to do just for the sake of presentation because you're doing this with a bit of haste knowing that you're under pressure go ahead and roll a performance check 18 as you quickly begin to finish this heart traveler was here you hear (yawning) across the way from the herald you stop for a second-- no reaction continue going you finish up the art piece one of the other guardians of the temple begins to turn around and walk back towards the herald and you pull back for a moment but they turned away from you and it seems that you've managed to go this far without being noticed you finish up your last heart the exclamation point and the underline of the traveler (tinkling) just (straining) you put the pamphlets there on the side slip them beneath the offering bowl at the base of it make a sleight of hand check on that one because that will be creeping into the view of the herald as you place it on top the voice on the opposite end goes do you need help there dearie as you get up and start walking away the herald stands up and begins walking towards the other side of the anvil there's like speedily running granny into the crowd and as you get-- drop disguise-- in the middle of the crowd still in your disguise as you're charging into the crowd behind you you hear a voice (scream) that old woman find her there's screaming and you hear this ruckus as people around start looking behind at the shouting sound as you dart around the corner drop disguise and as you do you can now see the herald and the two keepers of the temple are now pushing through the crowd looking searching like has anyone seen an old woman is describing you as best they can and it looks like there's a bit of commotion going on as you begin to disperse into the crowd making your way-- you hear a crunch sound and your hand shakes for a second and you look down and a mysterious secondary bite was taken out of the apple they have a special relationship while this is happening you head to the military stand you said anybody going with beau you guys approach at this point towards the soldier spear you see this larger platform in the middle of the pentamarket there you see the central military figures wearing ornamental armor with a top knot there is a table set up there with these benches and you can see there are two burly men one who is this hairy heavy thick woodsman type who is wearing a leather apron and-- yes exactly he's like super butch hand clasped with a trained soldier who's wearing elements of the righteous brand armor but has taken bits of it off and they're both going (grunting) they're in the middle of an arm wrestling match and they're both tensing back and forth (grunting) before the brawny guy slams the soldier's arm down to the table he goes (yelling) the crowd around goes (cheering) there's a shout and cheer and the gentleman in the center goes that was well done well done and congratulations to you now that you've proven yourself my friend would you be interested at all in joining the righteous brand being a strong warrior in his own right and the guy's like ah piss off i don't want to he goes like it's a good wage gold per day fed all the equipment you need you help keep the empire safe no all right very well anyone else well we are having a contest to see who here is the strongest well so far it's that gentleman points over to the heavy burly fellow who's off to the side he's currently flexing and cracking his wrist i mean you don't have to probably but don't be surprised if other contenders start following you around the town to try and take your title not to us but it's a fun place to display your skill and talent plus we're always looking for some fine young soldiers to come and join us out there on the fields to take down the xhorhasian evils and keep all these fine folks here well taken care of yeah he goes no you're not-- points over and that large forum building that circular forum building that you saw that now the crowd's starting to wash into that had been closed off previous weeks he goes that that is the victory pit that will be happening in a few hours but you're welcome to compete here if you're feeling so feisty what's your name ah recruiter leopold wanstiker pleasure to meet you recruiter leopold wanstiker w-a-n-s-t-i-k-e-r so top knot guy yep whoever wins this gets to go up against our finest solder who should be back from his lunch break here in the next ten minutes or so we have the new challenger beau let's see he points over to the grizzled-looking beastly man who's currently chugging down the final bits of a tankard of ale spins around wipes it off his beard and stands up yeah i'm coming he gets up onto the edge of the stage and goes well this is kendall (laughter) sits down at his stool puts his meaty arm out with the fingers and goes-- sure it is sweaty leopold goes one two three go ahead and make a strength check yep just a d20 add your strength modifier five at that center point you immediately begin to give to his grasp you see this slight grin begin to curl underneath his wiry beard as his arm begins to push you close to the edge of the table make another strength check 12 with that (slams) onto the table you lose knuckles a little bruised from the slam he gets up and is like ha well done though beau well done here he hands you a small piece of parchment that's rolled up and goes this is information about if you'd be so interested in coming and joining the righteous brand you can find us at the marrow keeps of the righteous brand on the outskirts of the northern end of zadash should you be so interested yes this is in the area of the signet wall which is the military district of the city anyone else another gentleman raises his hand and gets up on stage and they begin to do a showdown the two of them begin to go back and forth however that same beastly figure kendall still manages to defeat the guy and send him to the table get up again and ha then at some point shortly thereafter leopold goes ah he returns he returns (chuckling) gunther prast our finest soldier here in the city would like to challenge the current standing contender you watch now as this massive behemoth of a man like the mountain from game of thrones about seven foot 350 pounds guy wearing the righteous brand silver and red armor gets up onto the stage (heavy steps) clean-shaven except for this perpetual five o'clock shadow that doesn't seem to leave his square jaw his hair is trimmed super short and you see the receding hairline curling back into a widow's peak sits on the table puts his arm out there and you can see the huntsman kendall for the first time lose his cool you watch as the two of them grasp together and they're going to begin to roll off you watch as the hands tighten and with that gunther begins to twist the arm further down further down you can see the huntsman character is starting to grimace however pushes it back in the center now they're currently neck and neck once again gunther pushes him back and with that final hit wham kendall is taken out like (groaning) grasps his hand and rubs his fingers and darts off the stage seemingly shamed in front of a crowd of people everyone's like oh there's now probably about 30-40 people who watched that last match he looks human he's just huge leopold is looking over the crowd goes would you like to try your hand at our finest warrior come on up miss-- miss (whispers) yasha (regular volume) miss yasha our new-- (cheering) hello sits down puts his elbow on the table with a heavy slam grasps you both your arms-- he's taking a moment and looking you over like he's studying something he's trying to make eye contact moving around as leopold is talking up this whole this whole all right come watch now here is our finest-- and it fades away in the background as gunther who's leaning forward now says interesting styling i've seen it before you're not from around here are you nothing just an observation i've been on the front lines long enough with that leopold walks up and goes three two-- make a strength check with advantage because he wasn't expecting it (cheering) natural 20 no joke no joke right there beautiful beautiful mwah as soon as you do that he catches it you both are caught in the center here tensing up the whole crowd goes ooh everything gets really tense and quiet as you're both flexing at this point now you do make eye contact as the anger is built up inside you make another strength check well she hasn't raged yet not on this roll you can't because you already rolled for it next time you can seven you feel yourself giving way your arm going further back towards the table you see this grin across his face his breath smells of mildewed bread and alcohol it wafts past your nose roll a strength check gunther yeah you get to roll another strength check with advantage they're down like two and a half three feet because you guys are on a raised platform they're about five feet from you because you are raging as he's pushing you down towards the table you muster up another breath of strength from inside with that you push him back to the center you're both at even keel roll again with advantage (grunt) he starts giving ground the sweat now beading across his forehead his nostrils are flaring that horrible smell of his breath is coming in bigger and more constant waves as he starts to (grunt) he looks up from his grip up into your eyes once more roll again sam and 14 he slowly brings you back up to the center roll again the crowd each time the shift happens the crowd is like ooh ah oh god ashley shit ten 14 (grunt) he rolled a seven plus five right up at the center roll again the crowd is going wild right now leopold's like leaning in now watching this happen marisha and (grunt) pushing him back roll again 22 he pushes you right back in the center rolled an 18 you guys are right there again at the fulcrum point the crowd is starting to go completely breathless at this point it's back and forth roll again he's starting to breathe really heavy 21 you push him back again you can see now the muscles are straining and popping the veins are bulging his breaths are getting heavier his shoulder is looking like it's almost dislodging as he's using his torso to push against it roll once more (grunt) (bang of arm against table) (cheering) leopold goes amazing show yasha and he runs up behind you and catches up to you as you step off the stage he steps off with you goes i'm sorry to bother you yasha that was an incredible-- have you any interest in all at joining the ranks of the righteous brand oh well think about it he goes into the small satchel and pulls out at rolled piece of paper and says it's a fantastic thing you would do for the empire if everyone here-- you look like a fine soldier and based on your skills up there you'd be a great help on the front line strangely enough there is no prize for this there is no buy-in it's merely for the bragging rights of the presentation it's a presentory-- no it talks about-- okay as you read it-- (laughter) no it speaks of the righteous brand and talks about all of the wonderful possibilities for glory it's housing and gear provided it's working in a good teamwork environment to protect the people of the empire it has opportunities to rise through the ranks and to become-- it talks about-- it pays one gold a day at start with possibility of raises from there the training is in bladegarden and after a period of training there it's three years minimum service in the military and then you can decide to stay or not it goes into a small print and says like desertion is illegal and brings imprisonment and fines as you guys are having this conversation there's a voice from the side that goes that was quite an amazing display if i say so myself as you turn and look you see there's a gentleman there who's tall a little over six foot very-- a gentleman not the gentleman he's a very strong looking human male with ruddy tan skin and long jet black hair that's braided in a single thick braid that goes past his waist in the back he's dressed in partial scalemail across the chest and part of the shoulders a dull iron color to it that's over his chest you see a heavy waistband of dull gray leather that's like a thick almost a foot thick piece around there and a rough-looking warhammer that's strapped to his side and he has his arms crossed and smiling widely at you with a very welcoming smile that was impressive that guy you just destroyed up there he's kind of a douche what's your purpose here are you looking for work ashley me or-- well mercenary work of course all right well first off my name is darrow what's your name yasha you said all right pleasure to meet you well i am the de facto leader of a mercenary band known as the stubborn stock we're out of guar on the menagerie coast but we've been hired for about a seven month stint so far by the empire and it's been paying pretty well we've had some pretty good scenarios here the retainer's been nice and honestly it's not bad to be paid to sit around in case they need us well when they need us to kill things to hunt things down there's a lot of business that they can't bring the military to and the crownsguard stay in the cities so they send us out and about that's only if they need us well it's contract you have to be there for their disposal we're stationed up in nogvurot and have been for the length of this contract but we were able to come down for this celebration and it's been not too bad it's good wage sit around occasionally hunt down some criminal xhorhasian terror that's come down from the mountains it's a pretty decent living if i say so myself and you look like a very capable soldier if i say again sure would you be interested (laughter) we have no pamphlet my band of esteemed warriors are planning to be in the victory pit later this afternoon we could very much use an additional soldier of your capability he turns and looks and seemingly for the first time notices the rest of your group goes like oh i'm terribly sorry i mean no disrespect-- hi-- but i do not understand that i do not wish to step on any toes here it was merely a curiosity what are you called the mighty nein very good he looks like-- that's impressive that's a good find good on you you know who that's supposed to be i was going to say a tiny asshole one and the same really well we're stationed in nogvurot but we're from a ways further than that (sighs) that has been an occasional problem yes we had been sent to investigate two of those instances and in all of them it seemed to be that they were stolen-- i'm sorry i do not know how much i can discuss of these with you-- make a general charisma check just to see if he trusts your face we've looked into it do not worry but we'll see how long the contract goes i do not know how much luck we'll have it's kind of a dire situation one of many things well not yet not yet just the ones that come too close in there've been a few excursions into the empire itself and that's why we're hired they're basically bringing everyone they can on hand to help keep the home fort defended what am i fighting right now oh we haven't been to xhorhas yet they've kept us in the empire so far yeah they keep the army on the eastern side but we're meant to find things that the army cannot be bothered to do no actually we've only really been in the empire for the first time this past half year and i've heard things about it and you know figured we'd come and try it they gave us a week off to come down here to zadash and me and my friends are going to take our best attempt at this oh well within our person-- including myself a grand total of six mighty warriors all six of us have our different techniques yes (laughter) i'm not going to tell you and it's not that kind of tournament anyway i do not mean to be a problem if ever you change your mind-- he pulls out a copper coin that's a little larger than a normal piece of copper and goes just ask around he tosses it to you and you take it it looks like a small copper platter coin-ish in its design and on it is printed the name of his group the stubborn stock well look for any place in a city where we might be or might not be and see if you've heard of us in the vicinity if they know where we are they'll bring you to us if they don't they will not one of our fellows makes them loosely he takes it and shows it off it's not made that well he goes it's functional more than it's beautiful i appreciate that all right anyway we have to go prepare for this tournament if you're standing around please come cheer us on that would be fantastic a pleasure to meet you mighty nein he heads off back towards the victory pit what errand are you on yeah a short jaunt not too hard to find a darkened corner where you can do it okay easy enough to do okay make an investigation check as you begin to pore through the crowd doing this you guys have noticed that caleb's been gone for a little bit yes wow yeah within a very short time asking a few questions and looking through part of the crowd one of them points over to the edge of the pentamarket on the northern side and over in that direction there are two of the robe-wearing individuals one of the monks that works within the archive itself and one looks to be wearing higher up robes you're not sure what that means or what the ranking is within the cobalt soul all right as you approach-- the one that's in the nicer dress you can see is apparently an elven woman you see these kind of long strands of blond almost silver hair that goes in front of the ears and the rest of the hair falls past the shoulders beautiful natural no makeup even for elven standards you can see a little bit of age this is an older elf in comparison to a lot of the brighter faces that turns to you of course what can we help you with make a deception check well a 13 okay well of course it is open to the public you're required to come when there is an available monk to escort you through the premises of course you cannot take anything from the archive itself but you're welcome to read while in the presence of one of our various monks and/or worshippers of the knowing mistress well the public portions of it yes yes just need to come on a day in which the archive is open and available sign in and you will be assigned one of our various attendees of the archive and you will have the run of the public library of which to read and make notes of you may take your own copy of notes but once of course it is only within the public space yeah well i'm glad you asked i'm jennah archivist jennah they are a little different they maintain their knowledge for those who are actually there as part of the curriculum you'll have to speak to the headmaster as well they have from what we know as we are not allowed either quite a decent cache of arcane knowledge as well there has been some sharing but they are particular that would be ornit i believe let me double check here so i don't say it wrong no that is no oremid hass yes yes yes that was a bit disconcerting definitely thankfully it is a well-defended tower the zauber spire has stood for quite some time and has its capabilities defending itself as we've seen well you should ask them how they did that you'll know as to why they're so secretive well i don't know we always go on specific business so you can certainly inquire i haven't attempted to go from the standpoint of a possible student but you could ask that is all right of course you as well happy harvest close as you return to the rest of the group you guys are met by a strangely adorned caleb with an interesting ensemble you guys are on the outside of the victory pit the crowds are starting to swarm into a central archway that's open right now you are in part of the crowd as the people are rushing past you guys gather your strength your interest your nerve you go in with the rest of the crowd that is now beginning to gather towards the front end of the victory pit as you step towards the central archway into the shaded interior of the main entryway we're going to take a break we'll be back here in a few minutes to pick up to this tournament and all that it entails tonight as part of our wyrmwood giveaway we have a bocote tabletop dice tray from our friends at wyrmwood very fancy leather interior it's very pretty that is actually yes you can have jester's dice box kind of tonight the keyword is celebration if you'd like to come into the twitch chat and enter the word celebration to become part of the drawing as long as you are in the us and canada outside of quebec otherwise you cannot enter i am very sorry laws are weird enter it only once any more than that and you may be disqualified we will come back at the end of the break with a winner to be announced until then we'll see you guys here in a few minutes [break] i'm sorry the fights will be soon oh you wish to enter oh entry may have already been closed let me ask he turns around and steps off of his pedestal and heads to this wooden door it's about ten feet behind and he shoves through closes behind him and slams a few moments pass and people begin filtering through still pushing past you and bumping you in the shoulders the door opens again across the way as you guys are having this conversation and the gentleman comes out again and goes quickly follow me you guys make your way through the crowd and follow him into this back chamber you enter with him there's a slight hallway that leads into a low-lit lounge with comfortable furniture with cushions there's some firelight a few torches set up in the chamber there is a window across the way that looks out into the open of the victory pit's main battle area you can see servants wandering in similar brown silks and robes as the barker but they're carrying trays of food you see guests in expensive clothing that dot the distant walls and areas of the chamber sitting atop these cushioned couches and talking in low voices to each other broken with the occasional laugh the older gentleman ushers you over and waves in the distance as a figure begins to approach this is another human man in probably his early 60s or so who has graying hair that is slicked back and even further thinned than the gentleman who first met you on the way in who has a very well groomed goatee that comes to an accentuated curve up underneath in the front he's wearing a finely tailored dark blue festival suit the barker says these are the ones who-- and the older guy goes ah it's far too late in the day we couldn't muster a-- very well i am yadaka brigman guildhead of the filigree house and organizer of this harvest tournament who are you and have you the coin to enter the mighty nein where are you from mighty nein yadaka brigman you are from everywhere you will be announced as from everywhere that's all right if that is what you require all right well we've warriors from around the marrow valley come to compete today many of which who'll have been on the front lines of the eastern wastes are you still eager to lose your coin and risk your life 20 gold pieces per fighter groups of five to eight are allowed to enter there are three rounds to this tournament each victory is 200 gold to be dispersed amongst your group and the winners that remain at the end split a 2000 gold purse whatever you bring in there is at your disposal to utilize with your group that would make four who have signed up for the tournament today you will brought down to the waiting/holding area and each group will be brought into the victory pit to face off with the chosen peril four groups you are the fourth to have signed up of course not you're fighting a number of creatures that have been acquired and kept for this tournament beasts and things that have been either found wandering over the ranges of xhorhas or have terrorized the local countryside and have been brought to us by the righteous brand for this sort of tournament there may very well be young lass good question well do you wish to join then present your coin what is your name very well thank you we've managed to squeeze you in at the last moment the rules are as such each team will face off with one of these encounters we've developed for this tournament continuing on if victorious to face another until the other teams fall you fall or the third round is completed should there be more than one victory team at the end you will divide the purse amongst you however these will increase in difficulty the further you remain you will not be allowed but the time it takes for the other teams to battle before you face once more previous years have shown us no more than maybe 20 minutes whatever you have in each round is what you go in with use your time wisely all of this will be displayed in front of the starosta the appointees of the crown and the elite of the tri-spires money and glory is here before you we have clerics on hand and outside of extenuating circumstances we've only had one true fatality in the past 20 years of running this festival so you should be all right at this point there's a bit of commotion at the front entrance where you guys entered where you see a figure rush in a young human man he's sweating longer blond hair past his ears he's wearing a very bright gold and red outfit and is carrying a satchel over one shoulder as he rushes in and talks to somebody he points over in the direction and heads up to where your group is yadaka goes i'm terribly sorry page the page looks up what business have you from the crown looking over his attire the page goes (breathing heavily) i must speak with the starosta immediately under order from king bertrand dwendal himself yadaka goes right come with me i apologize you'll have to give us just a moment he turns around urgent matters enjoy some feasting while you're here him and the page walk maybe 20 feet from you to a corner where you can see there is a central couch there where a few figures are sitting and they rush up all right so you roll a stealth check for your cat (laughter) as your cat begins to approach one of the servants goes you can't be in here and-- (laughter) not everyone's going to kick a cat into dust picks up frumpkin and begins to bring frumpkin away while the page begins gathering a breath and you now see a very well-dressed halfling with a curled mass of brown hair up top it's graying and white on the sides who sits up to meet with another important figure frumpkin has been pulled away your cat is being held by a servant being led back towards where you came like taking the cat outside okay servant's probably confused what're you guys doing all right there are the groups that are talking and eating there's the page currently engaging with the folks and the figure there's a couple of servants passing around trays of food what are the rest of you doing you have retrieved your frumpkin into your space there's another clap and you see two other figures get pulled from the other side to join the conversation by the couch okay make your stealth check with advantage you get advantage because of her blessing okay you saunter up at a relatively close distance make a perception check if you're trying to listen in well the box is an illusion (laughter) four you catch bits and pieces okay what you hear is the page hurriedly saying --which skies now darken brokenveil over 1000 dead the ashguard garrison is taken you hear this conversation a bit hush to hush and a little bit of (shushing) starosta peeks in a bit you only catch the next bit which goes what's the king's response then you hear the page respond and say --formally declared war on kryn dynasty and the wastes of xhorhas there's some more muttering you miss that you miss that (laughter) you miss that yadaka pipes in and goes starosta to announce anything like that would set panic and change nothing we are far from the fight for now let them have a day to rejoice we'll announce tomorrow you miss the next thing you miss the next thing the last thing you hear is the starosta say i'll send word to general grinbreaker and begin preparing her legion to move east tomorrow we'll notify the public but page return word to rexxentrum that zadash prepares to join the front now go the page turns and leaves okay which letter it's a pamphlet there are at the entrance where you came in and each side okay you back up towards where you guys came in and there's a crownsguard there arms crossed looking up i certainly hope so it's going to be a lot of fun to watch oh which one well i haven't seen them they keep those under wraps it's part of the surprise yeah (laughter) not us that's above our pay grade well you probably have to go to the king's hall and sign up for the crownsguard kiss ass for a few years and maybe then i don't know that's once again outside of my jurisdiction they keep a lot of things separate intentionally right appreciate that friend okay at this point the barker who met you originally says sorry to bother you but they're gathering the various teams down into the holding area i'll have to escort you please come with me as far as the-- right you look at it and there is similar design to some of the outfits and the-- yeah you pick up on it you guys are continuing to be escorted down past most everyone has filtered into their seats there's still stragglers finding their way in and as the day's sun is getting further into the mid-afternoon you guys are brought down to an area that is similar to that lounge area but far less in its decor and comfort this chamber has two windowed doors on the opposite side that are cut through windows that lead into the central arena you can smell the dust on the opposite side the interior is outfitted with about three dozen simple stools that are scattered about a few tables with cornucopias of fruits and meats that are set and a few folks you see are feasting on them there are two stationed healers of the platinum house of bahamut the platinum dragon they are the ones stationed there to prevent folks from dying and the other combatants in one corner there are five soldiers of the righteous brand one of which is gunther who are in the process of taking large handfuls of food and eating and getting themselves some energy for battle as soon as you enter they glance over and give a bit of a nod of notification gunther looking straight to you grabs an apple of some kind and throws it at you eat you'll need it it looks like amongst them there is one acting as leader or at least is in the process of discussing tactics among the small troupe though you can't hear exactly what he is saying an elven man with short brown hair and these sky blue piercing eyes who is in the process of giving orders to them then he walks off to the side pulls a blade out and begins practicing it's this very elegant almost dance-like blade technique on the opposite side of the room to them all leaning against the wall you see five dwarves and two gnomes that are all wearing black and gold variations to armor robes they are avoiding all social engagements and staring mad dogging everyone else in the chamber as soon as you enter all their eyes shift in your direction and they watch you as you step into the chamber in the center of them you see a gray haired dwarven women weathered skin and a surly grin as you approach gleaming these yellow teeth from beneath who gives a bit of a squinted stare at you as you pass by you see two battleaxes resting at the side of her belt hanging off of her armor then over by the doors snacking and looking out the window into the pit before you you see a group of six individuals in scuffed armor of green and brown with weathered armor and skin that shows experience and travel markings and accessories gives you a sense of inland menagerie coast heritage and there you see darrow who you had met earlier in the tournament who's leaning out the window he turns around as you enter and goes ah so you did indeed decide to join not too bad i'm excited to see how well you do i have not but i've been hearing about it i'm excited to give it my all as you say that's a good question i imagine that's less of my worry and more of theirs he points out to the rest of the people in the stands and goes i certainly hope they have ways to deal with that otherwise that's going to be a very unhappy day tomorrow for the people in the city that is not cryptic at all well the stubborn stock are my esteemed mercenary band friends this is the-- the mighty nein we met earlier at the places with the games all of them give a nod and then grunt and reach over and start shaking hands they seem of all the people in here the most friendly as soon as this happens the crowd outside starts cheering loudly the sounds of chaos begin to build the cheers swell and swell you hear feet slamming throughout the entire event causing dust to come down off the ceiling above you you begin to realize that you are below some of the stands a figure across the way emerges from another doorway from the right and the crowd goes crazy this humanoid figure steps to the center now looking through the windows you can see this is an open circular sand pit where there are some wall-like structures in places and pillars beyond those to break up the interior it has some small areas for cover and these pillars in the far corners of each side this figure who walks in is a tall half-giant figure covered in tattoos and spiked armor as he approaches his hands in the air as the crowd's yelling and screaming steps out welcome all fair peoples of the great empire under our king bertrand dwendal may his grace bless this harvest's end and grant us a warm winter the crowd goes crazy i am your humble jermai kull previous champion while i have left the fight i now live for the fights of others it is my pleasure to bring you this year's great tournament the crowd swells again some of the groups behind start mounting up behind you and everyone's crowding around the windows we welcome our guests of high esteem on this day give your applause to our keeper of freedom and order lawmaster orentha stonegrasp he points across the way up in the stands the cheers go bright and you see a figure stand up and you can see the gray haired dwarf who you had met in the king's hall earlier she's the lawmaster of zadash who had come out to thank you for the job you had done in slaying the phase spider in the sewers she raises a hand and then sits down make a perception check as she waves her hand and gray hair-- nope you glancing there your eagle sight of an inquisitive monk of the cobalt soul glance past and you can see where she's sitting and there about two people over sitting in the stand next to her is a familiar face pretty sure that's dolan sam and we also bring to this tournament the headmaster of the zauber spire who repelled the crick assault on our great place of arcane learning shaping the minds of our future mages oremid hass as the crowd cheers again you see back a row and to the left a figure stand and raise a hand once again everybody roll a perception check please nine 16 was the highest who was that that was jester jester you glance up and see best you can a figure a stocky dark brown skinned man with very short curled black hair across the top of the head very square jaw in long red and gray robes he raises a hand and smiles and everyone cheers sitting next to him you see a figure that you had seen before you can make out an older human man with longer gray hair bald on top this was the mage you saw floating in the sky during the attack yes white and gold none of this would be possible if not for the love of you and celebration from our esteemed starosta wyatt fedar there at the very front of that same area you see the same halfling who was talking earlier to the page step up on a small platform to give him a little more height and prestige amongst this point the male halfling with the curly hair and the graying sides raises his hands and give a soft bow and the crowd explodes and cheers this is him now we begin to bring in our fighters for this and our first competing team of this victory pit tournament the last line all the way from bladegarden the doors open and all the gentlemen and ladies in the righteous brand armor push past you with gunther and the elven gentleman step out into the light now you can see the cloudy sky has broken up a bit and there is a bit of sunlight coming down into this pit they step out into the center as the emcee begins to step away he goes may the first fight be a memorable one he steps back and enters a distant door that closes behind him they all spread out and prepare across the way a door opens and you see something shift out in chains that are then pulled off the body and the doors close behind there you see a 12-foot tall frog-humanoid-like creature with a giant belly that begins to lumber forward towards them they all immediately assault this entity jumping in the air vaulting off sides of the walls assaulting it one gets smacked in the face it grabs another and throws it onto the ground another one rushes up as it grabs and slams it onto the floor and puts its weight on top of it one foot pushing it down gunther rushes up with a blade and carves into a large section of its face the crowd goes crazy as it pulls back and shoves gunther off with a back fist the elven leader rushes forward and does a few quick swipes with his blade the large toad creature grabs it and attempts to swallow him and manages to do so completely ingests the leader the rest begin to assault make an arcana check 18 you don't recognize the creature but there's something about this entity no all right this fight goes on for another minute or so you watch them trade blows back and forth nobody falls and eventually the general carves his way from the stomach of the beast with a giant swipe of his blade you watch as the blood begins to pour from it as he leaps out coated in saliva and the creature's own crimson spins around and as the large toad beast pulls back they all together with one unified strike surround and attack it the beast lumbers forward and falls to the ground unconscious with a rousing cheer from the audience the previous doors open as the soldiers raise their weapons high and give a respectful bow they begin to walk back towards the holding area as they drag the unconscious body of this creature back to where it came the emcee shouts again from the side with that the banderhobb has fallen next a last minute addition to today's tournament we bring forth traveled from everywhere-- the mighty nein the doors open again and you guys are given a straight path into the center of this field it's okay i bumped it on the way over no this was from mats by mars they do awesome stuff you guys can place yourselves where you'd like any particular placement you'd like as you guys have a moment to set yourselves up here you would blur all right you have a blur spell on right now you guys entered from this side over here and you saw the monster enter from this space all righty what do you want to do sure over here the emcee disappears and vanishes into the back you guys all take a quiet moment looking around you in silence as the audience gets quiet still you can see hundreds and hundreds of faces all staring strangely formless when it's a cloud like this in all directions little beams of light peeking through the clouds hitting the sand and dirt on the ground before you in that quiet you hear (slamming) you glance around briefly and see not one but two doors seem to have opened only one of them has a creature that emerges it seems like they're playing mind games with you so you don't know where it's coming-- the door to this side suddenly swings open and a beast begins to lumber out chains detaching from manacles on two of its tethered large tentacle-like arms this grayish-brown mass probably close to 15 feet in height with a giant mouth filled with teeth and a large tongue that lolls off the side three tendrils reach off of it as these large heavy feet pull it forward smell wafts around it of feces and rot i need all of you to roll initiative as this creature emerges right there 25 to 20 24 all right beau molly anybody else okay 20 to 15 18 for caleb all right nott 15 to ten ten to five laura travis and oh dear all righty i believe that's everyone top of the round as this being (stomping) (sucking) its tongue slabbering around its open maw beau you're up five ten 15 20 25 yeah easily okay are you driving straight towards it or are you coming from a specific angle all right there you go okay so are you-- here's my question is this just flavor to your unarmed strikes or are you actually trying to damage it with the wooden swords all right so it looks like you're fighting with the swords but you're really punching with them it's more for the show of it they're not that strong go ahead two attacks first one hits second one misses 12 points of damage as you hit it and you feel the actual wood of the sword crack a little bit but your fist does hit the beast in the side its giant blubbery nasty body almost slippery and sticky on impact shifts from the blow is that your turn go for it total ten that misses the third blow goes wide no impact that ends your turn molly you're up that's a-- it's a wisdom save but it's charisma-based the dc's ten that's a natural 20 on its saving throw sorry all right so you have both blades now going which rite the rite of the dawn okay got it both of your blades are now glowing there that ends your turn molly it is now the creature's turn it's going to step up right there as it passes by it's going to go ahead and swing one of its large tentacle arms which you see have these long curved tooth-like protrusions at the end almost like a slapping squid tentacle it swings toward you beau with the first one natural one nope that misses you manage to duck it however it swings-- okay that is a 17 to hit what's your armor class just hits as the tentacle misses to strike you it does manage to grab you from behind and pull you in toward its mouth as it opens and chomps down on you-- yeah you're pulled into its poopy mouth that is 15 points of piercing damage and i need you to roll a constitution saving throw as the horribly-- 15 points of piercing damage make a constitution saving throw please six no as the teeth sink into your body and you pull away you feel this mild infection already begin to set inside you and you are poisoned the other tentacle is going to swing over towards you jester as it sees you around the corner that however is a really poor roll that's going to be an eight that misses you you duck and it hits the stone causing this dust to spray off of it from the impact that's going to end its turn caleb you're up for the purposes of that we'll put yasha on this big old dice there not twice six is about as close as you can get there you have advantage on strength checks and saving throws which is what your rage does but your weapons do an additional 1d4 points of damage when you hit which is good caleb that ends your turn you can yeah go for it as it strikes and misses jester you get one swing but it's with disadvantage on the attack because you're poisoned swing wide unfortunately you're hazy in your view and you feel the poison start to seep into your veins the diseased bite of the creature starting to infect your torso that ends caleb's turn nott you're up you other three are up after that at the same time that hits roll damage yeah they're adjacent so you get sneak attack oh damn 19 points of damage okay so i'll put you about there to do that five feet take a swig it's a free action all right jester yasha and fjord you guys are going at the same time so you decide who is going to take their action first all right so jester yasha then fjord jester what saving throw is that rolled a four three plus one seven points of necrotic damage as the bell (ringing) you watch as the creature shimmies in place you don't think so what do you want to do jester stays yasha what are you doing you don't get reach with the enlarge so you still have to get one more to hit with the melee weapon you're ten feet away from beau currently there you're ten feet away from jester yeah rage kicks in you have any reckless attacks or not no that's fine 14 just hits go ahead and roll damage not on attacks if she does reckless she gets advantage 20 points of damage with the strike as large yasha (heavy footsteps)-- this is going to be a thing i have to make a large yasha figure now swing the giant blade with two hands as the blade carves down it embeds itself four or five inches into the body of the creature it pulls back instinctually and as it does it drags the blade through its body and blood sprays out the blood itself is a thick brown color and the smell gets even worse as it begins to spray its ichor around the air well done is that your turn fjord your turn go for it you step out from behind cover that hits go ahead and roll damage nice you can dart back onto the edge-- that ends your turn top of the round beau you're up disadvantage on all attacks 18 hits concentration nine points of damage as you strike it this time the wooden sword does snap it breaks on impact you still have the hilt (distant yelling) there's a resounding cheer you go in your defensive stance good that ends your turn molly you're up you are 40 45 feet from it 30 that's your movement that's a 14 he still saves taliesin that's all right now it's the creature's turn with you right there in front of it it's going to attempt to bite you yasha with its giant mouth that is 16 what's your armor class aw okay hits you 14 does hit you take 15 points of piercing damage and i need you to make a constitution saving throw just strength eight even in your enlarged state the diseased gathering of bacteria and terrible elements-- 15 points the poison courses through your body and yasha you are considered poisoned it does it's going to take its tentacles and swing one towards you jester that is 23 to hit as the tentacle swings out toward you clawing past you with its raking teeth-- oh shit that's 11 points of bludgeoning damage plus eight points of piercing damage as it carves into you go for it you are also grappled as the tentacle wraps around you and begins to squeeze and hold you in place the teeth and the thorns that are coming out of the side of its tentacle jamming into your body is it a constitution save for hellish rebuke there we go that is going to be a nine 3d10 damage to it 12 points of damage nice there's a burst of icy shards and blades that explode out of jester into the tentacle and along the side of its body as it pulls back in place swinging its other tentacle out behind it towards beau with disadvantage because you have defense even with a disadvantage that is 18 you suffer five points of bludgeoning damage plus three points of piercing so eight total and you are also grappled now you are poisoned and grappled the two side tentacles and there's the one large tentacle on top which now that you have a closer look has three vertical eyes in it that are glancing around and looking at the space the two are wrapped around two of your allies as yasha's dealing with the poison wracking through her veins that's going to end its turn caleb you're up go for it because it attacked beau you could use your reaction to attack it back with your sentinel feat they both do you have that i'll let you do it now if you wanted to if you want to take it you have disadvantage on the attack unfortunately the first and the last one hit 13 just misses you swing and as you're about to hit with the blade the poison pulses through your veins and you go wide as the creature manages to be out of range how much damage is that both rays slam into it and the flames burst up and you hear (pained gurgling) trying to pull back from the impact but it's currently by the wall and it's holding onto your friends and holding its ground that ends caleb's go jester yes you are currently grappled and while you are grappled you are restrained until you break free oh sorry nott's after caleb my bad thank you ten goes wide as it's reeling back from the blow of the flame jets from your buddy caleb unfortunately as you fire it moves just out of the way and the bolt goes wide if it landed then it's fine 18 does hit so go ahead and roll damage and sneak attack it's still adjacent to a friend of yours nice all right it strikes on the inside of the mouth 19 points of damage total got it (bolt impact groaning) it looks like it's hurting but it's also in control of the battlefield on that side there that ends your turn jester it looks like it's hurt if you'd like to okay the saving throw-- that's cocked no that is a five plus one hey it all helps it all goes to the same place you are still restrained and held in place there anything else you want to do no it's an action to break free end of your turn yasha you're up he said about 20 minutes between rounds and a short rest is an hour you have not used reckless that gives you advantage on your attacks correct for now it's a straight roll there's no disadvantage on that roll that'll do it that doubles your weapon and the d4 you roll those together it's whatever that is it's your 2d6 for your weapon d6 for your divine ability and then your die so then double that roll those double that and then add your plus seven ooh no how do you want to do this (cheering) yeah you fucking murdered it it's currently holding jester and beau and it looks like it's about to slam them together it's pulling them back and their feet are dragging off the ground and causing grooves in the sand and it's (growling) which you can do because at your full height you're about as tall as it is in a downward angle you thrust forward and jam it right into the center of its membrane above its mouth as you push down you watch your blade actually protrude out the roof of its mouth through its mouth through the tongue and into the rest of its body and as you push it gives this horrible squealing guttural swine-like sound and as you push and push and push it falls onto its back and you keep pushing and you keep pushing and the tentacles go limp and release both jester and beau at that point you pull the blade free and it is not moving on the ground bleeding out into the sand okay good to know enlarge lasts for how long your size is reduced to a more diminutive stance as you guys back into the inside the poison however is still holding you don't know in your herbalism kit you can make antitoxin if you're in a space-- yes it's a medicine check to apply it properly but you can do that yeah as you guys back into the corner you manage to go ahead and apply the medicinal herbs which are used now but the poison does manage to fade from your body beau you are no longer poisoned you're using lesser restoration on yasha you said up to you okay the poison is removed which is probably a good thing because it lasts until cured technically it's a disease that causes poison but because the nature of the herbs that you've utilized in this space it fits in a similar realm because it's a bacterial infection that kicks in i'll say because you got to it quickly enough and you rolled so high you were able to do that kind of yeah 2d4 plus two for a healing potion as you guys are in the process of doing this you hear the voice shouting out-- not even realizing the other group that walks outside the mountain makers from grimgolir the dwarf and gnome troupe makes their way out into the field as the crowd cheers the emcee vanishes and you see an opposing side open once again immediately bursting through you see a large nine-foot troll with elongated arms and legs start rushing into the fray screaming this high-pitched yelp as it runs you can see its skin as opposed to the deep forest green that you've read about or seen in trolls in your experiences this looks like a dull teal-blue color you watch as the dwarves all of a sudden rush in the gnomes begin casting spells and this assault goes back and forth you see with each strike this cold mist off the claws of the troll with each blow you watch as the gnomes begin to apply fire upon fire and you watch as the entity burns their intelligent knowledge of the creature causing it to prevent it from regenerating fairly rapidly they make short work of it they were prepared and it was not as intense a battle as you were expecting with that-- to your memory you didn't know that you didn't notice anything with the final of the battle the cheers go wild the crowd goes crazy and eventually the mountain makers make their way back into the field anything else you guys needed to prepare at this time out from the menagerie coast the stubborn stock behind you as the doors open they move past you darrow goes hey wish us luck friends and enters into the sunlight the doors close looking out past the way another door opens off to the side and you watch as a 15-foot-long crocodile becomes barreling into the center its jaws opening and snapping as it comes rushing in it climbs over the wall that the guys are getting behind to defend and immediately snaps down on one of the soldiers who gets hit in the side and screams out in pain they all begin to rush in and assault jumping off the wall and getting onto its back you watch as darrow climbs up onto it taking a shortsword that one of his friends had dropped and jams it into the top of the head as he pulls out his battleaxe he begins to hack away he seems to be laughing another friend pries the mouth off of the one soldier that had been stamped on he limps away as it spins around its tail slapping one of its friends sending him flying back ten feet as his weapon goes skidding into the sky it hits the dirt off the way he runs to try and retrieve it the battle goes back and forth for a while one of their friends goes down and one of his allies grabs and pulls him away from the battle zone as he begins to try and wake him up at this point you watch as darrow makes a couple of motions to his friends and they all cycle in and assault at one time cutting at the throat of the large crocodile as darrow takes his axe and carves out one of its eyes as it pulls back screaming in pain they both come underneath and cut through the throat at the same time causing it to bleed out with that the crocodile collapses not moving into the field they slap awake their ally and they begin to drag themselves back into the chamber as the crowd's cheering they're a little wounded and a little winded but as they come in heh that wasn't too bad you're on deck i suppose they bring their friend over to the side and one-- the one that came out here the crocodile came out here that was the last one oh the ice troll sorry the ice troll came from this side there they are changing-- to the front lines again the last line you see as the armored soldiers go back out there into the field they get into the center they form a phalanx back to back in the center as they look around in any direction and you hear (grunting) (roaring) and two gates open from each gate two large-looking figures come charging out you see these sprinting dark humanoid creatures with giant horns out of the front of their head two minotaurs come charging into the center immediately they both break into two groups and try to head them off shields up one of them gets thrown taking the impact of the blow knocked back onto his ass three feet back the other one gets gored immediately the horns piercing his armor and throwing him into the air as this happens you notice now they're both wielding large axes and they start cleaving into the opponents they're giving up a good fight and it goes back and forth for a bit but at one point you watch one drop and another drop a third one gets grabbed and picked up and then broken over the knee of one of the minotaurs at which point you see the elven general begins to look around nervously and starts waving his hand to call it off just as one of them gores him from behind he gets thrown ten feet landing onto the ground rolling unconscious his blade clattering in the dirt there you see gunther in the center with two warhammers in his hands blood down his face going come on they both come charging in at him from two different sides last minute he darts backward causing them to collide into each other as they're stunned he rushes up and jams his hammer into the head of one of them once twice one of the minotaurs goes down and right as he pulls back the second minotaur gets him from behind you watch as a horn pierce where his liver is and he falls unconscious on the ground they fall the final minotaur roars up into the air and the whole crowd goes oh you watch as two groups come out with chains and manacles and manage to grapple and throw them down the lasting minotaur passes out in the chains and they drag him back off the field the two clerics rush out into the field and prevent death to those who are in the process of slipping with that the last line is pulled back the first fallen out here in the field the first fallen in the tournament let us greet back to the field the mighty nein the doors open once more all righty where do you guys wish to be placed if you'd like to try make an athletics check real fast yeah this one here all righty this one here yeah you're fine nott okay yasha okay you're with caleb there all righty as you guys all take your place two gates immediately open again you hear two sources of this loud deep (howling) leaping through both sides you see two massive white furred wolves come leaping through into a full sprint from this side and this side here you invoke duplicity next to nott all righty i need you all to roll initiative (screaming) aw caleb my dice fell sorry mic all righty for this new round 25 to 20 oh shit we have beau-- you got it 20 to 15 all right then

pacing around this side up into that range there it's going to rush up and partially pass through the jester illusion look back and see all that crowd in front in its area it pulls back and its shoulders curl up and the fur expands and (deep roar) you watch as a burst of freezing winter air blows out of its open mouth laura and that's going to get all three of you guys (laughter) yeah it's a cone out in that direction that's a success nope yasha okay (laughter) 16 points of cold damage to yasha and caleb and eight points to you jester yes exactly so four the other one is going to (galloping noises) turn around-- it's not going for a wooden sword it saw it for a moment it's going to move rush up here it was running out and you whistled and it went (grunt) and kept running it's going to go ahead and blast another cold air bit in that direction that will go for both molly and fjord i need you both to roll dexterity saving throws please you barely succeed molly does not that is 26 points of cold damage to you molly i rolled really well on that that's 13 to you fjord you are not unfortunately no yeah and as it finishes blowing it growls in place that's going to end its turn yeah so that will bring us to the next round that's yasha you're up all righty go for it you have advantage with your attacks if you're reckless that will hit d6 disadvantage doesn't affect it it's a cone sorry see technically it would be-- it was a natural 20 you only roll three of those dice yes that's how it is roll again that's fine it's 2d6 reroll it's okay 27 points of damage you carve a hefty chunk out of this wolf as you slam down with your blade as it carves past you see where the white fur has now become red on its left side it (whimpers) pulls back from the pain part of its flesh is flapping from the wound you left as you draw the blade back that was a pretty hefty hit that ends yasha's turn nott you're up fjord you're up next that definitely hits 16 points of damage beautiful go for it that hits roll damage six to that guy as both bolts hit the open wound that yasha left behind it's now starting to growl and look like it's in pain and is getting cornered-animal angry all right that ends nott's turn fjord you're up this wolf here you can get there the one that you run away from does snap at you with its maw i know you guys love that word i know i do that is going to be a nine that does not hit it's a three plus six its jaws snap behind you and you hear the impact but it's too far below you that ends fjord's go caleb you're up this one here strength saving throw that is going to be a 12 what's your dc 15 no he is held in place as the hand creeps up and grabs it it (yelps) and it's held in place now up off the ground its paws held as this giant caw paw is holding the doggy that ends caleb's turn at the top beau you're up jester you're up next you're already there you're there you have advantage on your strikes though yeah because it's restrained 13 just hits eight damage all righty as you leap over slamming your fist down-- or your staff down-- on the nostril of the restrained wolf and then as you land hit it with the back of your elbow it takes the impact but it can't move anywhere it's held in place by this magical-- you do it would be-- yeah roll damage for that please you're trying to move around it you have about 15 more feet of movement i'll say six damage got it that ends beau's turn jester you're up molly you're on deck okay so you're going to run across the wall nine points of slashing damage against this nice as you carve down with the axe and it cuts through it yelps again you guys are cutting it up pretty bad it's hurting it's not on death's door or anything but it's hurting its fur is starting to get matted with its own blood with each blow that ends jester's turn-- or anything else you want to do with your turn only one way to find out travis and okay you're right up against the pillar we'll say that ends your turn jester molly you're up okay 12 does not hit unfortunately it ducks out of the way you're trying to swing at it but unfortunately for some reason the howl of its presence and it moving so quickly in front of you throws you off and your blades are not going well that ends your turn molly it's now the wolf's turn let's see if they get their breath back nope and nope neither of them do they are both going to make a single bite attack one of them is going to be let's see against you yasha you did the most amount of damage to it so it's going to make a bite attack against you that is going to be-- and it has advantage since you used your reckless that's going to be-- right so it would have been the first strike that would be a total of 14 what's your armor class aw just hits that would be 12 points of piercing damage as it bites down on you with its giant jaws i need you to make a strength saving throw which you do not have advantage currently because you're not raging success it does not knock you prone it bites and tries to throw you onto the ground but you push off of its jaws and use the back of the wall to steel yourself and kick its mouth off of you and still stand there resolute with your blade in hand the other one is going to attempt to break free it does not like being held in place by there what does it have to roll to break free 15 what kind of check strength 13 plus four that's 17 yeah it manages to break free of the hand that's its action correct it will move over here to flank up right there beau you do get an attack of opportunity as it moves out of the space and if you hit it it does prevent it from moving 14 hits (cheering) as you're pulling the tail it's screaming that's going to end their turn yasha you're up yeah go for it good thing you went reckless jesus i think you found your snitch 25 points no how do you want to do this (cheering) technically it's not plus two with rage because it's not plus seven right because you weren't raging it's 23 because you're not raging remember there is two damage from that you don't have on the plus seven so it's plus five still enough to finish it but i wanted to let you know it's plus three for strength plus two for your divine fury and then plus two for your rage damage-- that makes it plus seven but you're not raging it had 22 hitpoints left so you still manage to carve it down (relieved groaning) as the blade carves through you hear it yelp and its growl turns into this low guttural (fading growl) and goes limp in your grip as you push it and draw the blade from its body it slumps onto the ground right at the base of jester molly you both take a step back as the body slumps to the ground no longer moving hex is off that's the end of yasha's turn nott you're up that hits 12 points of damage to it all right go for it ten to attack you mean (arrow firing sound) it goes too wide it hits the stone behind almost hitting beau you're like (scattering sound) as it sparks off the stone no impact there you go nott the brave by the name fjord you're up oh you're going in melee with it all right so you move there as the blade appears in the hand you see a blast of greenish energy as the blade apparates out of his grip as he swings upward it sends an arc of seawater splashing into the air go ahead and roll for an attack that definitely hits same sword looks a little different 13 points of damage to it as you arc upward it cuts upward the splash of seawater mixed with the arc of blood from the wound the way you carved up hits the back of its thigh and one leg collapses for a second and it looks over at you with these angry piercing blue eyes it's looking pretty hurt it's limping to that side now you guys see that the falchion has a slight curve to it and has a hooked end to the back of its design that finishes your turn fjord caleb you're up that hits go and roll for damage total of nine fire damage to it as it's turning back and forth and growling and beau's harrying it from the side the two rays of fire slam into its side and it turns back around you can see the dark burn marks on its white fur where the impacts have started to burn and you can see some of the skin underneath where the hair has been burned away is black and cracked it's hurt pretty bad perfect ending caleb's turn beau you're up go for it 17 does hit eight points of damage as you slam it with the second hit up in its groin area it's impacted it's hanging on it's hurting but it's pretty beat up yasha and beau have been hitting two sides of coin tonight all right-- i know how many ki points do you have left that's the last one all right well that ends beau's turn jester you're up and molly you're after that all righty okay runs around-- it rolled a 14 what's your dc resists it unfortunately sorry anything else on your turn okay molly you're up that'll hit no it does not seven points all righty yep roll damage how do you want to do this (cheering) as you go rushing towards it it opens its jaws to strike you slide down and with one scimitar you jam up into its lower jaw which causes its upper jaw to be stuck and as you pull it out its jaw falls open as it does your other blade you backswing dropping-- not dropping but holding on with both hands on the other side swing through and as it carves in you actually get about one to two feet inward as the jaw lolls open the tongue slips out as you cut it from the inside of the mouth its eyes go dull as the creature's body collapses to the ground no longer moving with that point the whole crowd goes cheering-- the gates where you came open and you all go and return okay as you guys step into the back chamber you cast prayer of healing all righty all righty as you guys pull back into your chamber there's a few nods darrow's clapping and the rest of his team are clapping there's a clap from two of the mountain makers off to the side at which point the mountain makers are announced and they step out into the space as they all gather hiding in the corner spreading out a bit two of the sides open out of one two large furred entities about eight to nine feet tall come rushing in with a combination of fur and feathers these hooked dark beaks at the tips of their mouths two owlbears come running in and go into an assault on these people they took some hits in the last battle and as it goes back and forth you watch as they're striking it and cutting through the owlbears are screaming this horrible squeal of pain and anguish combined with ravenous anger and they start tearing and pulling into them one of them grabs the gnome in its beak pulls up and tears its throat out the gnome gurgles as it falls to the ground the two clerics immediately come up to the side getting ready to rush out there to try and save its life another one of them manages to hit one of the owlbears in its leg as it falls on the ground and they all start slashing on it it looks like one owlbear is about to fall as the other one in a complete frenzy either partnered or what tears and grabs one of the dwarves and starts biting into its face as it screams it falls unconscious on the ground it grabs another and bites into its chest throwing it into the sky as they spin off to the side as they all begin to pick up to assault the one that's going after them the one on the ground slowly gets back up and joins the fray you watch one by one as these owlbears on the cusp of dying tear through the mountain makers at which point the crowd goes like (gasp) whoa big cheers cheers because it's a display but also that mournful whoa that low bass-y sound at which point you see the two groups come out again with the chains and the come up to the outskirts of the owlbears which then pass out and they put the manacles on and then pull them away right as they get up to them they pass out they pull them off and drag them the gates open wipe the clerics rush out and grab and drag in the bodies the gnome is gone but one of the clerics reaches over and touches him and for a moment later (gasps) breath comes back and you watch the wound close up somewhat brought from death as they pull the group in-- the shout comes for the next group the stubborn stock returns and darrow and his team rush out giving a pat on the shoulder to yasha on the rush out they go out to the middle field the gates close and there two of the gates open on the sides and you see these dark shapes kind of-- (materialization noise) almost skittering but shifting their position seems hard to map at which point you see darrow glance on the side and he goes oh no i know what this is you watch as these large panther-like creatures with large tendrils off their back whipping begin rushing inward one of them swings and strikes but as he strikes it passes through and it all of a sudden shifts and was not in the space where it blow and it pounces onto one of his adventurers they begin to hack back and forth crowding up around each other back to back one of them is pulling out his longbow and letting loose arrow after arrow some striking some missing one of them all of a sudden the phase is lost it gets struck and now it is in a solid place they use that moment for all of them to dash in and surround this one creature they manage to within one round carve down this one displacer beast on one side the other pouncing onto darrow and holding him to the ground its back legs clawing into his belly as the others try and pull it off darrow takes a serious series of wounds before he manages to pull himself free the displacer beast grabs another of its friends and snaps him in his face he falls unconscious and whips around they strike at it a few times but they can't seem to find where its body is it is dodging around until finally darrow is back up his face covered in blood takes his battle axe and swings wide and clocks it in the side of the jaw its strange illusion form vanishes at that point its body coming to a very condensed location they all swarm this one and one by one tear it down for the next round they're hurt their bruised and darrow's looking rough but with that the stubborn stock raise their hands the stubborn stock continues and the crowd cheers as they pull back in the mc walks back out two rounds completed and only two teams remain for the third and final round will they all fall will they all survive we shall see as next we call forth the mighty nein any preparation you guys have in this moment as the doors begin to open all right at this point the crowd's cheering mighty nein
