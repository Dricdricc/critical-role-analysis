you guys for helping us support that it's been really fantastic so important more than you'd give it credit for yes find a date take them there tell them critical role sent you anyway so so let us go ahead and delve into tonight's game proper folks so to get you up to speed vox machina the intrepid band of adventurers you see before you after a series of adventures had found their way back to their central city of emon in the center of the region of tal'dorei after a ceremony in which the leader of their city sovereign uriel tal'dorei was announcing him stepping down the town was suddenly under siege by a group of extremely powerful and dangerous ancient dragons that call themselves the chroma conclave after tearing the city asunder in many places three of them flew off into the east under the instruction of the fourth and possibly largest and leader of the group that has recently been found to be called thordak the cinder king who currently resides in the center of the city of emon claiming that his mercy is only for those who worship him and essentially feed his greed and hunger as such vox machina narrowly escaping the battle a couple of encounters with these dragons including one above their keep are housing a number of survivors who have made their way out of the city and are currently residing in greyskull keep for protection you guys went into the city to see if you could find any other allies and friends that may have survived this encounter you befriended a member of the clasp named garthok who walked amongst the rubble and proceeded to show you the secret entrance he knows to the clasp of which you may be trying to inquire about information on your way to that area you passed by gilmore's shop gilmore being a good friend of the group and a powerful magic practitioner and creator of magical items and artifacts and a number of glorious goods his abode however smashed and currently a pile of burnt wood and rock looters were currently poring through and you attempted to get them to leave the area alone it came to blows and with many of the looters falling in battle two of which were kept locked away you discovered the location of where they were hoarding the massive amounts of gold and artifacts that they had acquired from the rubble you then found the secret compartment in which gilmore's teleportation sigil was locked beneath his shop where the remaining family of tal'dorei salda and the three children as well as gilmore himself wounded and barely alive having saved them you found that uriel the sovereign did not seemingly survive the encounter with the dragons and gilmore nearly fell going back to try and make sure that you guys were okay barely escaping with his life you managed to save his and taking the children salda sherri and gilmore back to greyskull keep some of you splintered off to try and acquire the goods that were taken from his store however they apparently had already been stolen from the location they were being stored in or been delivered already you're uncertain as to what became of them but you get the sense that it was probably best that you chose gilmore over the gold at first glance making your way back to the keep you've sent gilmore up to rest for the evening some of you have then found your way down into the temple of sarenrae where a number of the escaped refugees from emon currently try desperately to cling to their memories to try and keep the shakes at bay and contemplate what the next step is for survival in this now partially ruined city that was where we left off so what would you like to do good roll for it you're in greyskull keep gilmore's with you he's been brought upstairs-- actually in the short time in which her visitor this angelic deva-like entity that was brought forth from sarenrae's sphere of influence did manage to repair entirely the damage that was sustained to the keep from the battle with vorugal out in your courtyard so yes greyskull keep is now back to being intact and rather fairly polished the stained glass is affixed and corrected it's far enough away but-- it's about midafternoon at this point maybe pushing into the evening i'm sorry what was that lady kima's been in vasselheim yeah she and drake went in your hearts in your heart of hearts they're scattered between the dining hall and the temple to sarenrae partially because one there's enough space there two it's a place of sanctity it's a place of hope and pike is currently bringing people-- not preaching to them per se but offering comfort in their current area of misery and worry so those are pretty much the localized areas occasionally one of the kids might begin wandering the halls a parent might chase after them trying to draw them back in but respectfully no one's wandering the house filling their pockets they're all still happy to be alive at this point there's that too sure yeah shayne who's out front currently strolling through the courtyard comes up to you and as you ask her she goes well we've had a few other refugees come in and ask for entry and we patted them down to make sure there were no weapons and tried our best to keep an eye on them since they arrived seems like most everyone's keeping either into the city or keeping fairly underground not yet but i believe jarett's keeping a close eye pike is with you she is currently helping folks inside the temple but you could go ask her to so glancing about the populace of scattered refugees throughout the general vicinity of greyskull keep i will pick two of you who wish to be the main surveyors of the crew this would be insight yes okay so vex and keyleth both you guys roll insight checks please okay both of you guys spend about ten 15 minutes or so scanning through the crew asking a few questions helping a few folks out while keeping an eye on reactions around the general vicinity no one sticks out to you as being either hiding their intent shifty there are a few folks that are aloof from the whole experience who seem to be either in a state of shock or discomfort based on their current surroundings but nothing in a way that strikes you as nefarious or worrisome correct yeah there's a lot of people that live in emon and none of them seem to catch your eye most of them have had their wounds tended to there are a few that have general scars some from elements of frostbite on their skin who were caught in the blast who were salvaged after vorugal left there are a few that have scrapes and bruises from fleeing from the town from collapsing debris from different buildings and such but no serious injuries a few bone fractures here and there that have been set and bandaged well there are a number of deceased in the front courtyard people that were frozen and shattered as part of vorugal's attack which at this point most of them have been taken care of by the guards and given a proper burial on the outside of the keep a few yards away towards the inside of the one of the hills they haven't been left to thaw if that was what you're worried about cost-effective a number of the refugees have also helped the guards as well transporting the bodies of the deceased and making sure that they're properly interred in the nearby countryside as a note too pike can also scry as well comes out a little bit of dirt on her brow looks like she's been busy handling some of the folks-- she smiles and pushes your hand away yes what yes i do i do why of course of course no worries she ushers you guys back into the temple and then gets a little nervous when she starts thinking about it and walks up to the central platform of prayer and takes out her holy symbol her armor's off right now by the way she's in her ceremonial robes because it's hard to clank around in armor amongst a bunch of refugees sits down and focuses for a second and pulls out some salt and begins spreading it into a small triangular shape around her and then pulls her holy symbol out and closes her eyes and for that moment you can see a beam of sunlight come through the roof the glass roof of the temple which then refracts into multiple colors that slowly dissipate around her you can see everyone else that has gathered in the room falls quiet and watches on as there is this tiny little visual miracle and she stays there for a moment a few more moments probably about 30 40 seconds pass before the light slowly retracts back up through the glass and she stands up and turns around and goes vasselheim seems fine for now untouched from the dragon's scourge at the very least marisha & oh yes she gets right back down into position with an air of begrudging acceptance focuses for a second spends a few more moments in her scrying ritual before stepping back and turns slowly to you percy and says whitestone seems fairly overlooked by these dragons as well the town rebuilds people seem to be going about their lives possibly none the wiser as to what's transpired this side of tal'dorei okay one of the kids starts crying and she goes oh hold on and goes over and starts tending to one of the children who has like a knee brace on and is currently aching and she goes to help calm him down shh shh okay back to your regularly scheduled d&d game i would like vax and vex to both roll a history check nope that's-- you get to roll this because of that okay are you proficient in history sure i'll let you roll okay being the astute researcher the indoor kid growing up yeah there aren't a lot of books that made their way north about pure elven culture especially wooded elves that comprise the entirety of the syngorn nation it has rarely come into play but because of previous wars terrible devastation and the need for the elvish culture to protect itself and to maintain its existence you do know that there have been instances of large enchantments on places of cultural importance that would bridge between here and the feywild and as a defense mechanism essentially would cloak and/or shift those locations okay as your vision separates from your current place of origin you find yourself drifting up into the clouds and speeding through the air the location itself is blurred though recalling the origin of where you originally came from you pass by columns of black smoke to your left you assume somewhere related to westrunn's current location eventually the clouds part and you find yourself thrust down upon the earth amongst the center of the air ashari tribe you can see the thin leather constructs that make up a portion of your people's hovels and buildings you can see the nearby chasm-based windfall that pours through constantly with a gentle whistling sound that forever is marked as the chorus that guides you all to sleep every evening there you can see your people amongst various conversations going amongst their various daily duties seemingly untouched unscathed and unaware of what recent events had transpired that is the last of your scrying capability for the day at this point now in your keep surviving you're looking at the 30s all right so as you go into the temple and get pike's attention you begin to round up the refugees which as a statement historically is already unnerving you begin to push them all together in a group and tell them what no that's true that's true it's terrible here yes and thank you for taking us everyone starts cheering make a persuasion check okay a couple of folks currently (muttering) i've never been to whitestone is it cold it's winter okay a couple of kids go vampires sir what was that what'd you say winter right okay let's grab our things and some of the folks start getting their things together packing up their things-- what they had on their back essentially as they rushed here shake a few out of their shell-shock and they all gather up towards the center of the temple of sarenrae we'll find out that's up to you guys how do you want to do this i'd say you have seven children some of the kids raise their hands some adults go over and they grab kids' hands and stand next to them yes make an insight check ha two of those people are definitely just taking a kid's hand in hopes of getting through first well i mean i can wait no worries eh-- they haven't shown up yet pike comes over and pats him on the shoulder they're the same height so it's easy altogether completed full families there are two it'd be a total of eight people okay you have about ten more people that raise their hands sure take a 1d10 inspiration die we shall see i'll say for the sake of this go ahead and roll a wisdom check a d20 and add your wisdom modifier go for it yep wisdom modifier 19 total okay so as you all gather around in the center of the temple keyleth you step up to the outside of one of the two front trees to the temple one of the ones you guys usually use to transport to and from here as you focus in and reach your hand out and touch the outside of the tree's bark with a rough tearing sound the tree bark widens into an oval-shaped doorway that is immediately visible on the opposite side you can see before you a lightly snow-dappled landscape that is the central market of whitestone from what you had who's pushing percy's through all right are you guys just letting them go at their own rate roll an intimidation check 17 with that everyone goes (startled noise) and starts charging through wildly the crowd starts pushing through okay all of the rest-- the family people go through the young folks push through you manage to get a total of 23 people through (cheering) percy they're all looking around a gentle snowfall is coming down the sky itself you can see is covered in light white clouds just enough moisture to carry the little snowfall that's happening there are folks in the center of the town that are surprised to see this arrival but recognize you and cheer a little bit hey percival (laughter) the refugees all gather up behind you and you guys walk towards castle whitestone the guards greet you and lead you inside and within a few minutes cassandra comes down from the upper floor percival you've returned no we've been focused on restoring our city why and she looks behind you looks to the crowd snaps her fingers some of the guards step forward she goes please if you would make sure to find any of the various unoccupied buildings are provided to these refugees thank you and the guards nod and begin gathering the group and sending them back into town and she gives you a look back and says for better or for worse we happen to have a number of vacancies in the city due to recent events but-- no just-- we've lost many in the struggle against the briarwoods but yes they will be provided for i assure you yes yes right right well we had a few individuals that were researching the ziggurat beneath the city two left a while back and we had one arrive just the other day i cannot recall his name-- realm seeker realm seer-- i'm not-- all right cassandra leads you down into the city again and one of the houses has been provided she knocks on the door the door opens and you see stepping out an older gentleman who you've heard of but not really had an encounter with since-- no actually you encountered him for the final ritual that took the phylactery from grog's chest but this is realmseer eskil ryndarien the archmage that basically was one of the folks who lived within westruun and was called to whitestone as part of research-- as the door opens he comes out eyes adjusting to the light and you can see the interior is very dark he's one of those live-in-lightless-territory types of person comes out with his round spectacles around his nose his robe is disheveled bundled over his shoulders he goes yes if i may be of service-- quite yes we have you're with those shits weren't you unfortunate title you've chosen-- good vox machina glad you took my suggestion what can i do for you frustrating to say the least it appears that this entire-- and he walks back into the house expecting you guys to follow as you enter immediately you're hit with the smell of sage and other burning herbs and you can see there's a vast number of books that are strewn about the table in front the fireplace in the back is pouring smoke up into the roof area and soot's starting to gather on the stonework on the outside looks like there's two or three different kettles going off with different types of tea it's complete chaos in here but he seems to be in control of most of it at least he goes from best we can ascertain this is some sort of a magical siphon device it has prevented us from utilizing any sort of ritualistic endeavors in ascertaining its nature it's quite perplexing i'm hoping to either head over to wildemount or perhaps return to the cobalt reserve and perhaps find some historical information about such an object but nothing in my current-- i'm sorry what well i guess it's good that i moved my tower before i left this is very disconcerting news i will do what i can unfortunately i'd have to get back to the cobalt reserve that's where most of my research is completed let me see jeckt-- and he snaps his fingers and you can see his manservant jeckt who you've met before slicked-back darkish red hair mustache very prim and proper-type manservant well-dressed steps out of the shadows yes my lord if you would be so kind prepare me for travel pack up this-- well that's really frustrating really yes i am unhappy with this circumstance how am i supposed to do my research without a place to do my research well you can say that again yes yes go do your thing should i find anything how will i-- whereabouts-- where are you that does not help me i will do my best ah cassandra all right someone of use around here he doesn't even say goodbye to you he's completely flustered it's funny for everyone who's taken completely by the horror of the situation he just seems really perturbed about the-- yeah it's so inconvenient that library was very helpful basically you find your way to cassandra again she's waiting outside of the room i hope he's been helpful brother yes he's a very strange man i hope so is there worry that these dragons might come here how will we stop them we have to neither do i stay safe percival i hope so we'll do what we can in the meantime to see to your refugees and hopefully try and prepare ourselves all right we'll be prepared thank you she reaches out and puts her hand on yours again and looks you sternly in the face and goes be careful you're all i have left there's still a ways to go brother she hands you the gatestone and with that there's a slight popping sound as you're in a very soft bit of bluish-purple light your body slowly subsides and fades into nothing before it (poof) vanishes out of existence as you guys are back at the keep suddenly who has the gatestone as you're holding it it begins to shake in your hand and give off a warm light you have about eight or nine at which point now there's a slight smell of burnt cedar before the air itself begins to sound like a light hum or vibration as suddenly percy's form (poof) appears in the center of the room next to your gatestone both of the stones you guys are holding all of a sudden become white-hot and you instinctively drop them before they tumble to the ground at this time it's pretty close to dusk the sun is getting close to the mountain line you probably have another hour of daylight all right you guys heading back into emon you guys taking the tunnel or you walking in no are you guys walking through your tunnel to the city is what i'm saying no however it does work only once a day after another long rest you'd be able to use it again like you do half-elven storage space you guys find your way back into emon utilizing your secret tunnel entrance coming up through the false outhouse once again you leave the chain behind locking it up and make your way into the city all right you guys i'd like you all to make a stealth check nope too bad okay placing trinket over here so as you guys start dodging between the alleyways making your way towards the north side of emon alongside the ruined interior of the cloudtop district you instinctually begin to-- and i'd say-- who else has proficiency in perception all right you guys all start noticing there are what looks initially like flocks of birds moving through the sky some of them are heading down into parts of the town in the distance as you continue to push forward one set of four in particular start heading overhead you look up and you can see a small cluster of about five or six flying creatures not dragon-sized by any means but either a very very large bird or something of that degree you can't make out the details as right now as the sun's beginning to set a lot of it's dark against a red-orange sky you keep yourself at bay waiting for them to pass unless you guys want to do something else yes they are actually indeed wyverns wivverns however you want to pronounce it both work in my world it's fine yes (laughter) you can see a few that dove into city and stayed there and one group goes overhead and continues onward pushing forward deeper into the city you make your way through the temple district and start pushing through abdar's promenade once again retracing your steps from the day before dodging through open areas as fast as possible to stay within the shadows all of you go darting into one of the alleyways as you turn behind you you can see your tiny-legged gnomish bard friend keeping up as best as he can before his foot hitting a divot on the ground and (slam) falling face first on the ground making just enough noise-- you hear a little screech in the distance (screech) and coming up on the rooftop you can see perched up there appears to be one wyvern that is looking over down at the currently toppled gnome and on top of the wyvern you see something riding it something that is holding reins on the edge something humanoid is glancing over just a little enough of a shadow to see he looks down at you yeah okay you all barely see it looking over the edge as scanlan's there left in the middle of the main walkway that is going to be a natural 17 on the will save that'll be an 18 what's your dc with having you fallen on your face i'd say probably not since it wasn't specified that would be a dc of 17 so the creature seems to rear back for a second shake its head and you get a little bit of a look at the features at this point too and it is humanoid but you can see its outer body is not fleshy or smooth it is scaled and bumpy you can see ridges across the back of the head and in one of the hands looks like some sort of a spear immediately as it rears back it puts its head up and goes (guttural gibberish) yeah riding on the back of the wyvern i would like you all to roll initiative all right so scanlan as you were running across the thoroughfare you tripped and fell that way the rest of you had come into this alley over here currently looking over the top of this rooftop is this wyvern and its rider (imitates derpy noise) it's fine that's going to be-- 25 to 20 20 all right 20 to 15 18 let's see vex 15 to ten ten to five (laughs) okay plus so you would be-- actually technically keyleth is next to you aw sorry buddy it happens to the best of us all righty so currently with this guy up on top of the rooftop percy you are first just sitting on the roof perched on the edge you can't even actually see him everyone else who's near the front can see the few that made the check you've got a little bit of movement up there but you're just out of view with the building-- you're right in an alleyway aside from a well-placed acrobatics check you could try most likely i'd say it's about anywhere from 16 to 20 feet tall it's two-story but it's not extremely well-built pushing to these guys okay so one-- you can get to about there if you want to you can see yeah he'll have half-cover from there for the wyvern or for the rider you can try it's hard-pressed he's sturdy on the side knocking him prone might fall over onto the rooftop who knows if it'll slide or not it's your call what do you want to try okay okay okay so (whoosh) you whip out that'll hit okay well this is the wing or leg shot right yeah new sheet on that one updated that okay that's a natural 19 plus four for strength so that's a 23 on the save still takes damage though go ahead and roll 14 points of damage nice all right go for it the same shot misfire so first shot of bad news (explosion noise) echoes the sound of the blast rippling through the nearby alleyways the blast hits the wyvern in part of its arm sending a spray of blood as it shrieks in pain as you can see its rider is moved to the side and you see a second head behind the rider from the reaction of movement looks like there's actually two of these creatures riding on the back of this creature as you go to reload bring bad news up again to fire a second time you pull the trigger and there's a (thump) sound and you can see now a stream of smoke pouring out the back of the gun itself and you're a little worried what this is going to do if you don't fix it soon next turn that's your movement that's your three attacks do you have a bonus anything go for it go ahead and make your tinker check so you spend your action quickly trying to fix the gun and get bad news back you manage to clear the barrel get the pellet out as the rest of the team starts coming up with their turns that'll be the rest of your action okay finishes percy's turn grog you're up okay okay good to know let's see here it appears that my-- taliesin could you do me a favor and hand me that box next to the fridge there thank you all right so grog as you're doing that the blasting sound of bad news that echoed through you all of a sudden start hearing other shrieks in the distance like a call to arms of a number of other entities as you see a multitude of other winged creatures begin to arise in the distance you're a ways probably a good 25-minute run there's another one on the roof over here and there's one on this roof here each one of them with their own riders as well now all right so for this turn this one leaps off and swoops down here to where percy is while both of its riders leap off to the side one that leaps off and rushes over to scanlan on the ground and this other one that gets right up next to percy this one goes flying forward and lands in the center to about there two of its riders leap off this one stays up in the air over this way in a flanking position-- or in a visual perspective with two of its riders on its back put them there this is them now entering the fray yeah well this is the initiative i rolled for them after being called by the guy who was already shouting out into the air you didn't see them before given your perspective these guys leap off over here-- over there okay so we have first the wyvern that swooped down on you percy is going to go ahead and make an attack with its bite and an attack with its stinger as a multiattack so that first strike that is going to be a-- the bite 13 the stinger however is a 19 yeah so that will miss so that uses the amulet good to know so the stinger goes to strike you after the bite misses and as you grasp your chest you can see now an arcane barrier shines in front of you and completely ricochets the stinger out into the air to the side as it reacts angrily the other giant humanoid lizard creature that's coming towards you with a giant heavy club is going to attempt to slam you with it twice well it's going to attack you with its club that's going to be a 17 and then it's going to try and slam you with a spike shield that is 15 so that guy starts swinging at you loosely all right attacking you scanlan the one that's on the ground there all right so it has two attacks against you with advantage because you're prone you're on the ground that'll be a 24 to hit and the spike shield is going to be a 24 again actually so as you're on the ground it slams you with a shield for 12 points of bludgeoning damage the shield slams you for eight points of piercing damage so a total of 20 points of damage as (whack) slams you into the ground twice it was until he rolled a 15 stealth those wyverns are too far away for combat the other guys are just assisting the scenario here okay there's one fellow over here that is a bit far away who steps off instead of holding the same clubs and shields or other various hack weapons he's carrying a gnarled staff steps forward and sees the weapon that you fired twice and had been fixing this large metallic dangerous entity looks forward and begins hissing under his breath (hissing gibberish) you do though you are being slammed on the ground i'd say make a perception check actually to see if you see this because you are currently-- yes actually i will say you do see this okay he is actually-- that's a second-level spell it is dispelled immediately as he'd attempted to heat metal on your weapon you can see as the metal begins to glow for a moment and you could feel the heat welling in your hand all of a sudden the spell (crack) is shattered like the sound of thin glass in the distance as scanlan shouts to intercept its arcane ability that is going to end their opening turn that brings us down to the initiative order vex you're up oh right grog you're holding your action first i'll say sure usually going forward if you hold your action that's just your action not your movement you still move to the situation but i'll let it stand for this it's fine yeah so you're going to tear down to this guy there go for it still maintaining your bonuses from last game by the way you haven't taken a short rest yet 26 hits 14 does not hit this is the great weapon master did you rage do you want to rage as part of your bonus action to this okay figures all right so as your bonus action you go into a rage before you strike go for it 22 damage all right the second strike missed 22 so you rush forward slam the sword into the side of the lizard creature it puts its shield up and it manages to block most of the blow but it still slides off and slams into part of its neck area it shoves the blade out however it fails its save take a strength point off of it and add that to what you have now what's your strength currently so it goes up another plus one to attack and damage if it became 22 it does all right grog that ends your turn vex you're up you can try to move through you might get an attack of opportunity from the guy that's attacking grog it's about 16 20 feet you could try to go for it with that you look over and see the rooftop up there you leap off each side ninja gaiden-style hop onto the rooftop with a solid view of the entire battlefield before you including the one flying creature up there all righty okay so it's a 60-foot cone right there you will hit scanlan as well all right so go ahead and roll for that yeah roll 3d8 damage yeah okay so does he make his save he does not yes you do this would be a dexterity saving throw you take 16 points of damage from that that's a fail and a success so 16 the wyvern makes that so half that for eight he fails all right cool got it so as you go forward leaping up on top you mark the one guy turn around and release a torrent of arrows that sprays into the center of this open pathway of the city i believe that ends your turn all right that brings us to scanlan yep it's half your movement not unless you move away from him these two are the only two that are still on their beasts yeah they have these ramshackle-- you can see now with a closer look these leather kind of saddles but they're mostly thrown leathers that are strapped to its back and there's two of them holding onto these knobs in front to stay on there's dominate person and dominate monster they're two different things okay the rider's screeching down while it's holding on and all of a sudden it shakes its head for a minute and looks down at you eyes connected and you know that this entity is waiting for its command you can give it a basic command and it will follow it through unless you wanted to directly control it okay all right good to know and do you want to stay where you are do you want to move (laughs) all right take your d10 inspiration die all right that's scanlan's turn vax you're up grog is against a lizard-like creature-- no that's a little bit away but percy is next to it correct yes the magic user's over here that's been hunter's marked did you use them during the battle against the looters on this side there you mean because right now you're being blocked you can't quite get to the wyvern unless you move around the building that you left you only get one sneak attack damage per turn once per turn go for it so first strike against it as you (whoosh) whip around the side of the building blades out-- that hits yep if you have both blades out you get a third attack too don't forget okay so the sneak attack against the wyvern first strike all right all righty so as you rush around you stab the wyvern on the back of its haunches and you see it shrieks in pain (screeches) looks over its shoulder and starts biting its tail its stinger swinging about but you avoid it fling the other dagger to the side and then jam the other side of its haunches with your other hand it's definitely aware of your presence now nope all right okay it's going to swing at you with disadvantage that's a two on the first roll so yeah that misses you (whoosh) its stinger swings out towards you and you duck underneath it slams to the side of the building breaking part of the wood you can see splinters fly out to the middle of the road that ends your turn all right keyleth you're up roughly-- i'd say about 60 65 feet okay yeah all the other wyverns have landed and let their riders off on the sides this one okay what's the save on that that is a seven and with that-- (laughs) the wyvern-- (laughs) twice now-- the bane of wyverns everyone-- (swoop chicken noise) as both the riders tumble off slamming into the ground (sound of impact) that would be-- okay ten points of damage to the wyvern which kills the chicken form entirely it turns back to a wyvern on the ground taking the excess three damage what the riders fall also they both take an additional 14 points of damage to each of them from the fall let's see if it takes damage and makes a new saving throw against the spell does not make it so it is still dominated but they are all-- all three of them are considered prone for now they are all knocked prone all right ends keyleth's turn at the top percy you're up you're right here you're blocked in between the two buildings the mouth of the alleyway with a wyvern and lizard creature right there standing before you this up close and personal they are humanoid in build they have you know stand up upright they have long tails ridges across the head they're bigger than an actual human and they're very muscular and the more you look at it you can see that their clothing they have tattered cloth and leathers that have been haphazardly dyed in blood and gore to all be a very very deep red color and they're pretty uniform across what they are wearing all right go for it 21 hits for what you've already hexed today you used it in the battle versus the looters nope yes wyverns however-- all righty go for it 14 hits they're sacks of hit points but they don't have lot of armor to them nice 26 twice in a row so with this you pull the sword out as soon as you see it in the proximity of the wyvern the blade itself almost seems to shimmer with this gleam of green on it like the metal almost seems to bend and wave with your movements and as you turn back around to slash at the wyvern the blade cuts through it like butter there's not even resistance it goes right through its flesh with each slash of the longsword you can see large chunks of its muscle coming visible as parts of its body are now being pulled from the muscle and sinew it shrieks in pain you can see it angrily now starting to get ready to rake at you pretty heavily that end your turn all righty grog you're up okay (laughs) go for it roll your first attack against him roll damage on that 25 he fails his save so you get another plus one to your strength and that swing just cleaves it in two it goes (whoosh) right through its midsection it (gurgles) it tumbles off falling to the ground you can move in now with your movement and do your next attack if you'd like go for it all right so now you get your next attack go ahead and roll damage it's double your first dice roll-- so 18 so 29 plus two additional die rolls okay so we're at-- matt travis and and then one more because you roll 2d-- it's twice because of brutal critical well plus ten for your-- you already added that for your-- no it's just the additional 2d6 each time so yeah with that you turn around after hacking its friend leaping forward (grunts) foam at the corner of your mouth your eyes bloodshot and angry you take the blade and sweep it down and it plunges itself right into the wound that percy had left open with his sword swing finding no resistance before it comes all the way to the hilt in the body of the wyvern which shrieks for a moment (screeches) before its breath stops and its body falls limp does make its save though as a bonus action for the record going forward if you're frenzied raging it doesn't really give you a benefit but if you're not it does help so in theory you could if you wanted to try and chuck it what are you going to do grog ends grog's turn all right now these guys both get up currently no longer on the wyvern did you want to give it another kind of a thought if you see it land okay this guy gets up on the wyvern grabs its reins pulls it forward and jams it with its spear as it leads it inward it runs forward and is going to take a swing-- it's going to take a swing with its stinger at the one behind it it's confused and figuring out what's-- why is it doing this it's more of like-- this might work once that is going to be a-- 17 it hits that's going to be 11 points of damage does it make its save it does not make its save that's an additional 24 points of poison damage on that one so that's 35 points of damage one wyvern to another (laughs) as this guy immediately whips around angrily both of these guys go charging forward here it's going to pull up its javelin and chuck it at you vex yeah that is going to miss you at a 12 it (swoosh) throws the javelin arcs past you this one over here is going to come forward and it's going to take a javelin as well out and chuck it right at you grog that is a 20 to hit you take ten points of piercing damage reduced to five as you basically (impact)-- (laughs) snap it off and grin in its face (laughs) --now it sees the danger that you're in looks at you sees you hack through the center of one of the wyverns intensely looks at you and begins casting another spell like it is wont to do all right so craven edge as you're holding it all of a sudden the handle becomes white hot and you immediately take six points of fire damage just holding it fire's biting through three attacks against you scanlan currently two of which are flanking you so they're going to have advantage on the attacks so that's a natural 20 on one of them this guy is-- 18 that hits and then this guy here without the advantage-- still hits with a 17 okay okay go ahead and roll a d10 okay so he rolled a 17 plus seven that would've been a 24 that brings him to 15 which i believe misses you so the last strike as he swings towards you the shrilling tones it causes him to reach up and grab one of his lizard-like ear holes and (snarling) the swing goes wildly over your head however as you duck down you look up as you see the shadow come down of two large clubs that (boom boom) over the head of your tiny gnomish form that's going to be-- (groans) oh and they also get bites after this too all right so you take 12 which would double to 24-- oh no sorry 12-- 20 points of bludgeoning damage from one you take 12 points of damage from the other so 32 points of damage total and they're both going to attempt to bite you as well with advantage that is a 20 on the first one that's to hit and that one's going to -- double 19 so they both hit so you take another 20 points of damage total of piercing damage as they both start tearing into your body i need you to make a bunch of concentration checks here to maintain control over it yeah yeah so just roll two at a time two d20s adding your constitution modifier to it 12 that'll work because none of them-- only one of them did 20 damage and it's minimum of ten so as long as you get above a ten with each one you're fine yeah okay another one another one you have advantage on these nine nope with that you lose your concentration on the domination spell as that fades-- so that ends their turn vex you're up you see scanlan being tossed around on the ground and then you see streaks of blood in the air as one of them tears a big chunk out of his shoulder he looks up at you briefly his eyes half-open sky sentinel i believe did you use that last battle i'm pretty sure you did okay do you want to say the most wounded of them that would be-- the least wounded would be this one all right okay right there and there so blazing bowstring and then regular go for it 18 hits 25 damage that's just enough say goodbye to him that sneak attack was just what you needed that was the last bit of damage another 18 that hits can only sneak attack once per turn 16 damage okay so this arrow-- the first one hits it in the neck and he gurgles and falls to the ground and bleeds out on the floor next to scanlan the other one the arrow strikes it in the middle of its shoulderblades and it arcs up in pain but it's still standing though it's having to really move around with much pain in its face that end your turn you going to stay up there staying up on the rooftop sniping down good call that brings us to scanlan thunderwave at third level all righty (laughs) okay so that is 4d8 thunder damage to all the ones on a failed save so their constitution saves here is this through a hand cone figured-- both fail it's 4d8 thunder damage they are pushed ten feet away from you yes this pushed this way this pushed that way 17 points of damage to each okay they're blasted backward barely catching themselves on their feet and from the impact you can see what little bit of red-colored leather armor they have on is tattered and destroyed you can see blood pouring out of the sides of their earholes where the thunderous blast possibly burst their eardrums and they're both like shaking their head all right (laughing) okay yeah (laughing) okay all right so that is 4d4 plus five healing to yourself 19 so you heal yourself 19 hit points that ends your turn up next vax acrobatics check yeah you parkour up the side land on top of the rooftop leap across and you're now at the edge that's percy right there it's a bad guy bad guy bad guy bad guy bad guy that hits roll damage nine damage (grunt) you shank him in the side and he tumbles over (cheering) it's an action to grapple someone who would be against it are you letting him grapple you i'll say for the sake of the-- yeah it's fine because he wants to you rush forward you grab him and you're dragging him back this way okay i'll say that's about as far as you get because you have a bit of movement taken away even though you are hasted because he's not too heavy but he's still a gnome three-- well they're ten foot by ten foot which is about this size right so it's one two three four five six seven eight nine ten you can get all of them there what's the dc on this right right but what's your dc on it fail fail fail they're not very dextrous fail fail fail-- fail they all fail (cheering) the ground bursts open rocks being torn asunder as giant columns of flame-- boof boof boof boof boof-- out of the ground completely engulfing each one of them in this sudden conflagration of red and orange and yellow flames and molten magma each one of the lizardfolk-type creatures in the flames you see them shriek for a second before their forms are turned to ash in these blasts of fire each sub-woofer-like guttural impact as the ground cracks open like (explosion noise) scatter amongst-- yeah each one of the wyverns themselves you can see the flames emerge around them and as it recedes they have burn scars and their flesh is cracked and peeled against the fire wounds that now tear across the front of their body they're all looking fairly hurt by that all right end of your turn percy you're up so you can go here okay so first shot against them 19 hits go ahead and roll damage on him (explosion noise) you take his head right off as you walk by without even looking (explosion noise pained squawk) and you can see the lower jaw gets blown off and it falls to the back on the ground right there go for it two shots on the wyvern all right 16 hits all righty this one (explosion noise) the bullet hits inside of its body you can see a little (splurting noise) of blood squirt out-- (heavy walking noises) that's the rest of it there okay that's your turn grog you're up getting in the middle of the fray against them both there you go grog charges and they're both-- there you go 24 on the more wounded one all right that hits him if you want to hits so roll damage on each they're both great weapon master okay 32 damage first one you carve through him with the blade (whump) makes his save 31 damage okay this one you (whoosh) streak across with craven edge makes its save you leave a large wound across the front of its jaw and it (choking noise) however you did kill one so you do get to use your bonus action for an attack because of your great weapon master feat yes with the minus five hits yeah you're good 32 this time (whoosh) you swipe through the second time with the blade this time carving off part of its wing and you see that one of the wings is half-curled and keeping up to the side it's hobbling around its legs looking like it's on death's door but still keeping itself all right is that the end of your turn all right (wyvern noise) in there and this one stays there and is going to unleash upon you grog it's going to bite and tail attack against each of you with the stinger against you grog that is a 21 to hit and natural 20 on the stinger okay that does help actually so it'll just do regular poison damage against you so you take 11 points of piercing damage reduced to six from the bite and the stinger deals-- that's 12 points of piercing damage reduced to six as well the stinger however i need you to make a constitution saving throw that's a failure actually it would have been an additional 12 because it was a critical hit on the pierce so you take 12-- so a total of 18 damage so far and then as part of the poison you take 48 points of poison damage because you have resistance that is reduced to 24 all right you have poison resistance from the belt right yes all right so there you go the other one coming up against you percy strikes with its bite that is going to be a 20-- 16 16 misses that is going to be a 22 for the stinger okay stinger hits you for six plus four ten points of piercing damage i need you to make a constitution saving throw 20 you succeed no poison piercing damage correct all right it's looking rough on both their ends they're just fighting to the end at this point all right that ends their turn vex you're up moving it over all right okay 16-- does hit yeah don't have a whole lot of armor they just got a lot of hit points 18 so grog as you're thrashing about with the blade at this creature eager to get that final hit you reach back with craven edge before an arrow (impact) into its face and it (burble thump) collapses to the ground all right 28 hits go ahead and roll damage with the extra d6 for hunter's mark gotcha 17 points of damage second you (whoosh) pull out the second arrow (whoosh) release it and it strikes the side of its body and (pained squawk) it still seems to be standing it hurt it but didn't leave it in any dire straits yet that ends your turn are you staying where you are okay scanlan you're up okay so leaping off make an acrobatics check 24-- scanlan at the start of your turn as you're getting ready all of a sudden (impact) in front of you spooking you momentarily you see vex lands on her feet and looks down at you with a look of concern and wanting to make sure you're okay okay using how many-- oof all righty so go ahead and roll proper damage on that this would be magic missile cast at level six technically i'm pretty sure-- so it would be-- it would be 6d6 plus six oh i'm sorry 6d4 plus six bleah hey 18 okay the missiles (impact noises) slamming into the side arcing off and swirling around percy to hit it anime-missile-streak style hitting it from all sides you can see chunks of its body being blown off from the force of the arcane casting it still stands though it is dripping from multiple wounds and is having a hard time ending your turn scanlan go for it take your d4 plus five you're up go for it 20 hits hits hits this is sneak attack percy is in melee range with it how do you want to do this (cheering) as you step forward your first dagger you pull it out and aim it and over-the-hand toss it as it rears back ready to bring its fangs out to sink down into percy the dagger vanishes into its throat and you see its face go lax for a second (wet coughs) it begins trying to cough and as it does you can see bits of blood and gore from its throat being hawked across the ground it takes a few steps percy steps out of the way as it heads towards you before it rears back and (choking thump) and collapses onto the ground you can see the blade still sticking out the back of its head towards the back of its throat before it appears at the side of your belt okay it's going to take you a while to do it okay it still looks like someone emptied a bunch of fireplace ash pits into the center of the walkway where there once were lizardfolk low fog sound as scanlan blows the horn fog fills the vicinity and you guys begin tossing dust of tracelessness around-- all right you guys pretty quickly manage to move what you can out of the way we'll say over the next few minutes the fog is there under that cover you begin to drag the wyvern bodies into the alleyway into the shadows if you want to go ahead and make some checks here to go ahead and see if you can harvest i would say given the circumstance all it would do would offer her advantage which she already has so it wouldn't make much difference so the first one it's been a little too damaged in battle and you aren't able to really draw any poison from the stinger for the first one-- what's the second one 15's what you needed you manage to extract just enough of the wyvern stinger poison for possibly a single dose so you can mark down a dose of wyvern poison okay so that's a second dose of wyvern poison all right so you have three doses of wyvern poison that you've managed to harvest from these creatures you guys can distribute as you see fit they don't carry much gold and what they have you envision probably went to the entity that rules emon and as you're looking over the bodies of the few of the lizard men here you see they didn't just wander their way in here and you remember mention from allura before that there were lizardfolk worshipers of thordak years ago apparently once the city's been taken thordak has or at least the worshipers of thordak are also moving in so taking this time to harvest poisons looking over the bodies you can see the consistency between their red crimson-dyed leather materials and you get the sensation that while this was a small skirmish group this is probably the new policing state of emon so with that we'll take a quick break for the restroom we'll pick up here in just a few minutes guys if you want to hang tight and we'll see you here shortly jumping back in-- as the party re-gathers themselves after the battle with these lizardfolk and the wyverns in the center of the city of emon you slowly make your way back through the streets towards the north passing through abdar's promenade finding the building that was previously brought to your attention thanks to garthok so you guys find the building that was brought to your attention you head down into the same cellar keeping tabs on the external trap that was brought to your attention by garthok last time you make your way inside there's the same barrel in the far corner you pull the top off and there indeed is a ladder that leads down underground okay looking at the barrel there are no traps currently set and it's not locked the only traps were on the outside of the cellar from what you knew previously and as that mechanism had already been shown to you by garthok so that was easily disabled okay so while you guys are taking a rest-- you drop down the ladder as you head down what probably comes to about 15 20 or so feet into pitch black-- it's completely dark down there do you have any light source or do you want to-- okay so you pull the flame tongue dagger it puts out a very very low candlelight opens up the vicinity to you as your feet splash down into very very shallow a couple inches shallow water looking around you you are in a subterranean sewer system the smell hits you as you hit the bottom of it this is the entire underbelly of emon and there is the slight sound of trickling water that's rushing through this tunnel you're currently standing in the ladder drops close to about a foot above the floor before it comes to a complete stop looking to your right it descends a little further down on that side and you can hear-- make a perception check okay to the right of you what should be the eastern tunnel you can hear the sound of trickling water growing louder it's almost like this stream meets another as you listen to the left and the stench is pretty rough in this part to the left you can see in the tunnel is a very very faint dim yellow light that is shifting ever so slightly in the distance as it curves around out of view it is level to where you are now actually slight incline for a little bit you splash down into the sewer system so as you finish your short rest you all progressively find your way down the ladder and to the subterranean sewer system the choice is to travel to the east or western side of the tunnel a fancy fancy moustache that you cannot wipe off your face i will give you a d6 inspiration dice for that her in the time it takes for you to take the hat of disguise and go ahead and attune to that you guys are now prepared what path would you like to take well you have the sound of water rushing to the right in the darkness and you have the sound or yeah the view of slight moving light to the left the water is trickling downward the water continues sloping downward this way the opposite direction is where the light is the little bit of light you see in the distance so you guys head-- left or-- make a perception check you know what yes you can looking along the walls you start heading in that direction you do see a few markings that basically say 'sanctuary' in thieves' cant in the direction of the light you guys continue onward yes (clears throat) so you guys continue forward up that tunnel eventually as it curves around the light-- you can see-- it's shifting because it appears to be a distant fire light that is the source in this vicinity and as you turn the corner as the tunnel slowly curves around it opens up into a large central sewer chamber though most of it is dry and you can see there is a large mound of dirt in the center that seems to rise above most of the water that has collected along the ceiling and there are a series of platforms constructed out of wooden scaffolding at different levels all throughout this chamber some of it looks a little rickety some of it looks very old but various states of moisture rot (offscreen sneeze) as you look and see a series of small bonfires throughout the room that are currently lit and surrounded by figures you see a ramshackle tent city and/or a series of small wooden hovels that have constructed here you see a number of figures that are huddled around these bonfires cloaks hoods up generally keeping warm in what is a relatively cold subterranean area you guys glancing over here as you're first looking and you can see a few of them appear to be laid up and hurt and there appear to be at least a few individuals that are heavily bandaged or have slings on as you guys step into the room not being very stealthy in your arrival-- okay a few of them stand up hands on the side of their hilt and stop there for a second before one individual steps out of the shadows and puts his hand up putting it down you recognize this to be garthok he says don't worry they're with me i'm glad you made it it had been a while i was afraid maybe you wouldn't come it sounds like it i'm sorry to hear it human yes he has a red-tinted monocle over one eye as he steps forward the rest of the clasp put their hands off to the side of their weapons he pushes aside garthok to the rest of you and says so you are the ones called vox machina am i correct in this assumption hmm trusted of uriel executors of modeth the traitor one among you is a member as well i'm told then you are welcome here i am spireling shenn-- master of networks and information-- sam and --of the clasp of emon excuse the mess we lost a portion of our territory and are currently caught in mid-adaptation so what can i do for you and you know who i am now uriel is no longer with us you are a hand to nothing (chuckles) no that does not do any of us any good business has ground to a halt and we've lost a few good patrons in this unfortunate circumstance we lost our entire northern tunnel structure as soon as the creature attacked the cloudtop district safer hmm well we're seeing to our own we're going to see how many of our allies still lie within the city going to reach out to our friends across tal'dorei and see how much of a network we still stand to keep then we call in a few debts reach out to some friends and ah we see if we can find some way to supplant this red thing go for it well for now i have a number of operatives topside who are currently trying to get as much information on the red one as possible the piles of wealth are growing and it looks like the beast is building a damn home out of the district oh i am aware and we are preparing for that however it's still fairly fresh and individuals aren't willing to release any coin when all of it goes to the pouches of the thing that sits on us word has gotten back that westruun was also hit rather hard in the night and these creatures have continued eastward ever since-- no further word on their whereabouts so we're put in a reactionary position which i loathe we're used to being ahead of the rest of the curve it would appear that could be a possibility that seems like a fairly top-heavy trade in our direction if you ask me there are many ways to get people out of our way i would love to hear it hmm how is this keep accessed hmm let's say we do this let's say we go forward with this alliance you get out of our way you promise resources from whitestone perhaps they have quite a few unique contributions they could make the slayer's take-- i have not had many dealings across the ozmit sea but are you referring to ah vasselheim now that is a tough nut to crack that city if you're connected in vasselheim perhaps we can talk there's no guarantees we'll be able to provide food or medicine-- it's dangerous times my dear of course all the real power lies in the underbelly my friend i have a proposition for you then we will do this we have many channels and secret tunnels throughout the city and we could very easily deliver food medicine shelter even to the wired and poor and downtrodden folk of this town be the subterranean heroes of emon out of the goodness of our hearts of course however once this creature is toppled and the city is brought toward i gather you would have the ear of whoever comes to power in this city that is helpful and i imagine you also have some presumably powerful connections in vasselheim we would be interested in beginning a sect of our fair trade in that distant all-too-- how do i put it xenophobic cityscape if you agree to be our seed in that stubborn garden of a town you have our aid my patience grows thin he adjusts the monocle on his eye make a perception check when'd you get that inspiration die it would've faded by now unfortunately 33 you're far away from the crowd however spireling shenn has been very concentrated in shifting his attention from each person that is currently speaking in this conversation yes hmm all i'm asking is an introduction to a handful of key figures in the city no more than that you act like that hasn't been our treatment for the entirety of this city's existence you think your council didn't have dealings with the clasp for many years before this happened we helped make this city function all we're offering is this service to other places that maybe don't have the right guidance to achieve their true greatness all i ask is an introduction beyond these other far after the fact don't even need to worry about it now who's to say what changes from now to then we don't have to worry about that now just a simple handshake and it's all done if this is an issue of morality i would like to remind you that one we've let you escape after murdering one of our leaders only upon learning that he himself was an immoral individual also we went against our word as an organization by letting you take a war criminal that had already paid his way out of the city it was business but business that was persuaded by the actions of good people and bringing justice we want society to thrive so not wasting any more time shall we make this a fine healthy city once again oh i would only hope that would be the case i wouldn't be caught dead dealing with such a selfish entity i have things to do i haven't all day my arm grows weary with impatience very well unfortunate as it is step forward no this is him asking you to step forward he steps really close to you and he takes you by the shoulders and turns you around to face away from him do you resist okay make an acrobatics check 28 you tumble away from his grasp and he (grunts) very well i know your face now at least and the rest of the clasp will know you are a false member now you are not welcome in these tunnels ever again and if we see your face amongst our kind it will be our word that you are to be taken on sight it's a shame you've marked yourselves our enemy this day i wish it wasn't this way but to step up and confront us with such disrespect for all the patience we've shown you in previous years is just-- it irks me stinks of a lack of civilization so please be on your way we'll do as we do you do as you now be gone and he turns around flicks his cloak and steps back into the group the rest of them keep their hands on their belts and wait for you to leave garthok actually gives you a very stern look and pulls his blade an inch from the side of his scabbard at which point you can see 25 more clasp members step out even wounded ones as they are all stepping up and gathering there are now 35 to 40 of them starting to form out of the shadows forming a semicircle around you entirely the spireling's not even in view at this point he's disappeared amongst the rest of them possibly as you guys exit and find your way back up to the surface as the last of you makes it outside of the entranceway you immediately start hearing this slamming and breaking of stone from underneath you and you gather pretty rapidly that this entrance is being entirely removed for possible entry (sizzling noise) searing white pain through the back of your eyes vax as keyleth presses her palm into the center of your shoulder blades you can hear the sizzling and cracking of skin and smell the burning of vax's flesh in the air in this cellar make a constitution check seven you break through the arrow with your grip and actually give out a very loud painful scream out of reaction kind of a moment passes keyleth you pull your hand back and where the clasp symbol once was there is a hand mark burned into the back of the shoulders what would you guys like to do cure wounds what it does is prevents infection it does heal you for the hit points you would have lost for that i'll say it nullifies the damage you would have taken from the burn mark it does not alleviate you from the scarring it's not as graphic as it would have been had it been left to heal on its own but it does muddle the clasp symbol somewhat as you guys are heading back i need stealth checks from everybody all right you guys push southward through the city finding your way at this point the sun has set night has come in and occasionally you hear the flapping of leathery wings overhead as a number of sentry groups of wyvern riders go tearing through the city at one point you hear a similar (raspy cry) sound and you hear other ones begin rising up off the rooftops heading in your direction keyleth what do you guys do okay make a new stealth check with disadvantage (chuckles) it's a natural one on their end as long as you didn't roll a natural one so at that point they (whoosh) one swoops down and lands on the edge of the roof and you see it curling down and takes off again and they continue on out of the way you wait a few moments before silence takes the night once more and you press on heading southward (laughter) yes and as you return to the keep pike has been taking care of the rest of the individuals and she's been seeing to gilmore's side gilmore is fast asleep dealing with the tail end of a fever that has broken after the healing from the day before earlier in the day i should say it also appears that salda and the children have been in and out keeping an eye as well pike as you enter looks up to you with a smile and says he'll be all right he's going to pull through i should probably stay with him for a bit make sure he's okay he is asleep currently yeah he's been conscious throughout the day while you were gone but he's got to rest a bit more he's still had a rough few days i just need headphones and to brush against the mic occasionally especially during really really impactful story moments so you guys find yourselves resting for the evening you take to a night's sleep yeah you got to sleep if you don't sleep you're going to start getting levels of exhaustion for the next day all right so you lose the strength bonus everyone you can get half of your hit dice back keyleth okay so we-- jump forward to the next morning-- so next morning you all wake up full hit points get back half of your max hit dice that you spent all your spells back okay all right so what's the plan all right what's the plan all right we'll say for the sake of brevity you speak with the rest of the keep's staff including the guards as well jarett for the most part is like as long as i'm still getting paid we're more than happy to go where you need us to be if it's further away from dragons i am okay with that okay so you gather your materials you prepare at the tree in the center of the keep you say your goodbyes-- you've used it at the temple of sarenrae-- just a straight-up poo okay marking your territory i respect that all righty okay okay notes are placed spell is prepared okay you have your supplies at the ready you all gather in the center of the temple of sarenrae keyleth the portal opens outside of the tree and all of the refugees start rushing through you guys give chase following over to the opposite side where whitestone waits you all emerge from the sun tree in the center of the familiar town it is chilly not as snow-dappled as it was when you first arrived a little has melted and the clouds are a little bit more open you can see some of the blue sky above you it's actually a beautiful day if a bit chilly as you emerge you can see there's a few individuals in the center of the town including a couple of the original refugees that seem to be waiting for the rest to come through they greet you as soon as you arrive and rush up and grab a couple of people that they had met at your keep some come forward and say thank you i'm so glad you made it they shake your hands you've arrived back in whitestone so do you guys want to wait here for the day and then make your way to vasselheim there is but you guys have cleaned it out they have not had an opportunity to restock their main providers have been killed you approach cassandra who is happy to greet you once you return did you have a question well the personal effects you all retrieved when they were defeated what remnants of income or gold which they'd kept was put in with the rest of the whitestone treasury when they took over they weren't really specialized in healing i'm afraid and what bits of protection they had you've already taken but if gold is what you need we can probably spare you some that can be very easily presented oh here we are there's a small chest with a lid that she hands it over to you actually puts it out and your hands are already out all right 2000 gold from our coffers it's not much but we have to keep the city running of the glass yes certainly very well it takes a few minutes for that to be retrieved from down south of the tomb in the mausoleum but nevertheless you get four half-dollar-sized pieces of residuum glass four shards of residuum glass i hope that's of aid to you apology for the confusion we have quite a bit of individuals to find homes for and get them running yes as you've told me i'm thankful that we even have an opportunity to offer aid to somebody that's thanks to you so it's nothing on us that's all right whatever we can do anyway good luck interesting all right while the rest of you guys are attempting to rest i need you to make a tinker tools check 22 you've affixed it to your boot we'll see if it works okay so total cost for the materials on that will put you at about 300 gold all right you find an evening's rest the next morning comes uneventfully you find yourselves refreshed i'd say at this point you're all at full hit dice after two nights of rest you're fine so on to whitestone keyleth laura and sorry you're in whitestone you recall you've seen a number of trees the largest you've seen in vasselheim would probably have been on the outskirts of-- do you want to stop outside the city or within the city is the question no arcane magic divine magic is a different thing there's plenty of divine magic within the city there are no sigils to vasselheim part of their defense process is preventing any secret intrusion in that regard there's the abundant terrace that's the section that melora looks over that is where primarily most of the farming food-- that's where you know there are a number of orchards and things that are kept in that vicinity if you wanted to it's within the city it's one of the five quarters i won't say quarters it's one of the five areas quarters yeah unless you want to try and bring him with you (laughs) you're approaching gilmore he goes to be perfectly honest i'm not quite feeling 100% and let's just say i'm not a huge fan of the zealot type vasselheim doesn't really jangle my dingles this is true well (sighs) guess it's not too late to open a new branch of gilmore's glorious goods since my other possibly two no longer exist (sighs) i was so close to opening i started from nothing i can do it again (coughs) good luck you all it's in the actual city all right using this once again off the sun tree you guys step through as you emerge out the other side you are in the thick of a heavy orchard in the abundant terrace there is heavy snowfall that has fallen recently here and where it was cold in whitestone it's cold here in vasselheim you can see built-up ice and sleet that has recently been pushed off to the sides of the orchard even amongst this very cold weather all of the plant life in this area is vibrant and springtime green as you all emerge in the center of this orchard you can see one of the nearby workers who's tilling the land looks over hey what are you doing here you're not supposed to be in the middle of the orchard (groans) fucking slayer's take do whatever the fuck they want he drinks out of his canteen fine just get out manticore (weakly) thanks he starts looking nervously over his shoulders as he goes back to his work eventually you guys step outside of the terrace finding your way to the quadroads which is the central network that the four main portions of vasselheim attach to this is the erathis-based center of the town you have before you to remind you at the very northern part of the town is the extremely tall pointed mountain known as heaven's stair attached to that mountain on one side is the silver talon's reach that is the main temple to bahamut to the left of it against the mountain not actually into it is the braving grounds this is the area that is geared towards kord the deity of war where you had previously had a conversation with the dawn master the earthbreaker groon there's the platinum sanctuary in the silver talon's reach which is where the highbearer vord the silver-touched the high priest of bahamut is you also just left the abundant terrace and there is the quadroads which is where the slayer's take currently is and there is the duskmeadow which is the raven queen's domain where do you guys want to go that is where the amaranthine oubliette resides which is the prison of the city that's the quadroads the erathis deity of civilization you guys hit the slayer's take first or where are you heading laura and okay you make your way to the outside of the main slayer's take guildhall the dark wood exterior greets you happily you can see they still have a gathering of various antlers of creatures that are tangled into each other that form this rustic-looking entrance and there on the front doors you see emblazoned the slayer's take-- for lack of a better term their symbol with the words of their actual guild spread across it as you saw before opening the front door you can see within the main foyer area there is the dark iron chandeliers that run across the entire length of the moot hall if you will across the front area you find the clerk desk sitting behind it a familiar red-haired tousled chin-bearded scarred-up tiny man with his feet up on the desk falling asleep in his chair what is this craziness (laughs) ah it's been some time so hello what's your business what are you looking for other than the fact that you killed one that is the most recent but nothing beyond that really no vanessa she's currently out on a hunt should be back in the next day or so well you're always welcome here this is your home away from home so please take a load off pick a room it's up to you it's good to see you all so healthy yes so glad to hear she's actually currently out with vanessa on a hunt as we speak me too i was sleeping when you came in i don't mind if i get back to that if it's somebody else's room they'll let you know so please take your time there's a number of empty rooms doesn't look like there's a lot of individuals around as you walk down one of the hallways though you do see there is a card table and the two individuals in there you see a very scarred burly and frustrated dwarf who's throwing down cards on a table black long series of beards and his hair over his beard you see thorbir is sitting there at the card table with another man wearing really beautiful ornate armor that is well-polished very short dirty blond hair who is apparently owning him at cards going (chuckles) you've terrible luck friend i'm sorry to hear this it's aldor thorbir's sitting there and throws his cards on the table (scoffs sighs) they tell me i'm supposed to have the luck of the dwarves (laughter) why have you seen her he reaches forward and grabs your shirt and pulls you in where did you hear that good you haven't seen her have you good i assume i just run if i see her she's a bit-- good you know what actually if you want to do me a favor i mean she's a nice girl probably pretty easy if you ask her why don't you take her off my hands and go on a date take her out for dinner distract her oh no i should go he grabs his stuff and leaves in a huff yeah it's maybe 1000am it's across the world so it's technically earlier it would be 1000 1030 in whitestone about 630 700 in the morning in vasselheim pike has actually stayed back in whitestone to help the refugees no but she did say that she's going to keep an eye best she can through sarenrae when she can pop in she'll try and see if she can project her form going forward she's led by her schedule in new york (laughs) if you'd like to you could have okay we'll say that she does that she keeps a gatestone with her just in case trinket's been practicing his stealth (bear grunts) all right so you've set up your rooms your stuff about you you have a full day before seemingly anyone from the slayer's take is
