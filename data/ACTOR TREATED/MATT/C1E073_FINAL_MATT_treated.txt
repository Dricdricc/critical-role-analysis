different tigers all right on that note let's go ahead and dive in to tonight's episode of halloween critical role [dramatic music] jumped the gun so as you guys reconvene towards scanlan's magnificent mansion to prepare for the next leg of your journey what do you wish to do correct you guys are so you've gathered to go ahead and make-- yes for the restoring some of the farmland yeah which as you complete the entirety of the spell you watch as the rest of the snow melt begins to turn to water and you watch as the land itself grows more fertile and the crops begin to pop forth like you began to see when the ritual initiated itself with the completion of the land cleansed you are free to go to the next length of your journey marty okay happy halloween all right you take a short rest to set your-- (laughs) what else do you guys wish to do what's the next step in your journey as you focus and touch the outside of the tree you watch as this small familiar portal begins to tear its way through the outer bark of the nearby trunk from there as you reach through the magic creating this portal between you and whitestone you hear the voice echo in the distance i hear you and thus the temporary doorway between here and whitestone is open the rest of you guys rush through with kima and pike in tow you make your way into whitestone itself at this point in time it looks like it's fairly late in the afternoon it's still day here that's a day eight hours there actually no it would be pretty early morning by here at this point you step out and the sky is starting to come to light you see the blue slowly transitioning into a light orange to a yellow as the sunrise is making its way over the mountain range that surrounds the outside of whitestone you're met with a few wandering guards that wander through the town that acknowledge your presence but it is your call as to what you wish to do now it seems like it hasn't suffered any sort of incursion or attack yeah there is a treasury vault in the whitestone castle all right pike says she's going to go and check in with the temple and make sure everything there is taken care of and situated kima leaves with you guys towards the whitestone castle as you make your way up you get to the very outside of the castle at the time the sunrise finally breaks the mountain range and you see the sun coming in what little bit of mist begins to slowly burn off of the surrounding forested area the cold brisk morning air is immediately met with that warm ray of sun hitting you and it's welcoming both to be returning to a place of comfort but also the transition into day itself is a very warm and welcoming experience as you step towards the front there are four guards at the front gate they step aside to let you in as you step into the main foyer of the area you already see a familiar sight you see there waiting arms crossed leaning against the wall seeker asum yeah still acid-pocked scar across the right side ruining the tattooed face the rest of the castle seems relatively quiet at this time as it is very early within the actual foyer of the castle yes the main entrance area as you guys begin to step inside seeker asum steps in your direction steps in your direction and kima is already taking a brisk walk in that direction and goes pointing outward toward seeker asum now-- now you told me you'd already met with a creature this is the-- at which point seeker asum's hands rest on to kima's shoulder kima's head whips around to face asum and asum says you need not worry kima's eyes blink for a moment and she-- yeah you can certainly try all right so as you begin to-- it's not a counterspell but you can try to cast it on her to see if it has any effect all righty so the dc of the spell-- okay so as you pull back and begin chanting to yourself clutching kima and pulling her away from asum asum's grip leaves kima's shoulder and kima's still shaking her head groggily you finish the dispel magic and you feel the strange warm pulse of energy radiate briefly out from kima's body kima turns to look at you and goes what-- why would-- i'm sorry i went groggy there for a second we've had a long day good to see you asum and asum nods and says well the pleasure is mine glad to see you all made it back safe and sound we have a meeting set here in the next two hours to gather our information and best situate the next plan of action you also have a friend waiting for you your armored kashaw returned but a half day ago apparently sleeping at the moment should you be interested in waking him from his slumber and notifying him of his well his services no longer being needed he did and rather proud with his findings oh i'm here waiting for the meeting as far as i know it's going to be myself cassandra allura and drake until the meeting now food should be ready and asum steps out into the sunshine and closes his eyes takes a deep breath as the sun rays hit and looks over his shoulder smiles and continues to walk down the path in towards whitestone itself kima takes a couple steps and says wow i'm more tired than i expected after that fight then again we did kill a dragon and that is fantastic which she pulls out and (swish) you can see the arc of light streak across the blade as she flings it in the air with incredible strength for a halfling of her size she's still marveled by it you know what i'm not going to sleep i'm going to go practice and she goes and runs off down one of the hallways towards one of the castle's training rooms she holds the blade up to her ear no thanks grog slaps you on the shoulder with an awkward glance and continues the excited steps forward into vanishing somewhere into the castle okay the rest of you what have you been up to grog you've finally caught up with the group you've managed to drop off your large amount of dragon hide in return i mean it probably should be it probably should be attended to in a short amount of time like in the next week or so before it's really-- there are a few tanners yeah it's below ground yeah it's not-- comparatively whitestone in general is a pretty chilly place so yeah yes you can make a stealth check what was that 28 okay yeah you vanish without anybody else noticing your disappearance okay fair enough vax as you rush down towards the homestead that gilmore had made here in whitestone the door is closed there's a large pile out front of ruined furniture that's been jammed into this collection presumably from the last encounter they had when the incursion of assassins made their way in but the door's closed and seemingly locked a few moments pass no response (mario coin sound) but you find a cool coin yeah eventually you hear a little rustling and you hear a voice muffled from the upper floor say confound it i'll be right down you hear some footsteps and then eventually the door (unlocking sound) you hear the unlocking mechanism the door swings open a little bit and you see you know morning robe chest open curly chest hair poking out a very groggy bedhead gilmore opens the door yes can i help-- oh good morning (laughter) of course would you like some tea i'd like some tea come on in come on in he ushers you to enter and leads you to one of the small chairs and he walks back into the kitchen shouting over his shoulder so vax'ildan please tell me what's on your mind (laughs) i certainly hope so it's taken a couple years off my lifespan really how many is that for you now three making a name for yourself i'm proud of you a few moments pass and silence and gilmore walks back out clutching a small tray with a few teacups and as he's walking he's twirling his finger and you can see a little spiral of flame encircling the tea kettle as it begins to heat up he brings it over sets it down on the table pulls his robe in and sits down across from you on this low slung tea table takes a bit and sips it so what brings you here this early in the morning friend shh that's far too fatalistic for the vax'ildan that i-- number one number two you have nothing to apologize for look everything's on fire around us all the time we all jump at whatever bit of comfort finds its way before us and at the same time i appreciate your honesty and i'm thankful for the connection that we do have and yes heartbreak comes but heartbreak goes it's part of life it just means that i need to find somebody who's a little more my speed he better be don't worry about it go kill a dragon another kill two more kill six more i don't care just know that you're coming back because i need you and your friends to keep pimping out my name i know i know i know you sure you don't want any tea i'm glad you did he takes your cup waste not want not (sips) now go stop being uncomfortable in front of me i need to get my morning-- --situated he stands there waves his hand and the door opens on its own he takes you by the shoulder real fast before you leave and turns around and goes 'till next time say it all right go and you feel a little pat on your backside on the way out he sits there holding his tea watching you leave door slams behind you you make your way back look i don't have to look at this i'm fine (laughter) (laughs) it totally is like performing arts with the weights on all right asking around quickly he is back in the room where he's been staying in whitestone you go back to his door it's closed nothing nothing it's not locked as you open it up there's no light on the inside but the light does come in as you slowly open the door with a (squeaks) you can see he's halfway out of his armor passed out on his back on the bed he's one arm out snoring loudly like he was too tired to make it all the way and (snores) well he still has his boots on it's more like his upper torso he got partway out of that okay so you're opening his palm-- okay you tickle his hand no response (snores) as soon as you flick his nose and you start to back away there's a blur of motion as suddenly he comes leaping out of the bed (grunts) and goes over and grabs his spear his hand reaches for nothing in the air and slings it forward in your direction (whoosh) bypassing by your face by a few inches and he looks still half awake going (startled noises) yeah it's my room hi and he throws his spear to the side i hope i wasn't either sure all right i'm glad you're here because it took me a long-ass time to get here and he sits up in the bed and-- or he sits down back on the bed and reaches over and pulls out one of his packs and brings out a couple of rolls of paper okay so i talked to vanessa and got two contracts that we could take up for this we got one here and he pulls it out this is for two indigenous creatures to the region that you were talking about over by wildemount one is a purple worm matron supposedly shit's dangerous careful this one is for a storm giant this one is a little harder to get a hold of apparently get out of my room just get out get out of my room out of my room laura and out of my room out of my room get out of my room you leave him in silence and darkness (yelling) out of my room all right so you guys wander your way off-- scanlan grog percival what are you guys doing as grog gives you 5000 gold which weighs roughly a hundred pounds-- it weighs more than you do yeah he starts divvying it out until it's like larger than you in a pile in the center of the room so you get six platinum from grog which is roughly sixty gold perfect okay as you walk around nobody else who's supposed to be meeting has gathered yet however cassandra is awake and in the process of going through some papers she has her personal guard at her side and two guards at the door and you can see she's getting herself prepared for the meeting as you enter the room the door partially ajar you see her still down currently thumbing through notes her hair is still in disarray and pulled back haphazardly and she's wearing her morning gown and without even looking up goes percival glad you've arrived and still in one piece i have to tell you i'm very impressed indeed that's what our meeting is about sorry i need to go fire some of my guards they're making a nuisance continue please that is actually what our meeting is about prevent that from happening what languages do you know she knows elven and common she does not know celestial that was more your hobby yeah she gives you a very keen look and you can see cassandra as much as she is the healthiest you've seen her physically her eyes have dark circles over them it looks like she's been very harried by the events of these past few weeks understandably so but she takes and looks over the sheet and goes well very well should be an interesting meeting then it's good to see you and i look forward to you sharing some of the burden soon right right good good whatever is fair in this life the wonders of lordship and ladydom okay do you wish to come anything else you want to bring to this conversation no one who lives on site per se but there are two individuals that your family generally used for various forms of jewel craft okay no worries scanlan what are you going to do looking for jarett okay you head outside of the main castle down to where the training barracks are for whitestone and you can see jarett's already out there with a small metallic platter on his lap scarfing up some food real fast he's gotten his day started relatively early and as soon as you approach mouth's already full mmm scanlan it's good to see you (laughs) the usual gruel that you find in this city oh well trust me i've used it on the eggs and it makes it bearable whitestone is not well known for its cuisine from what i can tell everything's gray and lacks flavor all right i will happily take you up on that offer thank you the task remind me again oh yes i sent a request through someone i know i'm not going to leave the city right now to go find-- look i have two people i know that might be able to get what you need but it's going to take time when did you pick up this habit i'm worried about you now scanlan certainly (chuckles) i have been told this once or twice yes well largely by not using illicit substances i'm not judging i'm worried about you like if you don't even have a habit why would you look for this the scanlan i knew the one that hired me he knew how to deal with this issue he got laid maybe that's why you're not feeling up to the task (laughs) i'm just saying look and i do not mean to talk out of turn he sets his meal aside but you are a man who walks driven by his pelvis am i wrong then what happens if the pelvis goes unused grows bashful because suddenly you have purpose because you have a reason to come back that's not a bad thing then do you have a keepsake of this reason to return this person you made a promise to then you need to get yourself a keepsake then something else that reminds you of her something that you can look at in that moment when you're not so sure drink a lot listen to people talk there are none wiser than barkeeps my friend and i have been friends with many a barkeep i will continue searching and providing what you require and i've watched it ruin lives near k'tawl swamp you are a strange gnome does not work in this circumstance but i applaud your attempt it was good i'll do what i can but don't forget you have more than one reason to stick around here tell you what come here and he suckerpunches you in the face you unexpectedly fall back you feel the pulsing of the blood run to your cheek your eyesight goes white for a second he goes see now you have to live to return the favor good i look forward to it i always do awesome grog yeah it's early morning there are a couple of courtyards within the perimeter walls of the castle they have some small garden elements not within the courtyard no occasionally there'll be one patrolling by all means yeah and there are a number of walls to choose from varying heights different levels of masonry you have the veritable pick of the litter certainly you find the portion where the exterior wall has one little parapet-joining portion with the exterior of the castle itself there you can see the masonry is fine the stones themselves are clean-cut and joined properly there isn't a whole lot in the way of ornate craftsmanship on the exterior of the castle or the walls but you feel as far as your interest grog this is a good wall you mark your territory expertly there you go like a cylon eyebeam yeah totally you do so with gusto congratulations that's how grog spells home unless there's anything else that needs to be done-- you can kynan who is currently under the watch of jarett at the moment is asleep you start walking towards the direction as scanlan is leaving the exterior of the barrack training grounds yeah make an insight check 18 are you deceiving him any as much as he would in the given situation yeah the campaign is over whitestone burns in flames you make your way there jarett you can see finishing a meal looks over to you there's nobody else in the training area it's still relatively early you do with your perception see back on the main stone building you see a few individuals walking back and forth in front of one of the windows it looks like things are starting up over there for training for the day jarett finishes his meal scarfs up the last bit of egg on the side of the plate hey yes probably inside sleeping or waking sure this way sure go for it he sits back down you head inside the door's not locked you open it you see ten different individuals that are all in the process of waking up you can smell coffee very basic breakfast meats being cooked some of them are around tables talking hunched forward and laughing as soon as you walk in a few of them turn and look at you some don't recognize you some do you see in the far corner sitting alone at one of the tables is kynan who is prison-style guarding his food and eating by himself hello all right everyone here's been fine i mean as much as i need to this is still a lot jarett's been good he's been watching that-- wow no i mean-- i don't have anything else right now really so what's the question okay yeah i'm trying (sighs) well i'll do my best he looks down a little bit for a second seeming like oh boy yeah okay all right yeah yeah are you sure i'll do that it'll be done i promise it's all i have to keep me going right now he reaches his hand up towards the snake and simon leaps from from your hand to his and swirls down his arm he looks confused for a second as it wraps around his waist and then forms into the shape of a belt you now see a few other guys in the room and the room's got a little bit quieter they're all watching what's happening what's going on he notices the attention and i'll take good care of him i mean no offense it's a lot of attention right now yeah i will (soft chuckle) same temple yeah definitely and you head out okay at this point in time a number of pages have been sent throughout the city to gather those who've been wandering about whitestone as you are being called to the meeting in the second floor war room held within the castle itself same one where you met with-- sure you take a hit point of damage all right you guys enter the war room same as it was previously left however you are brought the image of the table in early morning allura gilmore surprisingly drake thunderbrand cassandra as well as asum who's standing behind most of them back to the window they all middle of conversation turn and smile as you begin to walk in you see gilmore nods to everybody gives an extra smile to you vax cassandra's waiting for the pleasantries to end allura comes up and takes your hand and she goes it's wonderful to see that you've returned safely i've had many terrible thoughts that perhaps this meeting would not be as positive and i'm very glad to know that i was wrong and that you brought kima back to us as well pike is safe as well so congratulations i guess are in order come sit these circumstances do press our timeline a bit and you see there are a number of other chairs already brought into the room prepared for you guys to sit around together no actually raishan is not sitting raishan is standing with her arms crossed leaning against the window okay as you approach you see asum's eyes watch you small grin on the face and a little nod at which point cassandra gathers all of your attention in the midst of this chaos the excursion to wildemount went well as far as i understand you are now one more dragon-slaying into this chaotic endeavor well done tell me how did this happen cassandra takes it and says it looks quite important allura i can see how this would be confusing it's been a rough week (laughter) all right allura takes it inspects it this is a magnificent artifact well found perhaps we'll take a look at it after the meeting together cassandra gets everyone's attention once more motions to the guards the door that you're leaning by gets closed as the guards step out so it's only you guys having this conversation so with another of the conclave fallen retaliation is imminent and with thordak already infuriated at the death of umbrasyl and we only caught but a glance of that anger thankfully through the means of which allura and gilmore and others were able to cloak the city i do not feel that will last the entirety of the time we would need to take a leisurely stroll through our next series of plans i fear that less protected cities may be in the path of retaliation before it finds its way to us allura speaks up at this point and goes thordak is a creature of infinite pride and a slight such as this against the conclave will most likely trigger the destruction of even more innocents both to satiate his anger and i'm certain to also draw us out he is an intelligent one as is the company he keeps i've also reached out to other members of the arcana pansophical and hope that they would come to our aid but given the recent death of vorugal i do not know if they'll arrive in time to be of any assistance so we have to begin to gather our strengths our allies and honestly i think we need to strike first well otherwise we wait for the fight to be on thordak's turf well we need a plan first we need to gather those we've called to arms we need to assess what strengths we have and utilizing all of these things at our disposal come up with an idea of how we're actually going to do this gilmore steps in and goes if we are to strike i agree it should also be very soon we've pushed the boundaries of being on his peripheral even this long and you say that he knows your faces correct his gaze will now surely fall upon the seven of you at the very least asum steps forward at this point from the wall and begins to walk in front of you keyleth and between percy the longer he remains as well the more the landscape of emon and the surrounding bladeshimmer shoreline begins to churn begins to boil with flame and toxic fume he is scarring the surrounding land with his claws his teeth his flames his roar and those that follow in his shadow his fearmongering has risen a number under him a creature of such pride is eager to show that if you fall in such fear and do as he says there are rewards i'm sure you've come across many weak-willed individuals in your travels that would be eager to jump at the chance of working beneath such a powerful and dangerous creature allura steps in at this point now and says now i believe it is partially his essence but the expedited rate of this elemental transition around him is based on the soul anchor that we embedded within him to keep him in the fire elemental plane this stone that resides in the center of his chest and belly i believe this stone is somehow drawing elements of the essence of the fire elemental plane itself into emon i mean it's not unusual for the presence of a red dragon over hundreds of years to begin to convert the scenery around but this speed i can only see a connection between the enchantment that we hoped would hold thordak at bay and the changes we're seeing at the center of emon and beyond now it was never intended for him to leave that place and i feel deeply responsible for many elements of the danger we now see in this world i only know that i will do whatever it takes on my end to see that this comes to an end whatever sacrifice whatever is necessary i'm at your disposal but the responsibility of the destruction is also our own the longer we take the more chance he will tear through kymal he will tear through westruun he will tear through daxio he will begin to burn everything that tal'dorei is until we show our faces asum is still walking a circle around the table hmph well before we get to that let us discuss things we have at our disposal the information we have and from that we can garnish a plan i am the master of secrets i am not a master of warmongering and attack drake speaks up for the first time and goes aye not to mention that slippery green drake is still out there somewhere and we have no idea where it is two members of the conclave are remaining i certainly hope so and if that's the case then i think you're right go for the king first but we must do so with eyes all about us because the last thing we need is to be flanked by that beast in the center of our attack if we knew where it fucking was allura speaks up at this point and goes look i know that thordak's hate for me still burns hence the reason why they went directly for my tower when they first arrived in emon the one trump card we do have in this is me if need be i'm not saying that's the right plan but i'm saying it is one thing we can perhaps utilize in our plan in our strategy gilmore pops up again and says exactly we were poring over that thing for a number of weeks until we had to build this barrier and to be perfectly honest i am sick of it well we understand it's a siphon it's bringing the energy of the nexus somewhere we don't know where the other end of it is or if it's even functioning properly well i have no personal connection to it i know that i was the architect of its enchantment and the ruse of which sealed it within thordak we designed it to have no weakness the intent was to keep him there indefinitely perhaps if we could-- asum you said you have friends back in emon still that have been gathering intel asum turns yes actually and i was hoping that as part of our plan today we could even go and retrieve some of this information perhaps that could teach us more about this soul anchor you continuously talk about oh we would have to go to emon perhaps i'll go alone cassandra speaks up and says well you've been abroad you've been gaining arms and allies from what you've told me from across exandria let us consolidate our options our strengths and plop it down in front of the conclave best we can asum steps into the conversation and goes the thing with that plan is thordak has amassed thousands of lizardfolk in emon at this point that follow his whim in the nearby mountain ranges many from the stormcrest that worshipped him the entire time that he was gone wyvern riders originally aided in taking the city that you met as did i but since other allies have found their way to the cinder king's sway last that i checked it seemed that there were a number of allies that he brought over from his time in the fire plane as well fire giants in the service of the dragon now walk the streets that's what we're discussing today you were lucky to draw a creature of such infinitesimal experience and intelligence as a white dragon away from its home roost i would be greatly surprised if you had pulled a great powerful intelligent ancient red dragon from its home turf advantage that's one way distract his allies and go straight for the heart you have allies like allura just said all throughout the world well the design and the development and enchantment of it are powerful enough to anchor itself to the soul of a dragon of thordak's strength better part of six months liam and and that was with a dozen other hands helping me most of the arcana pansophical was at my side for that and we don't have that kind of time cassandra sits up a little bit in her seat and goes if we are smart about this we can minimize the casualties far more now than they would be a week two weeks a month a year from now there's westruun kymal were the two that you moved-- westruun's a little bit further than kymal is kymal is where you sent a lot of the westruun refugees cassandra turns looks over to asum and goes recon actually anything else asum you may have in regards to what we can expect there asum is still slowly walking around the peripheral of the meeting table i can tell you that most of the city's wealth and resources as well as caches sealed arcane relics and weaponry long held by the lyceum or the arms of emon have been stolen and thrown atop the victory hoard of thordak most who are part of this rebellion within the city are doing so with scraps that is why the clasp has been so instrumental in the removal of many of the oppressed folk within the city also the fire that marks thordak's presence that have drawn fire and molten rock across the city as well as the outskirts of the city walls scar the landscape and fill the sky with sulfurous clouds and black smoke the good news is that smoke can be utilized should someone have some control over the elements to be a screen however where the cloudtop district once stood there is now but a heated cauldron of glowing stone and flame hundreds of gifts and statues left in thordak's image litter the outer area while a massive cavern dives beneath the central region of the district now this cavern as we've watched it we believe it to be the location of thordak's treasure vault as well as the occasional sleeping place of the massive drake we speak of thordak is also showing rather intense signs of physical change since being released from his prison and his size still remains enormous by comparison his eyes now burn with a searing white light burning stars in the sky his jaw ever dribbles with burning liquid that blackens the ground it touches the gaps between scales appear to flare bright with each breath like a star engine beneath the scales i've no idea allura and allura goes well if the anchor was indeed removed from the fire elemental plane then thordak would have had his soul torn from his body that is how the anchor worked or at least maybe a piece i wasn't there i don't know the ritual that brought him over allura thinks for a second i could try but the enchantment itself-- we don't have enough information it wasn't bound to a specific place in the plane it was bound to the plane itself i don't know how you'd sever it from the other side asum steps forward to the table and puts his little halfling hands on the edge and goes well it's a shame that we don't have any information about this ritual that freed him from the plane i'll see if my compatriots can gather information but in the meantime we'll do the best we can to gather similar information drake steps forward and goes i think that's a fine plan of action reach out to all those you brought in hopefully we can get a few of our friends in this as well they all look at each other a bit confused no i didn't see one and cassandra goes no there hasn't been an airship here no are we expecting one good to know yes so they won't see us if they come if we see an airship do you wish us to flag it down you trust it all right now it's fine i get it reach out to your people on one end go ahead and roll-- i know it is go ahead and roll roll the first attack with advantage okay as you pull the blade out of the hilt to go ahead and begin to strike-- you're a quick individual you're also in the presence of an entity that does not trust anyone or anything you take the blade and swing out in the direction of seeker asum and where your blade strikes it shimmers through the image there's a flash and asum is suddenly four feet away from the position where asum was standing at which point everyone in the room stands up immediately and is like whoa whoa cassandra goes over and puts her hand towards you and asum is taking a few steps back and is like (breathes heavily) there's this moment of extreme quiet tension as allura's looking at you looking at asum looking around and there's like this slow connecting moment of realization throughout the room as everyone's eyes go wide and with that we're going to take a break (screaming) all righty well we'll go ahead and take a short break here guys we'll be back here in a few minutes and we'll (victor voice) see what happens next (normal voice) all right see you guys here in a minute [break] you have a very merlin from excalibur thing going on there right now we need more green lights in here to really get the effect all right so bringing it back in as your blade swings through and passes through the form of seeker asum it shimmers and then darts backward into the corner of the room at which point everyone who stood up and held off at the chaos you see all the faces going off in realization asum goes from a defensive position and then stands up again crosses the arms we're working on that plan as we speak but pardon me if i take a few-- how do you say-- careful backups in case one would take a blade and stab at an ally supposedly at which point allura puts her hand out and goes i'm sorry what the hell is going on here as the tension slowly subsides gilmore puts his finger up pardon my momentary ignorance would you like me to cleanse the room seeker asum takes a few steps towards you casually looks up to you and goes to pat you on the shoulder his illusory hand passing through your form goes i'm quite comfortable where i am right now let us continue this conversation very well since my hand has been forced hello seeker asum is still back in emon dealing with the difficulty of preparing the current circumstance we're discussing i am raishan member of the conclave up until recently tenuous ally with thordak the cinder king who is now considered a mutual thorn in all of our sides i've made an agreement with your vox machina for quite some time together using our combined strengths we slew vorugal the frigid doom over in wildemount we've returned to reconvene i've provided nothing but honest upfront and necessarily vital information to your victory allura you see her fingers are twitching and her arms tense and there's this very faint air that's blowing her hair ever so slightly where there's no wind in the air she's on edge right now and is looking to you guys for guidance like are we doing this cassandra stood up immediately for the first time in a long time since whitestone was reclaimed cassandra now resembles more her age than she ever did she has a look on her face like she's far out of her depth understanding the circumstance there's legitimate fear in her face and she's looking at percival with that look of what have you done everyone's still standing at this point looking cassandra slowly sits down but is still looking between raishan and percival you watch as asum's form steps towards the center of the room the flash of green flaring in the eyes with a smile the anchor that you speak of was indeed removed from the fire elemental plane we discovered that it was indestructible good on you allura well created we tried many different ways rending it crushing it sending it elsewhere without the enchantment tearing thordak with it to no avail in trying to find a way to bring thordak through we needed to bring the soul anchor and the fire elemental plane with it the one place where such research could be gathered promptly fully was pyrah now mind you it was not my intent for such destruction to rain upon them i spent many years with them i got to know them they're a fine people in that time i learned the ways of temporal travel between dimensions the details that allowed me to see the fabric of the fire plane to where we could encase a bit of it within the soul anchor itself once we had managed to crack that essence i was able to from a distance using the allies at the other end-- thordak had found friendship with some of the ousted fire giants they found comfort outside of the ordning under the shadow of the fire dragon in using their deep rich-blooded past and forging and making they were able to convert the soul anchor into something that housed the essence of the fire plane however we didn't have a means of creating a hole large enough to bring both through without destroying both in the process and as such we waited for the right time the winter's crest to some maybe but we called this the ember seed the ember seed resides in the center of this heartstone that is what is causing thordak to swell that is what's driving him mad that is what is drawing the very land around emon to fiery eruption it is also what keeps his soul on this plane it keeps the soul intact with his body in theory but we've tried believe me we've tried to remove it would destroy him as well as the arcana pansophical saw fit so yes both came through waited for the winter's crest had enough power and understanding of the ritual to open the entirety of the tear and thordak screamed through flames in his wake and he laid waste to your people not i you do understand that without my aid you will not succeed yes and there are quite a few in this room that fall in that category she looks to allura and drake i accept my part in this matter as well you don't think i feel duped by this you don't think i have many things i wish to tear from the very corpse of that entity you think i don't want to see him burn as much as you do this vengeance that burns within me what all of us want freedom are you saying you understand the way to remove this that you know the secret to burning this wretched disease from my form well good that's why we're working to watch him fall (chuckles) if you need not my help just let me know i wish to be given unfettered unbothered unwatched control over the corpse upon his death to extract the information i need i will leave your very sphere of existence and understanding until the end of your days oh then i'll find another way then watch watch for all i care it will be greek to you anyway it passes through the form well what is your next step through your journey assume what you will keep great company you do not comprehend the magics that you even speak of it's cute look i agree distance is of aid to us at the moment if anything i should probably cut off the information of vorugal's fall i should speak with the cinder king and still establish my allegiance from his perspective cut it off no but i can attempt to guide the fury if you will i can guarantee it for a time maybe if i knew what the plan was yes raishan takes a moment and thinks i am indeed but thordak has been using us as the attack what do you mean because i check in every now and then to remind him that is an idea hmm take your recess i'll take mine there may be something to this plot i would hope that there's no more errant blade pokery allura is sitting right now she's listening to everything with her hands crossed shakes her head and goes to be perfectly honest this bothers me a great deal but the fact that whitestone still stands does speak volumes at the least with the cards being in our favor no regardless i have a lot to think about as do we all and allura slowly turns her head and looks up probably for the first time since she sat down to the illusory raishan's asum form asum lives then indeed he does indeed he does and allura turns her head back and goes-- go for it 25 okay it's hard to read the demeanor of raishan in general it's this middle ground of neutral expression with a half-cocked grin information flows at this consistent rate of being generally difficult to read the beat of hesitation is meant for emphasis more than covering if that makes any sense so it seems to have an honesty to it if you could read any honesty from raishan i can certainly bring him here if you'd like however he is doing quite a lot of good with the clasp and brom and tofor underneath emon right now and they've managed to save many lives and continue to do so well-- what do you have need for asum why don't you go see him yourself well make your choice either i intercept and begin to work towards thordak's ruse and set a space that convinces him perhaps i've fallen into your hands or i go retrieve your friend from emon i'm not your errand boy and we have a limited time here which is more important so emon it is very well back in a day it's going to be very difficult to pry the cinder king from his nest if anything but i have no guarantees one day then and the image (disappearing noise) as you say that everyone pulls back from the table there he is as you're talking you feel a tug on your right arm and you look over and you see cassandra who has come over to your side and is pulling on your sleeve with a very intense look in her eye she goes percival i can watch whitestone i can get the people fed i can keep the people armed i can organize the day to day i can't keep it safe from that percival percival i don't know what you dragged us into in this but i need you to pull us out of it i can't do this how long have you known oh yeah no allura drake-- for perception you guys are still in the war room oh you don't see anybody else around allura sits up and says well i mean it makes sense asum is the one that requested we not move the war room down to the-- i think that would be the best yes let us all adjourn to the new space at the ziggurat that should at least keep things honest allura picks her robes up and-- okay you guys make your way down to the ziggurat the guards come and start carrying chairs and other elements of the war room eventually you're all led down through the tunnels which have been a little more refined and given an actual more comfortable path past the now-defunct whitestone refinery that the briarwoods had originally established you enter the ziggurat room it has more lighting to it than it previously did a number of torches now line the walls the sconces that are lit as the guards progress upward you can see the reflection to the green glass-like whitestone material that permeates the outside of the ziggurat and not right by it but partially upward there's a small wooden platform that's been where the main base of operations for research and study is here you see a number of desks set out it's been built alongside of the large pyramid-type structure and eventually you all adjourn up into that space as you go up there you all feel a significant drop in enchantment all of your magical items all of everything gradually fades in this space so grog you actually feel your musculature-- the titanstone gauntlets themselves the effect begins to completely fade back to your classic grog-like strength oh do you want to go to the top of the ziggurat and check at this point they're looking around everyone who's journeyed with you towards this new meeting place the ziggurat is of the same physicality they were at the meeting room any illusions that would have been cast aside or dispelled at this point seem to not be present so everyone is by all intents and purposes who they say they are allura nods yes actually yes well then what do you presume we do allura immediately puts her hands up and goes no no no no this is an absence of magic it is a void of magic it is a maw that devours magic the enchantment that we put within thordak is pure magic well right so what we take a few wooden two by fours and push it along look everything i know everything i've studied everything i've spent my entire life working for is useless near that it was the only person i know of who rightfully worshipped ioun was brom arbiter brom he was of the council with us according to raishan with tofor and-- yes this way and she leads you back down the ziggurat out to the entrance where you guys entered this large chamber and about 20 or so meters back you can see there is a specific wooden support beam that is structured within this tunnel and on that beam elements of it are painted black and she goes this is the perimeter in which the siphon devours magic inward what the-- i'd say it'd take a half-mile i don't know the ziggurat itself is built from stone and then the upper exterior of it is covered in this green glass-like substance that is distilled whitestone residuum what level's that that is-- a fourth level you mean yeah so you can create some fey creatures yeah what are you summoning okay so you conjure a pixie pixie flies in continues to fly in nothing happens pixie seems fine they can cast confusion they can cast polymorph they can cast things like that pixie turns around and nothing happens pixie looks confused what sorry technically this pixie-- we'll say for the purposes of this sure there is very basic communication the pixie is-- yeah sylvan is the language that it speaks so it is close enough to elvish that those who speak elvish can like interpret elements of it a little queasy that's all it's weird i mean she's only listening to her so-- all right so yeah you continue to walk as the pixie floats up towards the top of the ziggurat you get to the top and you notice that no all the bodies have been removed it's been cleaned up yeah it's like this empty platform now with the walls encased within a small colosseum and there it is the general spinning black marble the pixie approaches and like-- laura and touches it and you watch the pixie go-- and is gone you see her in the back leaning against the wall like she's seen this a hundred times oh many things chairs outfits pieces of stone metals we've put all kinds of things no nothing living your desk chair cassandra said it would be all right we tried and upon moving it once it contacted it did not move with the box it just crushed and absorbed the box itself given the better part of a year yes a temporary one as in like a-- like a brief spell yes i can do that now it's the permanent installation of one that takes an exorbitant period of time yes but unfortunately there's been no way of connecting anything that goes through it just vanishes well it's north of emon kymal's east of it and the ironsea ridge but kymal's filled with civilians well fort daxio has a piece of an army most of it went to syngorn and we haven't heard since have you reached out to syngorn let them know this was going to happen you mentioned that they were coming to power well we need to reach out to the resources we have and call them in laura and we have cassandra says if fort daxio is to be the place where this is to go down then that will be the place we'll send our allies allura brings her hand up i've done plenty of research on these i mean no offense to you keyleth but you convincing an entity that exists on deception through deception to believe you in that regard and based on that conversation she already seems to see through that ruse i would not recommend it no that is far beyond my capabilities (as victor) no allura says yes i mean i don't know anyone in daxio at the moment riskel was the only one or riskel was the one i knew with a connection there and his father mikael was in syngorn who those who are there most likely here i'll give you a written and she pulls out a small little side scroll pouch scribbling a note and says this is a decree from the council they'll have to listen to you she finishes writing it rolls it up so they'll be at your disposal it's not the army it's the reserves we'll do that and then we're meeting you at daxio correct very well daxio it is we'll see you soon beep beep bidet and with that we'll finish the night's session picking up here for next week well yeah it's 1030 i don't know you'll find out i guess it could have been nasty had it been a less tricksy dragon maybe (as victor) there here (as victor) i get to enjoy this for a little bit at least (as victor) two cheeseburgers couple of fry (as victor) filet of fish (normal voice) oh man all right we'll be back next week for whatever the hell your final plan is going to be for this i am so excited travis and i'm excited for the countdown to thordak that we're now embarking on cool guys thank you so much everyone looks awesome happy halloween everyone
