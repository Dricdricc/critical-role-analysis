right so 25 to 20 21 all right let’s see here 20 to 15 15 to ten all right so we have molly then we have caleb and nott together all right who's next i guess i should say what'd you roll all righty at the top we've got jester all right so top of the combat round as it pulls its jagged blade out of its side and darts forward in the direction of the group beau you actually have the first reaction seeing this happen you immediately jump into action and what's your turn don’t have time to react what are you doing you look over at jester who is holding caleb up and is not even paying attention you're like shit it's athletics-based all righty so go ahead and make your athletics check you actually beat him wow that was a five plus ten on that one that was a 15 so you wrap the rope around and immediately it's grappled in place unable to move although its arms are free it cannot seem to pull itself away from you so that's your action-- that's your attack go for it roll for an attack 16 does not hit you swing and the head ducks out of the way it swings wide and it glides against the edge of the leather mask but makes no impact correct all right that ends your turn beau the dark figure arm looking at you and looking out in the middle of the space concentrates for a second puts its hand without the blade in it-- actually it would be this one because it's right-handed-- focuses for a second as it does you watch as this tiny bead of darkness appears in the center of the area and expands until a sphere of pitch-black light completely engulfs this space and none of you can see into it or past it you are blind within this sphere and you guys see the whole hallway it consumes the creature and beau yep that's going to end its turn that brings us to molly okay so if anything comes within range that you want to attack-- the minute you see something vicious mockery got it okay all right so you draw your blade out you take the damage and you prepare vicious mockery got it all right that ends your turn molly caleb and nott you guys are up on the same turn travis and yeah okay as the globules go in they blink out did you send all of the globules in there okay the two blink out the two remain there but the other two you sense that they're no longer in existence you have two globes lighting up the area now it's low light in here all right frumpkin peeks in all right cool that ends your turn nott what are you doing you do not sense a reply but for the hell of it go ahead and make a persuasion okay good to know perfect finishing nott do you want to move anywhere not in this area no you'd have to get over here to hide there you go good to know that finishes nott and caleb's turn jester you're up you okay good to know you're prepping the spell that ends your turn fjord you're up unless you want to move at all okay good to know fjord you have armor of agathys on you cast that reactionary last time so what are you doing all right you stop as soon as you come to the other side as you rush past there's a (swoosh) in the darkness that is going to be a 25 to hit it did roll very high so that is ten points of slashing damage but he takes damage back right as you run by the blade strikes you manage to feel it glide off your ice armor and you feel the blast of ice energy you beau as you're holding the rope feel this spray of dark cold and you wince at it in the darkness but that gets you on the other side sure okay you glance over in the area in the darkness the light's fading at this point but you have darkvision you don't see any other figure sure waiting on the opposite side you got it all right that brings it up to the top beau you're up try and shove you mean well if you have someone grappled you can pull them at half movement this way or this way okay so you manage to push it out of it right there and you're both outside of the darkness yeah it's through the darkness beau that's your movement you still have an action if you want i'll say as you swing he manages to loosen the grip a little bit and the rope comes a little bit loose if it attempts to break your grapple it's going to have advantage on it at the beginning of its turn it's now grappled up in front of you it pulls its blade with both of its hands and its head turns back towards you now that you're the one who's been pushing it out and it begins to unleash two heavy strikes against you that's another 25 and that's going to be an 18 both hit okay that's going to be 20 points of slashing damage from the two strikes as the first blade impacts across the front of beau's chest there's this strange grayish flash of energy that seems to scatter from the impact of the blow and it congeals off to the side and you watch as this for lack of a better term a shadow clone of the creature appears off to the side behind fjord there it looks semi-corporeal it's still holding the blade it has the same armor but it's somewhat translucent and made of this dark grayish shadow energy also beau you feel the second blow that hits you it seems to carve a letter or some kind of a symbol on your chest as it pulls back and as it does you feel this burning singe and you look down there's this glowing brand on your chest it's not burned into the skin it appears to be magically placed but you have a brand on your chest that you don't recognize that's going to end its turn molly you're up yeah you've heard them impact it's just darkness but you hear yelling and shouting and then talking back and forth and then beau taking damage and this strange shifting of energy in the distance what are you doing 30 you get to the edge of it you can barely peek out you can continue to move but it'll be your action to continue to move okay good to know that is wisdom right that's an 18 i'm pretty sure that passes the vicious mockery seems to be unaffected by your demonic voice sorry he looks pretty wounded already like bleeding out the side it’s your choice in what you want to do but he's really powerful but really hurt that finishes your turn molly caleb nott what’re you doing this way okay sounds good all right jester oh no it hasn't come yet you're right you see caleb and jester there and this curl of darkness-- yeah you hear all the sounds happening and the shouting and the impact-- you hear them around that corner that's all you know that's as far as you can get with your movement you could bonus if you want to move around from there you can see your friends you can see fjord you can see the creature you can see the shadow form out of the side you can see beau with a hint of molly poking out of the darkness all right go for it roll for an attack a 20 hits roll damage okay you watch as it dissipates the impact hits it and you see it react slightly and then vanish into vapor all right jester you're up it does you cast the spell and then hold the very last moment waiting to release it and then if it doesn't happen the spell expends i'm sorry sure (counting) 30 you can just manage to see nott at the corner of it and that's about as much as you can see the rest of it’s just darkness still encompassing the corner 25 or 30 you could get either of those spaces there if you want to right there all right so now you can see it but that's your movement and your action does that end your turn all right fjord you're up you do have a bonus yeah all right beau it's your turn no it's fjord's turn sorry you can go for it roll for an attack you are technically on opposite sides so i would say flanked i'd allow it 24 that hits roll damage same damage if you bring it to zero they go unconscious not bleeding out 12 points of damage whack you swing across and slam it from the back of its armor and (grunts) you hear this exhale of pain out of its throat as it hits it spins around and you watch as that same energy that came out earlier when it struck beau the blow that you hit it dissipates into the same energy and then forms into another shadow version of it behind you he's taken damage he's getting hurt he's hurt pretty bad does that finish your turn all right top of the round beau you're up okay unfortunately you need a feat the grappler feat to then pin somebody go for it roll for an attack the 19 does hit 12 nice so as you crack across the head you watch the helmet slip a little bit you can see a little bit of the jaw beneath the mask now and the skin itself has a dark blue purple color you see white teeth that have pretty prominent incisors visible you're just shouting yeah all right beau is that the end of your turn all right it is now the creature's turn the creature is going to swing one strike at beau in front disadvantage well you prevented a natural 20 that's good so that's 19 still hits that is-- ten points of slashing damage beau falls to the ground unconscious the rope goes loose at which point the creature turns around towards you fjord as you focus on its face you feel this swing from behind as the shadow version is going to try-- that's going to be 21 that is nine points of slashing damage and it vanishes the impact the actual blow hits and discards itself into the impact of the blow let's see here it's now going to swing forward and head over to make a strike at you 15 does not hit did you amplify it okay that brings it to 19 okay that is eight points of slashing damage that's a constitution saving throw for that one is it that's a 12 what's your dc on that what's your charisma bonus all right so your dc with that would be 11 so yeah it succeeds it takes half-damage you still do damage 2d10 four points all right you see this blast of ice come out as you're shouting infernal at it it strikes into the armor and pierces parts of its shoulder as it (grunts) it goes limp for a certain point you see it flex angrily it's looking really rough as the attack hits you another one appears over there eight all righty that's going to end its turn molly you're up yep that's actually not true it's double damage that's both the weapon and the-- as a reaction he's going to use transpose echo and shift over with that guy you watch as suddenly there's a shimmy of shadow energy and he switches places with the shadow version of himself you end up striking the shadow thing which is dissipated from the impact (counting) you do yeah you can flank him actually so you strike the one angrily spin around and then catch it behind where you see him appear filling the spot where his shadow clone was that hits roll damage five points of damage how do you want to do this as you spin the sword around coming down (crack) you hit across the side of the head and the body collapses and falls to the ground unconscious the darkness vanishes no all right so as you all-- unconscious you strip him of everything he has there's the armor you pull off there's the blade and the sheath there's a pair of dark jagged black boots that are pretty cool three daggers that are all hidden in pockets in the armor and a pouch that is hidden within the plating of the leather armor that is filled with quite a few coin if you go and inspect within so that gets you 116 platinum pieces yes and 12 gold pieces ten gold no they are standard imperial platinum there is also the dodecahedron that is the slow undulating gray glow that he was holding before dropping it and rushing towards you to which object okay you focus on it for a bit it is definitely magic the magic contained is outside of the parameters of the spell you're not entirely certain what it's capable of there's something alien about its magic source that your identify spell is unable to pierce as you focus more and more on it your brain begins to open up into what feels like space endless expanse and it begins to scare you just the endless infinity of nothingness and you pull back and (gasp) oh that's interesting it seems very powerful whatever it is but you don't know quite how it works do you want to continue and concentrate on it okay sure you took the helmet off when you took the armor off the helmet is part of the armor the armor is very well made with the armor removed you can see the deep blue somewhat purple colored skin it resembles actually you if a bit darker whitish gray hair that goes just past the shoulders it was tied up in a tight bun into the helmet and tumbles past once it was pulled off dark elf definitive drow correct what you thought you saw the fingers dipped in the color was actually just gloves that didn't have the fingers covered it is a male yes the more you think on it the more you know there's more to this device it scares you but there was something you were close to there something you were close to learning you're not sure what lies beyond that threshold you keep thinking on it it's up to you okay he's still unconscious there’s blood curling out the mouth and nose he is beaten no well the main character of the book was the julous dominion was what once ruled the marrow valley so yeah so the main character was not xhorhasian they were a general in the army of julous which was-- yeah the julous dominion which as during the conflict before the dwendalian empire conquered it right you're maybe 150 feet from entrance of where you came down and you're a few hundred feet from the way that leads back up into the city of the interstead sprawl make a perception check plus no okay you look past and you can see some folks darting back and forth occasionally across the end of the alleyway otherwise you just see the dark shadowed walls and the dark sky above with the cloud cover no one seems to be immediately coming towards it for the time being okay it takes a few moments but eventually he (mumbling) (grunts) spits out a bit of blood on to the front of his chest and the rope and (grunts) (speaks in undercommon) and so you've cast-- the essence is stupid empirical scum you'll get nothing make a i'll say a persuasion check because you haven't technically allied yourself with the empire entirely though you are part of the empire you specifically are not part of the empire you did not grow up here his eyes narrow towards you and still bears the incisor fangs (breathes heavily) the right eyebrow curls up into a very confused expression (sounds of disgust) as you're shoving this pastry into his face you can see right now he appears demoralized ready to lash out at the first moment's notice and has seemed to have calmed a bit from the confusion of the displays in front of him but doesn't seem to be buying into any of what you're saying at the moment i can understand this (gasps) that is a that would be a nine that does not succeed okay you watch the eyes gloss over for a second wait hold on a second where's my player's handbook do you have it real fast here i'll grab this one real fast double-check one more thing i am trying to confirm one of the racial traits of the elves if i recall is they have-- yep advantage on saving throws on being charmed i do that's going to be a 12 it's eight plus-- yeah 13 still fails all righty so as the eyes glass over for a minute the snarling and the tension in the muscles relax for a minute untie me you rushed me and began to assault me he keeps looking at you it's ignoring the rest of them it goes what happened to the beacon the beacon it looks around right it's just glancing about yes very we are here to retrieve the beacon from the empirical bastards in zadash we had it i have it i don't know what happened to my companion but so far i am successful and i need it the beacon is part of our culture the beacon allows the rebirth of our people it doesn't even pay attention to beau the beacons are sacred i have lived four lifetimes as long as the beacons remain me and my people will live more we do the souls continue with each rebirth the memories retain what is the intention of the empire we live we worship we learn we die we are reborn until we are perfect we find more beacons no that was my companion you see at this point now as friendly as it has been there's this look of i might be saying too much and i don't trust the most of you still” that's all right for this mission just the two of us we had help but out of the city i've said too much either kill me or let me go you cannot trust anybody in this city you cannot trust yourselves anyone who has not bound themselves they are the enemy there's a moment of very tightly closed eyes the jaw clenches as he looks about i cannot our allies in the empire are short on the list that would be an insight check sure 13 he's not in a very strong place the charm spell is-- and give me the beacon no sure 14 kind of hard to read on this one i will strike you down where you stand and take it it's too important yeah i'll say yeah why not sam and 21 and you'll leave the beacon free me give me the beacon you give it back we go our separate ways i run he didn't seem to flinch okay as you pull the cloth up and look the grey light energy spills out from underneath and you watch as it looks over and it can see it now its eyes go wide and you feel the soft undulating low hum to it okay you match the tone as you do he's like (growling) okay it taps it sounds like you're tapping some sort of a stone or rock no it does not (sighs) this long heavy sigh hearing all this conversation and not knowing who to trust even in spite of your spell thuron then walk away the name itself does have meaning in undercommon it is a name no the nuance to the word from what you can best understand is-- it means blessed second born is the best i can find the right words for it it was taken from xhorhas (chuckles darkly) grins and looks up from your fucking wizards i don't know the details i was just sent to retrieve it i don't know all the answers by my empress you don't know much do you empress leylas krynn you did question was no actually that one is a proper name well the marrow valley is in the empire you guys are in the dwendalian empire xhorhas is to the east of here it's the wastes to the east of the ashkeeper peaks he nods slowly he stares at you confused but you will give me the beacon yeah you returned them okay are you fraying it with your sword the-- (trails off and chuckles) the moment the rope breaks-- i know but as you begin to pull you notice that all this time that's been happening the ropes in the back have gotten looser and looser he uses that point to grab the blade and swing around and pull it up against you i'm sorry i need your help he's not cutting him he's just grabbing going i'm sorry i need your help and is holding you now against the wall looking at the rest of you and says leave me he pushes you off he rushes over and pushes the cloth off the beacon real fast picks it up and holds it goes over and starts picking up the armor he puts on the armor puts on the mask puts on the leg armor takes the beacon turns around and darts deeper into the sewers other shit you have yes yeah you hear a shout in the distance in the direction that you're traveling echoing down that way and you see a flash of firelight torchlight in the distance you hear a (hiss) and the sound of weapons clanging-- yeah in the direction he went and then it goes quiet and you hear voices say we got him we got him and other voices and around the corner up ahead you can see a little bit of torchlight flickering against the wall okay hand me the object please the item sheet sam and doesn't work that way all right there's some other muffled voices down the way it's back to the tri-spires you hear footsteps you guys manage to head back up into the tri-spires back into the alleyway as you close and lock the thing behind a voice in the back of the alley-- you guys watch as two crownsguard approach and go hey you and both pull their swords to hold out in front and one guy in the back a third one arrives with a crossbow up to you guys and says hands up weapons this would be all of you guys as you got out of the sewer what's your business (chuckles) i will say since it wasn't a single person i'm going to ask for a deception roll from both of you since you were the first two to speak up yeah don't get advantage roll one more and you rolled a-- they take a moment get out we're investigating they move in and they don't take their arms off of you they get behind you and move you out of the alley into the street and begin pushing you guys in the direction of the outer wall of the tri-spires we don't have any information at this time just get out we're still checking please you see the tower still listing but held in place there's this flickering arcane energy underneath it that occasionally a wave goes (whooshing) that's holding it aloft you can see crownsguards are now-- some are shifting in the streets going and weaving through the buildings and there's a bunch at the actual exterior wall and they eventually push you through and lead you into the central part of the city they pushed you away and you guys are now in the interstead sprawl no you have not been paid who are the two that are keeping point leading you guys to the song and supper make a perception check please make a perception check i did 14 okay you catch it first and you corroborate it as you guys are heading down the road near the sewer exit where you guys were previously there's a commotion gathering on the side of the street there is a crowd gathering now and you hear gasps and people starting to shout you can see now crownsguard are coming out of the sewer and they're dragging the dead body of the dark elf that you had seen below and throw it onto the ground people are like (gasps) and they're looking at it and some folks are talking i've never seen one up close like this there's this murmur in the crowd as all about the guards are like don't worry don't worry both of them are dead you're safe now thanks to the might and the trust of the empire the king keeps you safe you do see it being held by one of the guards in one of his hands yeah two of the guards pick the body up and one of them puts it over his shoulder and all of them cluster together as the crowd follows them some of them are taking sticks and poking at the body as it goes the guards are like please stop no they're heading in the direction of the king's hall it looks like okay so you move and weave into the crowd you push up and look and the body has deep lacerations all through the torso and back it looks like they cut him until they were sure he was dead they're heading down the street right now they're turning the corner heading down to the main thoroughfare you can if you want to (laughs) okay okay make an acrobatics check just for the hell of it just to see how fast you get up there 16 and make a stealth check please all right as you dart off onto the rooftop like batman you just vanish amongst the night sky and you okay make a deception check this is as you falling forward ah and make a scene this is just to see how-- okay so the guy's-- as you fall in front of him he's like please miss move away and two of the guards rush forward and start picking you up and shoving you off to the side more people are coming out now and gathering the crowd around to see them pull this dead crick through the street word's getting around and people are-- okay i will say make a dexterity check if you don't mind just a straight dexterity check 21 you barely manage to--your foot doesn't quite reach but your tail does as it scoops around his ankle (yelps) he falls back and lands-- and you are disguised as-- okay okay okay and you catch it the guy starts getting back up he grabs you by the front of your armor and goes you need to get out of our way okay that guy pushes you off-- he starts looking around the ground okay roll a stealth check because you're holding a glowing undulating device it's like a deep grey 14 okay you may so there's two of them currently what's your spell dc what's your intelligence modifier okay so it'd be 13 would be your spell dc okay i will say that the two guards that noticed you leave with the object even though they're coming over to be like (confused stuttering) they see the other object over there and they both get confused and look at the two as they're standing trying to figure out what to do they both split one goes for the object over there one goes for caleb he's catching up to you and goes like hey hey we're going to the-- we're going to the hall of the king right right well come on and the two of you turn around he guides you to turn around you're now walking trailing behind all right some other townsfolk are starting to like walk up to get a look at this object now that the crownsguard are holding so you're off you're behind the group the large cluster is moving maybe about 60 70 feet ahead of you now you are back-- when it was turning onto the main street is where all this transpired so you're a little bit off past the corner of where they are they're just starting to curve out of sight and you are walking with the guard now in that direction slowing down the other object that you caused the illusion of is the other way and the guard has about 100 feet or so to walk to get to it and he's partway there and he hasn't quite learned what the scenario is okay what's the saving throw on it is there a saving throw oh all right cool yeah and he is not currently hostile towards you make a deception check with advantage 15 as soon as you say that-- oh shit thank god for friends as soon as you say that blew the hole in the tower you watch him take an instinctual step back right i'll go catch up right he darts ahead looking over his shoulder as he starts to try and join up with the crowd make another stealth check because there's other folk now that are coming out and are seeing this the other guard has just now gotten up to the illusion no there's the other guard that was paired with him that went off to go after the illusion that nott had created what spell is this yeah so as it drifts up in the air the guard goes uh looks around all the about 17 or so townsfolk had began to converge to look up at it they're all like ooh they're all excited looking at it it's definitely distracting the current group the one guard there is like go back back to everybody he's starting to look nervous because he doesn't know why it's lifting up and he's uncertain about what's happening you make a stealth check you're only getting it because they're distracted by that to try and duck into the alley unseen you're not quite close enough so you duck into the alleyway not sure if you've been seen all right what are the rest of you guys doing all right right so you guys go behind as you begin to approach you can see there are two teenage kids a boy and a girl that are dressed nice enough both are like did you see what he was holding i want to see it they both go into the alleyway after caleb as well in this alleyway there's no immediate door it looks like there's a solid wall on one side and an arch that leads into a small walkway that leads between the buildings if you keep going then it splits off into a t intersection of alleyways right or left you take a left all right so you land and they both go ah uh-- uh-- make an intimidation check with advantage with advantage because you just dropped down from the sky okay the two kids go (scoffs) it's not worth it come on the girl (sniffs) fine they both turn and walk away kicking the dirt a little bit perfect okay all right so you guys dart off into another alleyway you still do hear guards shifting but you start hearing other people are talking people are starting to go back to their homes they're whispering to each other listening in you hear phrases being said like the city's on lockdown this is crazy i'm supposed to be leaving tomorrow you start hearing whispers about the gala and like how many people were killed oh i heard like 100 people were murdered serves them right those fucking rich bastards you know passing conversations it's now the buzz of the town even this late at night as people are now either emerging to see the scene or are returning to their homes seeing what they have but the crowd has dissipated or at least the crowd has moved on towards the king's hall and are probably in the process of trying to figure out what the fuck happened to the object they were carrying you guys manage to dart off to the side of the is the eastern end of the interstead sprawl you aren't apparently followed at the moment but you're still holding this glowing-- it's about that large it's got two handles on each side it looks like you're carrying a lantern all right so at this point now the guard who's down below has called over like four other guards and they're all at the bottom of it some of them are getting their crossbows ready to shoot if it does something as it swells and then behinds to drip they all start backing away the guards start pushing people away the guy that was originally carrying it with seven other guards begins to approach the cluster they have broken off from the procession with the elf body and they've now joined up with the other guard he's like there it is stay back stay back they're all nervously waiting for this thing dripping and doing nothing and they're all scared it does and there's a brief moment as everyone holds their breath and you hear a couple of local townsfolk go (scattered applause and cheers) (laughter) (dopey guard voice) i don't know it just flew in the air grew big and then made sauce and disappeared okay you manage to catch up you dart past two teenage kids that are cursing to each other they're both like yeah that woman was such a bitch as they pass by yeah (laughter) all right so the two of you are making your way to the leaky tap song & supper right the rest of you guys are going to the leaky tap but finding a box on the way you said at this point it's past midnight and most of the market is closed you do still have a glowing beacon in your hand it does cover it up it's a very faint bit of glow that comes through the fabric but it's enough where it probably won't be noticeable from a distance it's possible none of you are very well-versed in the ways of blacksmithing or lead objects so-- yeah there's no looters no no and at this point now the streets are fairly barren of crownsguard they’ve all-- aside from the cluster that you saw moving through there's a whole bunch at the perimeter gates of the tri-spire and where they would normally be posted at the different corners of the streets they are not all right so you two are heading to the song and supper okay and you guys are heading to the leaky tap all right so you head back while you guys are heading that direction you head to the song and supper you manage to make your way there it's still open it's fairly empty on the inside there's only two patrons that are present at this hour it seems like the commotion has drawn most of what clientele would have been in there at the moment and there’s only two patrons that are both halfway into their cups and pretty drunk or tired at this point but you look around and you don't see dolan you don't see horris you don't see kara yeah there is the general barkeep there which would be-- clay owens yeah he's a balding portly gentleman middle age or so as you walk in he aye can i get you something all right crazy night from what i'm hearing aye certainly here you go no no oh no ulog was in earlier this evening he was here for a while and then left with some friends think dolan and his boy were in for a bit they rushed out in a hurry about an hour ago just the two of them no they just up and left figured they were done for the evening they looked a bit hurried maybe you could probably go to their home that's usually where they practice out of better get there soon then it's kind of late marisha and no worries here's your drink he gives you the shot i don't-- that’ll be a silver he goes i-- uh-- thank you kindly of course he tucks it away thank you okay as you guys quietly make your way towards dolan's house as you approach there's no light from the inside make a perception check both of you nice you both notice there is a quick bit of movement on the inside even though the lights are out there's a moment pause and the door opens up very quickly with just enough space to let you in do you go in okay you head inside it's dark in there but you have your dark vision so you look around and it looks like dolan and horris are both in there horris has a candle light with a side hood that's keeping it contained to a small area dolan goes oh thank god you're okay we're trying-- we don't know what to do through the bedroom okay horris is in the process of taking things and putting them into a sack they are basically rapidly-- we can't stay here if they trace anything back to us they're going to string us up in front of the tower great so now we have a murder on our hands too horris goes keep your mouth down please at this point that doesn't even matter we can't-- yes but if there is any chance they can bring that back to us-- maybe we leave town for a short time maybe just go make a persuasion check 15 he goes you're right we should-- and horris goes no what do you want them to go ahead and throw us in the dungeon is that what you want i understand what you're saying but none of us knew that the high-richter was going to be dead i'm sure they have ways of tracing that back what good-- and dolan goes calm down please maybe he's right maybe they don't have a way to bring it back if we see this through-- horris takes the satchel and sets it on the table puts the candle below it and walks up grabs the side of dolan's shoulders and says i understand but i don't want to lose you and this scares the shit out of me they both take a moment and look at each other horris looks at you and says i think you're right neither of us know how to talk our way out of the guards if they come by we're not good liars horris nods okay then we stay and dolan says no i stay just in case things go wrong i want you safe and gone if this is to be turned around i'm the one they're going to look to i’m the one who actually has the political influence here i'm the one who can talk and make a difference if that is to be done in the next few days or the next week if you can just for a while trust me and just leave is that okay he looks to you and horris kind of-- fine but i'll come back soon dolan nods okay i'm good sorry horris i don't need you for this it would be stupid for both of us should anything go wrong to be taken swept up by this okay trust me she's still out back horris rushes off and opens the back door make an investigation check there's piles of trash that are pushed in the corner you look through and you don't find anything that catches your interest of course i don't have kara's but i have ours and i have ulog's he left that with us before he left tonight yes he let you in at this point horris brought you in he points over too and you can see there's a smaller sack and a larger one that's more of a backpack that seems to the be one that ulog left he goes take them please that's of no use to us at this point horris is letting beauregard in and knowing that it's just the two of you he puts his hand on your shoulder and says keep him safe get him out if you can please” i don't know just out of the city just out of the city for a week that's all i ask a cart rolls by and they all get very quiet maybe okay invasion i'm confused horris slaps the shoulder of dolan and says i told you there was something up with that guy i just didn't trust him i mean it took a while for us to be okay with each other but he was always on edge that's something anywhere i could help change the law of the town make an insight check 11 hard to read but he seems forthright i will thankfully when all this went down we were both in the song and supper so at least we have an alibi i've just never done something like this before pardon my nerves you see his hands are literally shaking and you see notice now he is very nervous i will he goes off to the corner and pulls out a small glass bottle of liquor he comes over and him and horris give a very tight hug to each other and then separate dolan sits down puts the drink on the table “thank you go horris comes with you guys towards the leaky tap you guys make your way to the leaky tap okay okay so you will cast-- oh from sutan's house i got you yeah here you go a sending stone one of two you do not know where the other one is no not that that was a gate stone this is essentially a means of communicating between two stones you head down into the basement area beneath the leaky tap once again the guard is pretty sparse you’ll see one guard walk past but their numbers seem to have been ushered elsewhere in the city so you make it down there and you take enough time that you eventually get the lock back open that you left you head down into basement it's exactly how you left it make a medicine check a seven hard to tell i mean just looking at the level of decomposition it's been here a while make a medicine check to see if you can ascertain the creature type it definitely doesn't appear to be anything beyond humanoid the size the shape of the skeleton it's a standard humanoid skeleton but you’re not able to tell anything beyond that that's upstairs okay make a general survival check to pull things from the surrounding-- sure you look at it the job he did and you’re like yeah i can probably do a little better it’s fine essentially you didn’t do a masterful job in completely camouflaging it but it looks like it’s the rest of the objects that looks dusty and left there there were some barrels there was an open crate with nothing in it it’s a dusty unused cellar so you hide it up and put it off to the side you look in the crate you look inside and see a fairly rat-eaten sack of rice grains that have spilled out as well as a lot of rat droppings in the crate it looks like some of the wood at the bottom has been chewed through as well anything else guys all right it is yes it’s in the alley while this is happening-- okay as you’re holding it there it’s strangely warm to the touch the more time you spend with it holding it there yeah okay let me see here okay yep so you head back up into the leaky tap tavern there’s a handful of patrons a lot of them are talking or whispering about the events tonight talking about the tower’s still up there it’s crazy the general conversation-hubbub through the room probably in her office okay who is it um w-what do you want i did not know that my apologies no not on me well-- come back in the morning i might have something for you no i am busy at the moment everything is just fine i'm fine do not worry it is currently in use but i can swap it out how long do you need it for okay then come back in the morning i will have it cleared out then it will be at use for you no i'm okay okay it's locked make a perception check with disadvantage because you are looking through a tiny little gap in the floor nine you see there's light in there and you can see claudia darting back and forth behind her desk moving very rapidly and with haste is grabbing things and seems to be writing something feverishly but you don't actually see her you just see the bottom of her feet moving back and forth she stops in the space um i'm-- everything's fine i heard about it make a persuasion check 15 the door opens up and you can see claudia looking as pristine as ever hair makeup everything done perfectly come in quickly closes the door brings you inside i am aware that you and your team were involved in something this evening am i correct but you are not in any way shape or form perhaps doing a burglary and job breaking in for the knights of requital yes make a deception check she looks at you confused and goes well regardless your friends are involved in something that as a precaution as i have been housing certain meetings out of friendship with an individual there is danger that i might be pulled up in this so i am preparing to sell off the tavern it will only draw attention to me she walks over and finishes tidying paperwork on the side make a general charisma roll just for the hell of it ten she goes to a friend (sighs) she kneels down at the side of the room and there's a cloth put over a small table like an end table and she removes the flowers from it pulls the cloth off and it's a safe out of iron what else would you make a safe out of she pulls out a key and unlocks it brings out a couple of bags of coin brings out a couple other bags of something you don't hear any noise the rustling as she pulls it out sets them off to the side looks at you while she does so the whole time like-- here’s your safe hands it to you it's small it's heavy but you're pretty strong all right probably well i like you too but that's okay don't worry the woman i'm selling this to is also a very good person and a good friend there's a brief pause glances over at the paperwork on the table-- lauren lauren schvine it is i appreciate the information i should be okay good night not a problem she watches and waits sees you smiling arms crossed on the desk patiently waiting the door closes behind you and you hear a (heavy sigh) audibly on the other side of the door so as the rest of you begin to catch up and gather for the evening we're going to take a break (cheering) not all of them there’s a lot of interesting ways that could have gone all right so we have the black walnut deck box from our friends at wyrmwood here also apparently comes with a magic the gathering pack these have been in all the boxes so you get a little gift in there this will go out to one winner you have to enter twitch chat starting now you can only put the word in once or you'll be disqualified but the word tonight is threats t-h-r-e-a-t-s come into the twitch chat enter that once again only unfortunately available to people in the united states and canada excluding quebec we're trying to figure out how to fix that in the future but weird laws in giveaways anyway we'll be back here in a few minutes much love and we'll see you soon [break] there you go we have a winner the winner for this evening is iraginger iraginger congratulations we'll get that box to you asap well done all right so bringing us back into the game you all begin to converge back in the leaky tap the party has reassembled aside from you who are staying down in the basement yes as you guys all gather together what do you do yeah it's pretty (blows out lips) it's very iron-y it's like licking a nine volt battery make an intelligence check because you are an alchemist i'll give you advantage on it yep 15 okay yeah this is very definitively iron you've tasted iron iron filings and things of that similar nature and it has the same twinge to the flavor as a note so you guys recall horris is with you horris came along with you guys horris is in the room with you we'll say for the purposes of this the door now opens to the room and horris comes in after a drink to steady his nerves and goes hello just for a little bit about a week or two until things-- we don't know yet it's just a precautionary measure we have an alibi but if we both stay and we get found out we both get arrested what do you want me to do then she who questions everything and offers no answers what do you want me to do i don't blame her either as far as dolan told me yeah i can wait until the morning if you don't mind me crashing with you seriously all right anything else you want to work out discuss or plan it's roughly longsword length it has this curved hooked edge to it the blade looks like it would not just slash but tear as it went through flesh as well it's pretty wicked-looking i don't know can you sense magic then you do not know they look nice you take a moment and you feel alert they look functional they're similar in design to the longsword they're not quite as intricate and they're much simpler they don't have the same grooves carved into the hilt and they look like fairly decent daggers for either stabbing or throwing you're not certain what material they're made from it's not the same as the-- what are you doing it's got a great balance yeah the armor you gave back and then was scooped up by the crownsguard okay do you attack him roll for an attack you attempt to parry cooly and she hits you in the right eye pain the daggers seem to be simpler in design you're not sure if they're special or not i mean the only person who can detect magic is not in the room i know go ahead and roll an attack go ahead and roll an attack 22 yeah (vibrating impact) it sticks to the bottom of the sill it doesn't quite hit the glass it manages to hit its mark and stay there like a dagger horris isn't in the room anymore gerald stockholm caleb as you're sitting there talking to your skull the door opens and nott scuttles in closes the door behind and comes and joins you which one are you handing him that's right yeah okay the scroll case is a scroll case it does have a faint magical element to it the limits of what identify can-- i'd say it's about eight by 12 okay you both back out close the door you hear (boom) you don't know everyone else make a perception check please you hear a slight shift in the ground exactly everything's messy your room does not no a purplish dark fume wafts out you back away from it and it dissipates over the next 30 or so seconds you keep watch to see if anybody else notices and it doesn't it rises up and thankfully by the time it would hit the roof as a smoke beacon it mostly has dissipated enough in the sky where it doesn't cause a column of visible darkness the edge that you're catching of it the little bit that's wafting through has this very fine metallic smell to it almost the brief bit that catches your nostrils you feel your sinuses open up very abruptly and like a mouth full of wasabi it's like (coughing) eventually it clears out and you walk inside no not a ball of fiery death schmidt is-- it might have been damage-dealing unseen servant oh yeah schmidt is gone the scroll case is open both of the scrolls emanate-- you see within the scroll case there's now two rolled-up scrolls inside there and they emanate a magical aura the longsword emanates a magical aura the boots emanate a magical aura and your satchel is almost distracting the vibrancy of the magical source from that object the crystal-looking object okay it's a longsword the daggers are not magic they are just base daggers it's true all right all right so as you guys all come to sleep for the evening first off we'll consider this rest the milestone where you all hit level four (cheering) while you guys figure that out if i could have everybody but caleb leave the table please laura and just set up your stuff except for your hit points we'll roll those when you get back don't roll hit dice roll hit points when you come here you won't need dice you're fine we did it totally so as the dark takes your dreams sleep brings calm brings peace brings rest there's a soft hum that seems to radiate around you a welcoming softness a light not quite white not quite dark it's a grayish familiar light strangely you feel it pull you forward through stars the distant night sky you see beacons of light coast by you see a dark sphere before you then there's a flash of light and you're standing there and you're holding the object in your hand which you keep it's welcoming you look into it for a moment and look ahead and you see yourself and you see another self and you see another self and a fourth caleb and a fifth caleb and an endless row of calebs all slightly different all begin walking in different directions at once you look down at the object and back up again and they're all gone you see a distant flame flicker you feel yourself hypnotized by its movement you look down again at it and there's something wonderful and ancient about this thing you can't grasp it its scale is both too large and too small the more your mind tries to make sense of it the more you feel yourself walking in 17 different directions at once all those calebs you saw before are all within you and they're all pulling at different sides and it confuses you it scares you for a moment but once again you focus back on this object and the warmth is comforting you look up again at the stars they've stopped passing by they're held in place and for the first time in a long time you feel at peace that's the end of your dream all right let's bring everybody else back in please you wake up in the cold dark basement of this relatively unused cellar beneath the leaky tap come to consciousness with the most restful night's sleep you've had in a long time it feels almost you look over at nott curled up right against your thigh like a dog asleep come on in (laughter) (laughs) all right so first off let's go ahead and get a roll of hit points here so we have-- we haven't done this live on air before that's okay so go ahead and roll as a general rule i reroll ones for hit points because nothing sucks more for a character than leveling up and rolling a one so now two is the new sucky baseline so go around the table you are rolling for hit points first fjord d8 for the warlock yes seven nice there you go plus your con modifier yes yeah every level that's how it's always been caleb d6 okay for you yes i believe it's a d8 nice all righty that's your modifier you add the eight to it yeah it automatically adds your level up to that roll yours there you go no you get con modifier every class gets a con modifier to hit points there you go all righty it's okay sometimes you get better rolls than others (laughs) if you don't roll at least four hit points you die in your sleep if you die in the level-up you die in real life all right so anyway continuing the hit points are the main thing and your abilities we can keep tabs on that if it comes into play and we can define stuff after the episode tonight but anyway as you all come to consciousness in the morning the day is before you what do you wish to do horris is already awake and looking out the window and looks nervously i mean an escort would be nice just to have somebody i can work with in case things go bad on me 20 gold it's enough to last me a while yeah okay you guys get to get your breakfast started and such you guys begin to walk heading southward since that was where the alfield suggestion was making your way the general bustle is still happening there's still not a lot of crownsguard on the street corners you're used to seeing them posted at and as you make your way towards the southern portion of the interstead sprawl to the southern gate you can see why the exit gates are swarming with crownsguard the portcullis is down with the smaller side doors open and every person who enters and exits is being interviewed and being checked as to whether or not they're allowed to leave it seems that lock-down is very serious during this investigation horris immediately clamps up and grabs your arm and goes i don’t-- i don't know-- okay you both slowly make your way through that intersection and back and no one seems to pay much mind they're consumed with the current hustle and bustle at the gate as you guys are walking back horris is like is there another way out is there someone something you know-- no no no okay okay all right as you guys are getting the rest of your morning on what do you want to do getting your morning on oh yeah all right damn dude you look behind fjord at this point and in the doorway is horris arms crossed biting his lower lip yes i honestly don't we scattered when the preparations were done to make sure we were far apart so we couldn't be traced together i don't actually she says she occasionally works out of that really terrible bar the evening-- i don't go there that's true the horses are being taken care of the horses will be fine the manticore head though that's probably a whole different order of business oh excuse me no you brought it in the city with you do you know a smuggler i can do that i'll lock myself in there and let me know if anything comes up all right horris gives you a long look of i've learned a lot about you in the moment (laughter) i'm sure the community is already halfway there buddy (laughs) all right so horris is taken care of for the moment what's the plan the broken veil (laughs) okay so yes i know what you're talking about now thank you for the heads-up on that so the broken veil bluffs is to the far far east that is where the border of the dwendalian empire and xhorhas is it's actually where most of the conflicts happen it's where the garrisons exist where most of the army is sent to defend the empire in the valley you are ready for this shit their bryce was the one that sent you to the leaky tap bryce is the one that sent you to claudia no i think you're going in circles i don't recall there-- i was like what did i say about bryce's sister oh shit there you go once again if i did say sister remind me the leaky nip that's a different establishment (laughter) caleb for the hell of it make an arcana check i know fuck okay it's fine all right continue it's not about not enough it's placement and what you have and where you are so what are you guys doing you find your way there yannick is inside currently working on hammering out the edges of a piece of armor hello can i help you i mean i certainly can depends what you're hoping to have made that's a very curious liking but sure i'll take it hey i'm not judging the halfling scratches his temple and goes well i mean if you're willing to pay i can make it it's going to be a lot of lead and a few days to make it that there's a little more easy to put together that's up to you sure right okay we’ll go ahead and get started on that there full cost to you two days' work materials that'll run you back about one and a half gold one gold five silver all right it'll be an additional silver all right come back here in about 48 hours should be good i could certainly do my best i am but one small halfling so you’re going to have to wait one way or the other sorry no worries mate come back then you guy haven’t said you’ve split so i imagine you’re all as a group my hair went (wind sounds) on that one at the moment no it seems to be a common thing here in the pentamarket not at the moment what are you serious that’s terrifying you guys making your way to the pentamarket okay it’s still early morning relatively you make your way to the warm welcoming interior of the invulnerable vagrant there are no other patrons in there you do see across the way one pumat sol is sitting behind the counter with knitting needles there is one off to the side in a chair that’s currently reading through a book the small set of glasses on the tip of his wide nose they both look up and go why hello there that's just a real nice thing to see you this early in the morning just about to finish my breakfast snack so you caught me at a good time not all the time we generally do a cycle of sunrise to about four hours past sunset that's our general scheme that we maintain business beau well the pleasure is respectfully mine he reaches out giant hand encompasses your entire fist he puts the book down takes his glasses off what can i do for you we've got quite a few here currently containing items that require shielding yeah that can probably be done how big a box you're looking we got them right around that there then we got a bigger one about that there then we got one in the back that’s a biggie all right let me go ahead and-- well what the nice lady there is requesting is a box that is lined with the material known as lead no magical properties it’s just really useful for poisoning yourself if you put food storage in there poisoning other people if you store their food in it and keeping at bay the prying eyes of distant divination magics not a problem well we got this here cloak here on the wall i think you’ve already taken a look at it that’s a pretty protective-- the other one who's knitting is like yeah it’s a pretty penny because that’s a pretty item goes back to knitting that one will run you about 800 gold pieces we got this nice shield over here that we just had finished a couple days ago that's an enchanted little delightful piece that one is a little more affordable at about 550 gold pieces the shield itself has the head of two lions facing away from each other with their claws extended it has almost a diamond shape it's a pretty decent size the coloration of it is a bright gold where the lions are the back of it is a dull almost graphite metallic with a gold border around the edge of it it’s very pretty this one it improves your defenses more than a normal shield would it instinctively places the shield in places that might help protect from incoming blows therefore making you hard to connect with (whispers) it's a plus one (laughter) the fancy box that you’re requesting while not actually enchanted it is taking away one of the objects that we keep contained so respectfully i'll have to charge you the cost of that one and a replacement but that'll simply put you back about 15 gold pieces total that is none of your concern your friend is a strange one oh i can entirely understand that that's really impressive actually that is a very doable enchantment it'll take us a little while but we can definitely make something like that happen about a week's worth of enchanting time the cost will put you at about 250 gold pieces we can go ahead and outsource that yeah we can make that happen for you couldn't we the one knitting goes yeah that's not a problem at all you’re going to pay up for now up front oh the whole lump sum up front i appreciate your trust in our ability writes up a quick little piece of paper hands it to you as a receipt 15 gold pieces for the box you wanted two healing potions that’ll put you back about 100 gold pieces for the two we got probably another dozen or so more if you want to buy ten whole platinum all right there 50 gold from each of you that’s a healing potion to each of you yeah we have certainly many number of various scrolls and scroll types and spells if that's what you're looking for we can definitely provide i'm going to go ahead and double-check here he goes through his ledger let's see the very basic ones whether that be cantrips or 1st-level spellcasting those are fairly common those will put you back about 50 to 100 gold approximately i imagine they could no it's a regular healing potion regular heal if you're going up from there to 2nd- or 3rd-level those'll put you back probably closer to maybe 250-500 gold depending and then it skyrockets from there i mean we have to order them from the academy but we can get them in here for you or the halls of erudition the box is presented you pay for that 15 gold a lead flask it's weird every level the intelligence gets lower while this is happening pumat picks up the book again and puts the glasses on and starts continuing to read make an investigation check right so another 50 off you 12 nothing at the moment it's only been a few days and the enchantment process and/or the coming in of new objects can take a while to stock back up the shield is the most recent creation that was presented that's the only new one you see other than that there's still the pearl there's still the cloak a few other odds and small wands oh if you want pumat prime he's in the back i can go get him for you all right he puts the book down on the counter glasses off turns around leaves comes back in takes the glasses puts them on takes the book and continues reading while pumat prime comes from the back once again the large set of goggle glasses on the apron on i was told that i was requested to greet you with a 'hello' simulacrum that's the one yeah i know it's a little confusing that's kind of a personal story let's just say i didn't get along with my peers at a young age and found myself wandering got picked up by some nice mages that saw some potential took me in and helped me hone my craft and helped me set up a store and here i am in zadash been running this place for a good 12 years thank you sort of they were with the cerberus assembly yeah they really-- oh no the main person who's been of aid to me is the headmaster oremid hass who runs the hall of erudition he's the headmaster of the hall he scratches his chin for a second he's the archmage of cultivation within the cerberus assembly he's been a real nice beacon of tutelage he's a bit rough on the edges and seems tough but he's a softie especially when it comes to small critters don't tell him i said that for that one moment you see a look of fear in his eyes travis and maybe i don't know anyway i got to get back to work he quickly goes into the back room again don't mention it the one that's reading off to the sides goes-- shocking grasp i know what you're talking about i got it myself anyone want to see all righty i like the gumption he goes and gives a big old handshake to beauregard let me look that up real fast it's an auto-hit because you're reaching out to it you immediately grab his giant mitt and a flash of white light and pain as electricity rocks through your body you take three points of lightning damage that one will run you 75 gold pieces hands they look paws-ish but yeah we can get you a shield spell that's a pretty standard defensive mechanism for those of the arcane persuasion he thumbs through the ledger that one will cost you about 200 gold pieces all righty there 275 gold pieces he sets his book back down puts his glasses down leaves the room for a second and is gone for about a minute or so comes back with two scrolls and sets them on the table my pleasure anything else you guys require or can you leave me to my reading it's a collection of crazy tales about this weird fella it's the daring trials and tribulations of sir taryon darrington this guy's been all over the place it's kind of wild (laughter) oh it's got to be fiction (laughter) but it's good fiction well let me finish my book before i tell you too much about it needless to say he's got this wild construct-looking friend called dottie and apparently according to this thing there's these powerful folks from over there in tal'dorei that he's been meeting up with that keep messing up every time they go on an adventure real thorns in his side i got a collection sure i got this shipped out to me from deastok perhaps if you are in that vicinity see that you get yourself a copy i had never heard of it until this so probably not that easy to find i mean i'm not really a book retailer that is probably a place to look for a book not yet all right you are always welcome any time all of us are happy to see you come in and spend your hard-earned money goodbye goodbye goodbye a little hand comes out from the curtain in the back bye-bye all right so you guys return do you head down to the basement it's still there no the skeleton is still dead as he's holding it placing it over the box there's still that undulating low hum and grayish glow-- make an arcana check the essence as you're looking at this and concentrating on this object trying to get a grasp on it now that you have a good moment to look at it the school of magic or whatever the source of the magic is here escapes you it seems almost beyond or separate than some of the magics that you've naturally learned through your acquisition of spells and the pact that you had made but you don't get the sense that it's extraplanar or anything that would constitute the same level of danger that you think caleb is focused on okay i need you all to roll-- no i’m kidding (laughter) the downside is longswords are not finesse weapons so you'd have to use strength to utilize it yeah well are you proficient with weapons like a longsword your weapon proficiencies my player's handbook keeps disappearing from me yeah so you could not use a longsword these boots are designed in a similar style as to the armor of the xhorhasian individual you had fought no not obvious they’re made of a very dark brown or black leather with studs and the tops of them curl up into two spikes at the tip at each side well you have to make a saving throw is it a wisdom saving throw yep for the next minute your face is curled up into a joker-like smile minus kara's that would have been 628 gold 21 silver and 302 copper so what's the plan okay so you guys are going to the evening nip all right you make your way over to the familiar dirty small sunken dive bar the same two beefy-looking guards on the outside eyeing you as you enter you come inside the same two individuals sitting at the the same booth and the far table and there lies clive binz the dwarf with the half-burned beard as you enter he's like ah good to see you again what can i get you yeah clive can i get you anything right well then take these gifts with you he turns around and looks at the rest of you and steps into the back room do you follow him all right you step into the back room of this dive and as you step inside it's a storage cupboard there's shelves up there with various bottles of liquor wine and ale he's currently pulling a small chain up on the corner as he does you watch as a small trap door goes (creaking) it winches up and there's a stairway that leads down and he goes-- as you all slowly descend down the stairs it closes behind you you hear a few things shift over it you descend down the stairway and you begin to pick up the sound of soft music there's a gentle violin playing and a lute or some sort of small string instrument this staircase spirals downward onto the left and as it curves down for about 40 or so feet it's getting colder just from the subterranean depth that you're going from the warmer surface eventually you hear some voices and some laughter and a clink of glasses as you curve down the light gets brighter from around the corner until suddenly you look into a stone-set subterranean tavern from floor to ceiling it's about 20 feet tall you can see there are two balconies that overlook it from the left side and one that's barely visible around the corner as the room opens up to the right of you there's a table immediately down from where the spiral staircase ends and there's a gruff-looking fellow sitting there looking up as you enter he looks
