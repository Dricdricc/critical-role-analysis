[dramatic music] how many is this seven sams that's your name for the night seventh sam-urai so folks not long-- there's a narrative not long before you finish your preparations for the final battle with vecna you all spent an evening going to rest with unease and as sleep took you a vision fills your mind groggily you come to wiping the insides of your eyelids trying to find some means of grasping the scenario around you as unfamiliar smells of stale water and crushed stone begin to fill your sinuses the light blearing into your vision you slowly focus to look around you and find a strange assortment of structures in the vicinity and there above you cracking through the clouds with a thunderous boom you see a cloaked figure descend from the heavens hands held aloft palms up to the sky as bolts of energy arc around its form as it slowly drifts hovering above this central tower the sconces of flame below burning with embers that drift up with the wind and vanish the cloaked figure spins around revealing the face beneath the hood a well groomed beautiful familiar beard and his perfectly combed hair one side of his body contains unique armor with a series of spines of metal seemingly protruding into his arm as if to keep it in place (laughter) as he spins around making eye contact with the five of you members of vox machina his voice billows out you've come again and here you are and since you're here i think it's time that you show me what you've got show me what you've got with a thunderous clap he vanishes you see a singular column of green energy left behind where he stood that now rests upon the top of the pillar you watch as these two disparate towers on two ends of the battlefield begin to slowly spin as energy crackles throughout them you look around the field for any sort of view of your opponents and all you see are your friends and you know in that moment that this is another challenge from the great colville to show who amongst you is most powerful his voice cracks out from the heavens roll initiative it's an ability check yeah no i'm checking real fast here hold onto your numbers for a moment which can include yourself i'll put it this way does everybody have something they wish to prepare before the battle and as a note whatever potions that you had on yourself that are healing potions are out of this battle as you check your contents of your pockets sure liam and as you take in the gravity of the situation you can see a small sparkle around you as a containment field marks the exterior of this battlefield both around and roughly 80 to 100 feet in the air yeah initiative orders 25 to 20 all right so we have currently percy at 24 scanlan at 21 grog at 20 i would like you both right now to roll a dexterity check roll a d20 add your dexterity modifier yep because technically you're on the same initiative but i can't have you doing your actions at the exact same time this is to see who's slightly faster wait how'd you get 32 that's your saving throw it's a dexterity check still higher no it's just an ability check you're fine you beat keyleth so there is a burst of speed and vax is ever so faster than keyleth his dextrous capabilities edge her out of the initiative order so keyleth you're taking up the rear i know with that as those two towers are currently crackling percival it's your turn all right so you rush around that's about as far as you get with your movement looking inside you see a large cluster of sigils carved into the ground with crystals sticking out and it's this low pulsing purple energy make a perception check actually 23 you notice a small groove of similar pulsing kind of purplish-blue energy that runs from the circle and out of the chamber which is this line here and then you also barely see on the edge what appears to be an archway a door that is built that has a slight shifting barrier of mist where the archway is you move into the archway okay and with that you move here that's where it puts you and having revealed those two elements of the battlefield going to leave those two open for the time but there is a roof up there about ten feet tall end of your turn okay scanlan you're up okay you cast invisibility on yourself that's your action that is currently a door meaning it is a door 25 no you're not a rogue buddy no sorry however you are currently considered invisible it's been a few weeks since we played and i left my markers at home but that's okay that cake means you're invisible it's an invisibility cake all right finishing scanlan's turn grog you're up 30 you're at the door go ahead and make an attack against the door 20 go ahead and roll damage you now hear a thunderous roar grog's voice billowing out from the air not too far from you across a moat-like pond of clear water that surrounds the vicinity of the central tower with a smashing sound you see wood splinter off into the air with the axe this is the bloodaxe bloodaxe is a d12 yeah d12 what did you roll 23 double eight yeah the door is destroyed it's blown inside the hinges kind of (squeaking sound) and what little bit of the door still remains kind of breaks off and slams into the ground and revealing the interior of this chamber the door now open it is empty except for a singular chest sitting in the far corner from you that was 30 you still have 20 feet of movement yes you can nope that would be an action okay at this point both of the towers-- the sparking energy arcs outward and nobody's in the vicinity so no worries there you watch as energy sparks offward and hits the other structures nearby and then eventually pulls back into the towers and the glow is slowly building once more vax you're up okay roll a stealth check please not at the moment okay you're on deck keyleth okay vax vanishes into the shadows of the field let's see here yeah that your turn okay ends vax's turn keyleth you're up yes is this in reference to a creature blindsight means that they either don't use their eyes to see and as such blind doesn't affect them yeah creatures without eyes such as grimlocks grey oozes either it's naturally blind and can see without having to use the eyes or if it's ever blinded it doesn't affect it not with blindsight with tremor sense you would still feel him running across where are you casting it right it creates a beam when you cast it correct but when you initially cast it you create a beam so if you want to fire at wherever and it's gone that's fine yeah you very plainly see percy all right first blood other than the door which to be fair is the most vox machina opening thing to destroy no travis did earlier all right percy i need you to make a constitution saving throw please yes it is you do yep your spell dc 25 i think that saves half as much damage 33 damage half that you take 16 points of radiant damage you do it's considered a large creature no because about ten feet tall it's about as tall as the roof but you do see keyleth come out of the side blast a sunbeam-- your line of sight over there you barely see her rush around the corner fire this beam of energy and then (whooshing) into an elemental and then curl around the way ending keyleth's turn percy you're up you don't know where he went so percy has silence on him scanlan you're up i mean 25 would put you-- almost not at the moment it doesn't look like you know where she went but you don't see her you walk up to the door and you're going to try it no it's locked 25 little gnome feet okay do be aware-- invisibility ends when you cast a spell any spell i know what are you holding your action then yeah does your earth elemental have tremor sense make a perception check 15 no because you went your full movement so yeah no she senses you she has a pretty good idea so you don't see him and as you're looking around you sense the ground (footsteps) something's there something just moved behind that other building from a story it's before because i needed a reason for vax to still be there but i wanted to make sure that everything was there yeah tremor sense 60 feet yeah all right so that ends scanlan's turn you don't know that you're like aw i'm so slick nobody knows where i am she's like-- there all right and finishing scanlan's turn grog at this moment the energy in those two circles begin to (vibrating) percival you glance over the back of your shoulder and you see a burst of bluish-purple energy fill the entire chamber inside this entire room fills purple it washes past you you feel warm but no damage nothing yes and that's all you saw grog your turn you may you use your action to open the chest and reach inside you get yourself a potion of superior healing sure 50 is about right here it is solid but there's no roof on it it's an open cylinder almost like a small cylindrical bunker it's about six feet tall yeah you could use it for cover or use it to hide the other ones though with the towers on top are solid even though they have windows there imagine those have no entry they're just a platform for the towers generating electricity does that end your turn grog all right that brings us to vax all right there are stairs that spiral up i'm sorry this works for a certain point before i'm like all right 24 hours yeah but he still loses the battle royale okay got you all right that ends vax's turn keyleth you're up you're going to sunbeam the gnome scanlan as you're sitting there hiding-- this giant earth elemental comes around the corner that you know to be keyleth and looks in the general space you are and fires a beam in the direction where you are and it's wide enough to hit you so you gather in that brief moment before you get completely enveloped by burning radiant energy oh shit she knows where i am make a constitution saving throw please yeah you can that's true no yeah you're right thank you for reminding me of that yeah make a constitution saving throw okay so you're not blinded and you take half damage no once we get the damage in he has to make a concentration check 32 so 16 points of radiant damage and i need you to make a constitution saving throw with advantage because you're a war caster all right you're fine you maintain concentration on invisibility all right so keyleth is that your turn all right you moved around that way top of the round oh you do have a bonus action still yeah percival you're up but now you're beating the ultimate villain yourselves 30 you get to about there with your movement yeah so one over this way okay all right that's your movement you do as you turn the corner glance over and you see a large earth elemental around the corner stomping within visual range that's true and you do see grog across the water that way well that's 30 feet right there so you have four attacks which weapon are you using well taliesin here's the weird thing cabal's ruin currently has no effect it currently lays against you like a normal cloak but you still get the shot off so you can roll damage on that piercing damage which non-magical you're resistant to so you would take 13 points of piercing damage for the first hit you still have three more attacks you watch (gunshot) you see bits and pieces of the outer-shelled armor of the earth elemental fracture and spiral off minimal impact okay i'm pretty sure that hits go ahead and roll damage okay so as you take half that because you're raging you get pushed five ten into the barrier make a constitution saving throw okay so you succeed so you take-- that was a very balanced roll like six six six two two one 23 points of force damage halved 23 would be halved so 11 and you do not get pushed as it slaps you into it it slams into your back and you feel it forcing you away from it at a much harder rate than you were forced into it but you manage to hold firm on the ground and not get pushed forward all right so that's your turn scanlan you're up you watched her walk around okay this will break your invisibility so level two i just assume at this point so 2d4 plus six so hearing scanlan's song marisha there is no roll because it is irresistible your earth elemental form begins tapping a heavy stone foot (impacts) you start turning into your own version of stomp a one-elemental show slamming into the ground to the beat maintaining it although he stopped singing you're feeling it hold on let me see here let me check one thing let me check one thing just to be sure because she's an elemental and that may or may not have an impact on this all right yes so you are not immune to charm so you're fine so you can't move that's true so on your turn you have to use all your movement to dance without leaving your space so you're unable to move from that spot until you get rid of the spell you can as long as it's in that space so you can do a little box-slide into that five-foot square and you're fine it lasts until you spend an action to try and make a saving throw to resist it yeah you also have disadvantage on dexterity saving throws while this is happening so you can't move you still have your action and you can still cast spells from it but until you spend an action to try and make a saving throw-- this would be a wisdom saving throw doesn't matter so scanlan-- okay that's about as far as you can get okay that ends your go top of the round grog you're up the torches at the base of the tower begin to flare up and then (explosion) you watch as all the space around the outside of the tower radiates with burning flame affecting nobody but you get the sense that there are elements to this field you have to use to your advantage or avoid altogether grog as you see this flare burn around you and then dissipate it's your turn vax you're up so that's what you see you're on deck keyleth no you still have your action okay got it all right keyleth you're up nope scanlan is making you dance and then goes like do-do-do and disappears behind the pillars irresistible dance go for it the dc is 22 you do not succeed you're just grooving out only one way to find out as your form shifts into that of a moving grooving fire elemental you continue dancing in place but now it's less stomp and more really smooth soft rave dancing essentially that ends keyleth's turn percy you're up percival the cloak the energy returns to it you feel the boots solidify back in place and no sound all magical items all effects it seems no sound the door's closed okay make an attack with it yeah no roll damage the door doesn't take psychic damage you fire no sound the door opens with a creak no sound the chamber within reveals a chest in the corner you hide off to this side waiting technically it's not reducing your movement you're just spending your turn dancing in place this spell is worded apparently to just skirt around freedom of movement you can move you just don't want to you're flashdancing in there that ends percy's turn scanlan you're up true polymorph is concentration correct that's okay the brass dragon figure goes back on the table sorry it's getting better no it's not do you shake it out of your pant leg you do all have the earrings in yeah you've got everything you have yeah you can scanlan what you got grog you're on deck go for it m'lightning bolt it is the m'lightning bolt (laughter) the bardic school of white knighting i need you to roll a dexterity saving throw with disadvantage because you're dancing 26 points of lightning damage to your fiery form no you're just boop okay that ends your turn top of the round grog as you are coming around the way you see a familiar sparking of lightning energy as the two lightning towers blast off a radius of lightning energy but no one's in the radius to be affected by it that brings it to your turn make an attack you do another heavy hit right after the bolt of lighting dissipates over the horizon you see splintered woods as an axe swings over the range of the nearby roof of that building you hear an angry goliath yell as the door is sundered opening to the chamber within all right vax scanlan is playing the exact opposite as he did as taryon in the last one okay so that ends your turn keyleth you're up and with that you have your movement back yep you do no you don't have another action because you used your action to resist the spell which previously keyleth had two elemental forms before she had to make a short rest 20th-level keyleth has just transformed into her third form at full health you get the sense now and you've heard of such rumors in your research as a bard that certain powerful archdruids can wild shape as many times as they want all right that's your turn percy you're up no it's a solid wall about six feet tall which you can see keyleth peeking over the top a little bit all right you open the chest and you acquire a potion of superior healing no he's not invisible anymore you see him okay well and you're further than 60 feet from him i think actually yeah so it wouldn't work 28 to hit you take ten points of damage you don't hear anything all of a sudden-- so you take 20 points of damage and the (impact and grunting) and you glance over your shoulder and you can see across the way there's percival gun up but you've heard no gunfire 26 points of damage lightning damage also gets doubled 33 is doubled so 66 points so 106 points of damage from that shot okay you reload well he's not actually using a hide action he just goes into a chamber so percival that's the end of your turn scanlan you're up you watched this earth elemental dive into the tower right next to you in this open space you get shot the fuck up you're covered in your own blood and you watch percival in the distance slink out of sight and you're hurting bad there you go heal up 11 points of damage hey it all adds up i'll keep this on deck just in case ancient brass dragon just chilling on the side you're on deck grog the opposite circular tower all righty hand me the piece all righty that's your action grog at the top of your turn actually nothing happens because none of you-- all of you are not able to see anything happen grog it's your turn you pull it open potion of superior healing i also want you to make a constitution saving throw 19 wasn't a great roll you take 20 points of poison damage halved because of your belt and you are currently poisoned as you open the chest this dark black-purple smoke billows out as you grab and pull the potion out of it almost like a trigger or something it fills your nose your lungs you're coughing and it seizes the inside of your chest and so you are currently poisoned you can get right inside if you want okay you're hanging right there just on the outskirts no because you were hiding behind the side and he rushed right to the hallway i'll say because you weren't hiding and as part of the battlefield here glancing about he does see you because you do not have a hide action ends grog's turn all right i see what you're doing that's your turn keyleth currently what's the tremor sense 60 feet no movement at all yeah yeah that hits roll damage and then double it percy you're on deck yeah you just punch the door in and your fist goes through it and you have to pull it off the hinges and shake it off of your giant battering ram-like fist the door opens reveals a singular chest against the other wall well it's an action to open it but you can move up what's your movement as an earth elemental 30 feet yeah you'd be able to just get up to the chest but you don't have another action to open it yeah you're having to duck down to get in there it's about ten feet tall and you're like eleven-foot tall as an earth elemental probably littler than 12 so you're crouched down a little bit that ends your turn percival you're up yeah that's the end of your movement you'll be able to get there currently no you can not nope you have no sight on anybody you get to the top aim and the battlefield's quiet and empty and you're like ah fuck well your movement's there so you can't move any further okay are you trying to hide or are you just trying to give yourself cover so you're going prone yeah well no to drop prone is fine to get up out of prone is just dropping to the ground i know silence is different than vibration unfortunately i mean it is vibration in the air but that's not going to stop vibration in the ground it just dampens the sound nope he's just outside of it so you feel nothing got it make a general perception check for me if you don't mind saving throw yeah sorry ending percy's turn scanlan you're up okay yes you think yeah you'd die make an intelligence check oh yeah he's going (huffing) yeah you've worked with him enough to know that while he's raging charm effects-- sorry i'm giving you guys benefit of the doubt that you've all worked together enough to the point where you do notice elements of techniques and tells because it's helped you in the past let me tell you if there's anything to turn vox machina away it's elderly people no it's a bonus action it's used sorry percival glancing over you can see scanlan emerges from around the corner keeping an eye looking around the battlefield and doesn't seem to notice you're there well he wasn't holding an action grog top of your round you watch as the braziers at the base of the tower flare up and flames consume this outer area just on the outskirts not the top but just the surrounding area of the tower and then die down the walls of flame burning to an ember and then vanishing it's your turn it's a small a sigil raised platform okay out the other side you emerge you get right up-- oh god you get right about there sure make an athletics check to see if it succeeds okay now i need you to make an acrobatics check for me because it is a very small doorframe you're trying to leap into you do jump but your head and shoulders slam into the doorframe so you get the additional leap you're now in the doorframe you're blocking it off you have a little bit of extra movement but that's as far as you can get you have a ringing in your ears and you're like that smarts a little bit you as you're there by the chest you hear (grunting) you turn around and see grog in the doorway like (grunting) looking at you right in the face that finishes grog's turn vax first question no text your actions jesus okay good to know that brings us to keyleth you're now between a chest and blocked door frame with grog in it oh i keep forgetting to ask you make a concentration check when you took damage as a fire elemental with advantage with the fire elemental's constitution yeah i wanted to see if you lost concentration on the sunbeam all right cool it was 26 or 27 damage so you would have to make a 13 or 14 what are you doing keyleth you guys are playing it really safe now that's true no you-- okay i take it back one of you is playing it real safe what're you doing keyleth sure you can certainly try you first attack would have to be a grapple attempt your athletics versus his if the elemental doesn't have any athletic skill then it's just your strength modifier go ahead and roll no shit i was not expecting that not with advantage you reach out and grab and you have grog make your other slam attack correct 17 this is against the chest technically what's your armor class yeah okay you reach and grab grog you slam him and it destroys the chest it splinters underneath roll your slam attack damage 14 points of bludgeoning damage to you grog you're not prone but you are moved to the opposite side of her the chest is shattered beneath you liam and i need you to make a constitution saving throw grog you make another one as all of a sudden poison gas fills the entirety of the chamber around you as soon as you destroy this chest you are unaffected by any of it so you succeed 18 points of poison damage reduced to nine no but he's poisoned so he has disadvantage on attacks and ability checks until he gets rid of the poison against her yeah i'll allow it you're not prone she just moved you over and slammed you into it you managed to maneuver and get back on your feet but your impact against the chest destroyed it and released the trap inside you can but you have disadvantage on the attack because of the poison so it's just a single strike 32 points of slashing damage right now the whole place is filled with poison smoke you have no idea you have full movement he already used his reaction so he doesn't get an attack of opportunity on you you are submerged in this water that ends keyleth's turn percival you're up you turn around and you watch around the corner you have scanlan peeking around one side and you have keyleth coming out as an earth elemental turning into a water elemental then disappearing beneath the surface of the water nope but you did hear the impact oh right silence yeah 24 okay as you enter the tower-- ten 15 20 25 30 you're up on the tower now as you get to the top of the tower you glance over and the column of green energy that was left behind when colville vanished sits there creating this beam this central circular area right there is infused with soft sparkling greenish energy just the center circle there is a trap door over that you back up against the wall you currently have three-quarters cover in that space ending percival's turn scanlan you're up yes so you're holding your major image of scanlan out there right now grog you saw enter the chamber and vanish into the doorway nope around this way you peek around the tower there make a perception check please i would like you to make a perception check as well you glance around you can see just on the top of the tower shoulder against the area the outer edge of percival's form holding his gun up and taking cover right up on the side there end of your turn scanlan the flames burst from the braziers around the tower the entire area incinerates around the outside you're right i marked that incorrectly i forgot to mark that you watch as the two separate towers give off a burst of lightning energy and do not affect anybody keyleth you notice this as you're inside the water which is just regular water as you're swimming through it regular water not terribly deep it's about three or four feet deep you're flattening form as a water elemental to hide beneath the surface you get the sense the water around you is starting to vibrate a little bit there's a strange effervescence to it that wasn't there a moment ago that's all grog you're up you rolled 27 you heard (footsteps) that's right nothing the cloud dissipates you said you want to sift through the rubble make an investigation check you spend your action rummaging through the shattered remains of this you find bits of the trap mechanism within there and you find a shattered glass vial with trace elements of a healing potion that has since been destroyed you do you get down there you get a familiar weird medicinal herbal flavor that is mingled with shards of glass that are gathering on the outskirts of your tongue make a perception check you glance over and you can see in the water the slight very different movement of the water you can basically see a slight form in there only because you rolled really high you used 25 of your movement you still have 25 left you've used your action you have five feet more nah you'd have to move next to it you're on deck keyleth all righty that ends vax's turn keyleth you're up grog as you're waiting on the side you hear the ripple of water as you glance over you watch this giant wave as keyleth's elemental form emerges from the water out of the middle of it this beam of energy i need you to make a constitution saving throw you might have to be in melee i'll double check just to be safe against spells cast within five feet of you poisoned just gives you disadvantage on ability checks and attacks correct yeah you take half damage and you're not blinded you take ten points of radiant damage blasted it burns past your skin it tickles a little it's like a bad sunburn they're small slits that you can see through but that's it that ends your turn percival no from where you're standing you heard the blast no that's right silence spell man it's creepily quiet you walk into the greenish energy as you step into this field your body feels warm no sound you just feel warm as you go to pull for the door it (clicks) i mean you don't hear a sound but it resists have you taken any damage okay you sense as you're stepping in there not immediately but the sensation is that similar to one of your allies were to cast a cure wounds on you it has a sort of regenerative property to it the longer you stand in it it hasn't taken effect yet okay so you go up into the very edge of that radius and just hold your weapon okay that ends your turn scanlan you're up peek around the corner at this view you do not have eyeline on percival you know he's up on the tower you did you heard thuds of impacts and a burst of energy you saw like a bright light glow up over the distant sky for a moment reverse gravity okay on that spot all right your illusion fades it's concentration bringing it back 50-foot radius which would also affect keyleth yep all right so i need keyleth and percival to both make a dexterity saving throw i need keyleth to make a dexterity saving throw 12 no (counting) that's 50 this is going to be interesting keyleth you suddenly go firing up into the sky percival you watch as keyleth spins up slams into the top of the field i need you to make a constitution saving throw you take 29 points of force damage as you slam into the field and then it thrusts you 15 feet away from it and then you head back towards it so it won't affect you this round but you're currently being just bludgeoned repeatedly percival your hair is standing up on end above you you take a moment to try and right yourself and are now finding yourself having to fly upside down yeah you're fine it doesn't do anything to you but it took you a moment to readjust he doesn't hear it that ends scanlan's turn it didn't affect anything because you were flying you had to right yourself but as soon as you started flying upward you went oh crap and you caught yourself that brings us to grog's turn at the top of the round keyleth and scanlan definitely not percival grog you notice this too behind the entire chamber on each side it suddenly fills and flashes with that purplish-blue energy the energy travels through the center and all the water and surrounding also flashes once with that same purple-blue flash and then dissipates and returns to what it was before you now notice that those rooms are connected to the water and whatever's in the water when that goes off-- no that was the purple grog you're up you step onto the crystal circle make an intelligence check it's hard to concentrate it's really warm under your feet no it's pretty clear but you're a few inches taller than you were a second ago because you're on the platform that's cool yes it opens up out to the water yes you're watching her being-- 8d4 plus eight keyleth you're up what's your fly speed yeah you can get to percival you could get to a lot of places from here it's been nine rounds you have one more round-- you also enter the healing column i need you to roll a constitution saving throw percival halve that to 12 you take 12 points of radiant damage percival and you shield your eyes just in time as the blast hits you from above to have it not affect your vision you still have about 60 feet of movement if you want keyleth staying that far up you can't fly quite that high up with this range because the ceiling is there you do now as you float over you see the tiny little gnome right there on the ground end of your turn keyleth that ends keyleth's turn and we're going to go to a break because we're at a break point here we'll come back here shortly to ensure that we continue this roundabout battle of care and delicacy you have been you've been doing good you and scanlan both have been doing pretty well grog's been going door-to-door salesman you have not we'll be back here in a few minutes after a quick break guys at the break we have our wyrmwood giveaway the keyword for this one is showdown put showdown in the chat room one word when you are prompted to be entered and we'll come back with the winner after the break see you guys here in a few minutes [break] there's been a lot of first bloods just no consistent blood you just find his equipment in the middle of the battlefield top of the round percival first off you heal 20 hit points as your turn begins inside the column of green light atop the tower and it's your turn make an attack roll yeah go ahead and roll damage okay the lock splinters and the trapdoor falls open okay as soon as you rush to the stairs you can see there's a bit of fog on the inside of the chamber it fills the room and obscures a lot of the interior so you move up onto the ceiling and you're now underneath inside the chamber you are for the purposes of this upside-down there they do you have 15 more movement if you want you don't have quite enough movement to get there you get just to the top of the stairway onto the ceiling we'll put you there for the sake of keeping track of it yeah the fog kind of dissipates below well to look down the stairs you'd have to get-- well you're in the fog still but i mean it dissipates down the stairs the whole chamber's still filled with fog okay boop all righty that ends percival's turn scanlan you're up you have an air elemental swirling 80 feet above you keyleth you hear his cry into the earring and watch as in a flash of vibrant pink-purple energy he steps through a small magic-made doorway and vanishes from your sight that ends scanlan's turn that brings us to grog sorry top of the round now the exterior of the tower bursts into flames fire climbs up and incinerates the island around the central tower to no effect currently grog your turn ten 15 you're now inside 50 you're about knee-deep in the water go for it well make the athletics check 17 yeah you just crest onto the edge your ankle's kind of at the edge of the water that's it you may just as you get to the edge of that i need you to go ahead and make a dexterity saving throw so grog as you go-- for the purposes of this here that puts it about fair grog you go flying up into the sky past the edge of the tower slamming into the ceiling over the battlefield i need you to make a constitution saving throw 31 you succeed so you take what would've been 21 points of force damage reduced to ten and you do not bounce off to return-- you manage to stop yourself but you're still about to be forced back into it you don't get pushed off but the gravity's still pushing you into it so each round you're up there you're going to keep taking this damage all righty that finishes grog's turn all right mr stealthy pants here's the thing and i'm being fair in this circumstance keyleth and grog out of the corner of your eye you see a dash of black winged movement as darting from the edge of this tower you see something out the side of this tower like climbing on the outside dart and then vanish in that direction you want to fight me on this early bird gets an early grave all righty that brings us to-- keyleth yeah right now-- you didn't bounce off but now you're slammed into it and being slowly pushed into it like (static crackling) from this wall to behind where the edge of this building and then vanish correct that would've been-- oh god knocked you over actually as far as you can get is there you do not there's the open door to the building and there's the circular thing over there but that's all you can see keyleth where do you want to move yeah so you'd be about let's say-- yeah you saw her coast over and downward so there you go that's your turn all right percival you're up okay the fog has now begun to dissipate from the entire chamber you might be right i was just guessing oh yeah then never mind it dissipates because you step out of it heading down there's no furniture just the stairway it looks like the interior of this has been either unfurnished or cleared out it's just a series of empty stairs that lead up and down the tower okay that's your whole turn finishing percy's turn scanlan yeah you see grog up there bouncing right now no but if you were to look around okay so you move five feet glance over and you see grog currently being jammed up into the ceiling just slowly build it back up well technically she can you can get 25 feet you see her floating after keyleth tells you that she's over here moving down this way that's all you know one's in-game one's out-of-game you get that far less than that even you can get about there tiny gnomish legs beginning of grog's turn you watch the lightning towers spark and then fire off radius nobody's there grog you're up make another constitution saving throw please you succeed so you take 12 points of force damage yes go for it you've got the immovable rod out and you're clutching it so you're holding your action on it are you holding your attack or-- you're on deck keyleth keyleth you're up from where you currently stand no grog make a constitution saving throw please 18 that's a failure so full damage of blight on grog i multi-raced a little since i leveled up someone please draw that wait how much damage was it oh 49 sorry minus 16 so it'd be 33 keyleth he screams out in pain as he's being pushed into the ceiling his veins bulge with black energy as the blight takes hold you're about 50 feet of movement left there you are ending keyleth's turn percy you're up 30 if you wanted to get there i don't know are you you don't know you didn't see make a dex roll no indomitable indomitable you mean right yeah percival you go firing up into the ceiling as you attempt to make your way across the river technically you're one higher than that but that's fine make a constitution saving throw as you get thrust up that's a success you suffer 21 halved to ten points of force damage you and grog are now within visual range of each other being pushed into the force field ceiling you can certainly try you do that's a constitution saving throw 16 succeeds it's a dc ten it is what are you going to do as your feet touch the surface they find some purchase it's like walking on a water bed they seem to be holding somewhat but that's the full of your movement scanlan it's your turn you can cast it at a higher level it just-- you could sacrifice a higher-level spell slot to cast a level two healing word as a bonus action but you'd lose a higher-level spell slot with only getting the bonuses of a level two spell that i'll allow what level do you use so that's your turn you see keyleth over here both grog and percival being held against the forcefield percival seems to have righted himself and his feet are actually affixed to the field and now is walking trying to move across it okay and with that the gravity subsides no you are held aloft grog however plummets to the ground for 80 feet as a reaction you do where do you hit the rod at what height 20 feet above the ground grog make a strength check i'm working on it don't worry 27 yeah you manage to hold tight your muscles strain from the falling impact of catching yourself there essentially yeah you suffer one point of damage rolled a one on that one from just muscle strain no it is the muscle kind of pops out of the socket and you wrench it back in with the sheer force of your shoulder and back muscles all right scanlan that's your turn all right that brings us to grog first and foremost you watch as the rooms flash with purple energy the water lights up for a second suffused with some sort of magical flash and then comes back to rest grog it's your turn okay you fall to the ground taking eight points of bludgeoning damage reduced to four you see keyleth up there that's it percival you know is up there on this side the tower yeah there's an opening on each side or each corner yeah you can you go inside all right so that's your action so you get inside there you are now at the center of the tower i'll put you down there just because you're big for the tower size all right ending grog's turn vax technically you can't do that not as that type of action so you're not doing the first thing not as a hasted action you can't hold a hasted action okay the first thing you said okay scanlan keyleth you watch as this chamber over here billowing fog emerges from this chamber over here the entire outside of this room is now completely surrounded in fog yeah but you can't hold a hasted action that fog cloud's out the fog cloud's there keyleth it's your turn you just watched this fog billow out from the open doorway and surround-- the door is open yeah the door is shattered by grog so you went in the chamber and fog cloud fills and encompasses the surrounding area okay how far over that's 50 feet there okay all around it so you hear this and time slows for a second over the earring as you hear this small whine this (high-pitched whine) (explosion) and it's nothing but bright light and flames around you it completely engulfs the chamber you're in and around it you guys watch and i'll say this i'm going to say it burns off the fog cloud inside the building all around it so i need you to go ahead and make a dexterity saving throw dexterity saving throw all right you've managed to dive behind where the chest was open from grog earlier jump into the chest and slam it closed just as the flames engulf the interior burning the outside of the-- he's a little man as it burns the exterior of the chest you manage to avoid all damage from the spell he has evasion as a rogue if he succeeds a dexterity saving throw he takes no damage yep as the firestorm dissipates that chest is destroyed you kick off the smoking bits of it keyleth you're going to stay where you are keyleth with the rest of your movement and descending actually you'd probably get about there as you've seen vax through the entirety of your gameplay you'd know that if he has to make a dexterity saving throw if he fails he takes half damage if he succeeds he takes none or he can use his reaction to take half damage from a melee or any attack oh yeah from any melee level 20 rogue playing this for five years still don't know how uncanny dodge works when an attacker you can see hits you with an attack as long as you can see them you can reduce it by half that was the other ability evasion is the one that he used yeah evasion's every time you're good all right so that finishes keyleth's turn you managed to dodge out of percival's view percy you're up top of the round i need you to make a constitution saving throw because even though you're standing on the ceiling you're still against the force 19 will succeed yeah because it's an 18 all right so all right so you suffer the 11 points of force damage reduced to five five points of force damage and you are not jettisoned off the force field so it's considered rough terrain for you to move across okay it's rough terrain so-- 15 you're just-- okay so you're going to leap and release the boots make an acrobatics check please as you go and try and leap for it-- 23 all right so you reduce the damage you take from the leap it would've been 18 points of bludgeoning damage reduced to nine nine points of bludgeoning damage correct well first from the-- you have to make it twice and another one for the impact one was for the force field and one was for the fall yeah you're fine no your movement dropped you outside of the circle you have no more movement oh if you use your action for a dash then you can get there yeah well the trapdoor you blew open so it's currently open so you stand right at the edge of it okay ending percival's turn scanlan you're up you see keyleth floating there you see the flames burst around this interior the fog cloud dissipates okay how many you kick off the broken chest right as you right yourself a beam of red light goes into the room explodes a second time make a dexterity save with a dc of-- yeah so no damage you're like oh god you leap out of the way and as you pull your cloak up and the cloak burns and singes on the outside but you manage to avoid the damage as you flatten up against the wall unfortunately that's exactly the kind of thing that rogues are really good at avoiding they're an up-close or lock-down type scenario or they're going to be jumping around all your booms scanlan that's your action they'll give you advantage on climbing checks that's your turn grog top of your turn the braziers on the sides of the tower burst into flame incinerating all the space around which affects keyleth who is hiding behind the side of the tower i need you to make a dexterity saving throw because the water glowed last time nope that is 30 points of fire damage to you as the flames subside your wind form is burned a bit grog you're up i don't know you hear the wind whipping around outside but you don't see anything you look up immediately and see keyleth floating there in elemental form after the flames subside you can she's 20 feet up in the air though you glance up and she's 20 feet up sure make an athletics check yeah you're able to get up to about her height you're technically base-to-base with her against the side of the tower make a grapple check i know but i want him to roll it grog you fall through and land on the ground prone and partially in the water you suffer eight points of bludgeoning damage reduced to four you also notice the field that surrounds the chambers shifts in a bit scanlan make a constitution saving throw you watch as it all closes in by five feet you take 11 points of force damage and you are not forced out of the way however you are up against it being pushed against the wall you have to squeeze out of it you can see it slowly condensing itself as it does you glance up at the sky and see this grinning mysterious visage made of cloud swirling energy a grinning beard that's the end of grog's turn vax you're up you saw him disappear somewhere down below there as far as you know as a marker somewhere in that area you saw vax vanish keyleth your turn i'm confused by that image keyleth what're you doing you slowly descend swirling wind arms the wind form shifts out and keyleth descends landing right down with you what's the saving throw on that no but what's the saving throw grog i need you to make a wisdom saving throw where are you shifting him to grog as keyleth embraces you there's a shifting of energy there's a flash as you see the divine gate coast past you suddenly you're in the dark depths of a familiar ocean you're holding your breath you know with your constitution you can hold your breath for a decent amount of time as you glance down into the darkness of the shadow below you you see movement as a series of long familiar tentacles begin to emerge from the shadows below you think let's make this a final glorious way to go i don't know do you you slowly clam up as you sink down as the kraken takes you into its maw and swallows you first one down you have in this form 15 feet correct yeah is it a bonus action to drop form i'll double-check yep it's a bonus action to revert so you have to be in keyleth form you have 15 feet of movement what's your strength what's your strength score your strength score that's the distance you can jump in feet is your strength score so triple that you can jump pretty far no that would be part of your movement okay finishing keyleth's turn percival you're up you heal 20 hit points make a perception check she's not hiding so you do see the very edge of her he has an eyeline to the very edge of you that's as far as you can get with your movement she has three-quarters cover you're eyeballing maybe about 45 50 feet it does make a ranged attack roll all right keyleth as you're ducking around you hear this faint shout in the distance of-- no as the band expands and wraps around keyleth's body you watch as she quickly slips out of the bindings and the chains fall to the ground before reverting back to a sphere that would have been bad yeah you did you're staying there and crouching low ending percival's turn scanlan you're up you can see keyleth from around you pull out of that side there dash that's your movement there she's about 35 40 feet more than 30 correct yeah 35 feet yeah sorry grog dominate person for keyleth okay you need to make a wisdom saving throw you have advantage because you are a half-elf so you have advantage against charm effects sorry scanlan she resists the spell that finishes your turn the field shimmies and crunches even closer you watch as this distant building begins to collapse inward that door's destroyed liam and two squares in all around vax you watch as you suddenly turn and look up into the sky as you see giant wings unfolded vax points down at you and with a giant earth-shattering caw in the sky of a raven cry you feel this mark penetrate your chest as he marks you with his vow of enmity you are about 60 feet here correct total of 28 on that one i'm sorry what you moved over used your paladin action to attack twice-- are you moving somewhere with one of your actions is what i'm asking no i know i need clarification because they need to know where you ran off to they still see you you're still out in the open i'm so excited for the new campaign this is my own fault your movement is 120 feet which got you to there right do it text me where you are it's correct you're completely correct you are completely correct no don't get shit for it you're doing your job it's just a process to work out for the scenario of this type of event all righty ending vax's turn keyleth you're up you got shanked twice with two daggers after the vow of enmity and watched your vax vanish off somewhere in-- which direction you watched him vanish that way right behind the tower what are you doing keyleth percy you're on deck plane shift i don't believe it is it just happens banishment is concentration that's probably what you were thinking of keyleth you're fine what you got yeah this whole time you see scanlan running up to you and telling you all this feeblemind is an 8th-level spell go ahead and roll-- (laugh) okay hold on she did move up to peek she said wait 60-foot range for counterspell right i'm pretty sure it is yeah i know doesn't matter either way all right for you it's a counterspell yeah you should've moved it's all good i need you to make an ability check using your spellcasting ability so a charisma check the dc equals ten plus level of the spell you have to roll a check and add your charisma bonus 19 you need to beat 18 dc because it's an 8th-level spell you said he needs to beat an 18 counterspelled feeblemind so as she goes to cast feeblemind you recognize the incantation from when she used it on raishan and you go-- as the feeblemind fades-- what's the movement of your elemental again (counting) that's as far as you can get right there what's that you want to go around and look last turn when the fields shattered it did cause the lighting to go off i forgot to mention that yes last round both of you were out of range so i didn't mention it i forgot about it in the process i was focusing on the field yes possibly so are you staying in the water i'll put you there at the end of scanlan's turn-- sorry keyleth you watch as the water and the two chambers flash and the chamber crushes even further this is partially destroyed and now you're seeing-- we're using this as a marker-- it's starting to accelerate the destruction in the interior pushing this in here using that as a mark that falls back to this partially destroyed there i know all righty vax sorry percival i'm confused the field should happen later this round but we'll get to it okay ending percival's turn scanlan your turn keyleth i need you to make an intelligence saving throw whatever your intelligence saving throw is that's right because it's wild shape you keep your mental stats so roll 4d6 psychic damage so you take 11 points of psychic damage keyleth your intelligence and charisma scores become one you cannot cast spells activate magic items understand language or communicate in any intelligible way that's a swing cast right there yeah wild shape is not casting a spell it's an ability she can still wild shape it's not a frenzy scanlan we'll say you got that far do you move in there we'll put you there it's my fault for moving you that finishes scanlan's turn now the field crushes in where it should've before that was my fault for doing it out of turn also the flames burst around the chamber percival where are you right now you duck out of the way as the flames-- that brings us to vax's turn my phone's starting to get low on battery okay yes percival what's your armor class steps and is throwing daggers from the trap door he's inside the tower and rushed up you do after his first attack it's his reaction he hits as soon as your first attack hits 38 points of piercing damage to you technically no you'd finish your action which is your attack action and then he does all of his eight points of piercing damage constitution saving throw yeah you're fine as you throw both daggers you watch as percival spins around with-- which weapon with animus and goes for his four attacks yeah you were holding your action you can spend any grit you've got he doesn't have that remember kerr took away his cloak a long time ago no you roll a d20 and choose whether so the first attack misses he gets to choose whether you take his roll or yours he rolled a two so you take 11 you spending another grit on your turn is how it happens double check for you but i'm pretty sure on your turn thunderwave is an action it's not an attack that ends your reaction that ends your attacks you can take the rest of your turn you can feel the warmth around you but it's not doing anything immediately you have to start your turn there go for it 25 succeeds on the first one roll again for the second one you still maintain it that finishes vax's turn keyleth you're up no you do not see vax at all you're right over no it's your own check you can cutting words to reduce the damage if you'd like to you do you have about 30 feet of movement left probably about 20 since you did use some of your movement to get into the water it's a different effect unfortunately let me see here yeah you are restrained and unable to breathe yeah because you're whelmed and he's a tiny gnome yeah so you pull him into the water so you're in her space currently inside keyleth's elemental form unable to get out and pulled under the water keyleth does that end your turn percival i'm checking you get the sense that he is not just beyond that door all right that ends your turn percival no because you started your turn out of it the green has to be inside the center circle go for it scanlan you're up you have to start your turn in the beam in order to get the effect we said previously that you can still cast underwater we previously established in the kraken battle that you guys were able to cast spells underwater that continues here which room okay inside the room okay there we go all right at the end of your turn the field crushes in further it's now moving faster and faster moving ten feet at a time well no the lightning towers would go off but they do not because they have been slowly crushed and destroyed eaten by the field okay keyleth your turn the numbers are getting down and half the party's just staying in place doing nothing so your turn currently no you are alone on the battlefield go ahead and roll an attack against the tower yes you do 14 hits it's an easy-to-hit tower go ahead and roll damage you get two slam attacks okay so percival you feel this impact on the tower what's going on (impact) as the back half of it begins to crumble and collapse backwards no this all begins to fall and crumble oh man this is going to be interesting we'll say for the purposes of this i'll turn it this way yeah it's all falling apart at this point which works fine yeah this is all just falling down there is a little bit of this that's still hanging on there large portion of the tower is collapsed and is unusable percival you crumble and slide off and fall into the ground i know you're attaching to it as it falls so go ahead-- are you just staying onto it all right so you do not make an acrobatics check and it crumbles beneath you the rocks begin to grind and tear into you as you fall in with it not if you're adhering to it and it collapses inward okay it's falling back and then crumbling inwards make an acrobatics check you were for a moment and then it all collapsed 28 okay yeah so you manage to only suffer four points of bludgeoning damage and you land not prone as you ride it down and are standing there on the side with an angry earth elemental now slamming into the sides of it okay keyleth you do suffer 22 points of bludgeoning damage from the tower pieces collapsing down upon and around you reduced by half because you're an earth elemental nope nope actually yeah you would see scanlan yeah well he rode it down to the ground and made an acrobatics check to stop and you're not hidden a misfire the first shot's a misfire scanlan don't give up yet okay so you swap out to retort second attack he goes to fire (fizzling) pulls the second gun (misfire) this is bad news 19 scanlan what's your ac i think the target of the attack has to be the target of the cutting words because yeah it reduces the damage because you fuck with them you know what use your wit to confuse-- a creature that you can see within 60 feet of you makes an attack roll i'll let you do it so before you put the damage down go ahead and roll we'll see it's a d12 d12 man yeah so take the damage the shot blasts into your shoulder you see the blood erupt from you you've been hit by this before percival that ends your turn scanlan right because keyleth brought it down right because you were waiting-- right okay so that brings us to the top of the round percy it's your turn well he held his action to attack as soon as he saw somebody and he saw you and keyleth he attacked you four attacks a 20th-level fighter it's their thing all right so that's your action okay so you fixed which one animus okay that hits next attack second hits roll damage it hasn't come back to your turn scanlan goes unconscious with that second hit it's water and you're walking through water right now so you could stay up over here i mean she can see you you're not hiding from her she's this giant behemoth you're out of movement right there that's as far as you will get and she can sense it she feels the footfalls okay he's prone technically so you have disadvantage on the attack scanlan i need you to make a death saving throw please all right so that's one success keep that in mind all right the fields (crushing) another ten feet i'm using this to mark how deep in it's getting now so we'll say there also the water which is now filled with bits of broken stone however still sets off that brings us to your turn well you were hidden until you attacked which revealed you there it is but once you hit him he sees you this is just for placement i want to put you on the field once or twice this battle unfortunately all the big spellcasters are either down or can't cast spells did you bamf to her as well that ends your turn keyleth you're up you can feel him yes keyleth top of your turn you feel two footfalls very gently in the rubble on the other side of the tower if you'd like to what's your movement here yeah you moving 50 feet through the rubble since you can move through small spaces right if you want to do water elemental you can okay fire elemental you (counting) vax you were hiding up in the rubble you sent me two pictures she knows exactly where you are and as a fire elemental she can dodge between cracks as you're sitting there hiding there's a bright light and there's a slight crevasse between the rocks as a flaming burst of fire elemental keyleth emerges to assault you what're you doing she swipes with one fire claw you barely dodge out of the way a second one hits the stone behind you as you duck low it took you most of your movement to get there you have five feet of movement i'll allow it with the rubble and everything in here ending keyleth's turn percival you're up okay (counting) what's your strength you jump and land you're up to your chest in water you're going to use an action to dash maybe five more feet you can get to there that's your turn scanlan death saving throw you're fine that's two successes the field crushes in further slowly pushing in at this point by the way so you're aware percival you have a little bit this whole chamber let me use this to mark it here that's where it's closing in closer and closer vax your turn it just went that was percival no they go after scanlan's turn now the field you're right thank you for the reminder valid point the area around the tower ignites in flame you're immune to fire keyleth i need you to make a dexterity saving throw that's a success you take no damage because of evasion your turn slight gap in the wall 40 points of piercing damage to you ending vax's turn keyleth you're up yes you felt a little (clicking) you turn into a water elemental i have to wait to find out never mind you felt no (clicking) instead he just disappeared from sight you saw him go this direction but you have no idea where he is do you want to remain fire elemental sure i'll let you step up over rough terrain dashing through you don't see anything percival the first attack roll an attack with advantage because he's on the ground only against ranged attacks that hits it's an auto-crit you fail two death saving throws and with that you shank scanlan scanlan bleeds out over where the wall's up against there you already used your action oh action surge first you hold your action in case you see anything end of percival's turn the water bursts with magical energy no it was fire last time so now it's lightning blue things are gone nothing happens also it crushes in once more bringing us to there currently the walls have crushed in one okay so couple things one roll 1d10 fire damage marisha by the way technically twice since you didn't do it last turn right it's an action to put it out so nine fire damage and then roll again and then you fail your constitution saving throw as the wall slams into you pushing you back oof you take 28 points of force damage and you are thrown prone onto the ground right there that ends that turn vax your turn half your movement also vax-- the boots are off correct yeah you can barely see her you just barely have her in range percy you watch as he glides in the air-- everybody hates each other she's been feebleminded don't play woe is me he got plane shifted he got shanked by percival you're doing all right correct that would be 17 next attack 26 points of piercing damage nope not your turn so your last attack is to reload okay so now you land there and can make your attacks on him yep that was his reaction i had these minions at the ready just in case i know pit fiend on a full melee round against a single target can do an average of 115 hit points of damage and lock down healing you've used all your movement keyleth your turn a leap there would be 20 feet of movement marisha technically your mantle isn't on you right now because you're in elemental form absorbs into your form but you're not getting your ring of protection bonus you're not getting your other elements that you have in physical form they stay within you so when you transform back the effects return but you don't get the jump ability what's the strength of this guy oh yeah water elemental there i'll say half your movement to get into the water the jump turn into a water elemental half of your swim speed (counting) you're just in melee range with him do you have to move into his space for whelm he's unfortunately just out you're just out of range for being whelmed so that's good roll damage you take eight points of bludgeoning damage from the water that brings us to percival this is your action right there just so you know the force field is right there (counting) right there now the energy fields burst with purple energy actually they don't they've been destroyed by the fields so they do not have an effect any more which saves you because that would have knocked out your form however the fields move in further completely destroying this here this all goes away just the edge of the water now we're in on this area now vax it's your turn 58 damage to your water elemental magical dagger attacks so you do not resist you can't see percival you disengaged from her all right that ends vax's turn keyleth you're up technically on that side there is no water there this is all gone this has all been eaten away you'd have to get up onto the land there you can move partially that's as far as you can right there nope with a 30 feet speed for an earth elemental right that's as close as you can get that's your turn you still have an action you can use your action to dash towards him if you wanted to the field's up against there so technically he had to fly around and land yep yeah sure you can do that i know my apologies you can just get up to where he is yeah you should have taken damage last turn as you land-- he's smoldering on the ground you go over to where vax is and he's just burning his unconscious body is burning you look over and see on the field that's pushing forward there's a scanlan corpse being rolled as it shoves him closer onto the battlefield the water's over here we'll put you there percy your turn the corpse yeah you can go for it nah he's got constitution for days he's got five more minutes on this shit melee you have advantage to attack him his body incinerates yeah each time hit him twice so vax's body burns away oh that was just the first hit i thought you hit him with both both attacks you're incinerated yeah not four it is magical because you're shooting with animus that hits plus d6 necrotic so 13 14 points of damage i know there's fire there you get there end of percy's turn the field crushes in even further which unfortunately does hit you keyleth you get pushed in make a constitution saving throw 20 okay you do succeed so you take wow that's a good roll six six six six five two four no against you 29 divided so that's 14 points of force damage you're now being crushed into the rubble and pushed up the top of it she's jamming pretty hard into that wall that is the field's turn over it's keyleth's turn you're up it's crushing you guys inward the torch unfortunately could not because the territory that it would be on-- i mean the torch goes off i would say but you're immune to fire and percival's out of the way and only part of it is currently available it's crushing it very tight so it's your turn keyleth okay you won't get to him with your movement unfortunately because there's a lot of rubble in the way you do but your movement-- you can't jump more than you can move when you don't have the cloak on he's about 15 feet from you all right percival you're up here you get the sense that on this side it will but not on this side-- end of percival's turn it crushes in again now keeping tabs on where it lies there is the edge there and then on this side it's right up against you percival keyleth your turn yeah you can get up on top there and bash downward essentially yeah him and grog have been thrown into it a few times earlier yeah if you want to grapple with the first attack all right i need you both to make athletics checks please so the first attack she reaches down and grabs you now the giant elemental form has wrapped its fingers around your shoulders and torso you're unable to move from the spot your movement is zero hm your next attack you attack him you don't get advantage nope so you're held there in space percival thunderwave from which one that's true all righty so go ahead and make what's the saving throw on that dc 16 constitution go ahead and make a constitution saving throw keyleth and she gets pushed or does she not get pushed okay so still grappled right so 14 end of your turn percival actually you could have but you spent it to cast thunderwave it would've if she had failed the save technically you do yeah percival top of your turn this side stops closing in this side does percy you are now being smashed between the wall of the tower and the field as she's holding you in space i need you both to make constitution saving throws as you're having to hold him there to keep him in space but you have advantage because you're pulling away i'll say all right so you fail you do get pushed back 15 feet and you take oh man all right that's a good roll no because it breaks the grapple because it pushes you back so that's 30 points of force damage to you keyleth 15 to you however you are currently restrained as you are being held against the wall and the force field you're pushed back he's being sandwiched between the stone wall and the force field like (crackling) we're talking like tetsuo-crush all right no now it's keyleth's turn all right so go ahead and make an attack against the wall okay i won't have you roll damage because it's siege but what you do is each one of these shoves forces him into the wall so i need you to make two constitution saving throws both succeed so that's 27 points of force damage reduced to 13 that's a shitty roll ten points of force damage reduced to five i mean he's taking the damage because he's being sandwiched you have to change to a different form okay percival your turn top of your turn make a constitution saving throw that is 19 points of force damage reduced to nine right so you're trying to escape from the restraint all right make an athletics check athletics or acrobatics i believe let me double check real fast well no it's not breaking from a grapple necessarily it's from being pinned this isn't weaseling out of it this is pure force so this would be athletics no the window it's a slit it's like that wide and your back is pressed against it all right so you're still restrained currently no she's behind the wall pushing you into it all right at the end of that the field pushes in once more well no it's pushing against that it's not pushing further sorry because they're both stopped they're now holding that space so you don't take damage again it doesn't force you but you're still pinned keyleth your turn what is best in life pushing him into the wall again okay you're essentially just pushing against the wall it'll shove yeah it's essentially a ten or lower no damage on this you're just pushing the wall so the force against him so make a constitution saving throw percival we'll find out roll a second attack ten and 12 all right you take first 24 points of force damage 24 points of force damage keyleth i need you to make a strength check please or a strength saving throw correct so as it pushes back you manage to keep it back and then shove him back into it and then oh my god that is 25 points of force damage to you percival and keyleth make another strength saving throw as the section of wall that you've pushed in that's loose and you're shoving him with is being shoved backward you've managed to hold it in place still restrained you're slowly sandwiching him making a percival sandwich percy your turn make another constitution saving throw marisha and 25 okay so you take 13 points of force damage keyleth your turn ten total just barely roll two constitution saving throws percival first one succeeds you take 11 points of force damage second push you feel percival begin to pop and squish against the outer field and for the purposes of this one more round of shoving and with a (squish) percival-jelly begins to ooze out from behind the wall in which you shove him against the force while you were technically healing 20 points every round underneath the green beam-- the field dissipates the rubble begins to separate and float in space the ruined corpses of all your allies then float aloft around you and are slowly re-stitched back to life grog appears pulled back from the water dimension from the depths of the drowning and you see the bearded patron descend from above as he pats you on the head and goes-- good job (laughter) level 20 druids man yep it's funny i was like okay once they start getting into the high-level spells this is really going to turn-- and then feeblemind all right this is going to be a drag-out brawl to the very end that deprives you of all the senses eventually well done guys congratulations keyleth
