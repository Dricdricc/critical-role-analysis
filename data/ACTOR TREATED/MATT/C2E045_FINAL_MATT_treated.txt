tonight's episode of critical role (no audio) (chanting) role critical role [dramatic critical role theme] welcome back that was adorable laura last we left off the mighty nein after spending an exorbitant period of time at sea at the behest of captain avantika on the ship the squalleater got pulled into piracy under the banner of the revelry brought to the pirate city and island of darktow amongst the dragshallow reefs there you uncovered information proof that she had plans to overthrow the plank king and rule the seas along with her fanatical obsession with uk'otoa i knew it was coming you manage to dodge through the night grab the necessary journal uncover the information through the cipher and through a scuffle survive this fiery battle on the docks from the ship through some tactical use of spells and quick members of your party you got it in the hands of the plank king judgement was brought between the two of you at the dock and he chose avantika to go upon having her make her leave violently gave you guys your reward which was sparing your lives and telling you to get the fuck out of darktow and never come back you were gifted the hobbled burned form of the squalleater and left to make your way out towards the ocean where you attempted to search into the backstory of fjord's relationship with his patron in search of one of what seems to be the third and final sphere you made your way down into the wreckage of his ship the tide's breath and discovered it was one of many in what was called the diver's grave a ship graveyard here in the center of the lucidian ocean in trying to find out where this orb went you were drawn into the underwater lair of dashilla the dreadful you encountered spirits of long-dead sailors bound there by her magic you discovered the essence of how she's able to maintain this graveyard and draw ships down below while she managed to flee before being killed you grabbed what you were looking for fled to the surface and with your ship escaped the growing storm before any more danger was brought to you that was where we left off mighty nein as you've all gathered your things you can hear the distant crack of thunder as the storm gets smaller behind you on the horizon what do you want to do three or four days from where you are now of course don't you worry he goes ahead and sets course the ship makes its turn across the water in the direction of the bisaft isle bisaft yes to that degree you guys have a few days of travel anything you'd like to accomplish in this time you've taken a long rest for the first evening you're restored if you need to restore your spells and hit points what is your small list nott yes sure sure let's do it let's give it a shot roll a tinkering check are you proficient with the tinker's tools it's under your proficiencies you are it's already powder it's already explosive you're just constructing a casing and a means of detonation just roll and add your dexterity modifier yes okay you make two the third one in the crow's nest as fjord-- okay the first one goes by easy as heck you're proud of yourself second one a little tenuous but you manage to craft it and that's nice the third one roll a perception check you in all the excitement and your mind's eye focusing entirely on all the wonderful explosions this is going to cause aren't paying attention to the wire you're using to seal off where the head of the explosive bolt goes as you pull through a series of lucky circumstances a spark gets hit there's a brief moment where you hear that (hissing) and you're like oh there's just a flash roll a dexterity check for me-- a dexterity saving throw it's still a two though plus you really should correct unless your cloak gives you advantage on dexterity saving throws correct so you failed in that explosion 13 points of fire damage you suffer halved because of your evasion trait so that'll put us at six you take six points of fire damage as there's this brief explosion that rocks the vicinity and your ears ring you grab the sides of your face as your eyes attempt to focus in that brief instant you see a shape move through the center of the galley make a perception check everything seems safe as you guys look up you can see this smattering of dark soot all across her face the hair's scattered no last you saw vera she was burned pretty bad beau and nott the three of you head down past the galley or the kitchen where you originally saw the shape move you're now towards the center where the cannons and the accessible stores of gunpowder are you guys can see the scarring mark on the wood there where the previous explosion happened make a perception check okay then you glance past the galley you don't see any movement you glance across the opposite side near where the stairway leads into the cargo hold below you look past and you swear you see something looking back from around one of the barrels then disappear behind it and you hear (light footsteps) it's possible where you saw it was right next to the stairs that lead down into the cargo hold whatever the shape was it moved behind one of the large barrels there made a run for it hoping it wouldn't be seen and then went downstairs into the cargo hold yes laura and okay so blocking off the area everyone make a stealth check please okay that tips the scales a bit then you guys are quietly making your way down there hearing the creaking of wood and the very faint muffled sounds of waves crashing against the outside of the squalleater you see a shape duck down even further back in the cargo hold behind one of the box clusters it's too far away and there's no light down there all of you have darkvision as long as you have the goggles on you guys dart around with the booming voice of jester's duplicitous double there curved around the corner you manage to all at the same time flank in this area as you get around the space you can see they're huddled in the corner if you'd like to come to the table-- (cheering) in her gnomish hands this is pretty large from your perspective it would be about that big but for her it seems even that much bigger it's a brass and golden sphere that consists of many layers of intertwining clockwork sliding hemispheres rotating bands and strange inscriptions it's this massive complicated mess of contraption puzzle sliding pieces make an arcana check 19 while she holds it out to you parts that she's not touching are shifting slightly to where it has a clockwork feel but then you don't see any gears in the parts that are shifting they're sliding naturally with a very faint whir you can tell there's probably some magic involved but it's a combination of clockwork and magic you may as the last part clicks into place there's a (whir puff) a burst of light about 15 gold coins go (clanging) to the ground in front you crack a tooth what she reveals as she pulls out of this bright pink satchel this colored leather satchel she has is this dodecahedron shape that has gold trim around the edges and these handles it looks like a gray quartz and it has a very faint hum to it it seems to glow in a rhythmic heartbeat fashion it has this very strong presence and the air around it has its own subtle vibration which as you do that you feel this gravitational pull your essence drawn towards it your peripheral blurs and darkens within you feel like you're leaning into it it's no longer an object it's like a pool of water and you cross the surface and it's warm past that in the darkness you see stars an endless sea of stars drifting towards you and past you you look ahead and you can see other little shapes you look at them and they're you they're little ghosted versions of twiggy they're all going in different directions and some of them fade and some of them are created two of them join and create a new light and go in a separate path in that moment you see this single glowing warm light that appears and presents itself to you as you reach out and put your hand towards it it merges with your hand the warmth carries through your wrist and forearm it gives this warm interior hug-type sensation as you close your eyes to relish in it and open them again you're back on the boat with them okay as a note you have what's called a fragment of possibility for the rest of the day anytime you have to make an attack roll an ability check or a saving throw any roll with a d20 essentially you get to reroll it you get to roll an additional d20 and choose which of the two to take just once yeah actually probably even keel between the two of you at this point around the side marius lepual has walked down into the center of the ship and is standing there who the fuck is that you're all scaring me right now i'm going to go lay down okay you guys all make you your way back up to the deck of the squalleater as you hear the footsteps rising you look back to hopefully hear information about how things went down with the supposed sound and stowaway instead you see them arrive with twiggy port damali make an insight check is there anything you want to whisper to him feel free to okay bisaft isle so you're concentrating on-- okay so continue while you're doing that caleb as you finish the ritual your vision crystallizes on the object as part of the identify the information that would transition to you fails you've tried to identify non-magical objects before and been like oh this isn't magical this blocks you do not solve happy fun ball make a history check low dc since you're relatively local there's not so much in the way of museums per se but there are collections there are collectors and those are usually private and invite-only through mutual merchants and nobles and people of affluent nature but there are two auction houses where a lot of these items are sold and traded by these collectors one exists in port damali it's called the exalted collection auction house make a perception check as you're inspecting this there are sections of it rubik's cube-esque where you have to rotate an area to allow another part to rotate and there's a strange order to these one for things that should be rotating freely there's a consistent resistance to it you also notice between the seams where all of these pieces of metal overlap where there's a slight gap if you manage to hold it in shadow or put shadow over it there's a very faint blue-green glow that barely peeks through each seam from the inside of this sphere there definitely is magic you're a smart guy you're starting to look it over you're like some of these patterns maybe could figure it out you do notice that a lot of the strange inscriptions on it appear to be complicated variations of basic conjuration glyphs none that you've seen but you can see the similar shapes the similar equation-type connection between these glyphs there is a strong conjuration element all across and very minute impossibly small engraving across the metal no idea all the metal's pretty well kept it's pretty polished there's a couple of errant smears of chocolate caught in some aspects of it a few sticky fingerprints in some areas this time (puff) you see this flash of white light and eight gold coins clank to the surface of the ship okay (puff) white flash four gold coins yeah nott already took them roll an investigation check okay you find one section that shifts following suit with her and it sticks yeah you're not getting anywhere make a wisdom saving throw i know who's got the sphere there is a powerful magical essence emanating from that sphere a different kind of magic but comparable to the dodecahedron in some ways yeah and there is two faint magical auras on her person he would be able to tell if there was something magical on your person he wouldn't know any more than that make a perception check as you clamber up to the top of the crow's nest and glance over the horizon looking off in the horizon you currently don't see any ships that are immediately pushing into the territory you're following fjord it stings you a little bit your wound's still fresh you do also know as you're heading into legal territory under the clovis concord that you have a ship that is known and labelled as the squalleater as damaged as it is roll a dexterity check for me this is dexterity to see how well you can paint it while upside down apparently not only does she manage to entirely erase the beginning of the word squall but has beautifully calligraphied the b of ball to where it looks almost like a set of balls if interpreted that way it has this nice sparkly border around it now it's like (singing) balleater it's almost got jazz hands this is regular paint good to know there are no colors on deck that aren't associated with it the only colors that are on deck were the colors that the ship previously sailed make a history check caleb you keep thinking on that sphere you've read about similar objects especially the conjuration aspect of it that are used as focuses similar to a bag of holding to maintain and contain things for powerful mages its construction makes you feel like it's very old probably pre-calamity pre-calamity is 800 years and there's a whole era of very powerful magic-- no 800 years ago was the calamity or a little over 800 as this is happening and you're approaching caleb you see orly sitting there with his giant tortle arms looking up with his craned tortle neck and going hmm far too long make a wisdom saving throw so yeah it takes effect every time she goes into that pouch and opens it up you can still see taking up a large portion of it massively like a distended backpack is the slightly shifting clockwork of that sphere well until the directed activity is completed then yeah so suggestion has worn off most awkward on-ship high five ever as your new compatriot for this journey seems to have for the time being accepted into your wings is there anything else you want to do all right so you're getting that situated from this point a little over three days so the traveler she explains to you in a very truncated way is the being that she worships but talks with and taught her a bunch of things and they've been a friend anything else you want-- make an investigation check doing a thorough pass on the crew's quarters the remnant of the crew that now is arrested or worse on the island of darktow yes you manage to scavenge up two boxes of firearm ammunition yes actually yeah from hupperdook i think it was right you manage to pull together 22 shots that fit yours there are a few others that don't quite they're made for a larger rifle-type but these particular iron balls will fit yours oh yeah there are plenty of coats hats scarves all kinds of things most of them in a similar vein to what you see her wearing most of them are long coats with the sleeves removed a high collar big billowing scarves and cravats that are varying degrees of well kept a lot of these she's had for a long time and as such at sea there's weathering some of them have grown damp and have a little mildew at the very edges but have been scraped off multiple times which give it a cool look but maybe a little bit of a musty smell there's a number of interesting outfits of a dead woman that you manage to scavenge anything else yeah we can continue this journey to the second day if you want to but it's up to you (crashing) make an investigation check you rolled a 16 you said as you're saying this absentmindedly you find another portion of it that previously was locked in place and wouldn't move you manage to rotate one band and all of a sudden it comes free and turns as well you start shifting it a bit and as you turn a little cylinder extends a little bit and you press on it and you hear (poof) there's another burst but this one has a dull blue color to the burst of light suddenly four cut jade pieces of stone appear and hit the ground each one's worth about 100 gold if you want to mark that down roll another investigation check i guess from that place where you had it you find one of the other grinding bands-- it felt like sandpaper when you tried to move it-- is now moving smooth like it has no resistance so you twist that one around and as you do you hear this clicking sound it fits into place there's another piece around that you hear give this very faint (creaking) sound you look for it and you find it and there's a little knob you turn the knob and as you do another section opens up on one side and then there's this flash and you look over on the ground and in the middle of the wood there's a black hole about a foot wide no you look and it's just black no as you let go they make no sound they just disappear into it no you just see fjord and beau go down okay it gets to about five or six feet okay it's rope okay temperature feels a little colder but it goes in (foomph) it's gone it was about a foot across so a smaller person maybe but a lot of you guys it would have been a tight squeeze not caduceus at all she takes this couple of materials out and this pot of paint as she paints with it it begins to take shape and become a physical object representative of what she drew the sphere is still locked in the place where you had it last and there's that one little knob that's still visible from where it was it seems like with each stage that you've unlocked of this it's opened up another stage a little bit less smooth and there are more elements that are starting to protrude a bit all you have to do is press on that to trigger it again (poof) that hole appears again same size in a slightly different location as the lantern hits the darkness the darkness consumes it like water once the lantern is submerged within the darkness no light you don't even see the lantern still lit mm-hmm it's gone it only lasts about a minute each time it's lasted about a minute yeah both times it's been approximately the same length of time close to a minute the hole opens up you look inside it's darkness still darkness you can put your goggles on if you want put goggles on and your face as he pushes you down further you hit something it's soft you pull back a bit and look and there's a pile of objects there okay as you pull her out before she slips as you're pulling back a few things start tumbling out of this thing you grab them and pull them in you pull out and she emerges you have this pile of reddish cloth and a strange metal object of some kind and a couple other things you pull the rest of them out that's dangling in as soon as it does the hole closes you look at it first off-- she's pulling her tongue out first off you hear (impacts) as two boots fall out of this pile of clothes she has these really nice leather boots that are fur on the top they hit the ground there's a metal rod that looks like a staff that you hold and pull there the other thing is a bundle of this really heavy warm winter-coat velvet material it's a deep crimson-red color with golden trim on it as you unravel it there's an embroidered symbol across the back of it that's the symbol right there you do not you guys have never seen this before i mean you're looking at it there there's not much more to it than that that watermark is part of the paper it's not part of the actual symbol it's a metal staff you look at it and it's a metallic staff about three to four feet long it has a seam in the middle of it like it's two pieces joined we'll say for the sake of brevity the boots are not magical they're just really warm boots the cloak is not magical it's just a very warm cloak with the symbol on it the staff is faintly magical and what it is is it acts like a hand warmer you take the two parts and you slide them together and it clicks the metal emanates enough heat to warm the hands of whoever's holding it this appears to be a set of travel gear for whoever once might have had this yep halas halas h-a-l-a-s (disagreement) mm-mm it seems to have some roots in zemnian but it's a divergent element so a name that hasn't been used in a long long time kind of like-- yeah like melchor things that are old historical names in fact roll a history check it slips from you there's something you're like hmm your face hit the cloak you were like (impact) into this pile of soft heavy material a couple of ball bearings fall out of the cloak from what was dropped in there earlier nothing her hand one by one you guys jump in one after the other and you both tumble in and hit a floor looking around you both have darkvision because gnomes it's a cylindrical chamber it feels almost like a natural rock interior no it's just a little pocket you see two other ball bearings you left behind and that's it it looks like you've cleaned out what was in this pocket sam and you guys emerge the area on the sphere where you've been pressing this button you look and it's freed another area as well that can continue to be solved as it looks right now you need to shift it back to use a previous function each thing you slide unlocks the next use but it closes off the previous one until you reverse it you wouldn't oh halas you roll a history check too yeah roll a history check if they did teach it you probably weren't paying attention that day at the archive unfortunately roll a history check no none at all you've never heard the name halas before anywhere in port damali or in any of your travels especially in relation to sir cadigan okay you all step back about ten paces anyone want to help or you going with your standard roll yep okay that hole appears again you're unable to get past that point you're hitting a barrier and you're clicking it forward there's something about the puzzle that's escaping you you feel like you're not quite-- you're on the cusp if you want to try it again if you want to either you both can roll individually or one of you can roll with advantage as you're helping the other as you hand the sphere over holding the places twiggy goes in and takes hold of it both of you together begin to try and rotate and figure it out at that point both together twiggy finds this small rotating piece on the very edge that turns and turns as it does another cylindrical sphere slowly emits from it like you're rotating a pencil lead that pushes out you twist it and you push it in and it actually pushes in about an inch and then clicks inside recessed as that happens a top part opens up a little bit caleb you take that and rotate it as it clicks into place you hear (rising tone whoosh) flash of green light fills the entire chamber that's where we're going to go to break (yelling) well that was a fun campaign guys it was a lot of fun i love it before we go to break we have a giveaway our fantastic friends at wyrmwood have this amazing dice tray to give away it is the wenge dice vault with tiger maple inlay that beautiful two-tone this will be going to one of our fantastic victors to this to enter you have to head over to the critical role twitch chat that's twitchtv/criticalrole and enter the word stowaway stowaway is the word enter it once more than that you'll be disqualified once again only for people in the us and canada excluding quebec because of stupid giveaway laws anyway we'll have the winner when we come back we'll see you in a few minutes [break] all of you except for yasha because she was not nearby this chamber is somewhat triangular but the corners are curved at each of these walls between each curvature there is a banner hanging about 12 feet off the ground on a brass rod the banner hangs almost to the floor you see four pillars a little closer inside the chamber each banner is a different color the ceiling's about 15 feet high and there are two corpses on the floor nearby both long-dead and mummified their skin paper-thin and pulled against their bones their faces twisted in horror you see the light gray stone walls and where these banners are there are two on the side parallel to each other and two on the other there is a red a green a blue and a black each of these banners has gold embroidery down the sides and a gold embroidered symbol in the middle the same symbol as the cloak that you found nope mm-hmm halas no there are four pillars they are smooth they appear to be either decorative or load-bearing but there is nothing about them that catches your eye if you want to take a closer look you can make an investigation check if you want stone as well pretty solid and featureless they are both wearing clothing there's not much dust on them which means either it's fresh or not a lot of dust to have collected from what you can see none make a medicine check there's a faint aura or a faint scent but either these corpses do not emanate a lot of smell or it has faded in time okay just to give you guys a visual representation-- placing yourselves where you would like to be in here if you don't mind telling me where you'd like to be placed one here and one here their faces are twisted in a horrible expression of ghastly terror or pain but you don't see any wounds did you roll a medicine check yeah you don't see any wounds or any gashes their last moments were probably pretty terrifying you moved aside the-- the blue one okay as it pulls behind it reveals to be a statue that is embedded in the wall behind it up on hind legs with claws in front you see a dragon made of stone carved wings blending up into the stone behind it its mouth open its eyes these very bright sapphires embedded in its head immediately as it opens up the mouth lights up blue make a dexterity saving throw and caleb and nott correct what did you roll okay still half damage failure you take no damage nott as you dodge away the rest of you watch as this bolt of blue energy fires outward as a thick beam of electrical energy shoots across the room it hits by and skims the front torso of twiggy as she pulls out of the way you watch caleb spin and take it straight to the chest as nott ducks out of the way caleb you take 18 points of lightning damage twiggy you take nine okay okay also make a concentration check for mage hand i believe mage hand is concentration oh no it lasts for a minute i'm sorry you don't need to it maintains itself that's my bad it did it went (crackle) across it hit the tapestry and dissipated the electrical energy didn't seem to impact or hurt anything it covers the statue is anyone else adjusting their position or are you staying where you are yeah it went (crackling) through the chamber where do you want to go all right caduceus the one nearest to you you're casting-- as you sit there for a second holding your staff your shield strapped over the arm your hand goes down you close your eyes and focus and the corpse on the ground staring off its eyes dull and the pupils smoky and gray breathes in its chest seems to inhale and it holds the air there awaiting your questions the wailing creature onyx black we had found an object and toyed with it nothing four questions you've got one more no that final bit of trapped air in the lung escapes and it falls to stillness once more okay so you're casting decompose on him it's a little tight on you but it fits you're slender for a half-orc you can be fit and slender okay a ten-foot radius would be a bit bigger than that so that would be the ten-foot radius so everyone is moving into it there's not a whole lot of space there don't make this the second time i've taken a hand of yours sorry so as far as you know it doesn't affect you in a volume or noise way you have to move over here probably to get into range as you pull back the green tapestry-- you crouch down okay as you pull it back you see a statue behind it that looks to be some horribly mutated humanoid creature its body is bulbous and covered in sores its neck is swollen like a toad's its mouth and jaw open with rows of teeth all made of stone as it pulls back this gaseous green fume spews from its mouth that fills the chamber around it about half the chamber begins to fill with this before it dissipates but it does not cross the boundaries of the hut what are you doing next it pulls aside the red behind it you see emerge a wooden door of red-painted material and the similar symbol of halas painted across the surface there is a handle there (clicking) it's locked the hand hovers across roll an ability check adding your dexterity modifier and your proficiency modifier it takes a few minutes this is an intricate lock as you watch the hand finish with the third tool that is being held between the mystical pinkie you hear a slight clink like a spring snapped or moved the front of the door here bursts into flame burning out in the area it burns solid for a good 30 seconds surrounded by flame all of you are being lit by this you're wincing from the heat you feel you should be feeling but it's all being held at bay by the hut's boundaries eventually the flames die out the door tapestry both untouched yeah they're very hot sure make an investigation check there are no pockets on the robe yeah it's a heavy cloak if you will it triggered something but you feel confident (click door creaking) it opens up go for it whew you give a thorough pass they are picked clean in fact you find the belt on one of them seems to have been broken forcefully and a couple of pieces of leather that are pinched where a belt pouch may have been resting for a while missing somebody has completely rolled these corpses and picked them clean already make a medicine check i mean you glance around the areas there's not much to really pull from that type of material you don't see any heavy bruising like they were forcefully pulled from them while they were living necessarily it's hard to tell so what are you guys doing okay roll a perception check for frumpkin okay frumpkin goes up to the doorway and looks it is a dark hallway no light frumpkin sees a little bit of light but it's above like there seems to be an incline it's above and to the right it's not a straight narrow hall it seems a little oddly angled the light source on the staff now emanates and the chamber is lit well this is open on this side (oohing) i got to use that piece finally okay so twiggy leaves the radius and starts heading towards the far end of the room all right roll a stealth check good to know what are the rest of you doing you watch as twiggy just leaves and starts heading towards the door all right as everyone finds their way to the door safely you feel the moment to leave the field-- so the hut vanishes spell's expended you guys exit and make your way into the hallway the hallway itself drops temperature dramatically it's similar to the space that you guys were in last time you feel for the edges and there's no real shape or texture to it it's just solid it feels almost like stone but not quite it's hard to place as you're stepping into the chamber i would say nott and fjord you both get just a hint of vertigo you glance and you take a step into the hallway and it's an incline you look up and you can see the light it's hard to make out but you see a faint bit of light at the end of it maybe a hundred or so feet ahead of you just like stepping into the room and having no real idea of where the walls and ceiling and floor are it just looks like a black shape and you're feeling some walls but they're a little rounded it's a strange aspect to this hallway no the floor just seems like a steady incline you see the end of the tunnel but you can't make out what's on the other side it's too far as caduceus steps in with the staff the light seems to be crushed down to where you can see the faint bit of it there but there's something about this hallway that's swallowing the light or at least compressing it to where it's not giving off much of a radius while you are standing in it not necessarily but make a perception check for me make an arcana check you can't make out much detail beyond the end of the hallway you however there's something about this that feels extraplanar meaning the end of this doorway whatever's at the other end is being tethered by something that's not really material space you don't know what distance you're traveling between these two objects perception check no in fact it's weird because the doorway itself is this well carved inlaid beautiful door as soon as you step into the hallway and look at the opposite end the hallway is just flush with the exterior of it and seems to curve out into the rest of the hallway it seems intentionally placed to match perfectly but has a natural feel to its shape it's weird correct right nothing comes up marching order please who's after twiggy nott and twiggy who's after nott caleb in the back you continue along this hallway walking it takes you a moment to realize but as you're moving forward the light seems to turn like whatever this source is the light shifts slightly like whatever source is there seems to have some sort of movement as you're paying attention and the closer you get to it you begin to see it's like a flickering of firelight there's a flame-based light source within whatever this next area is but it seems to be rotating you begin to make out shapes vaguely of things within that room but it's rotating as you walk it takes a moment for you all to realize that this chamber you're spiraling around it but there's no change to your sense of gravity but it a corkscrew movement eventually you come to the end of the hallway inside it appears to be a warm interior it's a crafted den or study of some kind but the angle you're at as you come to the end of it is a heavy steep angle you see all these bookshelves and a desk across the chamber and there are candelabras in there they're all this harsh angle but they're not sliding they're all held in place by something okay you cast thaumaturgy no effect the flames you see are inside the chamber and you haven't entered the chamber yet the thaumaturgy doesn't seem to-- no make a perception check no movement beyond just the slow movement of flames in the interior of the hallway make a perception check looking around the edge of the hall the ending you don't see any script or symbols looking inside the chamber though as you get close and peer within this is definitely a study of some kind there are bookshelves upon bookshelves that round different areas you can see a desk on the far end with a chair there you don't see anybody in it across from where this desk is you get close and push and past twiggy and nott to look inside this is a tall chamber it's maybe 70 or 60 foot tall taller almost than it is wide on the opposite end of the desk above this large collection of bookshelves there is a heavy stained glass window that's about 30 or 40 feet tall and about 40 to 50 feet wide there is no light source behind it you can see the stained glass and that there are colors to it but there's nothing behind no daylight to really make it clear from this distance you'd have to get closer not from where you're standing but you guys still have not entered the chamber so everyone gets plus ten to their stealth check i'd like everyone to roll a stealth check for me please beau overall pretty good stealth scores you feel pretty confident that as you one by one enter the chamber bracing yourself to slide down with the curved floor and you stumble and trip as you enter because as soon as you step in your whole perspective shifts and gravity is as it should be in that chamber you all step in at an odd angle and have to catch yourself as you have to reorient yourself in an instant yes as you all step in the chamber let me get a visual reference (cheering) pushing into this chamber this door is already open you guys all step into the interior of this den of some kind it's fine there's no fireplace but there are candelabras throughout the chamber that give a light source that flickers throughout the interior this is all bookcases these are bookcases these are bookcases these are bookcases this is a closed bookcase there's a small desk here and a large desk here and the stained glass window stands up there once you start all of the flames flicker brighter causing deeper shadows across the chamber that's the door you came through make a perception check you guys entered from that side it looks pretty solid this wall here there's a ladder over there as well looks like these are all set aside for climbing and getting higher okay no you can see through it it starts maybe six inches off where that platform starts and then continues up for the next 40 or so feet looking through it is darkness void a lack of light the only color you're able to make out is what the candlelight from the inside of the chamber is enabling you to see from the inside from this side okay as you all step into the middle of the chamber to look at this stained glass window above you-- over here sure you place yourselves where you want to be as there's more light in the chamber you can see now above this desk there is a 12-foot-tall six-foot-wide picture frame in the picture frame from the side angle it has no image as you step into the center an image comes into shape you see a tall ten- to 12-foot-tall portrait of a man thin of light brown skin long dark hair that tumbles past his shoulders a very thinly-groomed chin beard that falls to a point three or four inches below-- it's a very succinct point-- wearing a red robe with gold trim he is wearing a handful of rings on his hands billowing sleeves folded across his lap his eyes are a piercing amber-yellow color and his lip curls ever so slightly into a knowing smile no no it's lap up a tall thin man of light brown skin with long dark hair that tumbles past his shoulders a very thinly-groomed chin beard that falls to a point about three inches below his chin wearing a red robe with gold trim with billowing sleeves that fold across his lap his eyes are a piercing amber yellow his lips curl ever so slightly into a knowing smile there you go yeah he's got some intricate rings on his fingers yes it looks almost the same coloration the same deep red the same gold trim while that's happening the stained glass window now that you have light that's illuminating it-- there is no backlight so it's just the light that you have on it right there it shows clusters of different colored circles and discs arranged in a strange tethered pattern you see different colored discs different sizes and colorations that are laid into this with fragments of dark blues and grays in between they are all tethered by these silver threads and various tangled-- it looks like a crazed synesthesia equation if you will anybody who's trained in arcana or history go ahead and roll okay this arrangement you begin to make out is a layout of the planes the transitive planes of the ethereal and the astral between the realms you see these clouds of gray and light blue that mingle and create a venn diagram where everything overlaps on top of they act as the threads that hold these things together and connect them in between the inner planes showing the elemental chaos where the primordial elements were ordered into following the founding of exandria you can see where the flaming sphere is placed here and there is the water and the wind and the earth that is the scattering of these inner planes the outer planes where the realms where the divine exist are scattered and connected all surrounding the material plane on the outer side what you both notice two things are off about this one there's no divine gate shown here in this whole layout there is no reference most maps or sketches or historical designs of this type of a layout contains the divine gate because that was a major event that happened after the calamity and separated all of the gods from the mortal planes liam and you get the sense this was designed before the divine gate was ever created number two there is an additional shape smaller than the rest a tiny ruby-like circle that floats in the astral sea that is not tethered to anything and seems to not really fit within your understanding of the cosmos like the same color like the color of a ruby no it's just the same type of material as everything else it's the glass the window's made out of it looks like it's sitting in the center of the astral sea and doesn't have any tethers everything else seems to be tethered by these silver cords almost that puts in this large tapestry and that is just floating between all the lines in the middle of the astral sea you touch it you touch it and all of you hear this loud heavy shattering sound as the window shatters into a hundred different pieces all of them stopping about three feet from the window and freezing in place fjord standing before it in this void gets sucked into the darkness and the glass window closes behind him no no one technically was watching so what are you guys doing we'll get to you later you guys notice him vanish there's no like where did fjord go you heard the wall explode and him disappear and then it reset itself and closed okay caleb's heading over to the desk as you're walking by caleb there are books and books on these shelves and you notice that all of the books have a brass binding around them like a lock like a square shaped manacle that is affixed around it and it looks like all of them are locked in some way there might be ways to open it but it looks like whoever left this alone did not intend for anyone to open it but them you guys are over at the opposite end of this closed thing this also has a brass bar that is bolted and affixed to the closed cabinet all right so make an attempt with advantage you manage to find an area underneath the bar where there's a button press or symbol and you get one of the tools underneath push it inside and turn as you do the bar (click) it appears to be unlocked okay you open the inside of the cabinet and it is empty okay you put your hands inside the empty cabinet and it immediately closes on your arms as teeth suddenly emerge from the sides of the door (yelling groaning) no actually this is an attack on each of you oh that's cocked okay that is 23 against you and that is 17 against you all right each of you suffer 14 points of piercing damage both of you take seven points of piercing damage but you are both currently grappled as it is slammed on your arms in a very the thing kind of way like when the guy's chest opens and closes yeah it's some john carpenter it closes on you and you see on each of the doors where the striations of the wood are they split and you see these eyes peek through at you okay all right that invoke duplicity appears where do you want her to be okay yeah so you guys are both up here right now all right i need you guys to roll initiative nope okay so 25 to 20 20 to 15 all righty sam and there you go 15 to ten beau is going at the same time as the cabinet i love saying that that's an actual phrase that exists i'm so happy ten to five okay got you caduceus all right twiggy you're up first it is you have to use an action to try and escape with an ability check you can choose either acrobatics or athletics 19 is enough you manage to wedge your arm-- -- and pull out and yeah you manage to free yourself from its grasp okay easy enough you manage to back up to there that finishes your go nott you're up next two peas in a pod over here you manage to pull yourself free of it as well and back up to this side and pull away no worries that finishes your go beau and the cabinet go at the same time your dexterity is higher than the cabinet's so you go first it's a cabinet (singing) levitz pained (spoken) what are you doing all right the cabinet-- yeah this is full on we're talking dark side of beauty and the beast here just making its way forward it does notice it's an illusion it just steps through it it moves through and it's going to attempt to bite it can bite whoever is adjacent in front of it as you guys move back it's going to try and open and try and swallow you up into it it's going to attempt to lean forward and pull you into the cabinet's mouth against you nott that is-- ooh that's a 12 i don't think that hits no it's just a hit yep and against you natural 18 yeah all right so you suffer-- you've had your turn since so you have your reaction back yes you can so it would be 16 points of piercing damage which is reduced to eight however you are swallowed so you're inside of it now it scoops you up it lowers down and slams the cabinet shut as it pulls back twiggy's legs are kicking there and like audrey 2 it just sucks her inside of the cabinet she's used to this caleb you're up make an investigation check taking a minute to glance through a couple of things one you pull open one of the drawers you see a glass jar about this big that contains about a hundred or so of these small glass beads there's that you go okay that's that on the desk itself there's a large vial of ink about that big it's a heavy vial of ink with this big red quill placed next to it into a little cap the cork that has been removed from the ink vial is laid there next to it on the table you see in another cabinet a small porcelain doll it's made of porcelain and silk it's crafted to look like a young woman in a very fine blue and black silk dress the hair is long and silver and the hair in particular is very realistic that's all you find in the desk that'll put you there i'm saying you're at the desk to search it so that's (counting) 30 which puts you there that finishes your go caleb jester you're up go for it yeah you can second level so is that 4d10 damage roll to hit first you have to roll a d20 and then add your spell attack yes not hard to hit it's a cabinet 17 definitely hits roll damage since your illusion is immaterial-- go ahead you'll find out hon hon hon nom nom nom i love me some gnome flesh 20 points of damage the burst of necrotic energy slams into it and the cabinet shakes in place the eyes roll in pain for a second and they withdraw into the wood before they pop out once more from the doorways it seems to chew for a second in anger but it looks hurt it's not bloodied but that was a hefty hit not bad that finishes jester's go caduceus you're up i got caught up in it sacred flame is a dexterity saving throw nope it's not very fast this cabinet 14 points of damage you watch this burst of divine energy around it with this faint aqua glow to it as it burns around it the area where it hits you see the wood darken and splinter its boxlike shape is beginning to warp and twist a little bit as it's starting to give up a little bit of its instinctual form now it's looking hurt that finishes your go twiggy top of your turn first things first it's digesting you you take ooh that's 15 points of acid damage you are inside of it still i'd allow it there's few places as exposed and vulnerable as the inside of its mouth okay you are restrained so it's disadvantage on the attack but it is also the inside of its mouth so try it out 19 points of damage from the inside as you jam the dagger up into the top of the cabinet it's a combination of wood striation and weird liquid muscle that are pushing against you as it's digesting you you jam upward where you imagine the head might be as you do you hear (groaning) from the inside it begins shifting and quaking and the muscles are beginning to spasm it needs to make a constitution saving throw which it fails and spits you out you are prone on the ground adjacent it but it does like (throwing up) it is a coating of semi-translucent film with a very faint green texture to it but it mostly looks like spittle a very thick spittle you're covered in it we're talking ghostbusters slimer hit covered you still have movement you can half your movement to get prone if you want to unless you want to crawl yeah yeah your call you can get under the table if you want you leave this little trail on the ground as you get under the table you got it nott you're up first it does not count as an ally okay you step away it takes an attack of opportunity with you it's going to attempt to bite at you and consume you that is a 15 to hit what's your armor class you just manage to duck out of the way as it slams shut inches from your body you are going to attempt to hide over here or over here oh this way you manage to bonus action hide all right roll a stealth check you feel pretty stealthy you feel pretty hidden just throwing it out there all right so you move back out oh that's right yeah it's fine he's still hidden you do have advantage on the attack since it did not see you yeah all right roll a d6 on a one or a two it's the defunct one perfect well regardless how do you want to do this as it vanishes into its mouth heart the cabinet closes shut the eyes go wide for a second and you are waiting for the explosion like (straining) yeah it goes (sneezing) and starts sneezing heavily as it's sneezing the wounds that it's taken are causing it to sneeze up its blood it is leaving puddles on the ground until eventually the eyes roll back and it falls on the ground it's a room filled with books caleb make a choice make a perception check looking up there behind one of the cabinets you see a small stack of books that haven't been categorized yet they're still locked with the same bronze binder but it looks like they were set aside like somebody threw them up there to get to later all over the place up here is where caduceus is yeah go for it make an investigation check they do not appear to be trapped but they are definitely locked these bronze clasps around their form is that for one book one book you try and get there and the lock breaks one of your tools snaps inside there's the second book and the third book that book the metal brace opens up and the book is available to you make a perception check looking around no you see the smooth glass of different colors and you see the seams that hold them together where it's been sealed you can see the various colors and shapes around it nah you're panicking a bit that's what caleb checked earlier no one's looked at that necessarily okay you are going to head to that desk there okay make an investigation check and perception check for you oh i see then make an investigation check looking around you see amongst all the books that are latched in there's one big beautiful red leather book with sapphires embedded in it along the base it's locked in and it's placed ostentatiously in the center of the center bookcase right there you don't catch any other hidden chambers but that stands out you checking the desk it is locked it is arcane locked you look it you're like this is not moving you're not sure if it's trapped necessarily but glancing at it you're like this is locked and it's locked in a way where you're not entirely certain you could try but it's going to be a very hard lock go for it (laughs) total of 20 it's not budging interestingly enough the books' titles are not visible they are blank and then once the binding comes off the title appears on the front the title of this says public debate records forum of zeidel that one comes off this one no title appears you see instead a burn mark appear on the front like it's singed okay you're watching them come over with these two books and they put them on the table in the center which book do you open okay as it opens up the pages pull open and come to rest nothing happens it's a book you can see there is a place on the inside where a name might have been placed but that also has been burned off you can see from the way it opened up there are a few pages torn out it looks to be maybe a hundred or so pages it's investigation sure if you're helping him out yeah roll again it's hard to say it's definitely a very pretty book it's trying to get your attention by the way it's designed and placed make a perception check caleb you're paying attention to this layout they open up this book on the table and you glance over at it you look back and you look back at the book those are spell equations the one that they just opened on the table the burned one touch the one that's open okay you touch it it's a regular book make an investigation check beau since jester's helping you at this point you can do it with advantage because you guys are both glancing at what to do skimming over it you actually wait for a moment where caduceus is walking and the light hits it you can see a point on the glass where you can just make out the faint dimming of the reflection across the smooth surface the fingerprint left by fjord in a very sherlock holmes moment you see the one moment across the glass where it's not quite as shiny and it's that single bit of red that's imbedded in the glass technically it has to be something you touch so you can put it on the glass-- light as a cantrip is a touch spell okay as the globs appear on the opposite end they're snuffed out make an intelligence check caleb the void the vacuous darkness behind this reminds you very closely to the hallway that you traveled in here on okay you can go ahead and cork the ink and take it with you okay all righty double checking here you cast dispel magic there's a release of arcane energy across it-- sorry the divine energy you see the sparkles slowly fade as your concentration ends okay it's not locked anymore it's a (rumbling) it's one of those roll tops that slides up okay as this is happening the glass shatters you watch as both beau and jester get pulled in it closes back behind them (glass shattering) twiggy's gone half your party is now gone who knows where what are you doing okay it's empty all right you guys go back up okay you stay behind caduceus same thing shatters pulls him in and then closes and reforms itself these books as you pull they're stuck in the shelf it seems like the mechanism has locked them into place this is to unlock this is your thieves' tools the book comes free (strained) it's not moving it's not budging the second one comes free as he's moving up there there's a bunch of shelves books on the bottom row there's the center row with the big shiny book there's the top row with the other books-- you go and pull they're in place they're not loose okay doesn't work doesn't come free all right you press the button (glass shattering) closes behind i'll move this out of the way so fjord the sensation of being rapidly thrust through darkness at a breakneck speed is tough on you for the moment that it's there your sense of physicality is stretched for just an instant infinitely a point of light rapidly growing towards you until you're pushed through a circular portal of some kind you're falling you're falling forward gravity is pulling you this direction make an acrobatics check for me you fall 20 feet oh not too bad you suffer four points of bludgeoning damage as you slam down onto a circular stone dais it's rising out of the middle of this chamber about two feet up you slam into it get up there's a smattering of bone fragments across this platform and the floor around it bone fragments bones you look around you and you're standing in the center of an arrow-shaped chamber it pulls back a little bit behind you but to the back-right of you there is a long hallway that goes into darkness that way to the back-left of you there's another hallway that goes into darkness behind you in front of you the chamber continues on for about another 40 or so feet there's a dead end it curves to a dead end and there is a pedestal in shadow with an orb there set onto this pedestal before it sits more corpse fragments surrounding glittering coins and jewels-- lots of jewels and gems-- what little bit of low light in here is catching them what little bit of light there is it's just the dull blue light you can look up and the portal that you fell through is this faint blue sparkling loop that is the only light source in here the rest of it's through your darkvision you can just see the faint flicker of it reflect and refract through these scattered gemstones amongst this pile and a curled mass of deep cerulean blue scales you hear a heavy snort from under a large rigid horn as a pair of pale blue eyes open and focus onto you the body of the large creature remaining at rest while its folded wings twitch powerful but surprisingly slender this young blue dragon lifts its head to address you (snarling) the smell of unfamiliar sneak thieves finds us the way is shut to you that you have you're not entirely certain where the pile of loot and the creature's body really begins it's partially submerged into this nest that it's burrowed itself into besides from its neck that slowly begins to extend as its head lifts to meet your height you can't really see the rest of it it looks you over its eyes taking in your shape where's the fun in that why are you here little morsel oh please and what have we learned good tell me what else have those grubby hands touched i like to know the flavors to expect the falchion appears at which point the head curls back and one of the arms (loud impact) you hear coins scatter as the impact sends bits of its loot across the stone floor and into the shadows around ah it's been a while since my food has played back okay as soon as you turn you hear another (loud impact) as the other arm impacts the ground shakes a little beneath you make a perception check with disadvantage because you're scared as shit you can't even focus your eyes blur for a moment it stands there and goes halas has not returned in an age you shall keep me entertained for now make a persuasion check still standing you glance over your shoulder and you can see now its form it's maybe from wing tip to wing tip about 20 or so feet the body itself is not incredibly massive this is a younger dragon but it's still a fucking dragon it turns its head curiously towards you and breathes as it does you watch these crackling blue bolts between its teeth arcing between the jaws it opens up slightly the tongue running itself over the front i don't know where he walks these days it's been a while but we have an arrangement yes i keep watch on some of his surroundings and he sends me food and gifts one day i'll be big enough to eat him and this will all be mine but until then i'm fine with the flattery he leaves little pockets around the world he thinks for a second to himself time does move strangely chamber to chamber here if he is well i guess that makes me lord of the manor you hear another-- (footsteps) more or less (footsteps) if you can call the hundred or so chambers here a house make a persuasion check roll fucking high he goes huh i appreciate the offer but i tend to work solo and let's be honest i'm hungry there are a few flashes from the center of the above hallway as a few bodies fall through beau and jester both come falling through bill and ted style both of you guys make acrobatics checks for me you three-point land you three-point land (bones cracking) (screams) five point of bludgeoning damage to you as you land the dragon rears up caught off guard wings up in the air i'm going to pull the map out (cheering) for this jester landed there fjord-- sorry beau is prone there and the dragon is right there well let's roll initiative first rolled really shitty initiative yeah he rolled a two 25 to 20 yeah only those present 20 to 15 six for jester top of the round fjord you're up looking down at the end of this chamber it's dark there's no light source but you have darkvision to perceive anything in there you have to make an action but it's up to you so your choice right now is focus on the dragon or explore your surroundings okay over there we're going to throw the-- is blink concentration correct so you're not even concentrating all right cool so you cast blink on yourself as you cast on yourself and turn around releasing your hand towards it the shadows from the nearby area cling to it like chunks of a venomous symbiote for a second as they grind into the corners of where its body is the curse takes effect that's the end of your turn so i think you get to roll right correct but at the end of each of your turns-- on 11 or higher you vanish from the current plane that's where you were you disappear that ends your go beau you're up you're on the ground looking around there's a dragon there fjord turns this way and vanishes there's two of these darkened hallways what are you doing red elemental gem a fire elemental is summoned as if you cast the conjure elemental spell and the gem's magic is lost so as you throw it it shatters i don't have a fire elemental thing on me so we'll use this for the time being as you throw it it breaks on the ground there suddenly rising from the impact the flames swirl and build up into a full-fledged fire elemental beneath as for the conjure elemental spell let's see if it gets its action right now yeah it is concentration so you're considered concentrating right now it's friendly to you and your companions roll initiative for the elemental do you have stats for the elemental it's okay i'll find it right now for you and i'll text it to you yeah do that pull up the fire elemental there initiative what's the number on there you got it that's your action your movement you're still prone okay half your movement you got it okay that ends your turn the fire elemental's turn now it goes it is next in the initiative order go for it it's still on the ground the mini has it flying up but it hasn't risen yet 18 just hits correct does it catch fire okay that's the end of the fire elemental's turn is it going to stay there or going to move jester you're up okay you are now concentrating on spirit guardians it's a wisdom save for the dragon is it friendly oh look at that thank you for pulling that out for me even better you're amazing that's a wisdom saving throw right it rolled a natural 17 plus one so 18 it takes half damage though you do that's what i thought it was wait an affected creature-- no it's when it start its turn you're right we'll come back to it okay which direction no it's an action unfortunately only beau gets to do that because she's a cool monk okay that ends your go well the dragon is going to take its turn the dragon is going to turn this way as it moves around the fire elemental that struck it first it takes d6 damage right from being on fire d10 damage roll a d10 eight points of damage insolent creatures (footsteps) turns around on the fire elemental and releases this burst of electrical energy this lightning bolt arcs from the front of its snout or channeled the horn through the fire elemental and towards beau spirit guardians correct so you're too far away from it so it doesn't take any damage patient defense doesn't do anything you have to make a dexterity saving throw and the fire elemental does as well that's a success roll for the fire elemental evasion happens-- oh yeah so you take no damage you take no damage roll a dexterity saving throw for the fire elemental you duck out of the way it strikes the wall the stone exploding from the impact the fire elemental takes 55 points of lightning damage correct 52 damage no i'm sorry 55 it's going to then fly back around to get a better area this is actually going to take up in the air the ceiling is 20 feet so it gets to max at the very top it's ten feet above anybody so it's out of melee range unless somebody can get to the top it's 20 feet it's right there the mini looks like it's flying when it's not now it's flying it's at the base level the fire elemental does get an attack of opportunity as it moves out of its range shrugs it off 17 just misses it does hit roll damage the flames are burning around its body it doesn't even pay attention ten damage not bad that's top of the round so (approaching screams) next up i believe was it caduceus first in the same round yeah so we'll say both of you guys drop both of you roll initiative first of all acrobatics check yeah you read some books okay 14 you're fine 19 you both are fine so you land you actually fall past the dragon (screams) you land on the ground like what (wings flapping) there's a fire elemental burning over here on the side it's absolute chaos both of you guys now roll initiative see where you end up on the initiative order 18 caduceus is up first and 13 so top of the round caduceus you're up first fjord is nowhere to be seen you can see this giant shadowy mark on the stone where electricity is dissipating and beau looks like she just saw a ghost maybe shit herself just the look i'm not saying you did but you have the look jester is surrounded by sparkling unicorns and is just like uh what are you doing okay saving throw is charisma plus three that's a ten it fails so that now has bane on it boop all the circles correct bane on that i'll make that a yellow one there we go negative d4 to all its attacks and saving throws so you cast that and then you have your movement and bonus nope nope nope (singing) where has fjord the cowboy gone towards jester this one or this one okay so (counting) 30 it is dark in this hallway there's no light source so just be aware that ends your turn fjord you're going to appear ten feet from where you were you appear there you rush up to the very end and you come upon a small alcove and a small crystal a faint turquoise green-blue coloration to it similar to the flash that consumed the room when the sphere was being puzzled there looks to be a groove running across and down the base of it and across the floor and you glance over and there's a groove running all the way down the hallway across the floor the crystal is dull it is dark and it is just there all righty roll for an attack twice 24 hits both hit roll damage nice as you peer and run down the side turning around and firing these bolts out they light up the hallway as they arc past blasting into the side of the scaled armor as they both hit the blasts hit and take damage but it's a dragon it looks over i see you morsel it flickers in and out and you're still standing there you added your curse damage on that right you add your curse damage that ends your turn fjord beauregard you're up (counting) you get there you see this small alcove with a green-blue crystal that's resting there and a groove that's running along the ground and across the wall and continues all the way down the length of the hall you turn around and can see that both of them meet in the center and then go in towards the platform in the middle this was the raised pedestal you saw behind the dragon you guys haven't even looked at that yet because you just saw a dragon and fucking ran okay you touch the crystal it's cold no okay nothing (counting) all right you're underneath the dragon now feeling the wind blowing down from the wings scattering dust and bone pieces around you're having to squint your eyes from the bit of debris that's being kicked up from its wings that finishes beau's go twiggy you're up you see beau vanish down and come back fucking crystals right at this distance-- you have darkvision 60 feet right you can see him down there it's conceivable you're a tiny little thing that hasn't done anything yet unfortunately you are next to a very bright fire elemental that is lighting up the area you might have to creatively use the space there are outcroppings-- you'd have to move into another area to try and get-- correct okay you are small see if you can try it it's going to have a higher dc you may or may not be make a deception check yeah you're playing it you're owning it as you stroll forward creepy extended fingers and billowing robe the dragon is like (winging flapping) and just looks right back at fjord it's paying about as much attention to you as it did when you arrived so you haven't angered it but it doesn't seem to be convinced necessarily unfortunately dragons are pretty perceptive good call though that ends your turn fire elemental's go but can it fly it's out of range unfortunately (burning) there you go does it stay put or move anywhere sure he can ready his attack in case the dragon comes in range you got it that ends its go jester you're up sam and just fill the chamber with halases okay what's the saving throw on that and a negative d4 to that he rolled a 15 minus three (cheering) okay just so you're aware-- roll an intelligence check for me real fast okay gotcha it turns into this tiny crimson weasel i don't have a mini for that necessarily here we'll go there that'll work it falls down ten feet it takes one point of damage it's still in its form but the fire elemental is in range and is readying its attack so fire elemental attacks it as the elemental slams the tiny weasel the weasel reverts to the dragon form yeah not the player well no i'll let you guys do all of your attacks but i'll let the enemies do it too all right roll damage it's okay that's the thing you have to consider with polymorph you have to decide if it's going to take damage if you're going to put it in a tiny form it's all good 11 points of damage that was an awesome maneuver yeah it's all good that finishes your go jester it's now the dragon's turn you want to back up this way spiritual guardians has faded because you cast polymorph so you're backing up this way it is it's in range now now it's his turn it takes fire damage at the top roll a d10 for the fire damage six points of fire damage all right i'm going to roll and see yeah that's a six it gets its lightning breath back infuriated by the fact that you just turned it into a tiny little weasel it's going to turn this way and release another arc of lightning down i need both beauregard and jester to make dexterity saving throws please yeah evasion's just an ability you have all right that's half it's 51 points of lightning damage you succeeded so it's halved you take 25 and you succeeded so you take none so you cast hellish rebuke nothing comes out the ice gathers around you and then rockets behind you no effect you turn around and look at the crystal and the crystal is now glowing the light that emanates from the blue-green crystal travels down and arcs through the hallway hits the center and gives a faint line towards this object across the way twiggy and beau you guys can see as it hits the center this very faint trickle of energy is now hitting this far pillar where the darkened sphere is standing that finishes-- well the dragon's going to try and fly up again both of you do you and the fire elemental do i know what'd you roll a four yeah so it gets out of your reach miss the fire elemental does get another attack as well roll critical damage for the fire elemental the dragon however does still manage to get out of melee range and get itself up in the air 13 damage okay correct with the rest of its ten feet up it's going (counting) the dragon is now currently hovering over-- yeah we'll say it's there the dragon seeing the glyphs light up is now turning-- yeah it just finished its turn blasting and uses its movement to move up that's true you get another ten fire damage got it that finishes that round next round top of it we have-- no because you guys came in last round nott and caleb you guys have a few more rounds you dilly-dallied back there you guys are looking through books right now the elemental went after twiggy it already went it held its action remember caduceus you're up correct you are no longer invisible you saw none of this you were over here in this chamber all you saw was a blue thing go (buzzing) that's all you know you saw lightning go down there you heard a scream you saw a blue glow (buzzing) up the-- which one okay you release sacred flame the flame burns up around it dissipates no effect okay brings us to fjord mm-hmm i mean if you want to try it okay all the moisture in the air gets pulled in and clings itself to the outside of fjord as this icy encased chunk of arcane armor that gives off this mist around his torso yeah sure it creates this banded partial helmet and you crack into the crystal the armor shatters off of you and into the crystal the crystal glows you're a bit dazed by it but the light tears down to the center of the chamber the light actually brightens in the center and there the central orb that's there that's been dark suddenly lights up with the same dull blue-green glow as the coloration on the floor and the coloration that you noticed very faintly coming from the inside of the orb when you initially were inspecting it every turn you have to keep doing it you can end the spell prematurely if you want to god why won't it happen okay that ends fjord's go beau you're up okay so you walk up there you look down it's just a large pillar with intricate carvings and you see runes along the side that are darkened there is a sphere about that big that looks similar in size to the one the got you here but it's not as intricate it's more of a metal ball that has hollow runes carved in it that the glowing blue-green light is emanating from it's lighting it from underneath the faint glow and it's lightning the middle of this small alcove yeah that was just your movement sure you reach out and touch the sphere (whooshing) beau's gone that's your turn twiggy you're up the fire elemental right now is no longer under beau's control the thread has been severed that was keeping it controlled as an elemental yep for the next hour the elemental is considered an enemy what are you doing twiggy there's jester currently now pinned in the back of this hallway by a dragon flying in the air it's about ten feet above it you are you are now within its melee range because you are now considered an enemy it was originally whirling there and then all the sudden as beau disappears it (growling) that is my favorite descriptor of invisibility i think i've ever heard in the history of my gaming experience that makes me so happy you do it still knows you're there it will have disadvantage on an attack as you move from melee or you could just use bonus action to disengage or just assume that it might miss up to you okay okay 25 you're right there okay that ends your go that brings us to the fire elemental's turn the fire elemental does not know where you are it's going to move to the closest target it's actually going to as part of its fire form-- the fire elemental is going to move through both of you as it bursts through you both burst into flames so both of you are on fire it is it is going to attempt to attack each of you once since you're both within his attacking fjord that is a 17 to hit all right you take 11 points of fire damage the armor's gone it was consumed by the crystal that is going to be a 19 to hit you caduceus you take seven points-- sorry ten points of fire damage that's going to end its turn jester your turn ten points yes which means at the top of your turns you take 1d10 fire damage unless you use an action to put it out okay make a concentration check for me it's above you it won't get an attack of opportunity on you so you're not going to cast the spell (counting) 30 you get there roll a d20 it's your constitution saving throw you're fine you're still there you get there and the magic just sputters for a second not going to save you unfortunately yeah aww all right end of jester's turn the dragon's turn yes it takes d10 damage i'm going to roll that that's a nine all right no he's getting close to-- you're starting to see some wear and tear does not get his dragon's breath back so instead it's going to swoop down towards jester trying to prevent you from escaping so it makes three attacks one with its bite two with its claws first attack at jester okay that's a 14 to hit right yeah as it strikes with its claw you pull your shield up sparks fly off as its claw arcs across the outside of your shield it strikes with its other claw ooh that's a natural 19 plus-- that's 28 minus one 27 sam and i'm pretty sure that's it yeah so the claw strike manages as the shield pulls away from the first hit you're not able to get back quick enough and the second claw goes right across your torso for 15 points of slashing damage the bite is going to come after you that is going to be a 19 to hit minus a d4 minus four it's going to be a 15 to hit as it goes to bite towards you its jaws open you pull back and you instinctively put the shield up to block it and its mouth comes down on the shield holding on to it caduceus in the back focuses for a second and you watch the jaw weaken and pull back readying itself for another strike that ends its turn that brings us to the top of the round caduceus you're up you guys are looking at books still i'm sorry you do you take-- you can spend an action to do so you take six points of fire damage to get there yes well people are in a couple of rough places and you're still missing caleb and nott up to you you still have an action to use i like dumb all right it's not concentration i'll allow that the flame goes out because there's no air for it to breathe do you step into it here he homer simpsons into the stone wall you can use your movement to leave the stone where you entered it which ends the spell you don't get to move through the stone it's a lie-and-wait type of spell like merge into it and stay there for up to eight hours and then once you leave it but the fire's out and you have your movement 25 30 you're in the stone currently in the wall got it that ends your turn caduceus fjord you're up this is going great guys yep you do you take three points of fire damage okay so (counting) 25 what're you doing okay roll two attacks both hit roll damage nice it gets hit twice i'll say go ahead and make an intimidation check just as part of this attack since this was your intent you have the dragon's attention he was slashing into jester and after that twice in the side of the head it (growling) back towards you you can choose to end the spell that's a good question let's go ahead and check it should tell you on the spell ah so no that ends fjord's go beau you're out twiggy you're up for an attack you do yes okay go for it is this with your bow that definitely hits and it is sneak attack because he doesn't see you you appear in that space and you let loose an arrow that sinks itself right into the heart and scaled underhide of the blue dragon 27 points of damage it's looking hurt you can see blood emitting from some of its wounds okay so you move behind the pedestal you believe that you are hidden fire elemental's turn it goes this way i'm going to go ahead and-- jester roll a d6 on a one two three it attacks you on a four five six it attacks the dragon it comes over to this side it moves into this tiny space because it can it's going to run past it is going to ignite you both as it runs through so you are on fire the dragon's still on fire but it doesn't lay into you with two attacks it attacks the dragon twice that is a natural 20 and a five miss 12 plus three 15 points of damage on that crit nice not bad all right that ends the fire elemental's turn jester your turn first at the top of your turn you take six points of fire damage you're burning what are you doing what are you doing jester roll your attack you spin around the flames are burning around you you spin to look at the dragon and the fear wells up inside you facing it down even with the flames burning around it you can see its face coming through towards you angry now that fjord's vanished and is no longer in its sight it's turned its attention back to you you think you reach out for it and expend the spell and you're just a few inches short okay so you're ending your turn there you're not going to move that's true the dragon's turn top of its turn it does get its breath back it rolled a six it comes through the hallway angrily it does so i'll roll the attack for the elemental another natural 20 holy shit this is the luckiest damn elemental in the world that's 12 plus three another 15 points of damage the dragon also takes because it's still on fire an additional six points of damage it's looking hurt i'm going to see if it rolls high enough perception to see you natural 18 it comes in the chamber (sniffing) (crackling blast) this beam of vibrant blue electrical energy arcs towards you make a dexterity saving throw correct it just barely skims singeing the edges of the branches that are sticking out of your hair the rat's nest themselves curling back from the momentary heat as the flash of energy but you avoid it entirely slams into the wall behind you stone breaks and splinters and the energy dissipates throughout the area no damage rogues and evasion man it looks furious (roaring) the breath itself-- it smells like burnt ozone that's true yeah it's really confused by it that ends its turn top of the round ah go ahead and make acrobatics checks you guys acrobatics check you both fall prone right on the sides of it as you slam into the dragon-- onto the side-- (groaning)-- on the ground not for dragon scales unfortunately but you do both take five points of bludgeoning damage from the impact you're like-- (groaning) both roll initiative to see where you fall on the initiative order eight okay you're in a chamber you land there and you see this angry burning dragon and this tiny little version of the mage that you walked through the den of and that's it you see the glowing sphere here on the pedestal these lines of energy that meet in the center the fire elemental in the back way burning you're troy in community walking in with the pizzas you do smell the electrical remainder in the air caduceus you're up they already rolled initiative okay what are you doing caduceus you shout that as you're stepping out of the wall we're running it's bad you're on deck fjord what are you doing it's all good all right what's the saving throw on it okay is blindness concentration it would be a three plus four-- it's a plus four con save so it's a 17 minus four from the bane so it's 13 yeah it's blind you move up the bane fades all right that ends caduceus' turn fjord you're up so there all righty he has reach with his bite he has that entire hallway covered that will put you at 30 right there fjord is out at the top of your turn because you're still on fire you do take four points of fire damage that's the end of fjord's turn it's your turn wisdom saving throw no that's cocked it's a 19 unfortunately good try (small impact) the dragon hears you speaking and looks in your direction but where the pale blue piercing eyes were is just a cloud of black it is trying to sniff for where you might be in theory yes yes it does not have tremorsense it does have blindsight to 30 feet i just noticed you stay hidden okay you got it you move into the back area got it okay that ends twiggy's turn fire elemental it's going to-- nott roll a d6 on a one to three it attacks you on a four to six it attacks the dragon yeah with advantage because you're on the ground that is a 17 and a 16 yeah they both hit you take eight points of fire damage and you're on fire okay so you take four points of fire damage the second attack does nine points of fire damage to you that ends the fire elemental's turn nott you're up he's within five feet of all of you it's a sneak attack just letting you know it's an explosive arrow and you're adjacent to the creature go for it 18 just hits you're prone so you have disadvantage on attack rolls by the way so you do have to roll again we'll say you stand up that's half your movement there the arrow detonates from inside creating a fiery explosion in a ten-foot radius around the creature that affects you caleb and the fire elemental the fire elemental is immune to fire it takes no damage the dragon however-- will you roll 3d6 it has to make a dexterity saving throw actually it does not because it was hit by it it takes an additional 11 points of fire damage then i need both caleb and you to roll dexterity saving throws so you take 11 points of fire damage you take none because of your evasion you roll out of the way (dull explosion) caleb's like ah still alive correct you still have a bonus action and half your movement okay go for it so you have to make an attack roll against yourself don't you for your weapon as you go to fire a second round you pull back and shoot and the mechanism misfires slightly and all of a sudden it scrapes you on the side of the cheek and you're like ah okay you still have your movement if you wanted to move i mean you can still move within its melee if you wanted to try and re-maneuver okay there you go the fire guy does get an attack against you that is a 12 i don't think that hits you you just manage to avoid it okay caleb you're up yep yeah mm-hmm a dragon that looks hurt but not death's door and a fire elemental that is burning angrily good call okay all right all right that brings us to jester's turn jester ten feet that's right unfortunately no he's placed in a way where-- i mean you can you can go-- oh god you can go there that way the fire elemental is not within range and technically the dragon-- you're just out of the dragon's range although you're going to pass it running you also take one point of fire damage at the top of the round because you're still on fire okay i mean there's no way to-- yeah so (counting) 30 you can get to roll for your d20 jester remains it's now the dragon's turn it does not regain his lightning breath that's good he's going to go ahead and take three attacks liam and he has blindsight within 30 feet yeah that's going to beall right yeah it's going to be a claw attack on each of you a claw attack against nott that's going to be an eight plus nine 17 you take ten points of slashing damage got that okay against jester that is a natural four plus nine that is a 13 to hit you deflect it and it doesn't care much for nott necessarily you've been a threat it's going to go after you jester i'm sorry natural two not even joking i was looking at it-- we're not out of the woods yet as it strikes both towards you there's that moment of quiet where your eyes close and you're waiting for the imminent moment and you hear this voice creep in your head and go don't worry i'm watching your arm-- without even noticing-- you feel a hand push your wrist and the shield goes up and deflects the impact the teeth streak across it and cling to it and begin to try to pull the shield away and you instinctually muscle it away as you do you watch two teeth shatter and fall to the ground in front that moment of strength billowing up inside a pretty strong cleric that's the end of the dragon's turn caduceus is done fjord is done and twiggy this is the turn this is the moment it's looking pretty hurt that's as much as i can tell you yes that hits roll damage with sneak attack into its throat you watch it reach up and with its claw scrape the arrow out of the throat and as it does you see a little bit of electricity arc out from the wound it's looking pretty hurt you stealth into your old campaign that ends your turn twiggy the fire elemental's turn first the fire elemental is going to roll against the dragon which is the closest enemy currently natural two that's a miss natural eight yeah it misses both strikes it's going to shift around to this way that ends his turn nott you're up at the beginning of your turn you take six points of fire damage within 30 feet he can see through blindness correct it's nott's turn okay are you disengaging okay going to run to the front it makes an attack of opportunity against you that's going to hit that's a 15 plus nine yeah it's 24 it's going to be a bite attack against you which does more damage that's going to be 18 points of piercing damage the jaws bite into you and you feel it rake across your shoulder but you manage to pull out roll on the ground to back up and you manage to get your arm up and pull yourself onto the platform where the orb is still glowing that dull green color go for it the bolt ricochets off of the hard scales of the dragon's hide what are you doing man all right jester's turn at the beginning of your turn you take fire damage six points of fire damage he did jester's out (groans of relief) dragon's turn travis and (laughing) holy shit the dragon's going to wail on the elemental it can't see anything else around it let's see if it gets the-- does not get its-- that's a hit and a hit and a miss on the jaws that's seven damage for the elemental if you want to keep track of this ooh double sixes that's 17 points of slashing damage to it the dragon takes another six points from the fire the dragon's hurt real bad the dragon's hurt real bad that's going to end its turn everyone else goes by-- twiggy you're up you go before the elemental go for it roll damage we'll see if it's enough okay nine plus four so 13 you can either just roll the sneak attack and then double the number or roll twice as many dice it's up to you how do you want to do this (cheering) quiet shh still in the form (heavy breathing and steps) it stumbles forward towards you now that you're visible its eyes blinking in and out looking confused still with the shape and goes-- (low chuckling impact) and falls to the ground and collapses exhaling bits of energy arc out of its snout and dissipate into the stone around there the dragon is dead yup (roaring flame) you can but it's either that or touch the sphere they did they're scattered over in this corner it'd be a move grab it and then go okay (exhales) as you all one by one emerge beaten on fire-- help put it out for those who are still burning in flames you find yourselves back in the hull of the ship you see the crew half of the crew is sitting there looking intense the sphere resting on the center of one of the tables off to the side and as soon as the first of you emerge they're like (starts) where have you been what's going on orly pushes forward and goes where all you been hanging (whooshing) a few more appear (impacts) eventually everyone makes their way out of the sphere you hear a clattering sound and you glance down and you see stuck in the side of your boot what looks like one of the errant dragon tooths (cheering) marius is like we've been waiting here for seven days yeah we're at bisaft our repairs finished like a day ago and we haven't paid yet because you've been fucking gone the dockmaster's not happy yeah it's sitting on a table they've all been rallied around it trying to figure out-- you guys vanished and this was all that was left we figured that was the case all right it's about 130 gold for the masts getting the various bits of the sails repaired and fixed and everything all right i'll get them paid mark down that amount you watch her gnomish form vanish off the docks and mingle with the rest of the villagers of bisaft you both quietly sit there drinking your tea finishing off the watch while the rest of your group sleeps soundly in their midday bunks recovering from the strenuous activities of surviving three chambers of a hundred-chambered mage vault extraplanar home we'll end it there and pick up on that next
