hello and welcome this evening to critical role everyone a show where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors play dungeons and dragons and have a good time guess we can go ahead and-- we forgot to do the format this time and start with the intro we trying to do that going forward because it makes more sense but for now let's go ahead and jump to the intro and we'll be right back to describe what we have going on [dramatic music] that's the most comfortable way to do that well awesome guys thank you so much for joining us in this before we jump in let's see if we have any announcements that anyone wants to make anything coming up anything you want to talk about i'll start i'll say that as of flying out this evening i should say i have a flight at 1215 from lax i'll be flying out to columbus ohio for matsuricon this weekend so any of you guys out there in the ohio area want to come and visit me for the weekend i'll be doing signings panels and general hanging out with fans and stuff so if you're in the vicinity come say hi that's my announcement anyone else have anything they want to mention you keep streaming thursdays at 700 which i think is really counterproductive oh look at you yes you did i would say susan's a very lucky girl but really it's the other way around a lot of suede will and which no one ever uses and you forget it's there until you're like what's that oh right congratulations there you go exclusive critical role exclusive well fantastic let's go ahead and jump into where we left off anyone else need a pencil everyone good all righty guys as it currently stands vox machina throughout its ventures found itself in the city of vasselheim as of late they came to seal away the horn of orcus they had tore from the head of the beholder k'varn deep in the underdark once they had completed this journey they spent some time in the city trying to figure out what can be done there preparation for possibly keyleth making a venture out to one of her ashari tribes during which grog entered a fight ring and lost and the party decided to go ahead and-- i have a feeling kern and grog are going to have a round two in the near future depending on how grog's feeling about that then the party saw that there was some sort of hydra-like being that had been harrying the walls of the outskirts of the city of vasselheim being the adventurers they are they took it upon themselves to leap out into the jungles and the forests of the vesper timberland found and hunted down this hydra fought it and upon slaying it discovered there was another group also hunting this hydra an actually sanctioned group and that hunting this hydra is considered illegal in vasselheim unless you had actually been contracted to do so so in breaking the laws of vasselheim they could have been tried for it but instead chose to return to the city with this group of hunters and be brought before their guildmaster the huntmaster known as huntmaster vanessa cyndrial basically they were given the choice they could go to trial or they could undergo their own personal trial to join the guild the slayer's take which is essentially a guild that takes on contracts to hunt various requested creatures down harvest elements of their physical bodies to then be sold or returned to these individuals and be paid for it if they manage to complete these trials they will be absolved of breaking the law because they will now be within the confines of it and will be members of the guild so choosing that they were then also notified that they would be splitting up into two different groups much to the chagrin of vex and vax our twins so this group the second adventuring group has gathered itself back to the bellows' respite inn vax you were asked to go the bar to join your sister vex for a shot of the hardest liquor they had available to deal with the coming separation you shared a brief breakfast shared your bitter spiteful alcoholic imbibement and then went your separate ways the first group went initially and it's been about an hour or so of you guys waiting in the tavern for them to as far as you know take care of their business before you were to go to the guild yourselves so we have tiberius keyleth and vax all sitting around the bellows' respite tavern lamenting what's going to come next you are currently in the bellows' respite tavern the relatively jovial ginger-bearded rotund human gentleman who runs the establishment comes over to you looks like himself is a little bleary-eyed and hasn't quite adjusted to the morning light itself oh okay certainly i'll go ahead and retrieve that for you it's three three is what i'm looking at right now i'd say it's roughly 900 to 1000 in the morning he tries to catch it fumbles goes and pick it up five minutes go by your food and drink are brought to your table and you continue to lament about the coming time is there anything else you guys wish to take care of before you make your way to the slayer's take guildhall okay go ahead and make an investigation check the flying carpet is for the most part kept wrapped up in grog's bag of holding as you reach into your bag of holding-- through the luck of the draw it seems to be that the last resting place of the flying carpet was within your bag of holding okay what did you roll for your investigation check tiberius 16 okay as you guys take the next 20 minutes wandering the quad roads district of vasselheim asking around a lot of the shops here offer general supplies there are a few that are focused on the mining supplies as there is a large market mining cobalt out of the center of the mountain the city is built around you find places that provide clockwork for large grandfather clocks that are starting to be distributed in this part of the city you also find that there is a large bazaar-type market in the center of the quad roads that you passed by when you first came to town amongst many of these barkers you do catch one small tent tiberius that catches your eye because it resembles the same purple color as one tent you guys entered in emon about a year or so ago in which you encountered a fortune teller so as you enter the tent you pull the curtains apart there is one other individual who seems to be just perusing the interior but the smell that hits you immediately is very heavy sage ceremonial burning of various spices giving the area a mystical scent the light itself is very low just a few flickering candles and a hooded lantern in the far corner directed outward give a bit of ambiance to the interior of the tent the series of small ropes and cords made of hemp and silk carry trinkets and bones and various enchanted accoutrements and in the far back corner amongst the table there is indeed a very beautiful elven woman dressed in a fine silk gown with a metallic headband her dirty blonde hair behind her ears and she looks to be in the middle of shuffling a deck of tarot cards as you enter she looks up and gives you a look of surprise and then a curious look of remembrance you're behind him and outside of the tent he entered did you guys want to go in with him liam and all right you enter and are greeted by this same atmosphere she gives you a cross look she puts her finger up for a second turns over to the noblewoman who is currently perusing this small shelf of books and tomes i'm terribly sorry would you mind just giving us a moment i've some personal business to attend to the noble woman is like oh fine i didn't want to purchase anything anyway and stomps out of the tent the door closes behind her at which point the elven woman immediately turns trista's my sister it's good to see you again young half-elf you can see now with the current atmosphere the light seems to dim the interior of the tent and the elven woman's visage shimmers and then fades and there sitting behind the table you see a large hunched forward gnarled humanoid this woman who is definitively referred to as a hag is currently lording over the table long twisted fingers holding that same deck of cards looking up at you with a crooked nose and pointed chin there's a grin on her face and looks to you and it has been some time dragonborn i can still see there is a fraction of you still missing still shuffling her cards so was there anything i can help you with she gives you a keen look i think for the time being one quest is enough return when you've procured this ring you so graciously seek then perhaps the rest of this will be revealed grow greedy with fate and i fear the timeline will swallow you up young dragonblood she pulls the cards down and just starts going over her own reading each card she slams down with a heavy thud the room seems to almost cloud the air growing thicker and there's a hint of frustration that she's currently being bothered and strung out after she takes a few moments to herself she looks back you is there business you seek aside from asking me these questions perhaps a bauble or two i make fine baubles she stands up and as she stands up you can now see the hag which hunched forward sits at a solid five feet tall at full height even with the hunch she's now cresting the top of the tent at seven feet long stringy gray-black hair framing the shoulders the same nice goldish silk outfit the elf appearance was wearing is there it looks much more world-tattered and matches the one currently wearing it she reaches behind her still staring you intently in the face and grabs a small case off the wall sets it down before her pulls back the wooden lid and inside you can see there are three small glass vials these are what i have to offer two of them will right your physical form perhaps take care of some of those wounds someone as foolish and careless as you eventually deal with the third one is caustic in its nature its application is up to you they are sold as a set though 300 gold pieces take it or leave she reaches over and as you hold the small bag of coin out her hand completely engulfs yours the fingers wrap around and for a second you feel a tug and you are awkwardly pulled forward a few inches you get closer to her face the breath catches your nostrils the scent of swamp water and old fish it's a moment of intensity where you forget your surroundings for a brief moment and it's just you and this entity and you realize she's far older than you ever gave her credit for she pulls the bag of coin from your hand and withdraws the light seems to return from the peripheral of your vision keyleth and vax are there at your side she reaches forward and pushes the box forward toward you on the table be safe and may fortune smile upon most of you not today as you know my dealings with fate take a lot out of me i'm not quite ready for another round of tellings you see this city as most bits of civilization are very eager to hear what the future has in store for them so i'm a bit tapped out at the moment and you can see a bit of dried blood around one of her nostrils and if you recall last time the process was very physically taxing on her perhaps return in a week or so and if i'm not here i'm around trade she stands up and reaches over and there's a small alchemical glassware set up on the side and you see it's cracked and old and it's been brutalized and she pulls a very small vial of some dark black almost umbra-type liquid where you can't even see shine in the light it absorbs all the light she puts it forward this would be very unfortunate to find its way into the bloodstream of an enemy yes a favor not now but perhaps down the road she pushes it forward with her long crooked fingernail shoves the vial forward it screeches across the top of the table she withdraws her hand so it is done at that moment there's a very a cold shiver down the back of your neck that then fades she just grins with this nasty toothy grin now be on your way i have cards to shuffle as you step out she raises her hand in front of her and her form once again shimmers and shifts down to that beautiful elven maiden that greeted you as you entered the lights tend to blossom a little bit and you close the tent behind you gives a slight breathy chuckle that starts beautiful (chuckle turns into a cackle) you acquired two potions of greater healing and a vial of caustic liquid you are uncertain as to what its properties are you also don't quite know the properties of yours but you gather the assurance from a creature of this power that she speaks in riddles but not in untruths the person looks down at your arm brushes it off and the middle-aged gentleman goes sir you do realize that most of the potion trade is controlled by the clergy the individual looks at you awkwardly and points over and you can see just past the outskirts of this bazaar there are a number of buildings that line the outer area of this central portion you can see where he is pointing there is a large cathedral made of almost from this distance a warbling warped obsidian and it is far more ominous and obelisk-like in appearance than the other temples in a district of the city that you haven't been to yet but it is the closest temple dank which is arcane terms for thaumaturgical anyway you make your way to the southern outskirts of this portion of the bazaar which leads its way into the central building cluster portion of the quad roads district to the outside of the slayer's take guildhall you walk up to the main doorway which has the inscription in front and pushing the door open you enter into the main foyer area where you see the same cast-iron chandeliers hanging from the ceiling the dark wood rafters frame the entire internal area and there sitting at the central desk is mertin the scarred-up halfling with the relatively joyful disposition he looks up from his books okay it appears to me that we have the other half of this adventuring group to deal with let us hope that perhaps you have better luck than your previous friends in what has been chosen for you eh yes they left not more than an hour ago i imagine oh nothing they're going to kill a dragon would you like me to go get the mistress for you i'll take that as a yes i'll be right back and he gets up from his table and wanders off as you wait a few moments eventually mertin returns but he seems his head down a little humbly and gestures out with his hands and you hear the familiar footsteps of the huntmaster vanessa cyndrial her tiefling appearance both very striking in her chiseled bone structure in her face her dark leather armor itself creaking slightly with each footstep and she has that very commanding yet welcoming appearance which you know hides a very hard-to-read interior she steps forward well are you ready to take on the other half of this mission your friends were eager and they traveled with some of our finer warriors are you confident in your capabilities today you see it is very simple i like it direct and to the point i respect that the angry flowery part in the middle not so much a fan of all right so she reaches behind and pulls out what looks like a small rolled-up piece of parchment looks at it for a second well you have one other hopeful for this guild that will be joining you for this and a leader will be assigned to you on this excursion to keep an eye on you and make sure you stay within the rules and not go absconding to some other country and we have to hunt you down a liaison if you will mertin would you get the other hopeful for this mertin says of course my lady he gets up and walks over and knocks on a door as you hear the door knock on the opposite side of the room opens it up and the red tousled hair halfling kashaw your group has arrived as you guys look the door opens and a human male steps out into the light if you wish to describe yourself for the remainder of this contract at least but once you have joined the guild perhaps other groups will be assigned to you it is a contract very well it's mertin mertin is the name but it's okay i can hear accent from upbringing it's syngornian use it's fine mertin never mind by the way the human that has walked out you can see has shoulder-length brown hair a leather cord that is tied around the center of the forehead eyes two different colors one i believe is a light blue mertin goes over and knocks on a door opens it up this individual is easy to hear from a distance the heavy footfalls and the grumbling echoes through the hallways before he even appears mertin leads you into the light of the main foyer area this will be the group of which you will be guiding on this i appreciate you doing this for us i know it's not really usually what you do but here is your team for this contract this is your team and vanessa chuckles to herself i'm sorry this is what you'll be dealing with today now thorbir play nice thorbir thorbir play nice so please if you would not mind making sure that they see their contract to fruition taking them on this as you will showing them the ropes of the guild and try not get them killed well you will be rewarded as per the contract you will have done the guild a great favor which you know favors can go a very long way in the guild fair enough well perhaps now would be a good time for this jovial lot of adventurers to know what it is they are to hunt down well we'll see how well you can make it into one perhaps this is a test for you as well fair dwarf she unravels it looks at it i think this will do well for what is required we will bind this contract to you now feel free to take over if you wouldn't mind reading half-elf this would be more of an arcana check 18 rakshasas were entities that originally stemmed from the realm of the nine hells they are devils they are deceptive and usually embed themselves in elements of society where they can grasp and take power they love having servitude beneath them and they are notoriously difficult and slippery to find let alone nail down and destroy appearance-wise they look like a normal humanoid man but have the face of a tiger and the other curious element is both of their hands are reversed that's as much as you can glean from your formal training and understanding why does it matter all we know is we can confirm that there is one within the vicinity or huntable at the very least the rest is up to you to find the client has decided they wish to remain anonymous for this contract your quarry is the creature meaning we've been able to confirm that there is one that is within a huntable distance within the three days of the contract however part of this trial is to see just how good you are at finding and destroying such creatures so that information is for you to find unless you do not feel your skills are up to par for the slayer's take in which case you are more than welcome to go for the door human well you seem like a well-traveled unit you seem to have done well enough to find and destroy great things you spoke of as you walked into these halls prove to me that you are more than just sell-swords show to me that you have the intellect that you have the skill sets that you have the cleverness to find the creature that does not wish to be found as the dwarf exits and you guys follow outside of the slayer's take into the center of the main quad roads thoroughfare on the outskirts of the bazaar to seek a rakshasa wherever one may be found knowing the city for the while that you've been here you know there are places of open business that have a lot of traffic are also good places to ask for if anyone has seen anything that might match a certain description or an individual that you are seeking any strange behavior and so you know that the center of the quad roads where that bazaar is is a good place to start requesting information as you have currently none at your disposal it's like a man will and it's a demon creature that looks like a man no go ahead and make an insight check would you like to go ahead and roll a 20 gruff exterior there is definitely a toughened past to him he seems driven not necessarily untrustworthy per se but definitely a man of little patience and currently does not seem to be too pleased with the fact that he's essentially babysitting in his mind you may find out in due time yet that is too hard to read at this moment you can cast that anywhere you want to your magic is divine this is your city you can just tell me all right so as you guys are having this discussion you're having this weird stare-off and considering where to go in the bazaar you stop in the nearby alley two buildings down from where the slayer's take guildhall is and you begin just taking a small dagger from your side and carving a circle in the ground throw some runes down that are specific to your patron take a moment and concentrate on the description of this rakshasa looking at the specifics of the spell to make sure that i don't give you misinformation locate creature beautiful you focus your mind for a second and your holy symbol begins to drift up from underneath your armor you instinctively take and slap it down underneath and then refocus your vision your eyes closed and you can see what looks like a pulsing energy like a very dark flame something that itself you can already smell the sulfur you can smell the lineage the devil lineage that this entity is and there is indeed one not too terribly far from where you currently are it's faint which means that it is on the outskirts and you know this lasts for a good thousand feet or so but it does give you a northeastern direction and the spell fades with each footfall you know that what was once probably hundreds of years ago a nice cobblestone roadway in the center of the city has been slowly hit with mud dirt snow sleet and so each step is a slight moisture with each footfall not immediately those are usually to the very outside of the city thorbir leading forward in the northeastern direction that was given by brother kash eventually brings you around the side of the bazaar and you can now see why it's called the quad roads there are two main roads that meet right where the bazaar occurs and then they spread off into the other sections of the city to the northeastern section from your guys' perspective the district begins to drift into another district that you have not previously visited this district is you've heard it mentioned before known as the duskmeadow now previous sections you've been in have been worshipers of bahamut the platinum dragon there was the braving grounds which worships kord the god of strength and warfare and honor the quad roads which is under erathis the deity of civilization and invention the duskmeadow falls under the watchful eye of the raven queen the goddess of death that large obsidian-type structure that you were led to earlier is the temple that resides in the center of this district and you've heard mention before of a few of the things that exist here that being probably raven's crest which is the main temple to the raven queen this is also where the amaranthine oubliette is located which is essentially the prison of the entire city of vasselheim the amaranthine oubliette this is also where most of the dead of the city are interred into a series of catacombs that are built deep beneath this section of the city far enough away from the oubliette to the point where isn't crossover and is enough of an escape because that apparently has happened in the past history of the city as you begin pushing towards the edge of where the two districts meet you can see that there is an area of the town that for lack of better term it's a more jovial than expected area there are a series of stands put up along the side of the road there's a lot of beggars sitting on the side of the street that are currently panhandling to those who walk by there are a number of taverns you can hear music coming from various establishments and it seems almost the closer you get to the death-oriented district on the border of the quad roads the more and more it pushes into a shadier mardi gras-type experience so you make your way towards that dividing line there what you would like to do there are many that sell jewelry many that sell very well-made clothing some of them party attire there are some that sell exotic fruits that have been imported in various states of ripeness make a perception check that would be an active perception check as you're seeking it 21 you do glance around and there is one cart that carries costume party attire supplies it doesn't seem to have too many customers right now but they do have a couple of masks that are on display looking at it there are none that are tiger-specific no they seem to be molded leather and some more impish goblin-y in appearance there is yes you see a woman in her forties or so thin with a big toothy smile her hair is pulled back into tight bun you can see there's little bit of her blondish hair turning to gray on the sides around her ears reed richard-style the bahamut section is far away that's another section of the city you are now on the line between the duskmeadow and the quad roads so it's erathis and the raven queen i do i do i make them myself by hand hence the price this is the localized festival of the city if you've been around vasselheim long enough you've seen there is little interest in celebration depending on some places but at least on this line some people can appreciate the fleetness that is life and grasp it by the roots and make it its own before it's snuffed out consistently that's why i come and bring my business here i wouldn't do very well up north i'll tell you that all them dragon types-- looks to you no offense all them silver dragon lovers have an issue with things as celebratory how many masks take your pick go ahead and make a persuasion roll 15 she gives you a look like she's trying to read you looks about left and right glances at you and looks a little ugh glances at you and looks really taken aback and then comes back to you with a escape of comfort well i mean some businesses here are a bit shady i won't lie and there are some long-standing businesses that have quarrels usually they end in small scuffles or one purchases the other and ousts them from the city this is one of the few areas in which the more adult pleasures can be found so there's a lot of money to be had but recently there's been at least from what i've heard a series of bodies have turned up there were a few found fished out by the bastions in the water trough on the outskirts of the duskmeadow bastions who are the guardians of the city from what i hear they had been mauled by some sort of strange beast now beasts on the outside of the city that i can see but on the inside that is the stuff of nightmares is it not i mean death is not an uncommon occurrence for certain areas of the city and she gestures off to the distant temple some people invite it even but such violent death like this is usually kept to the outside of the city at least with some sort of cause this seems to be a murderous rampage that me personally i don't want to go out at night without protection i don't know i've not investigated perhaps you have to ask the bastions yourself that or anyone who was in the vicinity she looks around and points off and you can see there isn't a whole lot of bastion presence in this portion of the city especially since the bastions are more of a voluntary guard people from the different clergies the different temples train to become bastions and fit themselves with whatever their deity's armor is you do see there are two bastions armored in a very dark dark brown leather that carry a symbol of what looks like a silver raven that is embroidered on one shoulder of a cloak that is tossed to one side yeah oh they're across the road about maybe a block up i believe they're bastions from the duskmeadow perhaps you could ask them she does actually have one that looks like a raven very well a good choice it doesn't quite match the color of your attire but perhaps i have an outfit that could match for you cloaks i don't but there but there is a cloakery about four blocks that way on your left they can probably help you there of course yes of course friend dwarf and she goes and rummages through a small bag and pulls out a mask this little purple mask that seems to have small fake gems forming the outside with a couple of ribbons that dangle where it would tie around the head it's simple but it's pretty unfortunately not many people bring children to this side of the district they don't sell very well but if you would like one i would be happy to part with for two gold make a persuasion roll one gold guess it is better to sell it than not at all here you are i must say i won't tell anyone but purple is a pretty color on you all right a few moments pass as you wonder where your dwarven leader has vanished to he steps out through the front of the establishment you do they're either provided from some of your experience by the slayer's take but those are usually offered at the start of a contract the fact that they weren't offered on this means either they don't have any currently at their disposal or they felt that this contract probably wouldn't require it with the construct of this group being set out other than that they are a little hard to come by a lot of them are controlled by the main temples and are pretty much given straight to the bastions there aren't a lot of individuals that are in need of them within the city and those that travel out are either members of the slayer's take or members of the bastion forces so they are little hard to come by all right as you guys step across the way it's about a block up one of them is partially inside the alley between two of the buildings you can see he has one hand up on the wall and the other down one of them is relieving himself on the side of the building while the other is keeping watch arms crossed looking out across the road the one that's immediately present or before you you can see is human a scruffy brown beard around the edge of the chin the hair itself is cut very short a little heavier in appearance a little muscle a little layer of winter padding but the black leather armor definitely gives you the appearance of somebody who is a bastion of the raven queen as you approach the hooded half-elf the dwarf walking with the giant axe and the bumbling dragonborn the human cleric with a very angry disposition and the awkward half-elf druid stepping in pace with him gives you all a cursory look and immediately puts a hand to his side where you can see that there is a rapier currently sheathed aye you walk with purpose slayer's take it is what business have you on this side of town then aren't you supposed to be out past the walls killing creatures and such all right then what's your business aye the gentleman to the left of him finishes shaking off the rest of his alleyway journey he turns around and throws his tunic over excuse me it's official bastion business anyway and he nods over to the bearded gentleman who's standing there there are certain bits of business that are official in this town i don't know how honestly right it is to be talking with common folk or even the guild who does what it likes make a stealth check i'm not even going to roll i'm going to ask you to go ahead and you can choose if you want persuasion or intimidation on this you're riding that line you know i've heard about it for so long i don't know what ancient aztec deity's temple you defaced when you were a child but man all right so as you lean forward-- we'll get to that as you lean forward forcing your presence on this bastion his hand's still holding the edge of his rapier he steps forward into you to the point where you're almost forehead to forehead sorry i have to lean down to reach your level but if you're going to go about asking questions and not offering proper compensation for information well then i think we have no business here go ahead and make a perception check 28 taking a moment as you sneak up behind the one he's talking to-- the two guys are shoulder to shoulder squaring off with the rest of this group the one that had been relieving himself in the alleyway is a little bit closer to you you can see as he put his tunic right and everything he jostled around and revealed a couple of small pouches on his side one of which you heard a clinking of glass on the inside go ahead and make a sleight-of-hand check not sleight of hand no 20 all right you reach over and find the edge of the leather loop that attaches itself to the side of this bastion's belt you tug ever so gently to the side and the loop releases and you pull it off seemingly without any noticing as you pull out the four gold from inside the bastion looks out and scoffs and goes clearly pittance fee for this what's to let me think that you aren't actually part of this murder scheme you just walk up and try and start asking questions like this first off where did you hear about it second you look like the kind that would go ahead and be mauling folks in the street do you not sir dwarf you got the eyes of one who's probably done a few dark deeds then explain to me why we shouldn't take you in for questioning right now and he pulls his rapier out the blade up toward your face and he says look dragon man i was talking to the dwarf you i have no business with at the moment so you've got ten seconds before we take you in make a persuasion roll three i rolled one as you push forward the coins in a semi-awkward forceful manner the bastion himself also seems to be caught off-guard and looks down and looks about realizing that now it looks like you are visibly out in the open paying money to the bastions he looks back people don't stand out in public and do it and he pulls you all off into the alleyway to the side of the complex out of the middle of the area into the shade between the buildings he reaches over and takes the coins from your hand and hurries them into a pocket all right look i'll tell you what we know but if you're going to be messing around with this investigation i ask that you don't let anyone know that you spoke with us this is all on your own and if you do say anything we'll deny it and we'll make sure to put you in the oubliette yourself for this all right now we have found a series of bodies over the past few years scattered about a few months at a time between all with a similar pattern of death to them we found large portions the meaty portions of the body had been torn away some of them apparently eaten there are marks that are indicative of some sort of beast ravaging the corpses but no signs of a beast coming or going and we've had many of our finest trackers looking for any sort of sign of a creature that may have found its way into the city they've been in the rooftops the gutters perhaps even the sewers no sign of any such creature traveling amongst any of these scenes now all of the bodies have been found wrapped up and discarded in the canals a lot of them surrounding the abundant terrace looks at the rest of you that's where melora's eye is watchful what's really got us confused of late is the most recent murder that we found was a very powerful merchant lord from ank'harel one that's been in this city for no more than a month he's well-known in these parts as bringing in a lot of business his caravans come through via various skyships and he brings with himself an influx of much-needed mercantile in the city i'm not allowed to say the merchant's name is tyrell tyrell lord tyrell if you say any of this to any of our people i swear i'll make your life the hardest it's been in months and from the looks of you you've had a very hard few months lord tyrell's body was found but apparently during the murder we have one beggar that apparently caught sight of this the murderer as best as we can tell it was some sort of lycanthrope the beggar was babbling but it seemed there was some sort of wolf-like creature it was seen bipedal walking a man but tore this man right through the throat most of his chest but when spotted didn't run just vanished disappeared no longer in his sight no tracks left behind just gone didn't know if it was angry poltergeist ghost but the last place he was staying is at a recent establishment only been here a couple of years referred to as the velvet cabaret the velvet cabaret is a very high-end place you do he gives you a look of-- the fact that that the lord had been staying at the velvet cabaret for some time and we were feeling pretty close to possibly finding the source of these murders our bastion force from the duskmeadow worked with the quadroads and we actually raided it found nothing nothing but the patrons no sign of any sort of foul play we were forced to leave empty handed that's all we've got i've only seen the most recent the rest i've just heard of no children most of them seem to be well off to do folk dressed well most catacombs themselves are sealed off we've asked around and there's been no sign of movement in or out and gods forbid anyone stays in those places that's a nasty place to be staying all the bastions that's near impossible the city's scattered politically enough as it is people can be rallying whenever there's some sort of force coming against the city but when it comes to nothing for any particular reason just the investigators take care of it themselves yeah i certainly hope not these sort of communion rituals are sanctified and held within the actual temple to the raven queen itself if anyone is doing any sort of business there is a very watchful eye over the city anything that is unsanctioned i can guarantee we'll know about it you can see the two the two bastions are looking at each other with expression of really listen we've talked long enough we got to get back to our posts there are different people assigned to investigate we were part of the team that was sent as part of the investigation raid on the velvet cabaret that's part of what we do as bastions aye they wouldn't have any more information than we do no yeah go for it he seems forthright enough he seems impatient and a little flustered with the fact that you've been pushing these questions to him but he doesn't seem to be covering anything necessarily the body was found in the side alley to the velvet cabaret the ones that were found in the river they were wrapped up in blankets whatever put them aside was not some beast there was some intelligence to this and they were placed deliberately which means i don't think there's just one thing doing this they seemed to be different some were just scattered cloths some were tattered sheets some were bolts of fine material really varied there was no pattern to it nothing more than his throat his trachea it's all right just offer more coin up front next time be well and if you hear anything find any information come straight to us don't be getting into official business you're sanctified as a slayer but don't make us look bad they step around you guys back out into the main street roll a history check this is unprecedented you are the nega-percy right now this is impressive you take a moment to conjecture where you may have heard the name what was the name again you want to roll a history check d20 and add your history modifier total is 20 all right you've heard of the city of ank'harel it's a desert city from a long ways away but you aren't specifically aware of this individual you however kashaw you know that lord tyrell has come through this city a few times in the past year or so you've only been here a short time yourself but in the time that you've been here you've heard tales of this large caravan that comes through and it is a parade he usually brings with him a good 13 different carts that contain all sorts of jewels and materials and tapestries and fine silks and it's almost a small party whenever this is this long walking caravan is brought into the city so you are aware of this individual you're surprised that the death has be kept so hush-hush as far as you know no information that has caught your ear per se but the fact that he's staying in this district who knows it was a few weeks back when the murder occurred yeah you have three days to complete the contract meaning slaying the entity you're contracted to all right fair enough even in comparison to vax your attire is very nice as you guys go out shopping for better looking well-to-do attire we'll go ahead and take a quick five-minute break and we'll return here and as you guys continue to the next step of your hunt for the rakshasa last thing engraved on your tombstone yeah quick five-minute break first off before we get to that guys a big thank you to negihama once again our patron saint of ridiculous gifts who purchased these sconces to put on the wall they are amazing reminder every hundred subs we're giving away a signed picture and signed full-scale poster of kit's art and for the break the five-minute break we're going to take real fast we have an awesome video that was presented to us by some of the critters that i think you'll also appreciate as well so we'll go ahead roll that and use the potty and we'll see you guys in a few minutes [break] oh gotcha that's okay he'll arrive when he comes we'll all awkwardly stare yeah when he does when he arrives we'll all just-- but in the meantime you managed to go back and-- oh that's good to know wrath of the gods comes down upon you all right so you guys taken a few minutes to acquire outfits that seem a little more fitting as to the establishment you're planning to go and enter all right cast and a flash of light you guys all pick up the very very heavy smell of breakfast ale emanating from the deeply breathing angry dwarf all right you guys make your way to a little bit further north this of this route five or six blocks until you get the outskirts of the velvet cabaret which based on the description you've gotten from a few individuals you asked around very easy to find the fancy house of entertainment it is a two-story building of dark cherry wood with strips of what looks to be black suede bolted in a pattern along the outside of it it stands out like a sore thumb against the rest of the architecture but it looks a night club it looks very very gaudy but in a way that the garishness looks expensive and so you can't really fault it for looking the way it does i like that i'll take that when are we going to this joco cruise i know as you approach the front you can see that there are two bouncers established at the very front to the left you see a meaty male dragonborn bronze scale with painted face scars he has a very very intense look about him he's thicker he's built like a barrel he sits with his arms crossed looking angrily out amongst the rest of the folks outside to the other side you recognize a burly-looking female with short hair and some facial tattoos the siren who you saw battle in the cauldron apparently works as one of the bouncers of the velvet cabaret he gives you a look of confusion for a second and leans forward and the dragonborn looks very intently at you and says back in draconic are you a member looks over to the siren siren glances back and what's he saying and the dragonborn glances over and he says out loud in common now at this point he's saying that they're looking to come in here and talk to other elvish guys i guess make a persuasion check 21 he gives a glance over well if you're not a member you can acquire membership but it has to approved first by the owner let me get his assistant hold on just a second siren she gives a look i'll be right back she rolls up her sleeves and steps inside as the door opens as the door opens you can already hear what sounds like soft harp music coming from the interior and it's hard to actually look inside because as you can see there are silks draped crossed over and in front of the entryway as soon as you step in a few moments pass eventually the siren returns and you are greeted at the doorway by a dwarf with very well-groomed facial hair a beard that comes to a fine point has a little gold ring at the very bottom that kinks it at the bottom this little poof with makeup on very rosy cheeks and you can see there is eyeliner around his eyes smile to his face wearing these long white robes lots of jewelry and the rest of his dark brown hair is pulled into a dual ponytail that runs down to the middle of the back comes to door and immediately says gracious welcome to all of you i've been told that you're seeking possible membership to our establishment well fantastic then don't leave possible patrons outside and looks off to the two bouncers and they grumble and step off to the side come in come in follow me and he steps inside as you guys walk in behind him immediately you're hit with the strong smell of exotic incense and the cooking of meat mingling with that it has this smell of everything good you've ever smelled mixed into one location the interior is fairly low-lit with what looks like a series of faerie-fire lamps dangling in small lattice cages so it has this light purplish-pink glow to the general interior there are no stools or chairs there are tables that low set and the floor is nearly covered with very very expensive looking pillows all the patrons are currently sitting cross-legged or laying around the tables and you can see the clientele is very well dressed and very wealthy there is laughter and conversation there's definitely has a very very different air it's like stepping into a whole different world from what you're used to seeing in vasselheim and you get the feeling that whoever created this establishment definitely created it to provide a very different experience for most people who work here which means one it probably makes a really good killing to the small number of clientele number two it probably isn't very well liked by the people who have been living here most their life as you look around too there are dice games being played there are many gold pieces being stacked up on tables it appears that there's definitely a lively-- what's the word i'm looking for my brain isn't working-- gambling arrangement in this place you notice that all the guards in the inside the bouncers are common sell-swords there's no unification to their adornments or any of their armor and stuff there are a few folks that are looking around keeping the peace arms crossed they all definitely have weapons visible and they're just sitting there guarding just like the bouncers were at front of the place just the one that let you inside all right well that's a step in the right direction looking about they look armored it's hard to tell their skill level based on the low light in here they seem definitely keeping an eye out but you can tell they've been working here a while and they've grown comfortable what you do notice though is a lot of the servers that are walking around are young men and women dressed in very fine silk robes or gowns all have these iron bands around their neck collars that aren't chained to anything but it immediately gives you this mental image of slavery or some sort of servitude it does not appear that they are actually in some sort of servitude but the adornment they wear is almost trying to get across that atmosphere as if that's part of what you're paying for it sickens you a little okay as you guys you have walked to the center of this room now the dwarf individual who let you in turns around and with a bit of a bow i would to introduce myself my name is hosin i am the manager of this fine establishment the velvet cabaret i'd like to welcome you scanlan of the shorthalts where do you hail from i've not heard of them coralin shorthalt very well well you have interest in membership you say oh yes quite entertainment here at certain hours if you like for now we have more an atmospheric presentation and he looks over and you can you see that there is small stage off to the corner there sits a very beautiful elven woman dressed in a gold gown that is sleeveless and hugs to her form very well you can see that it shimmers and little bit of purple fairy light that is hanging above her and she just this gorgeous-looking silver harp in front of her she's just plucking away her eyes are closed like she's just caught in the moment and there's group of people that are sitting around her chatting softly not to be overbearing to the music but to just be around that atmosphere you're saying this to hosin make a persuasion roll no deception roll deception roll 16 all right the pleasure is mine and it's not often that come across elves that have taken the time to learn the tongue of my folk well if you are seeking membership you should probably speak with our patron the owner of this establishment he's currently in a meeting i believe but step with me for a moment and he leads you to go to the other side of the room and you know all these draped orange and gold silks that are constantly getting in your way as you push through leads you into a doorway that is covered in these silks you push into the hallway to the right and left there's a door across the way and two doors down the left and the door at the very end is a really ornate-looking door with a series of locks that currently unlocked hosin walks up to it and knocks gently onto it takes a listen ah it appears that he will be available in just a moment if you'd like to sit tight and you're more than welcome to speak but of course he claps his hands and you can see one of the servants that you saw walking with a small tray enters from the side of the hallway yes hosin turns the finest wine we have available for the elven lass right here the servant immediately darts off averting the eyes a moment passes returns with three glasses of wine looking over you two hands one to each of you and the servant still averting his gaze from the guests smiles gives a little curtsy and then darts back into the main room it's definitely an elvish blend which is generally too sweet for your tastes but for what you were expecting it's not too bad its serviceable nowhere near strong enough to really do anything but it's not water the doorway at the end of the hallway opens up suddenly and as it does a servant walks out holding a tray that contains a bunch of partially-eaten fruits and what looks the outer gristle of some sort of cooked meat and looks at you all awkwardly and steps past and disappears into the other room you hear a voice come down the hallway enter i ask you all to enter you are to meet me please come sit be comfortable welcome to the velvet cabaret as you enter hosin lowers his head and offers his arms at the rest of you to acquiesce stepping into the room you see-- once again a room that has a square or rectangular table in the center that has a series of small platters on it with bits of previously devoured meal and there are three small cushions on the ground that you see would act as some sort of sitting arrangement the opposite side of the room has three large purple cushions on which there are two women also servants that are just lying back comfortably just resting and in the center you see a man very dark complexion ratty looking crimped dark hair very well-trimmed beard and mustache ensemble and long black and gold robes very very long sleeves and jewelry adorning every ounce of his hands his fingers you can barely see the actual skin beneath there is just so much jewelry adorning him he looks up smiling with his elbows near the edge of the table have a seat we are to talk yes introduce yourselves guests are always welcome but i wish to know who it is that i am guesting for all right what are trying to see they seem to be lounging and there isn't like fear in their eyes or that they are being mistreated per se almost like they're here for atmosphere the room itself-- most of the walls have like a velvety texture to them all the wood has been covered with some sort of material that has a comfortable almost-- everything feels like it's a lounging bedroom and that's the aesthetic of a lot of the interior of this location you cannot quite see the source of the light in the room it almost feels like there's an indirect lighting accoutrement across the ceiling whatever the source of lighting is it's being spread across the top it gives this sort of dark intimate feel to this current room at least as he gestures out to the rest of you to sit i fear there are only three seats but i assume that your accompaniment are accustomed to standing anyway so do not worry very good now you say you come for membership membership does not come cheap membership does not come to anyone we have a certain level of clientele we wish to keep because in keeping this it is easy enough for us to consider it very-- how do i say-- exquisite i did not catch your name either coralin shorthalt takes your hand and leans forward and gives you this ginger kiss to edge of your fingers yeah there is a slimy-ish presence but not too aggressive just a very well-trained type of dealing with guests my name is vince cyinnor and i am the owner of this house of joy and pleasure make a deception check 15 hosin if you don't mind and the door closes behind you guys well scanlan shorthalt what may i ask business do you run that gives you the liquid assets to think that you can walk and rub shoulders among such astute clientele you are well-dressed i see and well-versed in conversation but have not heard of you before and i have very acute ears for people of such heritage in this city why have you come to this establishment i am made of ostentation for i do not fear what people judge or think here do what you like why limit yourself even this one here while his appearance may be rough i'm certain that under certain circumstances he could be persuaded to prove his weight in more than gold and weaponry business does happen here yes quite a bit of interesting business from what i hear as my assistant has told me your business is shoes tell me why would the business of shoes require such an ostentatious location for business we get to the meat of the matter eh so shoes is but an appearance what is your business aside from cobbling mr shorthalt make a deception check what was it poisons so you supply to what king-killers supply to sell-swords you apply them to your own weapons you realize this city is very very tight-knit when it comes to these sorts of industries although i know you would think possibly to find it here i guarantee you what we deal with here has nothing to do with slitting of throats i will tell you one thing that i am interested in buying i'm interested in buying information i'm interested in buying loyalty i'm interested in buying trust since you've walked into this room there has been an air of something not right about you and through this conversation i have come to believe that perhaps you're not telling me the truth now i will ask of you this moment whoever you may be shorthalt or not but this entire facility is very well paid to make sure that should you try anything funny you won't get but two steps before the heads leave your shoulders so let's be frank here who are you why are you here okay as your actual dragonborn appearance restores itself he sits back then perhaps you should have walked in this form when you first arrived well one person has come clean what about this one what is your business here what is to help me you have not told me what your business is explain the force of the wink itself is intense enough to the point where he physically shudders and leans back a few inches this is about lord tyrell we do have his possessions they have been investigated our establishment has already been investigated the bastions were very thorough and we have been found absolved of any sort of involvement interesting you come in here and lie it seems to me exactly what you're doing now are you coming to ask questions to see what involvement we have answers we've already told everything to anyone else we have no involvement i don't know what you're talking about this is ridiculous and i may have to ask you to leave what did you get it's not impressive that's mythic yeah you're the singularity that ruins the universe all right so as you're all taking this moment to yourself it's hard to read it seems like he's very thorough and offended by this circumstance you glean that there is a nervousness and there are droplets of sweat across his brow and his brusqeness does show a bit of fear in his eyes yeah indirect lighting you don't quite know where the source is coming from the door was already closed behind you hosin closed it but as the wind comes out all the silks blow against the wall pillows are lobbed to the sides both of the women in there (yelps) and pull back against walls trying to keep out of the circumstance and you can see vince has begun to stand up and his hair blown back what is the meaning of this persuasion check it's the women and vince hosin closed the door and left in the hallway owner he's human make an intimidation check 15 as you do this between you standing he's in the process of standing up and he was reaching for something under one of the cushions as you do that he glances about the room looks over to you specifically and back to the dragonborn the dwarf you realize you may have just alerted pretty much the entirety of my guard to this establishment they'll be descending on this room soon he sits down on the cushion again what do you wish to know his possessions are not under my keeping no i have no idea this would be insight yeah 26 looking at you tense he's fumbling lie after lie right now yeah for you especially all the signs are there the quivering to his voice his eyes darting from person to person he's still covering look what happened was unfortunate there are things beyond your understanding or control involved here make an intimidation check with advantage because of this whole setup here they'll kill me if i say anything this establishment i am not the owner i am a figurehead something else currently pulls the strings from behind and he looks off past you just over your shoulder you glance over your shoulder briefly and at this point you can see the door is partially ajar and you can see in what little light there is a dwarven face staring through the passage that then slams the door shut quickly and you hear footsteps marisha and that was hosin yeah he's shaking his head now the blade there as you hear the feet running off now all right you guys watch as keyleth all of a sudden grasps the side of her armor and then her form shrinks down to a tiny rat then darts underneath okay the scroll is consumed and gone you turn into a fly and follow as well two of your party members just shrunk and vanished and went off as creatures you go ahead and roll for an attack that hits go ahead and roll sneak attack damage on that yes it is with 42 yeah you (whack) he's out like a light lights off face on a pillow the two women squeal in reaction you guys as you rush under the door what are you guys doing as you glance over you can see what appears to be a small jeweled blade that is hidden underneath one of the cushions there it's a curved dagger that comes to a gradual point okay so mark down jeweled dagger in your equipment okay as you are beginning to go through his body you guys have rushed beneath and as you can see the dwarf hosin is walking down the hallway really quickly with his robes open you pull underneath because you had to go underneath the door to make it into the hallway you see him he's about 15 feet away and as he's walking he's looking about very nervously he's seen one of the guards is approaching and he looks back over and sees the rat scurrying down the hallway he's about 20 feet you know what let me go ahead and pull this up it'll give a good indicator of the circumstance here all right you guys are currently inspecting him at the moment as you guys are rushing through actually no he'd be back here he's just rushing past so he's 20 to 25 feet from you okay all right so you're using him as the source okay so as you un-polymorph he looks over his shoulder and sees you take this form you go ahead and cast silence which has an opposition what level spell is that 2nd-level okay cool so that creates a sphere of a 20-foot radius of silence here so he goes and he does like a hand motion nothing happens frustrated he continues to run i'm going to have you guys roll initiative 17 17 and 17 all right so you guys will both be going first but before we finish that as you guys are searching the body you hear all of a sudden the sound of some sort of scuffle a flash of some sort of energy in the hallway that's muffled between the doorway and footsteps also happening as you're just starting to get through his pockets you start hearing some sort of a scuffle outside of the room so i'll have you guys roll initiative as well all right all right so as you guys are turning we'll get to your turn in a moment tiberius and keyleth you're up first okay cool just staying where you are are you going to stay there or are you going to move right there yeah okay so you go ahead and cast hold person as the spell releases you can see the mystical shimmering cage that seems to encapsulate seems to shrug it off do you want to move or are you staying where you are all right you can get up to pretty much right adjacent to him if you want all right tiberius okay so from where you are you go ahead and you create your telekinetic force you rush out and the telekinetic force seems to have no effect on the dwarf's form do you move which you don't hear because she goes [no audio] yeah there is currently no sound coming from the center of that area she can hear you okay as you guys turn you see tiberius come rushing into the room hosin gets just out of the sphere of silence and then angrily does a motion with a hand and then-- (shouting) that'll bring us next to brother kash kashaw what do you want to do okay this is during your turn is there anything you want to do how long does it take to cast locate creature okay so you can do that so you mark that off as another casting of that spell as you rush out into the hallway and see that it's vanishing you cast the spell for a second you can see the direction of the creature is roughly ahead of you and you also see a door on the opposite side this right-hand door open and close you still have 15 feet of movement if you want to move forward okay so you'll get up to that point with your turn and you gather that that's the direction of him and that you know that's where it's going vax you're up at this point there okay so you can get up to here if you're going to use an action as well to dash okay as you go to talk to her no words come out no you're in the other room still everyone darted out and you're making your way out so go ahead and make a perception check 21 glancing about the room there doesn't appear to be anything that catches you as a trap this hallway is fairly often-traversed by the clientele of this establishment and nothing seems dangerous that would be difficult to put in the middle of a place and still run a business we're still in initiative currently for the moment just for the sake of the pacing on this okay that gets you to about there cool that ends that turn at which point three of the bouncers then start pushing through the silks one of them pushes his way here this one pushes aside and they come out weapons drawn seeing all of you there and one of them goes [no audio] that's their turn but it looks like they're ready to jump into some sort of combat circumstance that brings us to the top of the round tiberius you're up they came from the main room where the silks are that separate the hallway from the main area and you start hearing people shouting and some slight yelps and screams from the other roompeople who seem freaked out by the sudden rise in energy okay so you use your action to cast alter self you take hosin's form step out closing the door behind you how did he sound the guards look over confused and we heard there was a-- make a deception check the guards look at each other all right but if anything happens again there's a problem let us know we'll be at the ready they sheathe their weapons and look untrustingly to the rest of your group with your weapons currently drawn and step back-- they disappear back into the main room and they start calming down some of the other patrons who are starting to peek around them trying to see what's going on the action some look smiling and curious to see what's happening and they're go back to your tables it's fine there's no problem and they disperse the energy okay to about there make a perception check put it away watch as the dice just like turns to dust exactly you glance about the room as you're walking forward carefully looking at the floorboards looking at the tapestries on the walls looking for anything that would be out of sorts and your eyes very keen to find anything out of the ordinary the room thankfully does not appear to have anything specifically trapped it seems fairly safe yeah door to the right door to the left i would say with a natural 20 yes the doors both also seem to be functional doors not designed with any sort of trap attached okay listen to it perception roll seems fairly quiet you guys are not you guys are not currently in initiative because you're not in the thick of battle you managed to disperse the conflict all right you step to the other door you guys want to do anything else while you're waiting on him 19 listening you hear what sounds like a slight (creak) sound some sort of a scooting of wood on wood and then silence okay make a strength roll this would be straight strength okay you slam your foot into the door oh that was the foot that you just got healed oh that's going to bruise that's really going to bruise okay go for it and roll what did you roll i'm going to test this theory i'm going to trade you for now and i'm going to leave you with that dice and see if it has any impact whatsoever which is very possible but there needs to be-- all right so as you pull back the axe you actually swing wildly backward nearly hitting vax in the process you have to dodge out of the way as the axe embeds itself into the wood behind you axe is stuck okay you unclasp as you do you feel your throat seize suddenly as the cold liquid tends to freeze up what is normally a very warm and very fire-breeding interior to your throat and it thaws slowly and as you exhale you can see the mist and suddenly your muscles pulse with energy and you feel like your physical form is embodied strength far more than you've ever felt in your body before there's now the angriest dwarf right now clutching two daggers as you get down with your thieves' tools all right the door swings open without issue it's one of the easier jobs you've had you push open the door and find your way into what looks like a very well-adorned bedroom there is a small table on the side where there are some books stacked up there's a dresser on the far end that's closed there is a canopy bed set up there is a small end-table on the side and the rest of the room has a nice circular rug that's thrown across the center and there are no windows currently to this room okay all right we're currently hitting the one minute 15 second mark haven't quite pulled it out of the wood yet do you wish to enter the room okay you're keeping an eye out and you do see that there's one of the guards just to the side who's just keeping an eye looking over carefully you guys make a perception check looking around the room you see there is no movement there are no curtains on the walls there is the rug and most everything else in here seems to be perfectly still you catch what looks like a little bit of movement of the canopy bed the material that's on top there's a slight sway to it that comes to stillness you just barely catch with your keen half-elven eye okay (bam) click the boots of haste you run and charge up into the bed and stab upward into the canopy the material is torn asunder this very fine probably imported silk is carved into three separate ribbons and falls gently onto the cushion of the bed proper revealing the hardwood ceiling above you 14 looking about it's solid wood you can move your fingers along and you're standing on the bed you can just get it within reach and feeling along the board it's all pretty solid okay keeping an eye out you pull your axe free into the hallway door in front of you not a lot of strength you pull it out and try the best you can to save some grace that ceiling looks pretty solid go for it you step over you glance past keyleth you glance over and you're more distracted by the fact that keyleth is doing this awkward field goal thing in the door to you for no reason and you forget what you were in the middle of doing there appears to be no exit from the ceiling you may you push past the confused cleric you pull the rug revealing a wooden floor plain slats you were never a fan of elves or half-elves before but this one's really starting to dig into you a little 20 you pull the rug back there's nothing there and you look about at the rest of the folks with a heavy sigh but the rug was on the right track everyone was keeping high looking beneath the bed you can see what looks to be in the shadow some little bit of elevated wood that catches your attention okay well it's a good thing you rolled high enough perception because as you spider underneath your first hand goes underneath and you nearly tumble and you catch yourself there is a five-foot-wide hole in the ground right beneath this bed and as you catch yourself you can feel a little bit of wind slowly drifting up from underneath there's some sort of airflow coming up from underneath this bed where this hole is and you feel over and you can see that little bit of wood that you saw looking forward is the top of a makeshift ladder that is currently fastened to the side of this tunnel that disappears beneath the room it is pitch black you can see with the dim light from your low-light vision a little ways into it about 20 or so feet from the angle you're at because you're not looking directly in and even just glancing over the side it continues down for quite a while independently yes one person would go down it would be single file of course because it's a tight tunnel darkvision you can see within a short distance of pitch black and then a larger distance at low light so yeah all right so we'll put in order here who's going down next all right and after vax keyleth that's weird tiberius okay as your form shimmers for a second and you see-- you notice this too kashaw-- his scales almost seem to protrude into earthy spikes and then form and solidify almost like his body becomes its own suit of armor okay as you do even with the encumbrance of the armor you're wearing you feel like your form is a little more agile and you're ready for anything that might try and stop your passage you guys begin making your way down with thorbir leading the way you descend for a good three to four minutes you gather probably a hundred feet or more down rung by rung and there are a few that you reach that are a little rickety about a hundred feet down one hits your foot and snaps but you manage to catch yourself on it but you get the feeling this ladder is probably not meant to hold someone of your heavy physical form largesse you could use yes one by one you make your way down until eventually you're you begin to see towards the edge of your darkvision floor finally begins to appear and rise towards you you step off the ladder into what appears to be a small circular area that leads into another ten-foot-by-ten-foot tunnel ten by 15 foot up and continues forward this is very natural carved earth it's not smoothed stone it just looks like a tunnel that was mined out of the floor it is still dark there is no light source currently and you all eventually make your way down you can't see anything mr human you are in pitch-black darkness reach down yeah you manage to find a couple of small stones so you reach down and you find a stone you pick it up you begrudgingly grab your holy symbol and as you begin to recite your cantrip incantation a flash of white light comes gleaming off the top of the dragonborn sorcerer's staff that's true one of the daggers is now glowing the jeweled one twice as pretty when it's emanating torchlight one direction okay so we'll say for the sake of marching order who all is going in after thorbir in what order all right following thorbir okay 15 feet behind all right and keyleth you continue up that way all right so that'll be the marching order this would be more tracking if you're looking for footprints so that'd be wisdom survival eight okay it's hard to tell it looks like this area is not heavily traversed and what little sign of footprints there are scattered enough that it's hard to make out a specific print but i mean they have been traveled before 22 all right as you guys are walking forward and going through this you get about 40 feet forward before you catch that there is a slight divot a small drop in the dirt and one looks like a section of intentionally placed plate of some kind are you checking to see how it works to disarm it okay that would be with your thieves' tools so this would be a dexterity plus your thieves' tools so plus seven 19 okay as you go to the plate you stop and look up at the walls to the side and to each side of the wall you can see these tiny little holes these little quarter-sized gold-piece-sized tunnels bored multiple places on both sides of this wall and you take the plate you realize this is a pressure plate-based trap and taking one dagger you slightly lift it the second one you eventually find beneath where the trigger apparatus is and you gingerly cut each part of these spring-loaded triggers until eventually the plate rises more and more and more and you remove the last bit the plate tips over and the trap itself is disarmed all righty there is that all right pushing forward continuing for another 30-40 feet do you want to check traps again 12 okay pushing forward for a period of time there doesn't appear to be any change there are no more divots you're keeping a very close eye for the traps and as you're walking forward with your axe as you're stepping forward you get this weird tickle across your nose like a spider web of some kind that catches you and you instinctively reach up and brush it away from your nose as your finger presses against it it's much sturdier than a spider web it's a metallic wire and as you push away (tink) you hear that slight noise tiberius behind you you hear a grinding of stone and a loud slam sounds like something extremely heavy just dropped behind you you guys glance over your shoulder and you see what looks to be a fairly rounded boulder-- well alter self is gone if you're casting stoneskin because that's a concentration spell oh that but that only carries it for a few rounds it's been a longer time than that but yeah don't worry about that but the stone boulder just-- picking up speed with the slow decline of this room all of you guys what are you doing you're bolting forward you cast fly pushing forward and you guys get a little speed but you've noticed the boulder's started to gather steam as it continues down and the pathway you guys are running is going at a heavier and heavier decline as you push forward okay go ahead and make a-- actually no this is interesting let me see if slow would have a direct effect on this boulder that's something that happens right now that i didn't consider i love when that happens unfortunately it is not a creature and actually it affects the physical metabolism and muscle use of an individual this is just a solid structured object as you release the spell you see the air around it poof and drift a little slower and the boulder seems to stutter for a moment but continues to push forward that was your action i assume you're going full sprint okay so pushing forward you all push forward tiberius who has stopped to turn around and cast the spell is not at a full dash so he trails behind the boulder is currently gaining on tiberius so you turn around you're continuing to fly forward so you guys just turn to push forward tiberius the boulder is nearly upon you now what are you going to do it is about ten to five feet away from you you can see it cresting-- okay all right you burned that spell all of a sudden the room behind you out of the stone pockets of iron ore or whatever material is beneath the earth behind you is brought together into a liquid mass and then shoots up in the center of the hallway behind you with each one of these pillars slamming into the wall you guys hear these three multiple explosions behind you and for a brief second you fear the worst for tiberius' current status immediately following that you hear the impact of stone against iron and you see the obelisks bend with this horrible creaking sound the sound of the rolling has stopped okay you guys continue moving forward the decline getting a little more difficult to traverse as your feel yourselves now having to feel your arms across the wall or use it for balance to make sure you don't just fall also the moisture in the air begins to grow more and more thick some source of liquid some point down in the future has permeated what was originally dusty dry air with liquid of some kind and the air itself grows more and more rancid in scent it smells like refuse or rot it's hard to describe and it's old it's musky it's terrible and it grows stronger the farther you go as you continue pushing forward you also feel that the dusty ground is becoming more and more mud-like a little bit yeah you spent all morning treating it and it's undoing everything you did it's just a tunnel into darkness right now from what you can tell there is no plant life at all whatsoever the moisture gathered on the walls you can now see are dripping the condensation has given this tunnel more of a mineral-pocketed look and the ground is getting more sludgy with each step it feels like it's chiseled-out hard earth that has been packed and supported with either small wooden things that are inset to make sure it doesn't collapse at some point a lot of that has either fallen through well if you do any severe damage to its structure it would probably be a bad idea it's not a mine shaft okay make another survival check actually as a dwarf i'll give you advantage on that so roll again that makes sense this is your place sure 21 okay as a pre-existing member of the slayer's take and the man who was currently set to be the leader of your group you're beginning to wonder if this guild is the kind of thing you really want to be joining at this point true but looking down you can see there are no tracks actually this line has not been traversed in quite some time and the smoothness of it says that whatever came through here did not leave any footprints no also as you guys continue you reach a point where especially with your heavy armor-- go ahead and make a dexterity saving throw 13 okay you're stepping forward keeping an eye out and you look back at the group and take a step and your foot slips out from under you (smack) you hit the slime and begin to slide down the tunnel as part of the decline you guys watch as your cleric goonies-style slide vanishes into the darkness kashaw has vanished into the darkness and you hear (screams) as you lunge through the air because you're flying still oh then yeah it's faded so you just slide after tiberius slides after body first across the slime all right three of your party have just vanished into the darkness hoping that fate will take them to some place of pillows and feathers all right you guys both make dexterity saving throws wow you manage to slowly make your way down this tunnel almost-- what's that it doesn't matter you jumped into this you intentionally fell yeah you guys slowly begin to make your way down the tunnel as you can't even hear them anymore you guys one after another sliding down the slide and grime going past you you smell in the air what smells like vegetable matter that's been long long falling in compost along with what smells like rancid feces mixed with mold it's this terrible continuously growing scent until eventually out of the darkness because you're ahead of everyone you're outside of the range of his light spell the slime stops and there's just air and a few moments of this air rushing past you as you're immediately stopped with a wet sound as you impact hard into some sort of heavy spongy matter thankfully because it's spongy you only suffer four points of damage so you can mark that somewhere on the sheet mainly just from the way you landed and your armor sticks into where the plates are and just the impact was bad for your body but you're now in darkness looking up sitting on what feels like you're on some sort of strange compost heap looking up you see in the darkness this small light begin to appear and you see this dragonborn-- you roll out of the way as the two of you scream down with the light that now shines you can see this is a cylindrical cistern of some kind it is a tunnel that is very tall and you both impact into the same heap you try and clean what you can but you guys are like knee to nearly waist deep as you get up and move around-- your faces are clean and it's a terrible smell this room is quite honestly a mixture of long-rotting food of dried vegetation that has been discarded here for whatever reason a lot of it's hay and thatch that has been just rotting and molding for god knows how many years and quite honestly feces from some indeterminate entity as you guys are doing this you guys are making your way down the tunnel and you have a ways to catch up to them you do hear (squeaking) you hear this and as you look around with the light you can see little bits of movement leaping through this heap then suddenly thrusting out of some of this heap you see a large arm or tendril brownish-tan in color just slams onto the side of it at which point you now see emerging from it two of these giant tendrils which at the end are covered in these long teeth-like spines grasping the sides of this stone cylinder pulling itself out of the refuse shaking as it pulls itself forward you now see the body that contains it with one third central tendril that rises up what looks like creepy eyes or nose-holes that are looking around and glancing at both of you and you see emerging beneath that the body this large eight- to ten-foot-thick wide covered-in-slime body that is this gargantuan toothy maw that opens up with a tongue that lolls out and that's where we're going to go ahead and end today's session we'll pick it up next week right where we left off you guys slowly making your way down the tunnel we'll pick up with that next time yep toothy maw that's all you know and some sort of strange sound and other small things moving i do and for that prize i give you a fancy yellow d20 shit yeah how did that happen yeah yeah i tried to tell you not
