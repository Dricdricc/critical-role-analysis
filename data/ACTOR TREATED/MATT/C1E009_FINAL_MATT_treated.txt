way of getting to them check it out anyway so into the game let me go ahead and get the music going because i think that's a required aspect of this as far as i'm concerned so as a quick overview as to where we were the party essentially was given a quest from the capital city of emon to find the missing folk hero lady kima of vord a halfling paladin very well known who had gone missing while on a pilgrimage vision quest over the past year she had been missing for a number of weeks nearly months at this point and you were sent to the dwarven city of kraghammer to find and bring her back safely after going to the city you discover that she had delved into the mines seeking some sort of extremely dark evil that was seated somewhere deep beneath kraghammer proper in searching for her you managed to find your way through the mines into the entrance passage into the underdark the underdark which is a very scary place you've encountered a number of subterranean beasts and creatures some of which are unnaturally mutated or altered by some sort of magic you cannot place upon going through these caverns a few battles with duergar the ashen-skinned evil subterranean dwarves-- further subterranean dwarves i guess you'd say and encountered your first mind flayers illithids which seem to have allied strangely with the duergar normally enemies by nature they're working together under what you discovered in sense is a common enemy referred to as k'varn nothing really is known of k'varn other than it has a great power and has united these two forces for some nefarious purpose apparently these abominations and these strange mutations you've encountered these experiments also seem to have been created by k'varn though no one knows quite why or how as you traversed down you managed to befriend a arcanist mind flayer that was cast out from the colony named clarota who has aided you under the intent that you would help him free his people of the slavery of k'varn and release the mind flayers to their own normal state of mind and you've made your way to the duergar fortress emberhold found and released lady kima who underwent many many weeks of torturous experiences to come through still firm of mind and ready to kick some ass through a very painful battle in the emberhold you managed to pull your party out only a few of them turned to stone and with a foot burned off (all laugh) (laughs) so get on enchanting that tiberius grog-jack whenever he gets taken it gives a little beeper in your pocket so the party then in trying to locate grog's position found their way delving past the lava fall-based element of the obsidian rock duergar underdark deeper into discovering this cursed pit of undeath bone shards and glass upon traversing it they encountered one of these abominations that you've seen traces of left before this weird half partial elven partial tentacle monstrosity that slashed through your party nearly killed trinket but was defeated by you you managed to make your way across this bone field and discover what appears to be a camp across a number of pillars in the distance vax went ahead and stealthed up looked over and saw that there was a camp of duergar and apparently the surviving queen ulara giving them orders next to grog who is currently bolted by iron bands to some sort of a cart that they've been dragging him through this tunnel passage with and that is where we have left off so all right so tiberius roll a stealth check 16 okay so as tiberius coasts up along the back portion of vax's arrival point you notice one of the duergar looks over his shoulder in your direction and begins to make a few steps in that direction all right so the duergar continues to move forward towards the edge of the rock all right so the rest of you guys go ahead and roll stealth and you got one of them all right so the rest of you it doesn't matter at this point okay so the rest of you begin trudging in down this tunnel towards the edge clarota and kima are (laughs) holding up the back rear end as scanlan approaches the duergar immediately turns around all rightsimultaneously as you approach the duergar looks behind gives you a glance and you can see his eyes normally pupil-less eyes of the ashy-skinned duergar are now glowing with an odd dull green color that you haven't seen in duergar previously and he starts rushing towards you he's going to make a simultaneous round rushing up to you for an attack while you release your two attacks against him and you release your dagger this calls for a music change okay good to know all right the first duergar swings at you with his war hammer to you scanlan that comes down with a 12 versus your armor class yeah you pull back and the giant war hammer swings past you and you duck out of the way thankfully though the duergar are relatively small you're much smaller and as a gnome you slip right out of the path of the actual hammer blow your first arrow misses second one you said hits 25 definitively hits go ahead and roll damage eight damage all right so after he swings past scanlan who ducks out of the way one arrow (whizzing sound effect) just cruises over his head and you hear it scattering and clattering against the rocks in the distance he looks over in your direction as the second one just grazes his shoulder you can see a little bit of blood begin to spill but it doesn't even turn his head towards the wound he's still just glaring at you angrily while you throw your dagger from behind him not even aware of your presence currently yeah we're buying you new dice next week so as you pull tiberius back clutching the front of his snout keeping him quiet you pull a dagger out toss it in the air catch it and fling it at full speed striking true go ahead and roll damage with sneak attack bonus also multiplied because of the crit all right so as he turns and the arrow strikes off his shoulder and he glares at you vex he pulls back his hammer again looking down at scanlan coming down for a blow to basically bash his skull in but he stops suddenly as you see this blade protrude from the front of his skull his glowing eyes fade back to a dull pale whitish color and his body slumps onto the ground as your dagger magically returns to your hand from below duergar down ulara queen ulara and the rest of you are you all staying where you are are you coming forward with scanlan okay keyleth is no longer keyleth and then-- (swoosh sound effects) fades underneath the earth somewhere just slips into it almost like sand through an hourglass you just vanish beneath the surface of the rock kima steps forward making a point to step angrily onto the corpse of the duergar you hear the crunching of bone and metal as she steps over his corpse percy you're approaching as well okay so about there all right clarota's going to move off to the side here and pike is going to come and get the center point she feels the most applicable to heal yes you don't see right now grog which is right over here okay all right so tiberius also vanishes from view you glance over your shoulder vax and notice that tiberius is just gone just (whoosh) vanished all right so as you shouted this out the secondary duergar now turns and first off make a persuasion check well no in this case intimidation i think is what this is going to be i'll say okay because it is a different skill so yeah you'll get about there with this round 22 all right as you shout this the duergar grabs this warpick from his side looks at you angrily and begins to step forward as a giant grizzly bear and the rest of the party filters up behind you in full flying v formation he puts his pick to his side and yells off his shoulder my queen we've got company as he does the flaps of the far end of the tent here open up there's a dwarf there not a duergar but a dwarf that is standing there to the side that steps out of the way and queen ulara steps out as well you see her angrily look off to the side (sighs angrily) well then it appears that we have some business to discuss and she begins to step past the front of the fire way stopping right next to the fire pit keeping a good 15-foot distance with her arms crossed the dwarf comes and flanks her on this side and you now see-- while i cannot seem to find the figure for the life of me right now to represent it we'll use this for the time being there is an elf also flanking her normal looking elf dressed in what looks like a fine chainmail attire longsword at the side so there's an elf and a dwarf both flanking they are at her side like they're ready to defend her talk small annoying creature and perhaps it'll delay the inevitable hold that thought just for a second percy go ahead and roll a perception check okay continue all right behind where this pillar is in the ground all right so at that response and you're noticing now as you're getting a better glance at the queen too the normally white pale duergar eyes have a strange green glow-ish hue to them as do the two individuals to the right and left of her and she just looks you square in the face you took my king from me came and slayed him in his own throne room you took something i love i take something you love he's mine now and i'm bringing him to his greater destiny at which point a loud horrendous streaking sound pierces the ears of everyone in this vicinity as appearing out of a ripple of energy a once-invisible mind flayer goes cascading out a mind blast in a cone that just tears through the entire group here scanlan vex pike as well trinket percy go ahead and roll an intelligence saving throw yes roll your saving throw for intelligence all right percy yes you do okay vex okay and so you double over clutching your skull as the pain is too much to bear and you find yourself unable to actually draw commands to your muscles for them to function you are currently stunned roll for trinket trinket falls to the ground with this horrible (bear groan) sound digging his nose into the actual dirt to try and find a way to escape this piercing mental agony this psychic damage both of you guys take 22 points of psychic damage by the way pike also okay now we roll initiative folks because stuff has begun no essentially this triggers the combat now this was an immediate occurrence now we're going into initiative order i would say for the two that didn't act this turn you guys can have advantage on the initiative roll because you guys have been holding your actions so tiberius you can also have advantage on your initiative roll since you guys were holding off 21 you are stunned currently you still roll initiative so we have the order that you go in all right we are guys hang on so 20 to 15 18 all right wow we got some good initiative rolls guys good job okay 15 to ten there we go oh yeah kima also fell stunned to that unfortunately all right that brings us to i think that's everyone's initiative right yeah yeah everyone's in all right cool so top of the round percy you're up first oh did you not print them out monster manual here we go (funny accent) see this comes in handy more often than you'd think of the the mind flayer over here okay so you whip around he's there in your face go ahead and make-- you're using your action surge to fire two additional times you said okay wow four rounds go for an attack 13 unfortunately misses form shifts (whooshing sounds) and you can feel the psychic energy of its oppressive mental force causing your hand to miss its aim with each pull of the trigger 19 does hit okay third attack spin the barrel again on the pepperbox (gunshot) all righty that's doubled with the critical yeah or roll and double the dice number but that's fine okay unfortunately so the first one hits the second one actually clips part of its chest and you can see as it tries to use its psychic abilities to resist the bullet it still pierces its chest in the side missing everything vital still causing it to (makes painful hissing sound) sucks in the air for a moment okay so going this way okay cool probably should get out the laser pointers you guys don't know you haven't seen him yet yeah on a cart you haven't checked tiberius you're up next (laughs) okay where are you throwing it right here okay so as they're all sitting there looking ready to pounce for this series of battle all of a sudden there's a slight streak of reddish energy in the distance as you all are watching it looks almost like the fire pit behind them just explodes in this giant fiery ball of red angry magical fury so go ahead and roll your 8d6 damage 31 points of damage okay queen ulara you notice as the duergar are generally considered-- as this blasts in this area as well-- both her and the duergar make their saving throw they have magic resistance innately against it yeah they're hardy creatures man however the elf on this side ends up being thrown to the side and its entire body gets thrown about 20-30 feet across from the force of the explosion landing on the ground lifeless next to you (skidding noise) on the ground a burnt cinder the dwarf takes the brunt of it as well appears to still be alive but looks very horribly burned and is looking at its hands now like (pained grunting sound) barely standing before we get to that point grog you also take that damage because you said you threw it in the fire there grog's right there on a cart i pointed here be specific next time but yeah that's okay he can take it okay all right go for it so as you coalesce this arcane energy into this blue cold freezing plume of moisture in your hand it forms into this giant jagged blade of ice and you chuck it in a straight line go ahead and roll a d20 plus your spell attack modifier 19 does hit even with her mage armor okay to her and everyone-- go for it right yeah what was the damage on the fireball 31 31 points of fire damage to both of them all right well for one four damage is enough as the shards of ice from the back of ulara's torso explode into this spray of jagged ice chunks it pierces continuously the right side of this dwarf who then falls to the ground grasping at his wounds and trying to stand to his feet before falling over unconscious right there (singing) mysterious fireball ice dagger source okay you come to consciousness in extreme pain as your entire body is immersed briefly in flame we'll get to that in a second vex vax sorry right here all right right roll a stealth check okay in theory combat already began when he attacked the rest of your party combat's begun sorry correct but they've already attacked half your party with the mind blast so in theory the battle's already begun all right that definitively hits yes 36 points of damage all right so the mind flayer which is after it finishes a mind blast you can see it beginning to eye what its next target would be as percy goes running off to the side it looks over at its three freshly-stunned prey and begins to lumber towards what looks to be either pike or vex but before it gets a chance to advance though (whistling sound) out of nowhere your dagger (impact sound) pierces it in its shoulder it looks at it and it grasps for it as its hand tries to pull the dagger out the dagger disappears in a plume of black shadow energy back into your hand as you throw the other dagger 19 does also hit all right the other dagger the creature actually puts up a little bit of a psychic field for a second and it stops its momentum it does still manage to strike it but with nowhere near the damage you were hoping it would cool that ends your turn that brings us to scanlan the mind flayer the queen and this duergar here that has not acted yet (laughing) okay yeah it's a touch spell all right so what's your spell dc i assume you're using your hand cone as you charge forward you pull out your enchanted hand cone and shout the incantation towards her with an angry glare it had a dc of 19 for that okay even with her spell resistance she does not resist it is it an intelligence or wisdom save it should say what saving throw it is i will do this for you on a charisma saving throw or be banished so if it was on anything but a charisma saving throw she would have shrugged it charisma she does not have in spades as you reach out she pulls back and you see her beginning to form this crackling bolt of energy you've seen once before in the throne room that shot out and hit multiple members of your party once for a severe amount of damage this would have been a very dangerous round if you hadn't connected with her right in front of her clavicle she looks at you with this look of confusion and completely caught-off-guard frustration before her entire form (sucking sound) blinks out of existence and is no longer visible on the board yeah all right so grog as the flames die down you look over and watch scanlan rush up and completely as far as you know disintegrate the duergar queen who took you and has been torturing you these past few days-- with that he looks over to you and gives you a little wink and a smile go ahead and take an inspiration dice which for him is now a d10 so you can add that inspiration die to any ability checks any skill checks saving throws all right well it would be ulara's turn she's going to go ahead and attempt to make her saving throw does not make it still somewhere in some other plane that you're unaware of keyleth it's your turn all right (crashing sound) grog you all of sudden as you look over from scanlan with this smiling face this giant mountain of rock and earth just lumbers up out of the ground you hear (makes deep gargled sounds) (laughs) it's your first time doing elemental form you're still trying to figure it out okay (laughs) he's strapped to a giant cart yeah because earth elemental so you're there now you still have about-- what's the speed of 30 so you've got about say ten more squares or i'm sorry ten more feet you can go this way all right one two all right there we go you're now being carried by this giant lumbering earth elemental that is just bringing you under its arm great vex do you make your saving throw intelligence intelligence saving throw that should be at the top 23 using your mind you shrug off the remainder of the ability that does end your turn but you're no longer stunned which is nice that's the end of your turn yes trinket as well thank you yeah so trinket's still on the ground slowly digging his nose into the dirt trying to find a way to his-- no more damage but currently is unable to function yeah very bad news okay that brings us to pike who's also going to try and make her saving throw fails it unfortunately pike dropped her shield dropped her mace and is clutching the side of her head screaming silently as the pain is wracking her brain from the inside that brings us to this duergar who's going to rush over to the one who just banished his queen and attempt to-- his physical form begins to swell with strength and frustration the duergar swings at you with his war pick that is cutting words okay so it's a 16 go ahead and roll your d10 number it's a d10 now it's a d10 now you leveled up yeah now you have yep so it's a 16 it was a four so it takes that down from a 16 to a 12 which does miss so as he rushes towards you-- he stops for a second confused he puts the war pick down for a second like wait-- argh (groans) you gnome doesn't know why he listened to you and is equally frustrated with himself now as he is you (laughs) all right that ends the duergar's turn that brings us to-- not yet this is going to be kima is going to try and make her saving throw kima does make it does shrug off the effect turns around angrily holding the greatsword that you gave her staring off at the mind flayer right there clarota however is going to go ahead and turn this way coalesce a giant ball of electrical energy into his hand and release an arcing blast of lightning energy towards this mind flayer who does make its saving throw however it's still a nice 8d6 lightning damage so 20 points of lightning damage as the blue energy arcs off and you see it grounds itself on the incline of this tunnel you guys have heading down the mind flayer visibly is burned charred wounded it looks really really rough that ends clarota's turn kima's turn back to the top of the round the mind flayer looks at its certain circumstance puts its hands together like this it seems to concentrate okay all right it's a reflex counterspell in this edition is so good all right so this would be counterspell all right counterspell so make an ability check so add a d20 plus five to it 22 that'll do it so as this entity you've seen before they tend to like create this small localized portal into some other plane and then like step through and vanish you see it begins to coalesce the same arcane energy and for a moment you see a spark of some sort of door beginning to open as tiberius steps from behind the rock releases this torrent of sparkling arcane energy that closes the gate entirely and the mind flayer for a second looks confused before it across the way to wherever it came from and sees nothing and is going to turn tail and run well yeah essentially levitating away it's more its a gliding it's a (whoosh) about five or six inches off the ground percy you're up a duergar okay hard to see him right now there's a big tent in the way if you want to take a step forward continue moving okay so as you turn pull your gun off to the side (explosion) offhand fire-- 18 does hit nine damage all right all right 18 that also hits all right so as you turn the corner you fire once take another step forward go (click) click over the next barrel fire a second time the duergar which was attacking you-- you see part of it's still burnt from the fireball which was tossed the first round-- he's frustrated and angry that you caused him to somehow lower his guard when he attacked you last you see him gearing up for another two-handed strike down at this tiny gnome character in front of him the first blow hits the war pick knocking it out of his hands he looks over confused at you as the second blast hits him right in the side of the face completely destroying this side of his head entirely this wet gurgle as the duergar slumps to the ground almost on top of you but you step out of the way as his body (boof) hits the ground right there that's percy's turn tiberius over here okay so as you fire this beam over here it detonates in the distance safely far enough away from the party go ahead and roll damage for that fireball as the mind flayer that is drifting away glances over its shoulder you see its greenish glowing eyes go wide for a second cartoon-style oh shit and with its advantage against the spell-- it's a dexterity save correct doesn't make it 19 all right 19 damage okay as the mind flayer's drifting away you guys see this arc of red beaming energy (whoosh) off in the distance (explosion) you see rocks cascade off the top of the wall hitting the ground with a force as the entire tunnel shakes and rocks as the smoke and the flames dissipate all you see is this pile of blackened creature on the ground from where the mind flayer once stood grog while they're all doing this what do you want to do yeah these iron bands are across your entire body they've shrugged it off by now ulara still can't make her saving throw for the life of her even with resistance oh yeah as you guys approach and begin making your way up to the front here grab these duergar over here okay all right so as the rest of you all slowly trudge up and gather around this vicinity there all right so so you go ahead and you try and pull the bars off is that what you're doing what are you doing they're iron bands that surround you yeah there's an intricate lock mechanism all right so so the earth elemental lumbers forth and presents the cart on the ground in front of you (impact sound) one of the wheels (breaking noise) cracks a little bit in the process 17 okay they appear to be just general locks there is a lock on them yes so go ahead and make your-- 19 (tink) the band that's part way across the waist opens freely on the hinge on the one side yeah that was the one so go ahead and make an athletics check i mean there's multiple bands around you across your shoulders your torso your legs your ankles okay you get a second band you rolled a 25 and marisha do you want to go ahead and make an athletics check as well or that would be a strength check for you for your form your elemental form to try and pull the bands off of grog unless you want to do something else pike comes over and spends a 3rd-level healing spell okay trinket heals 21 yeah between the two of you over the next few seconds or so you pick the next one and with that remaining push you force the rest of the bands off grog you make your way up to your feet there we go at that point in time there's a slight ripple in the space right before this fire pit and in that place ulara queen ulara reappears again yeah okay all right as you finish the spell you can see this glow of yellowish holding energy almost like these mystical shackles begin to tighten around her and then fade unaffected okay so you go ahead and loose your arrow so go ahead and roll for your attack all right 29 okay that does hit you can see now the second set of shackles spins around her she brings her hand up like this and they just scatter around her resisting a second hold person now all her saving throws are coming through if you want to so damage on the attack oh there you go see that chatroom 16 damage all right okay so go ahead and make an athletics check i know it's just a strength check then roll a d20 and add your strength modifier 23 you bound up behind her and as she looks over her shoulder the arrow piercing her shoulder she's looking pretty rough you can see the blood beginning to pool underneath her robe there her eyes go wide at which point the giant arms go (impact noise) behind her and the earth elemental lifts her off her feet (groans in pain) you can see her now her feet dangling angrily in the air a couple of seconds pass before she (pants) all right so let's make a deal shall we valid point what purpose do i serve you should let me go are you rolling persuasion for this she goes i know many things and she leans forward a little bit and then spits right in your face clarota at which steps forward and brings his hand up as clarota steps forward putting his hand out this voice echoes through all of your minds communally now tell us what you know and you see his eyes flicker with a strange blue energy and you see ulara's eyes glaze over and fill with the same blue arcane energy that clarota was briefly having drift out of his eyes ulara stops struggling and the mouth goes into this weird grin for a second and just calmly says liberation liberation is what it brings us liberation from physical limitation liberation from the pain of the light and she looks up as she says that we all shall rise k'varn the guiding darkness the sun shall hold no sway and we shall walk the surface once again k'varn came to us showed us how through unification we could be better than we ever were k'varn-- at which point there's a shudder in her body and her eyes go from this strange blue color to this strange swimming black that covers the entirety of each eye at which point she shakes for a second her shoulders shift and you clutch her in your arms as you do you see the blackness now has that same green glow that the rest of them had but it's framing the pools of shadow that her eyes have become her jaw falls slack for a second and this voice comes through ah there (chuckles) there we are i can see you all so clearly you'd be surprised dragonborn (all gasp) word has reached my ears but to see you to look upon you is everything come you are close yes come to me as my guests i invite you the temple doors are open i'd like to see you in person you're already on the right path come to me you are my treasured guests at which point the blackness in the eyes begins to intensify and begin to spill like black tears from the face her body shudders before the back convulses and then falls limp a little bit of smoke rising from the mouth she has definitely given up the ghost all right so as you guys glance around you find-- other than the usual assortment of objects you find are the armor the duergar the emberhold make okay you go and check out the charred remains they are charred they are remains there is what looks to be about 86 gold on the body but most anything of use has been charred or destroyed there is the remnants of a breastplate that is burned over that most of the mind flayers use as a basic form of protection as you inspect her body as the earth elemental drops her (boof) with a thud to the ground-- okay you do notice there's a silver circlet across her forehead that does give off a magical aura she carries on her one viscous reddish potion that is familiar to you in the healing accoutrement of various potions you've had in the past it is a potion of greater healing there is another potion that has almost a blue frosty color to it as you take the vial from where it sits in the rest the actual glass that contains the liquid has a layer of frost crystals around it make an investigation check he's almost done with checking the queen yes you can (laughs) okay what'd you roll on investigation 13 okay you can't seem to find anything out of the remains of the mind flayer unfortunately okay (shoomf) the earth around your form seems to crumble like a layer of rock it hits the ground and dissolves into the stone beneath you you check inside it looks like there's some traveling blankets some furs you do also find a small case that contains a bunch of empty vials there is one filled vial a very large vial and you find-- you can't have it with an ioun stone either by the way it's one or the other it's a head slot correct okay anyone who wears it it's great for a lot of people pike comes up and says i'm sorry i'm sorry grog goes over and places her hands upon you as she's about to kima pushes her aside and says i've got this walks up and you can see this divine glowing energy it fills her hands she reaches out and touches you and this warmth fills-- this warmth fills your torso using her lay on hands ability lady kima of vord heals you for 38 points of damage you look through the bodies it looks like most of their adornments other than the natural armor and weapons they have nothing of particular interest make an investigation check okay 16 yeah you're not able to really pull anything from their bodies unfortunately however after kima finishes healing you kima walks over to the dwarf corpse as you're inspecting it and gives it a look-over and shakes her head (sighs) this was one of my companions well judging by the scars across his body he had already been made a thrall of one of the illithid most likely the one that we finished back there there wasn't much to really bring him back at this point i fear and as you guys all look at grog now you can see him he has hundreds upon hundreds of small scars across his body fresh wounds that have just barely sealed it looks like they've done a number on him with a bunch of small blades hooks razors-- it's hard to tell but he is coated with small cuts you guys can short rest if you want to heal yourselves with your hit dice kima's with you kima's still looking over the body of the dwarf that's fallen go ahead and roll persuasion okay kima gives you a concerned look and goes-- oh dear no please and the two of you begin to walk away for a moment away from the party briefly while the rest of you are left behind okay things are getting a little weird none of this is normal at all we're all under duress we're under a lot of duress the more and more things-- people have emotions and i understand that it's all right and she pulls the leather gloves off that are part of the full leather armor set and begins to inspect you in the meantime you guys can continue your discussion okay a 14 all right as you finish your statement as well keyleth clarota steps up and says i wholeheartedly agree she is unstable and cannot be trusted in her state we made a deal i'm not sure what this is i'm sorry kima immediately turns around and says okay and walks back to the group kima steps in at this point and says i agree (sigh) we have quite a journey ahead of us at which point clarota pipes up and says indeed we're not too far from yug'voril let us rest what for she puts her hand up and in a matronly way it's honestly not a worry war is stressful and all of us have been through a lot for this experience i understand i've been where you've been and it's not uncommon to question everything around you and with good reason that's what keeps you alive were you to believe every person that crossed your path you would not have made it past your 15th season i can assure you as best as i can that i mean the best for all of us i just know that if we don't do what we're here to do far more people will suffer than the few i've brought down here to protect me and for me to protect i'm not asking for your trust i'm just asking for your patience you caught me at a rough time well thank you that's bedtime is what that is all right everyone let's go ahead and find ourselves a rest all right so as everyone goes to camp for the evening we are going to go ahead and take a break potty break for folks we'll be back here in about ten or so minutes all right guys awesome see you in a little bit [dramatic music] welcome back everyone we've been sufficiently rested first we're going to say thank you and welcome to all our new viewers welcome to critical role and all of its chaos a bunch of voice actors playing dungeons & dragons i also want to congratulate the first winner of our tabletop promo kit this evening zargross won well done we'll be giving out another one at 2750 so 2750 subscribers and someone else in the chat room will win another promo kit so that's cool also t-shirts on sale as of today they are a limited run for two weeks we are trying to get to our goal of 1000 before that's done hopefully so you can just scroll down to the bottom of the twitch page you'll find a button there that will get you to that shop so go for it all right so the 826 donation's working again yay let us begin so after an evening's rest taking your respective turns keeping watch all of you come to consciousness once more clarota anxiously sits at the edge of the camping facility looking deeper into the tunnel ahead keeping his eyes peeled in the darkness anyway you guys eventually come to consciousness and finish cooking whatever bits of food you've managed to muster at this point in time in the underdark yeah it is doughnuts under-doughnuts by the way all of those who contributed to getting us food tonight thank you so much clarota seems slightly impatient as everyone is waking up and goes come ahead we shall find it's yug'voril beautiful city of secrets without the colony i serve no purpose i am wandering aimless i wish to return to the elder brain no they threw me out long before for my gift and you see a little spark of arcane blue filter out of his fingers in the air and then (poof) small spark it is an abomination to my people i am considered anathema but to save them to save my city then they shall have me back a hero they will i can sense it thank you forward we will find shrouded in the forest of fungus our destination come it begins to drift down into the dark tunnel further below it's how we get around dragonborn his tentacles flicker at his face for a second as you guys continue forward in silence k'varn seems to be more chatty than usual almost like the proximity is-- this is excitement to him instinctually i meant clarota it's been a long week i know sorry as clarota drifts our people we are a structured society together we provide for each other broken into creeds we function rather pleasantly and he drifts forward again at full pace it's inherent much like your gifts it's just how we get around all right it'd be a history check like a super-super history check 13 the name is as fresh to you as it was the day you heard it she walks and she's using it almost like a stick in the dirt as she takes a step you know it's served its purpose so far i just (sighs) i wish i wish that vault wasn't lost leather isn't my idea of defensive perhaps certainly (laughs) she looks to you specifically (laughs) perhaps we'll find a more modest place to swap but yes i agree some of you summon the stapler straw (laughs) all right so as you continue to press forward deeper into this tunnel network the air begins to grow steadily colder and colder the temperature it's-- you begin to see your breath a little bit in the air yeah you guys all slept overnight i mean the visual scars are still there but he's at full hit points they're healing slowly oh yes of course she comes over and you guys take a slight break as pike comes and sets you down oh i've seen worse certainly she sets the foot down she begins to gather up her runes and she's casting a 4th-level spell aye but alas she's not here sorry ashley so that would be the equivalent of about 32 hit points she's also going to attempt a medicine roll as well okay you notice there is some progress that is slow but some of the burn scarring from the dip in the magma is beginning to slowly subside fresh skin is beginning to show but it's still pretty rough k'varn resides within the city the temple i have not seen him myself since i was cast out before he took the star took my people under his spell he leans forward for a second the temple we don't know its original purpose the city we acquired we found we took root yug'voril existed long before our colony did very well he continues floating forward the air still chilly with steadily more and more moisture the rock walls become less and less jagged growing smoother from endless years of condensation mineral drip and slow erosion begin to give that smooth inner cave look to the outsides of this tunnel certainly as you're walking the group slows with you as you have to really maintain concentration on this you close your eyes and you consider you sense no sources of dragon within the radial of your ability to sense in this cavern structure subtle ones but yeah at this point beginning to notice the tunnel itself the cavern is swaying back and forth a little bit with this as opposed to a straight path the tunnel is beginning to arc left and right there's little pockets and crevices beginning to show at certain points and you start seeing small bits of bluish crystal jutting in small pockets out of cracks in the rock clarota yesterday mentioned a fungal forest starting to find bluish crystals which pike makes a motion yes i saw this in my vision too you reach out and touch the crystal as you do go ahead and-- no (all laugh) (laughs) you reach out and touch the crystal and it's cold to the touch as is most of the stone wall and you can see there's condensation on it that gets on your fingers a bit it's smooth except for the jagged points where the natural formation juts out you tug on the crystal a little bit find if there's any place there that's moveable and it's pretty solid in that rock wall no the temperature doesn't seem different at all to the air there doesn't seem to be a source at all it's the same temperature as the rest of the tunnel yeah sure all right i will say go ahead and make an arcana check as well 14 okay it's hard-pressed to find out where these crystals came from what their source is or if they naturally are here or if they're put there through some other means but the crystals do have a very very faint magical residual energy to them useless almost it's the equivalent of finding crumbs at the bottom of a cereal box it's there you can see at one point there was something magical about their presence or their creation but it is long faded when the noise dies down you gather shards and pieces probably enough to fill a small bucket you can indeed fill your small bucket should you have one that is your prerogative grog okay if you had a stick you could be a crystal hobo about a half an hour further down this tunnel both vax and vex simultaneously notice a part of the wall to the left that is actually visibly cracked and what appears to be almost a narrow passage that juts off to the left however there is a large boulder solid stone that is wedged into this apparently blocking the passage all right certainly go ahead and roll perception 20 okay both of you guys take a look there's nothing immediately dangerous at all it just looks like this rock was not naturally formed here of course it looks like it was wedged in like it was actually placed there intentionally on the strength check so as you guys are explaining this seems to be a fairly-- you don't even get to finish your sentence before grog goes-- grabs the boulder gets underneath and lifting with the knees atlas-style puts the weight on the back and (groans)-- with a resounding (scraping sound) scraping sound and a large crack some of the rocks that it's wedged in break off and tumble to the sides and you get the boulder free and you're now clutching it on top of you and it's very very heavy you lose your balance over the boulder as it's now shoved off of its axis it falls behind you slamming into the wall blocking half the passage the passage you guys were going down immediately you can still pass it you just have to walk around it and you may have tweaked something in your back a little in the process trinket gets up pushes on you with the bear claws you can hear the cracks you can the passage is very very thin it can maybe fit you individually it can barely fit grog when you actually go through the passage proper for a gnome yes but yeah it's pitch black going forward which means you guys can see it's equivalent of low light for you in pitch darkness about 30 feet ahead of you you can see the path continues for a little bit and then widens up into what looks like a small chamber but you'd have to get closer make a perception check about 30 35 feet back so best you can tell it just looks like a chamber and it looks like a hallway all right so as the light-- the arrow shaft vibrantly bursts into bright tiberius-created light it arcs slightly down the hallway only a 35-foot distance it goes pretty quickly and then (sound of arrow embedding itself) into what looks like a piece of rock actually wedging itself into a piece of rock before falling to the ground chipping a chunk upon impact as it hits you can see it's a small roundish oval chamber you can see what looks like small piles on the ground at the far end still hard to make out from this distance but you are welcome to enter you followed it in right you rush in first thing you understand the air smells faintly of ancient untouched dust and mildew you glance at the floor and notice what appear to be six long-dead bodies strewn across the ground skeletal and covered in webs just now vax okay go ahead and make an investigation check 19 okay as you look across the body i mean there's nothing formal about this area there's no fine chiseled structure it looks like a natural formation it just appears to have been the final destination for whoever these individuals were and you do notice the way they're adorned they were an adventuring party they were people who came down here long ago for whatever reason and the last destination was this small cavernous space there are webs on them but the webs themselves are small natural spider but you do notice that each one of their skulls has a giant hole bored into the bone itself different places in the skull anyone else want to do anything the rest of you make your way in one by one it's a small room okay you guys hang out there okay looking at it you notice that they have been here for at least 200 years two of the bodies are male humans there are two dwarven bodies one male one's female one female gnome and one half-orc okay so you enter the room roll an investigation check okay looking at her you find that most of these bodies have already been for the most part turned over and looted some of them have no armor they're either in plain clothes or it looks like their bodies have been tossed and taken whatever was on them off you do find buried in the dirt under the gnomish female what looks to be a pristine ruby worth probably quite a bit okay i'll get to you in just a second you as you're inspecting the bodies on the other side you come across the dwarven male is still fully armored actually has a golden chainmail on and is clutching what looks like a metal maul the rest of them have no armor and no weapons but this one is still fully adorned and you also notice that the female dwarven corpse while devoid of any accoutrements any coin purses belts or anything does have hidden within the bony clavicle what little bit of stretched dried skin is pulled against it a pendant that is gleaming blue you pull the pendant and you look at it it has a very beautiful sapphire emblem and you rub the dust off of it and you look at it and you recognize this emblem this is the emblem that adorns house thunderbrand of kraghammer you turn it over and on the back there's an engraving on the back that says for lorna my love yeah the actual amulet itself does have a magical essence to it it effectively acts as a shield spell once per day once per short rest once per rest yeah it's a reaction no so you're going over to the armor you're getting the armor for pike all right as you reach out and grab the golden chain mail on it the cold air around the chainmail is noticeably piercingly cold to the touch make a constitution save natural one all right as you guys are all doing this you hear the sudden (groans) this clenching of breath and you glance over real fast and find vax has fallen onto his back and his fingers are curled back and you can see this dark energy that seeps into his body for a second you can see his veins pulsing a little bit you feel your form-- there's no physical damage taken to you whatsoever but you sense this sapping of your strength and your breath is shallow you imagine this is what an elderly person would feel like you have this lack of energy as you're saying this pike comes over to you kima runs over to you and they both take a look at you pike starts inspecting you using her medicine and kima they both look at each other pass a few notes back and forth and they both agree well it appears this dwarven individual when he came to his end was not very happy and in doing so left a very strong curse behind on his body look about to each other no you are considered cursed which means you have disadvantage on all your ability checks and attacks there are spells like remove curse pike's not here i don't have her spell list wait a second ha all right so at which point kima steps forward and pushes everyone away for a second and concentrates and she reaches up and grabs the holy symbol of bahamut from underneath the front of the leather armor because she still hasn't exchanged it with you and it glows with this vibrant silver light and the light travels down her arm to her hands to her fingers and she places it out and reaches towards the armor and as she touches it she winces slightly but you see this glowing dark furious anger this face arise out of the armor giving off this slight whispering howl sound (whispering howl) and then (poof) dissipate as you see the divine energy begin to dissipate and glide off her hand she reaches over and touches you with her hand and the curse is lifted i looked over and realized that oh she actually has that spell she gives you a wink and says to be honest i just really wanted the armor and she pats you on the shoulder she takes the golden chain off of the body she (chuckles) she tells-- no you're out of the room she finds a cranny in the room she puts on the chain mail replacing the leather armor she gives back she does give you the greatsword and then takes the maul from the corpse of this dwarf but as she takes it from the body she sits down and says a silent prayer clutches her symbol and as she does she takes from one of her pouches a small bit of blessed water and tosses it across the body of the dwarf puts it back away and stands up all right shall we continue you swear you hear a slight shift in bone in silence left behind in darkness she put the chain mail on she gave you the leather armor back she's holding it in her hands certainly it's whatever armor you gave her the armor that you gave for her to put on in the emberhold when she had nothing on persuasion versus persuasion is this what this was you keep talking over each other apparently as you guys head back into the cavern you move around the boulder that grog had moved from the side crevice and as you continue for about another 20 or 30 minutes some of you begin to pick up what sounds like the distant lapping of waves against a shore (wave noises) as the tunnel begins to curve larger and larger eventually you come around a bend and the tunnel opens up into a humongous cavern housing an underground lake circling a large island from what you can see on the edges of the walls that are closest to you as the island disappears into darkness about a hundred feet ahead of you there are these blue crystals that you've seen throughout this tunnel completely covering the walls of this entire cavern there is only maybe bits of and places around the wall about five ten feet across where there will be no crystal otherwise it's just grey stone and blue crystal jutting from the sides okay you cast daylight and on the actual crystal source that you cast it on daylight emanates from it and gives a bright beacon of light right you notice that from the whatever crystal vein structure some of these are connected by some of them tend to glow in spots but you see it's localized all this crystal isn't interconnected is what this tells you there are pockets here and there that are interconnected but there are multiple veins of it going through the entire so as you approach the hard stone surface you guys have been walking on in the tunnel begins to give way to like a coarse sand almost like a gravelly shore and it appears to be fresh water it's clear the smell is a little musty but not too bad and you approach and you can see there's just these very gentle very soft waves that occasionally lap up on the shore but only a few inches there's not a whole lot of motion to the water within this cavern yeah i'll finish my description (chuckles) so there's this lake circling this large island across the way you also see on this side of the shore central there is a large stone bridge that arches over the lake and makes landfall about roughly 200 feet on the other side at the very very tip closest to you of this island it's about 15 feet wide this bridge maybe 20 feet and is an immediate walkway onto this island across you can see just faintly on the edge of this island a glowing bioluminescent fungal forest that covers a large portion of this island's top side the edges of it you can see rise up into cliffs that have eroded over time and are rather stark in places clarota as you look over is gliding into the cavern it's the closest thing you can imagine seeing a mind flayer to smiling he's looking about and in response to you a few moments later he says we're near home he glances over to you there are many things in the water fish crustaceans he points over and you can see there is this small very pale colorless whitish-gray crab that's over to the side that looks weird malformed one claw is twisted on itself and dragging behind it and it skitters off into the water everyone make a perception check oh snap oh you two as you all walk up to the edge of the shore line and you're inspecting the water feeling for it you look over and on the far left side of the shore you can see just below the waterline what looks like a sunken boat or two clarota gives you a look i do not know many things wander these tunnels beyond my kin we are but one of its denizens okay so keyleth's form jumps into the air this thin lithe half elven figure that then turns into this giant shark beast that (splash sound) into the water underneath a few moments later grog jumps in big splashing sound you can you still can't quite see what everyone's going for other than what she said all right the water is freezing cold you could swear this should've turned to ice by now because your veins certainly feel like they have upon impact you immediately get over that as you transform into a natural creature that's used to cold water grog it's fucking cold there aren't usually this many penis jokes in a session folks it just happens to be one of those days so glancing down below you see it too there are approximately two and a half boats that are made of some sort of a combination of wood and metal like a heavily rusted iron one of them looks mildly serviceable the other one is broken with a large hole in the bottom of it okay you look around there doesn't appear to be much else around but you do catch what looks like a semblance of a half-eaten corpse a bone that is left partially buried in the ground you don't know how long that's been there either it's bleached bone at this point whatever fishes live in this landscape have picked it clean nope make a perception check yeah okay you do a couple laps nothing really catches your eye you can also attempt a perception you found some boats yo they are broken giant shark comes up under you and nudges you aggressively and lifts you towards the surface you guys all watch as grog is now riding a shark the forest certainly surrounds the city there are many places of entry within this cavern and you see clarota concentrate for a second and within all of your minds you suddenly have a very clear image of this entire cavern its layout what strange shape it is where the general overlook is and as clear as day you have an entire visual of the inside of this cavern you guys reside down here right by the bridge on this edge of the beach this green represents the fungus and this you imagine represents the city the temple being central there yes they are i'll put this down here in case you want people to see that you guys are right here sure potion two underwater breathing biscuits two underwater breathing waffles i'm pretty sure it was potions i'm pretty sure they were potions you haven't had a good look at it yet tiberius slowly disappears beneath the surface it is cold you see the bubbles break on the surface and then eventually the bubbles stop tiberius may have drowned you don't know okay this doesn't take you too far it's maybe 60 feet from the edge of the coastline you can see as long as you're traveling with a light spell going on which i assume you do at most points but yeah you see there are two and a half boats essentially they're large looks like they were meant specifically for travel you're not quite sure where it may have come from i'd say it's maybe about 15 almost 20 feet from end to end so you're putting your ioun stone on oh got you okay so you put on the ioun stone okay okay there's a rustle in the waves on the surface of the water as you see all of a sudden this (impact sound) this bowing and splashing begins to occur the ship begins to rise out of the sediment on the bottom of the lake it gets up it's filled with water you tip it on its side and spill the rest of the water out there's still a large hole on the bottom of the boat on the inside and you carry it over back to the surface of the shore and rest it gently onto the rock telekinesis is still in effect currently so if you wanted to do that now would be the time okay so tiberius comes back with the half boat essentially that's cracked in half and part of it is ruined and broken but there's still a sizeable amount of oxidized iron metal and wood here that you think would be serviceable for repairs okay it's up to you guys so you're going to go ahead and make a tinkering check anyone want to help i would say this is a key point in time for a scanlan song you use this bardic inspiration specifically for stuff like this i'll give you a d6 for that (all laugh) if it wasn't vax singing go for it you add whatever your tinkering bonus is which should be your dex 13 total okay you take a while with it it takes a little bit longer than you anticipated but you have your general tools with you you hammer away about an hour and a half to two hours later you're sweating your muscles are sore but you feel like you've managed to get the hole for the most part patched now it's just to test its buoyancy you push it in you leap in the boat it (impact sound) gives to the 600 pounds that are grog it splashes a bit it lifts it seems to be holding it's leaving ripples in the water best you can tell from the image that was given to you any of those sections along the edge that have the jagged lines are cliffs correct all right so you guys continue down the right side of the path you push off into the water being towed by keyleth in shark form you hug the far edge of the water pushing across you find a way around and as you begin to look up the wall you can see once again how these crystalline structures are spread out across this entire wall going up you can't even see the ceiling of the cavern it's so high up from your current perspective it just disappears into darkness you continue following the path until eventually you come to this choke point here where the land mass begins to-- you can see where the beach begins to crest down and touch the water as you slowly and quietly make your way around the bend you look over and you can see the forest indeed they appear to be trees but now that you have a better view of it you know maybe about 400 500 feet off from you right now that bioluminescent glow this very faint glow is given off by all the plant life all these giant fungal trees the roots have these strange organic almost like they're gripping the ground the canopies of them blossom in these strange almost mushroom-like appendages these fungal bursts that stick off the top and form the tree-like canopy and you can see vines hanging from each of these it's a very strange alien forest fauna that even you're not familiar with in your travels but it does give off this dull color this faint light source that does tend to give a general visual view of the landscape on this island you do see just barely beyond this point looking across the tops of a few buildings in the very very distance the color of the stone from what you can make out has almost a jade mixed with a grey marble and you can just faintly make off in the distance one large pyramid-like structure that comes to a flattened precipice on top on the island to your left and there is a very very faint greenish glow at the very top that matches the coloration of that same glow you saw in the eyes of queen ulara earlier and the rest of the denizens that were in her party as you quietly begin to push along you come to the point where there's the beach to your right and there's the island to the left the island which comes to this incline and then drops off on a cliff on the far side it has its own encapsulated fungal forest you can see what looks like a very very faint bit of ruins on the beachfront that has mostly crumbled and fallen but for the most part it appears to be fairly empty other than the fungal growth itself to the right there is another pebble beach same consistency as the beach you first arrived on to put to scale your boat that you found is about that big it's pretty big yeah as you guys come gliding down you look at the beach you see the ruins you see even though there is no real breeze or wind in this cold air there is like a slight swaying to the trees that reside on this on here best you can see looking down it's just a plain pebble beach an inlet there that goes into the cavern interior of the wall you can certainly try to keep quiet while doing so the cave that actually opens up in the side of the wall within this cavern is about 20 feet up and about 25 feet across so you're flying as low as you can but you're still only about maybe 15 feet off the ground ten to 15 feet are the rest of you going in all right everyone who's entering the cavern go ahead and make a stealth check in the boat all right as you guys not-so-stealthily begin to march into the tunnel here you follow it as it bends around a little bit and it eventually opens up into this larger space and as you enter the room partway through this tunnel the scent changes dramatically that cold still water smell begins to give way to this terrible sulfurous rotting smell very-- it's near septic and as you enter this room the smell is dreadful and you can tell using your light source over here there appears to have been some sort of a struggle there are bedrolls and sheets strewn about and soiled and burned and torn across the floor there's about what looks like three or four different bedspreads that have been tossed and ruined you can see a semblance of what was a fire pit but all the soot and ash has been smeared across the ground to the outside of it there appears to be a half buried chest or container off in the far corner and you can see what looks to be four dead bodies in a not too long state of decay you can still see flesh and skin but there's some bone peeking through and they're all slumped against the ground against the corners okay you take the dagger and (sound of dagger embedding into wood) into the wood doesn't seem to have any immediate effect okay grog and percy are still in the boat at this point well you're in the process of stepping out of the boat at this point as you begin to approach the chest you notice one of the bodies shift (moans) its head rolls around and it looks at you pike is still back in the boat with percy what she doesn't have one of the earpieces all right as you guys get out of the boat and begin rushing in that direction you notice the one body looking over at you with this weird grin you've had a few encounters with zombies or undead creatures that unnaturally move this one has an intelligence to it that disturbs you you glance over at the other bodies who are already getting to their feet we will get to that at the top of our next session (all groan) yep so (laughs) so we will pick up next week with the next episode of critical role in which the party will deal with this sudden surrounding of some strange partially-decomposed corpses indeed the overlord has come about that yes i'd love to i can charge through these real fast i can
