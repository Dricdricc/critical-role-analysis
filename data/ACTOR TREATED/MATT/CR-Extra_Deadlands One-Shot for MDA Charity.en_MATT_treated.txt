you guys have been amazing this is amazing we'll be playing this for the next three hours come hang with us let me meet you over at my table magic dungeon master magic although however i'm not a dungeon master today today i am a marshal because we're playing deadlands reloaded for those of you who aren't familiar deadlands is one of my favorite settings called the weird west and we're playing deadlands reloaded which brings it over into the savage worlds system which i've had to learn over the past few days so bear with us it's going to be a rusty run for a lot of us learning and picking up things we'll probably going to get a shit-ton of things wrong and that's okay because we're going to have fun while doing it anyway we're playing deadlands and to give you guys the idea behind the world that we're playing in this takes place in the 19th century around 1864 an event called the reckoning transpired what had happened is as the people of america began to push further west pushing a lot of the native americans out of their land and a bunch of terrible things happened to their people and their tribes a number of disgruntled shamans and members of those tribes came together and essentially did a giant shamanic ritual to tear a hole between this world and this extraplanar world of dark magic introducing entities called reckoners that want to pass into this world and can they only do so by elevating fear into this world it also introduced magic it introduced a bunch of really weird creepy things into the old west causing the civil war to run longer than it did in history as well as a bunch of other ridiculous circumstances nevertheless that is the setting that this game will take place in before we get started i want to go over a few rules for you guys so you know what this charity stream is all about we have some cool things called fate chips which i'll get into here in a minute the fate chips players and myself can use to alter the circumstances in the game a black fate chip-- sorry for those of you who know the rules i didn't have any white chips but they work the same as white chips-- the black fate chips can be spent by players to re-roll a single trait or skill roll they're attempting to do it's a one-time reroll the red chips can be used to instead add a d6 to whatever trait or skill roll they just made but in using that red chip i get to pick one to add to my pool over here as the marshal a blue chip which is probably the strongest of them all allows them to add that same d6 to a trait or skill roll but i don't get to pick a chip out of there that's pretty cool for them however some of my more powerful creatures or individuals in the game may have their own set of fate chips and if you donate looking at the list you can go ahead and provide additional fate chips to the players or me stack the deck however you feel it needs to be stacked trust me on this one you start with three of each we're going to get to that here in a moment so as it stands if people want to donate and affect the game you can donate a hundred bucks to give one of the players a black fate chip you can donate $150 to donate a red fate chip to a player of your choice $200 to give a blue fate chip to the player of your choice or $200 to give me a fate chip of my choice to use against the players because i'm the marshal i make the rules possibly sometimes the rolls can be better than additional ones we'll see i can only assume so what have you done what have you done laura in our final tier for this donating section of this wonderful drive is if you donate $500 or more you get to add a single-sentence element to the story currently and the moment it comes into play it will be incorporated to and adjust the current moment of the story's narrative based on your suggestion there try and be somewhat respectful with that we've had some crazy things happen in the past that completely derailed the game and that was fine for our extra life game which was crazy to begin with this one-- if it's a little crazy i may tweak it a little bit to fit into the narrative because i have to try and fit it somehow but i'm going to try to facilitate to the best of my ability everything you guys suggest yeah no deck of many things in this please that is the tier system we have in here for this to begin this circumstance-- well actually before we do this laura let's go ahead and introduce everybody's characters if you don't mind marisha why don't you begin she's a mutt she's an eastern european mutt grew up in the bronx it's awkward liam who are you all right laura who are you playing travis who are you playing all righty as a heads-up to all of you guys watching by the way if your children are in the room and you don't want them hearing a lot of curse words there's going to be a lot of swearing during this game just a heads-up all right so let's go ahead and divvy up some of these fate chips i need each of you guys to go ahead and pull three at random out of this two reds and a black bowl's here correct now i'm going to go ahead and pull a few here for myself also as a fun little quick here to start us off so laura's character took one of the edges called veteran of the weird west which gave her some great opportunities she's a more seasoned character than the rest of them she's seen more about the world but in doing so some strange interesting circumstance in her background is going to come into play so i've shuffled these cards and i want you laura to randomly select one of them if you don't mind take your pick three of hearts so looking at the table here sure because why not you chose the hunted card something or someone that you didn't finish the job on is currently trying to find you we'll see how that works out in the long run (cackles) all right so this conversation all takes place in a carriage as the four of you are currently riding to your destination for your different purposes and different reasons which you may discuss at your own leisure or not or make up at your own leisure or not the four of you have been traveling for days in this hot humid muggy carriage to your final destination of deadwood south dakota founded in the deadwood gulch at the discovery of gold by an expedition by custer in 1874 they had to abandon the government's incursion to seize these gold veins when the effects of the reckoning and the ensuing quakes began to swell in the western regions of the united states but word of the rich veins still found their way to the public ears here and there and folks seeking quick money and an escape from the mounting chaos of the still-dragging civil war swarmed into the gulch to raise up this lawless city of gold sin and vice managing to be far enough away from politics rumors still find their way to this rugged town of strange goings-on in the world tales of slain yankee and southern soldiers rising from the muck post-battle of shadows moving in the night to steal children of mystics calling spirits to do their bidding even so the people of deadwood are toughened already by harsh untrusting reality and such folk tales have no place in a man's world the sun has just set as the denizens of deadwood scatter to the bars to get shitfaced (loud bang off-screen) already got one off- oh no (laughter) pardon me a second we've already got some amazing donations i have to read them all there we go all players start the scenario-- uh-oh apparently you guys spend the evening resting within the bella union after drinks and relaxation the next morning's sun rises and you all realize you've all woken within the same bed as the others not necessarily recalling what the evening before entailed but it's at this time you all realize you've slept in rather late in the day as it's now apparently-- (mccree voice) it's high noon hold on i'm trying to keep up here guys (laughter) i know it's all good it's all good we'll begin the game here in a moment once i get through these you guys-- oh and i also receive two random joker cards so i have two jokers so those joker cards can be used in place of a poker chip we'll say the black on that one all right let me reset here and make sure i get to the other ones (laughter) all awkwardly waking up at (mccree voice) high noon (normal) you awkwardly gather your things finding yourself the music in the distance as the bella union is beginning to come to life again you can hear a piano playing and some laughter you hear some loud carousing on the other side of your door to the inn the second floor of which you now currently are awakening as you guys step out at your own individual pace you pass by a gentleman who's on the second-floor balcony staring down into the main thoroughfare of the bella union-- donation --a dark maroon coat and pants short grey-ish hair an intense dark mustache and a very very angular face he looks angrily down amongst the people and you can see at the tables the gambling tables are alight this early in the day and there appears to be a very intense game of cards going on and people are gathering around looking to see what the next stage is going to be during this game you guys go down to find yourselves a drink drinks first or game first all right you guys each throw a dollar down you go ahead and get yourself a very fine pouring of some whisky the guy at the bar hands the drinks over and goes yeah you would want a sarsaparilla wouldn't you tell you what it's on the house black coffee that can be provided you drink your fine fine alcohol which enables you to have a black chip so as you guys begin to gather around this poker game you look down and you can see folks are tense and looking over they're starting to cheer some folks are making their own side bets off the circumstance the visible layer of tobacco smoke is beginning to cloud the upper atmosphere of the bella union it's very palpable at this point looking in you can see four men at a table that are all very intent and one gentleman who's very well dressed similar in fashion to you a very nice light gray suit a very well-trimmed goatee balding on top with very short-cut hair on the sides and a little pair of spectacles at the end of his nose he's looking at his cards with a big smile everyone starts putting the last of their bets into the center there are two other gentlemen you can see that both look greasy like they haven't really slept in a long while covered in dirt and crud but they seem to have a large cache of chips at their side probably some of the various claim workers out here outside of the town and you see one of the gentlemen is wearing a top hat similar to the one that you're wearing with a fine long mustache handlebar out a portly older gentleman looking at his hand oh hell i'm going in one of them goes all right and pushes in (laughter) the inspiration of seeing all this energy you being away inspires you to go ahead have yourself another black chip you guys watch as suddenly they all throw their cards down full house pair of queens got a bunch of different cards and all of a sudden it comes to the well-dressed character who looks a little nervous now and goes hmm straight flush and everyone goes-- big upset loud uproar you can see now as the guy with the long mustache goes oh hell throws his cards down and gets up from the table angrily and turns around to walk away the two other gentlemen at the table glance out the side of their eye as one of the guys you see at the edge of this table game an older hunched-over gentleman with glasses at the end of his nose and a smearing of black powder across his face goes i love poker it's the most crazy game ever (laughter) thank you very much that man knows what he's talking about i'm not cheating you've seen me play cards in front of you this has been an amazing game at which point you can see one of the guys who lost in the game immediately goes for a swinging punch towards the guy holding the-- who won the actual last pot and with that whack cracks it right across his face donation all right he says as he punches him down suddenly a giant brawl begins to emerge in the center of this room you can see people throwing hooks left and right the guy who currently won the game is trying to grab the chips he has off to the side as you can see the two guys at the front of the guard of the bella union rushing in and trying to hold folks down seeing this chaos that was a good catch meant to be all this is breaking down you can see punches going left and right people falling down the guy who had his chips in his arm gets socked again and lobs them into the table folks start scrambling for them go ahead and make an agility trait check if you don't mind five both times all right you manage to pocket what would be about $200 worth of poker chips from the ground you start getting in the fray there all right stinky jules who are you going for you can see a bunch of different people the one that was cheating all right donation all right (laughs) this black chip goes to the new thief that's the chip you find that one is off the table all right so the guy's please i'm just trying-- i won it fair and square go ahead and make a fighting roll whatever your fighting dice is plus-- your fighting skill roll 2d6 and take the higher of the two two you swing towards him and he dodges out of the way oh dear grabs what he can of the poker chips and darts out of the saloon sure as you're grabbing things go ahead and make a strength check a four you reach out and you grab towards his leg and he trips over as you yank out the ankle from underneath him he goes spilling all the chips go scattering onto the front of the bella union and you can see while the guards are currently inside dealing with this fight that's broken out there's nobody outside to guard it a couple people on the street look over and is he all right sir are you all right they start coming towards him to his aid he turns around and looks at you and goes why would you do that thank you help me gather these things please before they take my hard-earned winnings you guys begin gathering up into the hats getting all the poker chips into the various hats the guys who were now brawling have been calmed down at this point you can see now the guards have their pistols out one of them fires twice into the ceiling of the bella union sending dust and little bits of plaster debris to fall all the fight ends as one of the guys is now shouting everyone calm your shit and you're all kicked out for now while we assess what the hell just went down you see the man who was looking over the top of the balcony now has risen up over the edge and goes thank you my good man all of you understand we only want civilized folks here at the bella union the man won fair and square give him his earnings and if i see any of you try and throw a punch in here again you're banned from gambling in my establishment as you begin walking upstairs both of you carrying your hats and his nose in the air a bit walking with you giving you a smile and thanks brother i appreciate the assist as you pop upstairs you keeping watch feel a strange sensation touching your left shoulder you glance over and see a wild monkey a small monkey that curls up next to you (chittering) go ahead and make a notice check yes donation it's her shoulder all right it is indeed a real monkey it is a straight-up real monkey on all checks if you roll a maximum of the die you roll again and you add it to there's your black chip by the way oh man you guys are going to be fine in combat when we get to that so you at this point look over and see the monkey this is a live monkey and as you look in it reaches in and grabs the edge of your earlobe and whispers into your ear do not worry i've got your back you guys look over there's no monkey as you throw the monkey to the ground he goes-- (angry noise) climbs back up onto your shoulder and says why would you do that to me i'm here to guide you as you're walking you pass by the guy who had the nice top hat and the mustache who's sitting there and he has an apron on and he looks like sleeves rolled up a working fellow in the camp in his later forties and you hear him mutter to himself as i get a red chip that fella damn well cleared out the gem last week and looks like he's taking this place for all it's worth last time i go gambling in a while i'm only assuming he's cheating he came into this town no more than a couple weeks back and damn well took all the gem was worth before coming here a week later he was you're walking up the stairs away from this you're actually helping this gentleman up to put stuff in the room he goes i don't know his full name rightly so but from what i've heard he refers to himself as simon yeah doesn't he sounds like a northern chap i've got to go well see what else i can sell to make up for this debt from today excuse me turns around and says by the way if any of you guys want to come by my place we also have poker there not quite as upper-class as this but we have fine drinks cheaper than you'd find at this place oh it's down past the main thoroughfare to the left it's by the alley side there and he adjusts his hat the number ten saloon is what you're looking for nice fine sign yes recommend it any time and he turns around and starts to leave call me manatou curls back up into your hair and seemingly becomes weightless for a moment you don't sense him there it's like he vanished stacking the deck over here for me guys you make your way up to the room and the gentleman goes i greatly appreciate this thank you so much for your aid if i could have my chips please he's going to go ahead and look keenly into your hat i'm going to use a chip for that yeah go ahead and roll-- do you have a stealth skill i think you roll a straight agility check just go agility see how quickly you can maneuver this okay donation i greatly appreciate your help everything appears to be good here and what is your name shakes your hand it's a limp shake well i'm also new here i can see by your appearance that you also are new your clothes are far too clean to have been here yes it's dusty even for winter out here yes well simon tyrell here i'm finding my way i'm a retired business manager from boston but i came a long way at the behest of my cousin and i heard that there was quite a booming gold trade in this city so i came to after building my luck up and getting a small cache of money realizing that i had a knack at this game called poker and apparently poker here can be very high-stakes and well so far so good happily happily good to hear from that we shall be in touch where are you-- are you staying here in this-- right okay i appreciate that we'll be in touch and he goes to put his hat on (chuckles) close leaves the room closes the door behind him you have got $60 worth of chips that you managed to pull out of that and a red chip to laura so you guys regather yourselves you've had a bit of chaos in your-- donation okay go ahead and make a medicine check healing this would be healing d8 and a d6 take the higher of the two the first guy you walk up to is one of the guys in the bar fight you can see his eye's fairly swollen looks like he has a cut lip and one of his arms is-- he's massaging a heavy swollen bruise on the side as you approach him he's sitting at a table what do you do donation look i don't mean any disrespect here i'm just weird with medical stuff i prefer to be holistic heal on my own that's right that's even stranger i'm not going to lie-- and he leans in to you and goes sorry i noticed you carousing with that there foreigner and i saw her speaking to the spirits and mumbling to herself and-- you don't actually hear you're just out of earshot of this unless you want to make a notice check to overhear make a notice check actually black chip for laura they're loading you up you overhear this even from a distance with your keen ears he says i have friends that come from eastern europe distant family member we'll say there's something about her accent that's wrong make another notice check and you make a persuasion check okay he goes all right go ahead and see what you can tend to as you start tending to him he starts whispering to you to the side you try and size him up he looks like a brutish guy who probably works in the mine quite a lot and has made a lot of gold on the side that he probably lost a bulk of in recent days he's very noticeably frustrated by the circumstance oh this religion shit okay make a faith check you add a d12 yeah if you'd like to use a black chip go ahead toss it to me thank you just reroll the 12 yeah okay that's with a raise too as you touch your hands i understand what the fuck is going on you can see as this light envelops him people in the room glance over with a strange look in their eyes you see tears well up in his face he's like i believe-- i'm sorry it's just really scary these days there's a lot going on i've got to get out of here i don't want them to see me cry and he stands up and stomps out of the bella union donation sure you-- make a general persuasion check for the room if you could you find your way back down the gentleman you guys saw who went upstairs at this point has now exited from the upstairs room down the stairs he gives a smile to the room and then leaves out the front of the bella union as well you follow suit only but a few paces behind you see at the far end of the room a-- donation --rough-looking gentlemen that goes all right i got-- i'll go ahead and get myself a-- (laughter) blue chip to everybody but me (cheering) the man walks over and says i don't really believe in all this mumbo jumbo but you look like a nice enough lady here he passes you a dollar it's one little crinkled-up piece of paper donation travis blue (laughter) it's going to be rerolls forever you take your time putting the cards out in front and eventually you see his eyes start wandering he starts looking around loses attention he goes you know what keep the dollar i learned my lesson he stands up and walks away it's at this point as you guys are talking about this a gentleman who's been standing in the far back with a long-brimmed dark hat a very well-kept mustache and goatee a long dark coat that ends about waist-height walks over you hear the jangling of his spurs as he approaches good day ma'am i don't mean the bother you much but i couldn't help but notice you have a mind for the mystic let me introduce myself my name is sheriff bullock there's been some strange things going on in the town here and not a lot of people are willing to offer help the one priest we had that was doing the best in this town has been ailing recently i figure maybe we can find folks with other specializations what the ailing fellow well you think you can be of aid to him all right he's been poorly for some time a madness is taking to him you know his eyes are starting to wander-- dementia but that's not why i came here though but we'll talk all right let me say that there's been a series of mysterious deaths at the time donation excuse me sir we're talking (laughter) thank you i appreciate your understanding but once every few weeks we found bodies turn up in the outskirts of town three folk normal denizens here of deadwood torn asunder ripped to shreds by some sort of creature the docs had a few looks and sees no more than i do about the logistics of it but yeah one of my-- my wife who had just come to town with my son was one of these victims well you'd have to talk to doc to get the real report but i say it's an animal many folks here think it's some sort of a bear maybe my wife i'm watching my son still it happens terribly but that's something i've got to deal with not you anyway (sighs) if you could be of some help maybe look around see if your mystic knowledge could make out something we couldn't donation sir if you don't i will take you down to jail no i don't necessarily believe in that stuff it kind of worries me honestly there is a loud calamitous crash sound as the door that was partially closed at this point smashes in front of you wood splinters go streaming outward and you see what appears to be a small fluff a spherical bear form roll in and stop bright-eyed a little bear cub hold it kill it you see the guards start pulling their guns out and start aiming it down at the bear cub the sheriff who's had his hand on the side of his holster goes this is a wild animal you can go ahead and make a smarts check donation for you do you want to reroll this is a small bear that's about as far as you can get on that one you go ahead and reach down for the bear the bear comes forward and sniffs you a small voice at the side of your ear goes your destination is elsewhere reverend you turn around there's nothing there kind of rub your ear the bear-- for you laura the bear sees you and goes (bear cub sounds) and passes around you and goes straight over towards stinky jules and just starts rubbing on your knee it starts licking your hand you're like ugh bears a voice creeps in once again into your ear reverend but it's softer it goes you're on the right path follow the leads it will lead you to your salvation follow the leads and you reach over again there's no source of the voice you've been a man of faith for a long time but nothing's ever spoken to you before no he's just looks like he's trying to feel his ear so i don't know how good are you with an animal the sheriff goes i mean respectfully there's a lot of weird shit going down in this town right now and a lot of it has happened in the past five minutes since i walked in to talk to you donation sir i warned you and the sheriff goes over and grabs the guy at the side table who's been far too excited and screaming outward he says sheriff what are you doing he's like i'm taking you down to go ahead and clean up you-- i can smell the alcohol on your breath and he drags him out and you see as sheriff bullock drags this poor card player out into the street past you guys go talk to the doc he's your best bet he drags him out trying to look it up right now actually i didn't have his name written down we're going to find it real fast here thanks to imdb that'd be reverend h w smith and the doc's taking care of him right now so that'd be your best bet indeed i'm going to take this guy-- and the guy's still fighting him on the ground going sheriff put me down put me down we hit 60k guys (cheering) let me go ahead and say as part of that just to kind of pause here while you guys are deciding your next path we're going to go ahead and put up-- we're going to have the community decide on an npc name that's going to find its way into a future game of critical role so we're going to go with that one if we manage to hit 65k before this game's done we'll also have a boss creature of some kind that i'll design with you guys in the near future as well so let's get keep that in mind all right so bullock drags the guy off in the distance you all leave the bella union now it's mid-afternoon it's hot even though it's winter time-- --you have carts going by the ground is muddy itself from a recent rainfall what do you guys want to do there's plenty of horse shit fair enough you go ahead and get yourself some whisky and your canteen-- okay do you want to make a street smarts roll go for it he said where the doc was and he was going to point and he ended up-- street smarts sorry go for it four okay it takes you about an hour or so asking around but you do manage to lead the group to the doc's place as you come up to it it's a really really simple-looking hovel that's jammed against a stable but everyone seems to point to say where's the doc and on the outside you do see what appears to be a wooden carving of the classic medical symbol over the doorway you knock on the door a moment passes all of a sudden the door opens and you see an eye peeking through a pair of old dirty glasses big grey hair and a greyish moustache goes who the hell's coming to my door i'm awfully busy all right we got something i'm working on-- yeah i can't take any more patients for now all i have is work well help is always welcome come on in come on in he opens the door you guys come inside and there is a terrible smell a terrible smell-- to you liam right there yeah you're used to the scent you come inside and a smell of decay and death permeates the entire place you can see across the way there are two tables with two current injured individuals one of which seems to be a man who is wrapped up and missing an arm and has been wrapped up and he's just rolling around in a feverish state you also see a man dressed in long black robes who is humming to himself as he's writhing in place one arm is curled up across his torso to the other side of the room as you violently vomit into your hat you see what appear to be a number of tables that have piles of viscera of what look to be once-human bodies that are bloodied and flies are gathering the doctor turns around now you can see him sweaty his long crimped grey hair there all right you said you're here to help this here's gerald he points to the guy who's having a fever and says had to amputate his arm 'cause the damn fucking fool got it torn off in an accident with some machinery okay he's partially asleep and as you pull out the whisky he goes what-- what-- okay puts up his arm and grabs the whisky it spills out a little bit he's like (gulping) thank you he'll be fine he's just making his way through the fevers i gave him some sedatives he should be okay more worried about the reverend reverend smith over there appears to have some sort of a brain tumor pushing on him there's not much we can do about that right now unfortunately donation the guy who's now drunk goes all right (laughter) you walk over to the reverend the reverend's sitting there muttering to himself singing low under his breath chip of my choice yes do you speak the lord i can see the light the lord has brought you to me that's correct when it's our time it's time to go i appreciate your solace you're a kind soul i can see thank you and you can see one eye's wandering off to the side and the other eye's just staring out before him he feels your presence but he's in a rough place you spend two more power points total is ten you gained one back you have three uses you gain one back as an hour has passed you gain one back every hour go ahead and roll your faith check go ahead and make an investigation check a ten okay roll a d4 minus two and a d6 roll again 11 minus two so it's a nine all right so we'll get to you in just a moment you feel-- this man is seriously ailing and for a miracle that can heal wounds this is going to take some serious faith to try and push this through even with what you have you don't know if this is even within your skill set okay what are you going to do use some of these chips you have a lot of them you can use a red chip to add a d6 no you get the one 11 the guy who's in a feverish state is half-asleep and just-- (laughter) use another red chip to add another d6 all right so what's it now 13 i'll let you do this for the sake of this so as you push through with the double-raise to your faith check on this you see as this bright vibrant light suddenly fills the room from one sunbeam coming through the singular glass window striking you in the shoulder and enveloping the entirety of reverend smith all of a sudden you in the distance as you're inspecting the corpses you can't help but glance over your shoulder and you watch as this ray of light envelops his body as it does he lifts gently off the table two three inches and the doc goes what the fuck have you brought into my place and he inspects and as you see the reverend slowly turns over in place his eye corrects itself a smile comes across him of serene joy and he's lowered down onto the table the light subsides you take your hand away and he sits up in place goes my lord my mind-- my thoughts are mine again the lord is stronger in you than anyone i've ever met he starts crying and gives you a big hug and pulls you in there's no faith stronger than what you've brought this day you've lost interest in this whole circumstance about the bodies and this is for you travis i'm not the only one that suffers so you get into this and keen as you are you've done some hunting in your time and you've seen some wounds spent to various creatures that have been mauled by individuals you find specifically that one it seems like a bear or at least something of a bear's size would have to have done this but it's wintertime bears usually aren't wandering and the wounds here are thorough not killed something and ate pieces of it there is no indication that there has been portions of these bodies eaten in fact they have just been killed and torn apart the doc at this point stunned by the whole miracle that just transpired before him walks over to you and goes here's what gets me each of these bodies were found on the outskirts of town not deep in the woods some of these folks weren't seen leaving i think some of these bodies were placed after being killed i don't know if these people were outside of the town when they were killed even so i'm confused just as you are about this or at least whatever did this is working with someone within the town have you been to this town for long it's full of suspicious activity fucking damn it this whole town's full of cocksuckers and i don't know how to separate the good from the bad i wouldn't even believe what you're saying if this guy didn't come in here and fucking prove that god exists to me as an atheist i'm having a lot going in my head right now halle-fucking-lujah if you want to help find out what the shit did this i need a drink and he goes over and grabs the bottle of laudanum next to the guy who he was helping don't you 'no' or shush me i know what i need fuckin'-- make a persuasion check two red chips to the reverend and a black chip to you sydney he goes one sip i ain't got a lot of this you may make a persuasion check make a persuasion check total of nine i want you to go ahead and-- i'd say for this roll a spirit okay you going to add anything to that both of you guys roll a d6 normally no one could keep you from a sip of laudanum but watching the miracles that transpire around this bright and bushy-faced gentleman you think maybe you should drink this when he's not around and you gently give it back to the doctor i appreciate you all having your conversations but if you could do it outside i got business to tend to as he starts pushing you guys outside of the place and you get outside before he closes the door he goes just a word i don't know if this will help much but each of those that were killed inside here were plot owners in gold and silver veins except for the last two hugh and kilmer the ones you were looking at they were under the employ of al swearengen in the gem saloon now get out and he slams the door behind you you hear a voice creep in the back of your ear liam once again that says the only path to goodness is to find who murdered these people follow the trail be a hero roll a faith check it's hard to tell you've had a lot of miracle stuff happen recently so you figure this is probably an angel sent from god but it's hard to tell the bear which is nuzzling under your hand stinky jules and is like just licking it begins to growl as soon as you get close bites at your hand what is your parry six all right so the bear bites out towards your hand doing seven points of damage what's your toughness it's not snake oil salesman you're referring to i didn't use a fate chip you can negate me using one you can't force me to reroll when i use a chip you can be like nope yeah so the bear bites down on your hand you pull back you're considered shaken for the moment but the bear's still so fucking cute just licks a little bit of blood off of its teeth and grins at you what's the plan now you actually saw the gem saloon it's not too far from the bella union she does right up to the ankle you eventually make your way towards the gem saloon as you walk up there is piano being played but unlike the bella union it's not quite as fanciful and the interior's a little more dreary as you step inside you can see a few patrons around you can see a few of the female workers of the establishment who are all leaning in the back corner in various states of undress but all look hot and not really into it at the moment as you walk in and say that you see across the way a man with a big black beard and long hair little bowler cap on with a rifle across his shoulder and a white shirt with a single strap over for his overalls looks over and starts walking towards you with his rifle in his hand just goes (clarota voice) what brings you here to the gem saloon sorry i got punched in the throat and it's healing what you cocksuckers doing here in the gem what you looking for they're a couple men we lost yes but that's not our problem i've seen no fucking beasts if you're here to drink fucking get in here otherwise i need you to step off looks at you for a second make a persuasion check roll again gives you a look-over and his demeanor shifts changes again and he goes sorry just doing my job name's dan yeah doherty shakes your hand for a second so right now you know who's boss so if you want a drink over to the bar otherwise sit down listen to some music buy yourself some pussy doesn't matter to me he gives you a look you ain't look like you ever suffered more than suckling your mother's tit and i don't trust anyone who don't drink nor anyone who don't have to shave donation that's what i said he goes and high-fives the guy at the table next to him this older drunk fella who heard the whole conversation and is laughing at your rather mousey-- i'll take suffer i prefer to heal on my own the proper way none of your fucking godmongering types here saying that the word can help and he spins around keeps an eye over his shoulder mistrusting towards you with the rifle still at his side the voice returns and goes men and women are born every day through a union of others go be merry touch feel they all look at each other they're all giving you a very very curious look and they all put their hand out like honey we're all clean the doctor takes care of us you going to pay or not ten dollars take your choice she takes you by the hand and starts leading you up the stairs he gets closed behind the door three of you guys what are you doing you find a woman a brunette rosy make-up cheeks who's sitting at a table just fanning herself off in this strangely muggy warm day in the middle of the winter you're telling me this day's been all sorts of muggy how can i help you i don't want to talk about that kilmer was one of the nicer fellas who worked here at the gem he well sad to hear that he met a weird fate hugh worked here as well but i'm honestly kind of glad hugh got what he had coming i don't rightfully know you'd have to ask mr schwerenger about that she looks up and you can see at the top of the stairs it curls around and there's an office with a closed door on the second floor she points over to-- you see dan at the corner with his rifle keeping a very close look on you you got to talk to him holds her hand out okay takes it okay so as you turn around sudis has walked up to dan as you approach he has the gun at his side and he begins to pull back the trigger can i help you dan dan doherty that's far enough you come any closer i'm going to go ahead and take your eye out he pulls a small black feather out of his mouth after the hiccup and is confused by the whole thing make a notice check five he would definitely pull that trigger you get the sense he's pulled a lot of triggers and he's aiming right at you one more step i don't want any of this too many fucking weird things happen in this town don't want any of your god damn magical bullshit get the fuck out of the gem before i shoot your eye out-- don't trust them gypsy types at all what you want you might need someone go on no one talks to al unless they get permission what you want to talk to him about tell me what you need for him i'll talk to him and he'll tell you no is he all right i can see you're supposed to cook the bird first asshole it's the throat thing i'm sorry sit the fuck down you get the fuck out of the gem or i swear to fucking god i'm going to shoot you got until three to calm your friends the fuck down or i'm going to go ahead and take 'em both out reach for her revolver so travis first off while we're in this moment as time has passed i would like for you to go ahead and roll a spirit check you got chips guys use 'em red one would add to it if you wanted to use a red one to add to it you can all right so add a d6 to that one five do you want to use another chip to add more to it on the important rolls so total of six a respectable five minutes pass before he makes his way outside of the room nice and sweaty you come down immediately to see what appears to be a stand-off rifle drawn right at the reverend as you begin to reach towards her gun on the side-- he's up the stairway she's maybe four or five feet from you okay against her gun spend two points make a notice check all right so that's with the raise so you go ahead and there's a dull glow at the side of her holster as you manage to enchant her weapon with smite you don't know you do manage to glance to the side and notice that he brushed his fingers past and there's a slight glow off of your holster two make a persuasion check you're looking down the stairs you see dan's-- they're both at the side looking at each other from your perspective down below all right i'll pick it up later (clang) so he's still-- glances over his shoulder doesn't see anything you do hear a door slam in the distance and a voice comes blaring out who the fuck is causing problems in my saloon and who the fuck is calling my name at this point dan puts his gun down sir i didn't mean nothing by it had these folks come in-- he's like i will gut you like a god damn fish dan what do you want or get the fuck out of my place the more you talk the less i want to talk to any of you you looking to see if you can help my men who got killed right get on up to my office he turns around and goes back inside storms back out again and goes like and dan you tell me next time we have guests looking for me do not point a gun at them glances over at you and goes i don't trust her go ahead and go that way the rest of them let them up three of you guys up and was like you can stay all right the three of you guys make your way up to the office desk is up there there's papers strewn across there's a balcony with a door half-open and you see a partially dressed woman currently leaving out of the far bedroom rushes past you guys you enter the room would you mind closing the door behind you all right so to who the fuck do i owe this pleasure oh be my guest whereabouts in england i actually had some time there myself make a persuasion check all right calm down calm down usually folks aren't so eager around this place jittery all right so you say you're here to help with my men all right (sighs) and he walks out looks over the balcony for a second fucking cocksucker cleaned out the tables with a grin you seen this asshole walking in town taking all the money next time he crosses your path go ahead and punch him for me if you don't mind is that his name simon good to know certainly hope he took cy for all he's worth too there goes a joyride for the trees alone you see him again deck him there's some cash in it for you so he says all right so i've heard some terrible fucking news a new interest is coming to town soon george hurst the same rich fucking loadrunner's hurst hurst hagen tevvyson cocksucker's company last thing we need in this place is another fucking company man without an appreciation for allies i'll tell you what you want work pay you $400 to split and a free run of the ladies for the night if you bring me anything linking hurst to these rumors of silver going belly-up in this town very possible you find that out you come back with some information about that or if it's this fucking bear they keep saying it is bring back the bear's hide $200 to you to spread as you like for the hide of whatever fucking creature killed my boys it's hard to find dependable men these days and some heroics in town can only bring spirits up higher spirits make for higher-paying customers if i knew i'd go looking for it my-fucking-self what am i paying you for shut the fuck up please spill it the bella union so want some cash find out who the fuck killed my men see if hurst is behind any of this now get out your choice stairs or the balcony good wise choice slams the door behind you guys you in the meantime there is a woman who has come up to you and said actually i've always wanted my fortune told if you don't mind lisa yeah the voice in your head once again liam goes come take one any of them it'll right your connection with your lord she's young she hasn't been in this business long you can see a bit of fear and worry in the back of her eyes get hurt a lot in this line of work what do you mean careful of what as you can say that you can see one of the whores nearby trips and knocks her down onto the table knocking out her front teeth yeah (muffled screams) and just begins running off the other women take her in and then start picking up her teeth on the table you get out of this place you fortune teller you get out of this place you hear (gun cocks) and dan has his rifle up at the back and is like i told you to keep out all right he looks over his shoulder again kind of nervously which one was it virginia i'm sure she is as you turn at this point you see dan still has his gun up and says go ahead and find whisky elsewhere you four are fucking not welcome right now until you come back with what al was asking about out you guys find your way outside of the gem saloon the monkey in your ear whispers out follow the trail of gold and silver this is where you must go and curls back up into your hair pour some whisky over the hand you feel inspired travis you get a red chip go ahead and make a guts check five okay you after saying that shake it off and look down you can deal with this no longer shaken by it you feel like this wound will subside in time the voice in your ear creeps in and goes it's all true at this point the sun has begun to set and you hear in the distance what sounds like a gunshot a gunshot in the distance a second gunshot okay you guys go charging off now on the sound of this distant gunshot you make your way to the outskirts of the town where you see there's now people surrounding what looks to be an individual who is torn open their stomach pulled out but they're holding a gun and they're on the ground passing out at this point notice check sure go for it you got a four looking around the darkness as the shadow's started to take the nearby forest you see nothing before you but you do see some of the other folks in town who are starting to bring out what looks like torchlight and starting to make a little posse to go out and seek you see the well-dressed gentleman who wandered up earlier simon what's going on this is-- what yes hello again go ahead and roll fighting okay you got a five okay go ahead and just roll a d4 or what's your strength yeah so roll a d4 add one to it all right so you-- is that your fighting roll oh go ahead and reroll the fighting is a d4 no you got the five yes so you're going to reroll the-- and he goes what (impact) her fist comes out of the side of your visual perspective his hat gets flung off to the side he hits the ground he's now missing a tooth a man rushes out and picks him up and goes are you okay and helps simon up off the ground you see a man looking with a sad turtle-like wrinkled face a paisley-blue velvet outfit that's worn dirty a hat much like yours and he stammers as he lifts him off the ground why why have you taken this moment to feel it important to impart onto my gentle cousin your fist al al told you to did you piss off al that's dangerous he is my cousin i'm eb farnum the mayor of this fair town and i am also the owner of the grand central hotel if you ever want to come stay with us you're more than welcome is she welcome she just punched you and simon's still coming to his senses and goes i-- why okay folks are confused at this point and they're pulling out their torches and their guns the guy on the ground by the way as you're searching him has-- he is expiring rapidly it was teeth and fur and he passes out all right go ahead and make a faith check two more points one other ones add d6s thank you as you reach down your hand touches him in the darkness of the newly formed dusk you see warmth begin to emerge from your medic's hands and all the intestines slowly pull back into the body the wound closing leaving the shorn shirt of the individual he comes to consciousness with a deep breath you can see eb farnum's like what is going on everything's turned upside-down i don't know what's happening simon turns to him and they whisper to each other make a notice check give this to laura please three no you don't hear anything you hear some whispering and you notice that simon nods and looks about shiftily and darts off into the town as eb takes his place with a big smile go ahead and make a stealth check as you turn around eb goes ma'am i'm sorry to bother you a lot of things have been happening in this town as of late-- sorry it's a thing i always seem nervous but as the mayor of this town i feel-- i did and mr schwerengen i don't have to talk to you look miss there has been a terrible incursion of an evil sort a blight on our fair city and i think it's important that we as a people figure out who is responsible smacks it away unhand me gypsy foul demon-woman at this point the man who he's healed stands up black chip for laura and goes i don't know what to say you see now he's an older gentleman with a big thick beard and a bowler hat and he's shorter stockier you saved my life and i appreciate that name's charlie charlie arthur i was out taking a walk in my thinking hour when i noticed something moving on the outskirts of town i went to check it out like one is wont to do in my place here in town something with a lot of fur and teeth came at me from that way and he points out towards the north end of town that leads out towards the various mining claims about the size of a bear best i could tell but not bear-like it was more savage like a dog but this dog was on its hind legs it looked like then it wasn't then it ran like a bear i don't know i got two shots off didn't seem to stop it then it tore out the side of my stomach and left me for dead excuse me while i go get a very firm drink you keep strange company and while i appreciate what you've done that weird shit-- i've had enough of it for the day you can see eb is still looking over your shoulder as you're talking with him and he's pushed you away i'm sorry i think it is time that i returned about my business and left you woman of the arcane dark arts out of my sight good day oh ugh and he seems like he's super confused and torn by the whole thing that's happened he just walks into town some of the people are out now forming parties who go out into the middle of the forest i'm sorry i don't know what you're talking about okay go ahead and make a fighting check with two raises or raising the attack so go ahead and roll damage plus an additional d6 it's under your bowie knife yeah so roll that twice plus two so seven plus your d6 do you want to use a red chip to add another d6 to that just 'cause why not add another d6 no as you walk away arm over him do you keep walking with him he goes limp in your grasp you guys now see as charlie has collapsed to the ground now just a gout of blood out of his chest where the previous scar wounding was no insight if i could have you go ahead and make a persuasion check correct seven you going to add anything else to that or no ten he looks earnest it looks like somehow the wound has reopened and syndey is genuinely fearful of what has just happened towards the woods you guys watch as your reverend fellow walks off into the woods you guys begin to make your way up into the woods at this point i want to mention real fast we just hit $65k (cheering) if we hit $70k this special one-off and what it's about to unveil as it continues will be uploaded to geekandsundrycom by friday if we can hit $75k it'll be uploaded by wednesday also we're going to be giving out a signed cast poster of the purple no longer available showdown poster so we're going to sign that poster and give it away since that is no longer available if we hit $75k so anyway don't give them any ideas so as you guys step into the dark forest the evening air has definitely consumed this area you can hear the crickets in the distance chirping and the occasional distant hooting of a night owl (owl hooting) you look up and the moon is a bright vibrant circular white it looks to be-- --close to full or full and that light is aiding you to get through some part of the forest as scattered as it is amongst the trees make an occult check knowledge/occult on the table yep thank you yes a full moon's particular furry beasts with the nasty teeth various forms of lycanthropy are affected at this point in time based on the information that these attacks happened every few weeks and the cycle of the lunar cycle you gather there's probably a very good chance that this beast that's been seen multiple times is some sort of a shapeshifter a couple of things one ladies red chips the men get black chips roll a smarts check if you could sudeis yes add to the d6 as well let's see what you find donation just one the big one five you add anything to it you don't have to you get more information if you-- okay add your d6 like a d6 ten you do also recall as you're putting these beats of information together full moon lycanthropy seemingly rumours spreading wide you've heard of silver mines drying up or being purchased up people like silver werewolves-- for werewolves lycanthropes it's the only thing that can kill them folklore has heard stories and such you've never encountered one it's occasionally maybe heard of in fairy tales and such times have been weird as of late he didn't say that cy did he said that they'd been purchased up cy had lost a lot of money he's worried that hurst might be buying them up you guys are deep in the forest where are you going are you heading towards-- who wants to make a tracking check you can all make a tracking check all unskilled i'm pretty sure no it's a d4 and a d6 and then minus two no you take the higher of the two yeah minus two 14 so as you all are lost entirely in the middle of this forest middle of the night the moonlight the only thing that's giving you any sort of visual reference all of a sudden you stinky ja-- stinky jules (laughter) stinky jules you look over and you see particularly little spats of blood and larger beast tracks recent ones that scale up this way you begin to follow and you guys follow behind stinky jules you come over a ridge looking down to where a lot of the plots a lot of the set claims are all set up the side and separated with flags and various markers and such you can see a number of them have been closed and boarded up if you want to there's a number of ones you can go and check out it's a campsite that is currently abandoned and it looks like it's been abandoned for a while there are a number of wooden boards that are placed up against the entrance you look around and you can see a bunch of leftover discarded mining materials and what looks like most of the remnants or the scraps that are left behind in one of the big mining carts that's currently outside-- make a notice check this'd be investigation make an investigation you glance around and look inside this and look around the exterior of it the dust around here is silver specifically in nature this is a silver mine the beast tracks faded once it got over the ridge and went down to the claim area so (laughs) i'll roll for the bear cub bear cub kind of (sniffing) (cute growl) kind of leans up against you okay so you pry open some of the board-- the air is dry and musty in there you get a few feet in and it's pitch black there's no light you guys glance inside you walk about 20 30 feet into the mine before it opens into two different paths but immediate at a glance as-- okay you look down both sides of the split y formation deep into this mine and you can see areas that have been heavily mined but the thing that catches your attention is for being boarded up and abandoned there's still a lot of apparent silver veins in the walls that are in the middle of being mined before they were left behind you see visible veins even this quickly in yeah and actually it takes you about half an hour or so but you manage to scrounge up some decent chunks of silver probably about five pounds' worth which is quite a bit (laughs) all right nope not that you can see make a notice check you're not very good at noticing things you're a faithful man you take faith-- the d6 to see which is higher okay best you can tell based on the wound it's a mild wound it's a little swollen it seems to be fine but no other visual effect than that big pit stains you hear from the far far depths of the mine-- donation a faint sound going not all right (laughter) a deep echoing exhale from deeper in the mine (creepy exhale) it's still a ways away but it's getting slowly louder okay all right you guys begin to curl around the left side where the sound's coming from and as you come into a larger mining chamber-- you see-- --not a furry creature as your lantern passes by all of a sudden it catches a darker shadowed shape that looks like a human but with a larger head than normal its body is black and bulbous and it looks almost shiny like it's covered in oil but that's its natural form it glances over real fast and its eyes glow as it flashes in the light and (hisses) it scatters out of the light-- --into a far corner you're going to shoot it all right go ahead and make your shooting skill check no the smite only lasts for a few rounds yeah you do d6 on your shooting your shooting is a d10 i think look where it is i think it's pretty high and what was the d6 yeah as well with that one what's the lower of the two right as the bear-- is this you re-rolling okay got you and the six was a four okay so the bear thinking that you're its mother and sees suddenly the fear runs to your side and clings to you and in doing so disables your shot and you have to go with the lower strike on that one but you do get a black chip from that one and the bear is heavily-- blue chip to you liam the bear is shaking against you and making it harder to shoot the gun ricochets off the far back wall sparking across the stone and you hear once again (creepy breathing) heavy breathing i'll have you guys go ahead and each draw a card at random from your deck you gain one more back so you've gained three total of what you've used you've cast three miracles correct how did you get one point how much do your miracles cost it should say on them then yeah-- right so that would be-- three uses four uses but you've regained three so you would have been at two to five you're at five now wow that's great great and what do you have laura a jack okay first things first as you were not quite fast enough-- nope (chuckles) this strange creature who's keeping in the shadows just outside your lantern-light you hear the (rasping growl) and it lunges out at you being the closest to it it swoops out towards you you can see it's bulbous it's only about three feet tall in its size but its larger head is awful-looking and it's just a terrible-looking thing large saucers for its face it strikes out towards you with two of its claws i want you all to go ahead and roll a guts roll by the way minus one i'm going to reroll that okay i'll use another one to reroll all right so what do you got all right you everyone else has managed to take this back you are finding yourself shaken from the perspective of this and you're now holding the lantern there's not much else you can do at this moment when it comes to your turn you'll have to see if you can reveal that however it does swipe out at you that's going to be-- so what is your parry it rolled a six it hits you it strikes out you go ahead and suffer from that that's going to be-- i'm going to go ahead and add a d6 to that it was black all right that would be eight points of damage what's your toughness five you are shaken right now as it strikes out at you and strikes its claw across your front you manage to pull it off and it just barely cuts the skin but it's enough to freak you out at the moment that ends its turn and then you're up next actually at the top of your turn go ahead and make a spirit check to try and regain your composure donation nine all right black chip here you shake it off you're no longer shaken but that's all you can really do this turn as you go ahead and try and steady yourself and start going for your gun now to pull it out i'll say you can pull your gun out for this turn as well all right the rest of you guys now you go ahead and see if you can make a spirit check to not be shaken it would be 2d6 for anything you roll as a trained check so yeah so you're no longer shaken that's the end of your turn you guys what do you want to do go for it so go ahead and roll fighting eight okay versus its-- all right so two damage it is now shaken as you slam it with the crucifix (shrieks) it shrieks back in this high-pitched wail and begins to push back into the shadows away from you but not far enough away to go ahead and give you a secondary melee attack against it so it's right in your face out of the line of the lantern all right that brings it to you travis go for it this would be fighting a d8 has to be max die which of the two six six does hit go ahead and roll your damage so 2d4 plus two toughness of six you go ahead and strike with the dagger and as you hit its hide it scrapes in but does not appear to leave a wound its somewhat crackled black shadowy form absorbing most of the impact of the blow and it turns and hisses at you its horrible small baby-like mouth filled with layers of sharp teeth all right your turn back we're back at the top of the round it goes back it's now going to lash out at you sydney it's going to go ahead and make its strike at you i'm going to go ahead and add six to that that is-- that's going to be a ten what's your parry six okay so it does hit you it is not a raise so it doesn't get the additional d6 damage i will spend another blue chip to go ahead and add a d6 to the damage it's already doing all right that's going to be 11 what's your toughness five that is six points of damage to you so that is considered a raise so you actually are shaken and you take a wound you are actually wounded the creature leaps out and jams its claws into your side and bites into your throat you freak out and push it back it doesn't manage to pull anything free but it does leave these giant bite marks on the side all right you're up stinky jules okay all right so your gun's already out you're going to go ahead and take all six rounds on it at minus two make your shooting roll six times minus two for each roll whatever your shooting is shooting is a d10 you're really good at shooting they both hit all right okay roll the next three you guys watch as there's a series of flashes in the center of this room as stinky jules unloads an entire fully loaded gun into this creature go ahead and roll damage for each of them every single one hit so roll 2d6 for the first shot all right so it is-- all right next one all right next one so before you get to the rest of the shots you just screaming echoing you unload as this creature turns around and its face gets shredded by a hail of bullets from your gun as it slumps to the ground and turns to ash and shadow before dissipating with a (sizzling) sound you're still-- we have ten minutes left on this game to go ahead and get to $70000 guys how close are we off- all right so so after the creature's down you spend a while searching the mine nothing else of this type seems to be down here as you make your way outside of the mine you glance and see what looks to be in the distance about four individuals running away who seem to have been tracking you you see them run towards a distant place into the shadows-- about at this point 200 feet or so it's up to you okay go ahead and make a persuasion roll all righty you watch as most of them run away and one gentleman stops and turns around death i don't want death to follow me at which point suddenly you watch as a large cougar leaps out and just tears his throat out and starts chewing into his corpse it's large for a cougar but it's not quite what you were looking for but they've all run into the forest you guys have options now you have some silver at your disposal you have-- hmm okay you have silver at your disposal you know some entity's out there right now what are you going to do sure smack across the face you feel the pain and sting on the side of your cheek it does nothing you watch at this point as stepping out of the sunlight you see eb farnum walking out with his hat he goes they're right there and he turns away to the side and you see stepping out as well the gentleman simon you met earlier and a few other individuals you see holding a couple of guns trained on you standing in the center cy tolliver you see him step out his outfit is shredded he's like if you guys had all just decided to not go poking where it didn't belong-- all right go ahead and make a faith check we just hit $70000 guys (cheering) eight that is a single raise so you do plus four damage for the next three rounds all right we shall see now at this point so at this point i want you guys all to pick a card see where you're at immediately at the top of this round you have the nine you watch as as you're preparing yourself for this moment cy hits the ground on all fours shirt begins to tear his fur bursts out of his back and all of a sudden his mouth extends teeth and it seems like an endless supply of saliva dripping onto the ground (roars) you're up first you get right into his area go ahead and roll are you going to attack with both of them so two attacks at minus two each okay here have one back everybody gets a blue chip (cheering) for right now sure blue chip to marisha and a red chip to travis one of each to marisha travis what are you doing 16 total for the first hit okay so that definitely hits go ahead and roll damage with an additional d6 ten all righty you go ahead and strike down with the blade jamming it across the front of the werewolf's form it roars you can see the exposed wound in itself it seems to be taken aback and shaken but nothing directly beyond that go for it the small bear named trinket by the way just begins to slowly hump your leg distracting you momentarily nine black chip to laura inspired apparently by the small bear coming to adolescence that hits go ahead and roll damage total one with the plus two three this one strikes through does nothing you can see it hits the flesh and tears across not able to pierce the outside of this hardened werewolf exterior all right ending your turn anyone have five or lower all right you and the wolf go at the same time oh you had an eight okay sorry so you're going next three misses five hit all right you unload bullets blasting into the werewolf's body you see it seems like almost none of the wounds have slowed it down you reload your weapon with your quick reload all right ending your turn now it's your go yeah it'll be minus two to your attacks that's to marisha actually we'll finish it don't worry you swing and it actually grabs your hand catches it in the air pulls you right in towards its jaws what are you doing 16 okay as you say this to the wolf who's holding the preacher in his face it appears to be still in the same shaken state that it was previously its eyes darting around you're about 30 feet what's your speed nope peg leg you're getting closer but not close enough as you finish that eb farnum pulls out his gun with the other two guys who have their pistols ready and they unload upon you guys okay that's a hit to you from eb who says i like my hat better that's going to be an eight nine what's your toughness yeah so that's going to be four over that's a raise you take a wound which you haven't been healed since the last one have you so you're now at two wounds oh wait that was a raise 'cause you were already shaken so that's three wounds you go right down you just get shot in the chest and fall to the ground and you're bleeding out now the two other gunmen go ahead and start firing at you and you being the scariest ones at that that's going to be yeah with the range here you get hit and you i'm going to go ahead and add six to that okay add

can to combat this overwhelming source but the perpetual spray of bullets in your direction eventually puts most of you onto the ground and as the wolf tears into your face stinky jules you scream out as the jaws of cy tolliver now extended into white and bloodied fangs rips the face from your body taking out your jugular you freak out eb farnum manages to get a crack shot that takes off the top half of your head you-- you hear a familiar voice in the back of your head go yes you followed the right path and you feel this crackling of flames over your shoulders before-- as now you realize that this voice indeed was not leading you down the right way trinket's over your body now as the werewolf has let it alone and is just humping your knee as you bleed out it's horrible time limits you feel flames on your back knowing that this entity that's been whispering into your head is not from your deity however the werewolf walks over grabs you by the arm and lifts you back onto your feet turns back toward you the preacher and goes do what you're meant to do cy commands it you watch as the visage of the fantastic sydney dissipates and in his place now standing before you instead is a humanoid cat-like tiger creature with two backwards hands (laughter) you pray as hard as you can to your deity but the pain is too hard but you can't help but scream out in horrible agony as you are gutted like a fish-- yeah there are multiple deities in this world and he's helped you a lot tonight as you are gutted in the full moonlight you hear the chuckle of cy tolliver with his somewhat
