happy birthday buddy and on that enjoy your cake and let's bring us into tonight's episode of critical role [dramatic music] no you didn't i was waiting and there was absolute silence wow this is what it's like to have respect (laughter) that's all it took and it's the last time it'll ever happen so anyway last we left off vox machina in facing the terrible threat of vecna returned to physical form sent you all through this conflict to seek audiences with a number of the deities of exandria after getting blessings and fragments of the essence of three of the gods you discovered that vecna had completed the ritual of seeding and ascended into godhood however discussing with ioun the knowing mistress it will take a little bit of time for him to both understand the extent of his power to claim his domains and expand beyond his current condensed avatar form so time is of the essence not to mention that in order to claim the full strength there needs to be a showing of power and faith to gather attention and faith from the masses so with that information you also imbued upon grog the ability to blacksmith and percival the knowledge of the construct of these divine trammels things that could possibly be used to seal and have been used previously to seal a god as killing them is a very difficult and dangerous thing retrieving this information you discovered that the place where these can be crafted is called the core anvil once belonging to the all-father the deity of construction design and craftsmanship it resides beneath an underwater volcano known as scaldseat off the shore of a city called shorecomb in issylra you also had a fantastic little run-in with vecna recently taunting you all last we left off you had found yourself in vasselheim went to the trial forge to speak with earthbreaker groon discovered what would be required to attempt to make contact with kord and you made communion with the raven queen and in declaring your complete faith in her she offered a piece of her essence to give you the third seed with which to make a third divine trammel and with you all falling asleep within scanlan's magnificent mansion you cast true polymorph on yourself to take the form of a planetar and did whatever you did in that form as you all went to sleep that evening okay both of you curl up and fall asleep the morning comes you all come to consciousness within scanlan's magnificent mansion and find breakfast of various grains and oats and quinoa yeah it's rough all right so as you finish your meals in the morning prepare yourself for the actions of the coming day what do you wish to do well pike goes up-- yes don't forget i can prepare the feast for you guys that way you don't have to spend a spell of yours for it as you guys are on this mission to go make this-- i can be help-- i think i need to stay here for now to shepherd both the people in my temple of the everlight with whatever words i can keep them calm under this chaos in the city then i can let you know i also have a sending spell prepared so if anything happens i can let you know immediately as long as you're on this plane that's what clerics are here for she punches you in the shoulder of course grog and she comes up to you and let me see your axe real fast yeah she hefts it and takes a little bit of her fading blue hair at the tip and carves off a little piece of it hands the axe back to you and very deftly braids it into a small braid ties it off and hands it to you no but seriously don't eat it please grog no no okay please be safe and if anything happens i'm going to let you know as soon as possible you guys will be fine better we save our strength for whatever's out there why would i steal the fun from you okay you hand her the chalice and she prepares the feast within the mansion so what little bit of for some of you may have been an unsatisfying breakfast this morning is quickly taken over by the fantastically tasting feast of such a holy spread taking the hour to eat it all of you guys get the benefits of heroes' feast there is a bowl of lentils for those who may want it all right so as the heroes' feast says here-- i'm going to roll 2d10 for you guys let's wait until the break whoa two nines (cheering) yes that's the maximum of your hit points for the next 24 hours so keep that in mind folks inspiring leader a creature can't gain temporary hit points from this feat again until it has finished a short or long rest so you have temporary hit points until your next long rest essentially you can it'll be temporary hit points on top of that yes wow that happened so everyone gets 18 temporary hit points right no temporary hit points so as soon as you take damage they go away from the temporary first temporary never come back then you have the maximum hit point bonus raven queen taketh away all right so as you guys are all sitting there watching keyleth dance while she eats while you're eating it's a unique display you're prepared for the rest of your day pike says goodbye to everybody gives you a hug says be safe i can do that yeah she goes done probably yeah right (laughs) you see this secondary dull flash and release of energy at her fingertips as she finishes the glyph there we go we have food now so pike makes her way toward her temple you guys are still within scanlan's mansion what are you doing yep yes it's on the floor and you can notice it because across this open clear ocean there is one column of black smoke that emits from the waves essentially the vision that you had she was topside and there was snow well tunnels that burrowed beneath the city of thar amphala no it's at the bottom of the ocean there are volcanoes underwater and this one is less burning smoke it's the sulfuric gases and poisonous fumes of the various reactions and chemicals and pressure beneath so with your things gathered you all find your way i imagine it's not too far of a walk from the raven's crest to a tree that is functional for this spell it's on the southern border of the quarter that holds the birthheart the orchards and various trees there you find yourselves a suitable tree gather yourselves steel yourselves now that the morning has come the tension in the air of vasselheim and the word that spreads of some sort of looming threat though sourceless and directionless definitely has built this air of fear and rush for preparation that surrounds you yes i'll say sure she walks you guys to the tree i can give it to a few people (laughter) that's going to tap out my spells there i'm going to have to save some for sending just in case okay this'll only last for eight hours so travel quickly you too as you guys are arguing she leans forward and beneath her breath finishes the incantation with the death ward and you vex'ahlia it sounds like a soft clinging of gentle metals in the back of your head and as it hits this warmth hits your chest and then it sets in it doesn't quite fade it's like having a localized blanket held to your sternum who else would like one i'll say for the purposes of this she can muster four so for those four that have marked it you have death ward which lasts for eight hours the first time you drop to zero hit points it brings you to one and then the spell fades all right pike sends you off with a wave and you all step through the tree you feel the transitional burst of energy as the druidic magics pull you from one living source to another and you all emerge on the outside of a tree that is barely wide enough to sustain the doorway between the two and as you all gather on the outskirts you turn around and you can see this somewhat-leafless living through the winter but not the prettiest tree you've seen the doorway portal closes behind you glancing around you there is a light snowfall and you can see slush and snow gathered dirty along the edges of the streets you are on the outskirts of the city of shorecomb population-wise it can't be more than a few thousand people at most it looks like there's a very healthy fish trade to the immediate right of you there's a cliffside maybe 200 feet from the edge of the town where there are carts going to and from you can the large crane carrying large containers and large nets filled with caught fish from the bottom of the cliffside people around noticed you emerge from a tree and you can see about four or five of the various peasants and working folk stop in their tracks and stare at you frozen this way james and he grabs his little kid's hand and the kid is slack-jawed watching you as he drags him off to the side people start walking again and still glancing over their shoulder they go about their business keeping a very close eye it's not the center of town thankfully still off to the side but you did catch the eye of a few folk no there are actual spells designed for that okay it's a couple hundred feet to get to the edge of the cliff and these are sheer cliffs that drop off for 150 200 feet or so before it hits very hard pebbled beaches these aren't sandy beaches yes you guys are at the edge of the cliff you look down and there are the rocky beaches there are a number of large docks that jut out from the rocky beach and you can see there are about five or six varying degrees of rickety winding wooden staircases that are built into the cliffside that lead from the top edge of the cliff down to the beach below you can see a lot of workers are currently hauling large sacks small crates and boxes things that are too small to bring on the large winding cranes that they have on the edge as well there are ships coming there are ships going it looks like this is a decent trade stop for cities along the shoreside here in issylra make a perception check yes 20 glancing out at this distance the sky itself is very cloudy very gray it's a very gray day it's cold it's chilly the wind that's blowing is very faint but it's enough to the point where snow is falling there is a very faint mist in the distance either a storm is coming or a storm has passed that's preventing you from seeing any sign of a glimmer of the smoke so you're not entirely certain the direction make a nature check there are people about and some of them are just passing not paying mind and few of them stop and glance at these very well-dressed very dangerous-looking figures that have now just walked up and look out past the ocean but no one's broaching any conversation they look like they're more making a wide berth or keeping a very untrusting eye on you as they walk past so what did you get what did you roll travis and oh shit okay you get the sense that a lot of the snow that was in the street when you got there and the slush was from a storm that recently passed and the clouds and the fog that you see in the distance it looks like it's blowing away okay (laughing) strangely no little girl is working at this dock however the person you did see that looked like a little girl is actually a generally short fellow who has a wrap over the top of his head a swollen cheek where it looks like he might have some sort of a tooth infection who spins around it's not a bonnet it's a crusty looking fisherman who is like who are you calling a little girl aye points out to the ocean no maybe yes i mean-- yes what do you think i'm a dog what is this kind of treatment yes i'd love to make some gold there we go straight questions he rubs his swollen cheek side you can see his teeth are graying and yellow there's a little bit of blackened decay at the edges but he grins a little bit at the sight of the gold i need a little more than that paltry sum make it five and i'll introduce you to my docksmen but you're not looking for a ship to rent right like he said all right (sniffles) volcano is that way and he points out you see he glances over he lines up where you can see a couple of larger rocks that are breaking out from the shore surface maybe 20 or 30 feet out from where the pebble beach ends and meets the water line he's lining up his arm and that way about five miles still it's too hard to see right now that i can muster puts the coins in a little pouch in the side and buttons it up and locks it all right follow me fenna you as well lass leads you guys back down one of the winding stairways and you have to wait at certain moments there are certain areas where it switchbacks and it's open you would think it's a platform for looking out but it's more for letting people get past and for the pathways up and down it gets narrow on the actual stairs but eventually you make your way down to where these docks are and there are three large buildings that are the hubs of most people checking in checking out they have a number of docksmen that are keeping tabs on what's going in and out of the dock and what materials are being shipped in taxing those that are using it temporarily general business in the vicinity he leads you over now then i'm going to introduce you to senth she can rent you something at the very least i recommend not letting that one in she has a thing against the smaller folk look i'm not-- you seem like a very fine lady but i know senth well and if you want to make a good impression maybe keep her outside stretches his lower back with a couple of cracks and snaps the hunched man gets about four five inches of height and is almost cresting about vax height fair enough i would also recommend you lower your voice we're right outside of her door senth are we done here good day hobbles off and makes his way back up the stairs so you come outside to this one dock hub it's a modest two-story building looks like it has like a watch tower second story and the bottom floor is much larger the door is currently closed the wood looks a little sea-rotted you can see the edges of the wood are curling and dark and perpetually damp little bits of green moss and various fungus are starting to gather at the very edges of the building but it seems to be standing and has been there for a while you knock on the door a voice inside goes come in that's okay as you push the door open glancing inside there's general gray dull daylight coming from the cloudy sky but there are also a few oil lanterns hanging in different places you can see stacks of maps or other heavy pieces of parchment that are curled up and tied off in sections there are small crates most of them empty that are scattered about the entranceway here and as you enter the building you watch as a very tall thin lanky female half-orc spins around across the room with a singular monocle that is very very intense to make one eye look really big over the other spins around sides of the head shaved and the rest of it slicked back against the head with a little bit of a light brown shock against the black to one side dressed fairly nice but you can see the clothing at an immediate glance is nice upfront and then tatters at the bottom spins around yes you watch as the one eye moving independently of the other glances and looks each of you very quickly up and down and then slicks back into place that can be arranged yes how long would you wish to charter this ship do you have a crew very well then yes three days' rental including a crew on board that'll run you approximately 150 gold pieces i require to be in case you lose the ship or don't return with it an additional 500 to hold in case you lose the ship so a grand total of 650 up front with 500 to be returned upon your return oh but of course i would not dream of allowing such a thing without a paper trail follow me a quick contract is drawn up you take a glance over it percival seems very thorough but nothing beyond what was requested and basically if the ship is not returned all money is forfeit when the ship is returned a very intense investigation and perceived state of the ship is going to be requested from an appraiser to see if any damage was taken yeah it's essentially like one of those seedy car rental places that the contract says they will ding you for every damage slaps the contract down in front have we a deal very well the one eye is still looking at you the other is (buzzing) in front of the bracelet i find this acceptable in our agreement flings it back and there is an expression of of course a gnome would do that if this was a telltale game it would say her hatred for gnomes deepens all right immediately puts it into a small shelf writes down some remarks on it very well i will show you to the shore shanty follow me please leads you out to one of the far end docks and there are a number of decent ships and larger fishing ships some faster-travel ships some long boats you see one galleon-sized ship that's just left and taken away and on the far end there is one of the shittiest tugboat-sized boats you've seen in a while scanlan you've seen boats like this and they're largely used for either relatively cheap and relatively quick messenger services a courier ship if you will that's about it well that would not behoove me i wish to keep my ships at dock where they're safe the crew is included go say hello hope to see you back in a few days whips around and walks her way back yeah we'll say that that was your intent last time that you made the conversion to platinum there are three two of them appear to be the crustiest barnacles-- the gentleman that you met earlier fenna looks like the brother of these two that mated that really lived the life both of these men that are inside that're playing cards hunched over the table can't be younger than their early sixties one of them has a big thick gnarled white beard that darkens at the tips which you can only imagine as most hair tends to get lighter at the tips means it's crusted with stuff they're both wearing general seafaring garb and tattered clothing they're muscular their skin is very tanned one of them's wearing a heavy knitted cap that folds back onto itself and rests on his shoulder to the side they are both playing cards and they look over i guess it's time to work takes the cards pulls them up from the table all right where we going both look at each other all right let's wake up santy santy of the shanty technically this is captain santy of the shore shanty yeah it's a mouthful you watch as this large gentleman walks over and slams his fist on this small wooden-- ugh my brain isn't working thank you a hatch in the ground we've got customers and you hear this rustling beneath and all of a sudden the hatch slams up and barreling out from underneath you see the drunkest most unshaven unwashed gnarled goliath you've ever seen no facial hair but bits of frizzled dark hair in the back which is interesting very few goliaths grow hair now what's interesting about this too is the size isn't as large as you height-wise but width is about matching yours so this is a bowling ball of a goliath steps up on the top (grunts) actually yeah that's a good point but if danny devito also was doing iron man competitions for a number of years and then let himself go so he has the bulk of the muscle underneath but then-- yeah doesn't say a word just looks at you all and then walks out onto the deck of the ship make a perception check it is dark but you can smell the rum well one of the two older gentlemen that were there the one that knocked on the hatch goes (hums) sticks his hand out the side of the doorway maybe two hours three hours they pull the sail up they get everything ready they go ahead and undock from the dock pull up anchor and the general wind because it's cliffside here the wind is pretty strong right here at the bay so immediately the sail billows open and the ship takes off and they begin to curve in the direction loosely of where you were pointed earlier you're the crazy monkey on the island that kept fucking shit up all right as you set sail the wind picks up speed is enhanced and you gather at this rate probably in under two hours you'll probably make it to the destination with the help of the air ashari-- so as it guides on captain santy stands at the front of the ship glancing out this giant square jaw just nestled right into where the pecs meet up beneath the thick sweater that's almost hanging off the arms at this point no cap balding head with the scraggly hair in the back and just looks off in the distance the rest of the two are just sitting back where there are various jugs of some unseen liquid keeping tabs on the sail it's a very leisurely lackadaisical energy on this ship front to back i'd say it's about 25 feet this is a tiny ship it's 25 to 30 feet captain you say this to the captain he goes-- and he points out and you glance out at where santy of the shore shanty is and you can see in the distance there's a little line of dark that is rising out of the ocean rocks fall everyone dies quickly enough you begin to approach and you can now see what was a thin column is now a fairly large billowing stream of dark fume that you can see as the waves get larger and larger the further out you go certain swells some of it breaks up and it chains and snakes upward based on how it's finding its way to the surface eventually you get within maybe 30 40 feet of where it breaks the surface there and the sails fall into loose and are tied around the bottom anchor is thrown off the side chain is let down and then eventually the captain turns back and-- laura and glances over the side as soon as you say that question the two other older gnarled gentlemen on the ship go (noises of warning) captain is just staring at you (spits) spits on the ground before you yeah all right with that you all have water breathing yeah he's as good at swimming as half of your party perfect as each of you make your way into the water (splashing) you can smell by the way the fumes because you see the dark color of it you immediately envision or at least instinctively prepare for the smell of fire smoke or a fireplace as soon as it hits you it's a very acrid sharp metallic smell with hints of sulfur and other chemicals that burn the inside of your nose and sinuses immediately it's the proximity being near you can smell occasionally as the wind blows through a whiff gets to you you all make your way under the surface and begin to swim down following with your vision where the source of this dark column of fume is it's all right i'd say about 60 feet or so before it gets a little murky okay all right so you guys make your way down below who's leading this i should get a marching order for underwater by the way percy has the light too all righty all righty grog you're sinking faster than most anybody is trinket in your necklace or swimming as well okay so trinket's trying to keep up next to you scanlan where are you all right so you guys begin making your way down you can breathe the water just fine as you descend 40 60 feet 80 feet it's funny you mention equalizing and i can't help but try and do it myself now i'll say because you have the earring it's a little garbled but you can hear it a little bit you can make out the gist of things but depending on how fast you're talking it could be hard to hear it's getting darker and darker the further down you descend and the water gets murkier and murkier it also gets warmer (chuckles) i was waiting for it it's good it leads you into it descending further and further the only visible light that you have is the one that percival is shining below and as it goes through you can see it reveals another 40 or so feet ahead of you and then as you pass over it suddenly becomes shorter and then longer again as it comes and hits the smoke and you can see the smoke and the fume now it's billowing up at a rapid pace and the water is getting hotter and hotter to the point where now it's starting to feel like a sauna about another 20 or so feet and it's hot enough to stand but it's getting really uncomfortable and with percival's light you can see the bottom (soft impact) you guys all land there at the bottom of the ocean it's so dark that outside of percival's light and the glow around you you only see the outline of each other from the splash-back of the light as he projects it around you're underwater i will say you get a little bit there and it's fighting against it it's a very faint glow you can see where keyleth is but it doesn't add any light to the rest of this travis and make a perception check you guys both have disadvantage on this by the way because of the lack of visibility all right so glancing down you can see you guys are standing on a rising upward cone the top of the volcano at this point where you can see all the ground below you especially immediately around where the water or the fume is gushing out is porous dark rock there's no soot there's no soft surface that you hit there's no usual bottom of the ocean you expect yeah no sediment it's just hard rock the force of the vents seems to be pushing any of the sediment off and it descends slowly around you and disappears into the darkness you can see a number of small-- strangely enough with the heat of the surrounding area too you can see little bursts of color within the porous rock and with a quick glance vax you can see there are bits of plant life colorful pinks and purples that are slowly pulled into the porous rock on the outside of these vents you can see a very faint glow in a couple of places of the rock where it looks there is still some sort of very hot very slow pressurizing molten rock that is cooling slowly it looks like there's this constant slow battle between the ocean water and whatever's forcing upward (whispering) don't please (laughter) right now where it's emerging these jets of extremely hot fume that are billowing past you it looks like there's one concentrated opening at the moment as you walk around it looks like it's not one central column it looks like there's a number of smaller fissures that are all clustered around this area and it's hard to see the separation because so much of it's mashing into one giant column as it emerges you can certainly try oh water will fuck with you as a fire elemental you could you don't know your visibility vanishes about 40 feet away from you you're seeing little glows within the actual areas where the fumes are spewing up you're seeing down where the smoke is emerging you're seeing every now and then a faint glow that appears here and there yeah it looks like the glow is stationary it's just the smoke obscuring it as it passes by and occasionally gives you a glimpse because of the nature of this the radius is limited to 300 feet because it's considered a somewhat underground not out-in-the-open setting all right so you take the minute and concentrate beneath and with that all of a sudden you feel your conscious extend into the rock and stone and the various forms of plant life that have made home around the outskirts of the top of this volcano's caldera your questions are no you feel the sense of the rock and the surrounding material guide your attention very focused into the center of where that fume is erupting hostile creatures in the area terrain bodies of water prevalent plants minerals animals or peoples powerful celestials fey fiends elementals or undead you do get a very faint sense of elemental movement you're not quite sure what that pertains to specifically but it is moving just outside the radius of your sphere of understanding here at the top of the volcano and it is moving slowly through rock resistant to yeah the heat isn't bothering you as much it helps with extreme heat as a general weather type but intensely dangerous heat like fire or anything it's not going to help you with that so you dive into the center you watch as vax disappears into the liquid the pressure is a lot i need you to make an athletics check first you swim down into the darkness and you're using your sense of balance to keep tabs on what is up and what is down because once you dive into the middle of this pillar you see nothing and you begin to swim down feeling for where the gravity is pulling you and the force against you and use that to get your bearings you can faintly see a little bit of it there you do take three points of fire damage as soon as you enter the water reduced to one so you manage to push through and descend about 15 or so 20 feet you suffer another six points of fire damage reduced to three need you to make another athletics check please as you're pushing further and further down a six it begins to push you up you lose a little bit of ground you take another one point of fire damage you begin to make up and you get partway down you get another 40 or so feet down into it you think still unable to really see anything occasionally you see a glint of that light that you saw before the little bit of glow you take another three points of fire damage reduced to one it is a lot of heat but you continue to push further make another athletics check a third one 20 (grunting) pushing along still making your way down making your way down you get probably another 80 or so feet before it seems to curve off a little bit to the side the force of the water begins to shift a little bit you take another three points of fire damage you begin to see a faint bit of that glow that you were following earlier and as you head towards it the heat gets more and more intense you begin to push past some of the smoke and you can see right there looks like there's a glowing ember of rock about five or six feet wide that is molten rock that is slowly cooling as it's being pushed faintly out but the force of the water curves off to the side and you continue to swim away from where that glowing ember is and following the path of where this push of water is you take another two points of fire damage the temperature is going up you continue to swim continue to swim further down further down further down make another athletics check okay you're slowing down a bit but you're still getting ground you also take another three points of fire damage this is getting hard and even your form you're getting a little tired having to go against this force and you're not quite sure where this is going to lead you you're not going to stumble across an opening where it's fine to walk you're continuing to swim down a superheated-- okay make another athletics check okay you get pushed back about 15 feet or so and you take another three points of fire damage okay you ride up before you can get entirely out of the column you take another three points of fire damage and eventually emerge from the side of it uncomfortable yes which comparatively is much more comfortable you have the earring on you can certainly try he was gone for about a minute minute and a half both percival and scanlan make an intelligence check please just whatever you roll plus your intelligence modifier 14 on this discussion of burrowing deeper within if there were any places where you could walk that were not completely filled with water per se the minute you exposed it it would begin to fill with water which means you'd have think of a way to either plug it or just stay wherever water exists within the system beneath you only have the construct of the actual trammel not the anvil more that you can also part water don't forget as a part of this too you can also part water yeah or redirect flow or create a whirlpool there are all things you can do okay so you guys begin to make your way around spiraling the outside of this okay what are you looking for okay everyone who's looking make an investigation check as you guys are glancing about for over the next 15 or so minutes just swimming around and keeping an eye out there keyleth with your glowing hands and cruising across as you head down you can feel a couple of other small changes in the current less of a fume release more than there is a warmer area of water in a small area and you find there is a pressurized jet of water coming out of one section maybe about 25 to 30 feet down on the side i'd say it's between about three feet long on one side and about a foot long on the other it's a fissure no no trinket or grog neither of them can fit most of you guys have to squeeze through and it's as hot as the water that was coming out of the top it's considered rock it's volcanic rock yeah dirt sand or clay so i'm going to say no if you have a means of doing that you could you want to punch a volcano roll a strength check i'll give you advantage on this because it's a volcano punch well no the gauntlets don't give him advantage but they do give him siege and he does double damage against structures and i'll consider this a natural structure you rear back and as you do you guys watch you haven't really watched him use this type of power in the dark before and you watch as the faint bit of a few yellow runes glow as he pulls back and then slams into the side and you watch as rock breaks and bits of the volcanic rock break off and begin to tumble down the sides he punches again and punches again and as you do watch the water flow you feel the warmth come up you immediately take six points of fire damage from the heated jet in front of you but as you slam it one more time part of it (rock collapsing) gives away underneath as one side of it begins to jet up you watch as it looks like there is a gap or an air pocket that collapses inward and the water begins to fill in immediately okay you guys are all fighting against the current well there was an air pocket that you saw but the stone as he punched in as soon as it collapsed inward it was away from where the jet was it's a very interesting thing to try and describe here in a theater of mind scenario yeah essentially you've opened up where the jet's strength has diminished a little bit at the surface at this point and you've watched as you've punched and there will be another chamber below that was an air chamber collapsed inward and ocean water is rushing into it right now okay so control water takes an action to cast so as soon as that happens you finish the spell and as the ocean water begins to rush in (water rushing) it immediately pulls back out and you can actually stop the current that's blowing upward and heated water is held in place and you can look down below the water is this slightly shimmering barrier and there is a small air-filled chamber below actually looking down inside it looks to be roughly 20 or so feet wide on almost any other side and it looks to be that there's a small still pool that is there in the ground it's a small air pocket okay you all rush inside there you land past it and it's about a 15 foot drop you all land on your feet or stumble off to one side and catch yourself but you're now in this chamber beneath keyleth currently yeah as soon as the water pushes away it begins to pull back and immediately you can hear the rush of the ocean suddenly oppressively darting downward to fill the space where you are and then with that (slamming) you watch as volcanic stone stretches out and slams shut you're now in a pitch-black room except for the surface of his light and the glowing of keyleth's hands as you guys have this conversation you're talking and sounds are happening everything's fine but (exhales) breath is hard all of the air in here is poisoned there is no oxygen in this room there is that pool of water in the center maybe four-foot wide and you can see it's kind of bubbling a bit like whatever the fume is that's filled the space is-- you're not poisoned you're not having toxic shock and dying right now but you're suffocating it's not affecting you you're fine the bubbling of air there is the same fume here oh the water breath itself oh with the water breathing the water you can breathe okay 18 you go in and take a breath and you look down below especially with the light and the lamp that's going around you can see where this is happening this little pool it's another small tube that descends farther and curves away out of sight well from what you can see before it curves off it looks like it could probably fit everybody okay looking down it does it's a curvature off it looks like at one point there was some sort of an escape or at least that jet that you originally found earlier part of it got blocked off and while the get of water continued the opening here kind of got covered with some sort of liquid rock and it created this pocket you can swim down there who knows where it leads but it does not appear to have any sort of a forceful jet essentially you have to cast it again though because you lost concentration permanent and concentration yeah okay i'll let you go with that well how the spell works is if you maintain concentration for the whole duration it becomes permanent for the whole duration which is ten minutes it's fine don't worry about it okay so percival goes first followed by vax then vex grog is trinket still swimming along with you all right and then that's scanlan and keyleth at the very end all right you guys dive past under the water it curves and you can see there's a faint light source in the distance this curves below it splinters downward and then curves up slightly and that's where the light source is coming from make a stealth check all right you think you're pretty stealth you think you're pretty stealth go upward okay as you get up you see a familiar orangeish-red glow and as you see the surface of water above you there's another looks like an air pocket you emerge you look about and it looks like there is another tunnel here but there's a faint glow it looks like there are small veins of cooling volcanic rock in this area the tunnel continues there's actually ground that you can walk on that continues down and curves out of the way you can see fairly with your elven vision yeah and with your dagger so yeah you begin to walk on the surface the surface is cooled and it's very hot in here but not painfully so like when you dove into the caldera itself you walk down about ten or 15 feet and you see it's now breaking off in various directions you can see small pockets where it closes off areas where it looks like whatever air or gases were trapped up when parts of the volcano would expand and pressurize upward it would trap these areas but you see areas where liquid rock are spilling into and creating small pools and it continues to descend almost like a curved spiral around the way very faint trickles and cools slowly on the floor you go around the bend and you can hear faintly the rushing of water muffled you're not that far away you gather from spatial awareness as to where the heavy pressure of the water that was forced upward you can faintly feel the vibration but as you curve away it gets dimmer and dimmer as you spiral off further away from the center of this volcano and as it continues to spiral downward this natural air pocket cavern it splits again into a small opening where it's settled faintly orange glowing with spots of black molten rock that's slowly cooling the path curves around the way and it splits into two pockets of this cooling rock and then maybe about a five-foot leap to continue downward your favorite i know you don't have enough information to do that yeah you guys all emerge from the water to gather up with vax okay as you all take a deep breath under the water and get to the surface you make a test breath and the air in this pocket is still poisonous and not breathable so you guys are going to have to take a deep breath under the water and hold your breath as you make your way down that tunnel yep all right it's a decent jump to get over the lava it's not a hard one necessarily but i want you to make an athletics check anyway six total of six you run and make a leap and you're pretty sure you made it but one foot (sizzle) right into it taliesin and it's the same foot taliesin and thankfully your armor is set to resist what would have been 56 damage is reduced to 28 fire damage to you you pull out real fast (sizzle groan) it burns and burns and burns kick it off you keep walking around the curvature and it takes about two minutes or so of brisk travel to get around the corner where you can see another pool of warm water so as you guys are aware you can hold your breath for a number of minutes equal to one plus your constitution modifier you were making a careful path if you were to continue to dash full dash run it would be close you can try it all right trinket in the necklace yeah you can it fills with fresh water to the surface yeah fine this is the funnest work-around i love it essentially you guys are gravity-bonging your way through an underwater volcano if that's not vox machina i don't know what is all righty so as you guys make your way around the way through the combination of that druid spell and strangely grog's ingenuity you guys have bypassed a fairly serious situation you make it down around the curvature of the tunnel to where that small lava jump is anybody who wants to make that leap go ahead and make an athletics check please it does so go ahead and make an athletics check athletics 15 yeah you coast over it's like a soft neo jump not quite that far but you coast and land onto the side grog what did you get 21 you guys all make it across that little stretch of molten rock without an issue you continue around the way vex and vax as you guys are making heavy footfalls and making some distance you begin to feel this (rumbling noise) rumbling in the ground beneath you okay i would like all of you to make a stealth check right now barely plus ten the rumbling stops as you all quietly stand still you begin to get bold to take a few more very faint steps on the ground the rumbling continues and gets louder and louder all right i'm going to go to break i'm hungry all right yeah so we'll pick up from that rumbling here at the end of the break we'll see you guys back here in a moment we have quite the giveaway today we have a spalted tamarind complete dice tower system three pieces from our friends at wyrmwood this is actually this is percival's wood type it's nice with a leather interior from our friends at wyrmwood one lucky winner's going to get this to enter this find your way to the twitch chat and when requested during the break go ahead and enter the word volcano that will put you in the entry we'll come back with a winner in a minute we're going to go ahead and have a quick break with some food and we'll see you here in a minute guys [break] yeah that was making up for the beginning of the game we have a winner in the chat we have johnny2x40 as the winner congratulations johnny2x40 danoba will contact you shortly to get your information and we'll get that shipped out to you asap signed by the cast congratulations all right so as the rumbling continues to grow and swell you all hold yourselves in place (rumbling crashing) you hear the crumbling and crashing of stone and rock as from the side of the hallway right next to where grog is standing maybe about a foot and a half in front of him you watch some large pointed object pierce through the wall maybe about nine feet tall or so go (explosion) out sending dust and rock spilling out and there's a faint orange glow from some smooth armored head to some large creature with a toothy mouth that opens up and (chomping) as it bites down you see rows and rows of teeth that are glowing orange as bits of molten rock are spilling out the sides of the mouth yeah i hope it's better than that you recognize the shape of the front especially you percival as you spent some time with a creature of a similar shape no because it has two big muscular trunk-like arms as it (crash crash) out in front but it has no eyes it has the solid armored front and heated edges where the plates meet it seems to be some sort of elemental-infused or variant of the bulette that you encountered before and as it breaks through and stops mere inches from grog-- turn that thing off (snarls) across the way you hear a low rumble again (snarls) it stomps the ground and you watch from one of the other walls (explosion) jutting from it a smaller version and a second emerges (explosion) two children they both emerge going (snarls) as you're all standing there holding perfectly still (sniffs) one of them turns around and starts walking slowly towards the direction that grog is the large mother and turns grog and you have to lean back as the nose sweeps past and is facing right in your direction you can see these large holes in the front of its armored snout go (sniffing) the mouth slightly cracks open and curls back into what you could almost imagine to be a grin well as none of you have done anything at this point in time i need you all to roll initiative so grog who was stopped here was the last to leap keyleth made it all the way over here broom over here vax where were you you were stealthed so you would be over here stealthing behind this rock into your eyes sam that's why i do this all right so initiative order 25 to 20 20 to 15 you don't know all right and you're 17 you said all right all right 15 to ten all righty so top of the round as all of them seem to have shifted in the direction of grog who is now quietly raging vex you're up first what do you want to do which one all righty so go ahead and make your attacks it's true look at that she says to you 25 hits so it's 4d8 lightning damage so you made the attack roll it hit so it takes that grog make a dexterity saving throw please all right so 15 damage and then 2d8 to grog roll 2d8 and you take half that because you made your save yeah what's the damage five damage to you grog five total or that's halved all right you take two points of lightning damage not too bad lightning arrow-- well no interesting point of order lightning arrow is a bonus action so no hunter's mark so no hunter's mark but you hit it with the lightning arrow next round you can worry about that that's your first attack you have your second attack you did not do your sneak attack damage last round so if you wanted to do sneak attack damage on this you can which means you also double the sneak attack damage and that's with the additional sneak attack 33 points of damage to it as you release the lightning arrow it slams into it (growling) the look shoots in the direction where it came from and as it opens up its snout to smell you fire a second arrow into its mouth and it starts writhing in place as it does it shakes and you feel the ground quake in the presence and a few rocks (impacts) from the ceiling and the children join the wail and they all turn in your direction you going to do anything else on your turn yeah you get on your broom that's all you do all righty grog you're up at the beginning of your turn the heat emanating from this bulette that's right next to you is rather intense you immediately suffer-- from proximity to its searing body-- 11 points of fire damage these are considered monstrosities the top of the cavern would be about maybe ten feet ten to 12 feet 21 hits 36 points of damage on that first hit not bad the axe cracks into the side of its body and you see the armor crack a little bit where it hits you pull the axe free you can see the blood pour out as it spills and hits the ground (sizzle) you can see the actual blood in their body is superheated as well okay not reckless 20 hits you did that misses this is this one time where you do swing and it hits but the angle of the axe blade hits the edge of its head plate armor and scrapes off the top with a shower of sparks off to the side no damage well yeah you were beginning to quietly rage scanlan you're up ten feet five feet that's what i'm checking i thought i had one prepared we'll say for the purposes of this because it is the same size as a large creature right we will use good old doty as the current size of your planetar you need to be there because otherwise you'd be stepping in the lava so that's it you can continue to move if you want well you've moved maybe 15 feet i'd say you probably have at his flying speed maybe a third of his fly speed left (chuckles) so there is that this guy here you fly to him and you're gliding above right now over here (gliding noises) okay you're currently floating above the lava it's not affecting you as you (whoosh) fly by because you're flying no i will say the mom bulette does not notice you pass it does not get an attack of opportunity essentially all right that ends your turn vax okay 17 does not hit (dagger ricochets) ricochets off that does hit oof nice great so that one seeing the glow of the slight crack in the armor that grog had left the dagger disappears inside the slight gap and you see this (spurt) of super hot thick viscous blood spill out and hit the side of the rock and then cool and darken as it does across the side of the cavern wall there you go sam and all right that ends your turn no it felt awesome i didn't have to do a damn thing all right yes the hunter's mark damage that's an additional six damage all right infuriated it's now starting to stomp in the middle and as it's hitting the lava's starting to splash up around it the babies this one right here is only going to make a bite attack right now it can't make a leap because you're too close to it but as you rush towards it it seems to sense your presence and the movement of the wings (wing flap) keeping you aloft and the baby's going to (snapping) and lash out towards you that is 18 does not hit as it snaps out towards you its saliva seeming to spray superheated liquid (saliva spray) across does not attack you at all (laughter) the other baby watches you go running past it's going to go ahead and make a deadly leap 15 (landing) on you (whoosh) that brings it here if that was the case half you guys would've been dead a long time ago all right i need you to make a strength or dexterity saving throw your choice 27 okay so you're not knocked prone but you do take-- let's see here 19 points of damage bludgeoning and slashing you are pushed five feet out of its space all righty that's the two babies' turn keyleth you're up i could say you could do that yeah all righty nope nope and nope no one makes their save this big hulking thing 52 points of damage 59 damage against all three of them so as you stand in the middle and watch one of them leap past and pounce onto your lover as he's pushed out of the way you see grog now facing off with this giant gnashing mouth that is spilling forth super-hot liquid the lava glowing in the distance you're having flashbacks to the last time you dealt with lava you concentrate for a second and release the blast of energy as it arcs off (explosions) slamming into each of them you see them shake and quiver their muscles tensing as they shriek in the middle of the cavern (shrieks) they stagger backward hurt but seemingly still holding on all right percy your turn okay is that all you're going to do with your turn all right that's your turn all right now it's the mama bulette's turn mama bulette has been facing grog this whole time after taking the dagger and watching you run past seeming ready to leap but with you still right in front of it she'll attack you that is a natural 18 this is important so that's a total of 31 to hit so that's 45 points of piercing damage halved we'll say 22 plus 13 points of fire damage and you are swallowed on an attack roll of an 18 to 20 it swallows the target and literally i rolled a natural 18 apparently man you are blinded and restrained currently it now begins to (thudding) go right up into melee range with keyleth who blasted it with the chain lightning before that brings us to the top of the round vex you're up go for it how'd that go again generally you have to decide that before you roll your attack you can't just add it on like oh i rolled well i'll say no not for that first attack you can for your second that does hit all right 32 points that is a 20 as the arrow slams into the side the brambles reach around and you watch as these thorny vines that wrap around the body begin to blacken and burst into flame by the proximity the brambles begin to burn to cinders and then break off the body as it storms forward do it you're up next grog holy shit that'll hit well bramble shot gets to see if it hits or not it's not lost if you missed if you hit you can say bramble shot same way that divine smite can be done do that that's usually how you're supposed to do it 60 points of damage with one shot and secondary saving throw 70 points of damage with a single arrow you didn't add your sneak attack damage a second time did you okay good that is nasty it rolled a natural 16 plus six for its strength saving throw so it's not affected by the bramble however it is looking rough the second arrow hits the side and you watch as it streaks pieces of the armor fall off to the side you can see the striations of its muscle and where the muscle tissue is it's dark but at the seams it's glowing orange there you go extra two damage but now it's bleeding everywhere wherever it's walking you can see it thrashing about it's spilling off this heated liquid that's pouring out of its wounds does that end your turn okay that ends your turn grog you're up first things first at the start of your turn because you are swallowed by the mom you suffer 42 points of fire damage oh it has to make a constitution saving throw to see if it spits him up first actually because you did more than 40 points of damage that is a 22 yeah it's fine wait no it's 25 dc no it does not you do not take the damage because she did enough damage with that crit hit arrow that it vomits you up you are prone that would have been a good 42 points of damage yep (sizzling) there's steam grog it's your turn all right that's been it every time yes you may yeah that hits how do you want to do this (cheering) after it finishes vomiting you up and you get off the ground still feeling the sizzling of its salivary liquid on your body you sing this song to yourself as it rights itself its mouth opens once more you bring the axe down right above its head you crack the center of its armored plate the top of its head caves in and you watch as the eyes go dull and the body collapses and falls to the ground unmoving its body is still there though because it's very big it only loses about two feet of height as it collapses and it's still blocking a large portion of that hallway right now that's your first hit you still have half of your movement still because you used half of it to get up from prone using your boots or just making an athletics check as part of your movement go ahead and make your athletics check you have 25 more feet you can use your piece look at that yeah you could you can make an acrobatics check to see if you can avoid the lava as you do that all right make an acrobatics not athletics 16 you just barely make it around that corner curling around yeah you don't go foot-first in the lava like somebody else did earlier that's about where you can get to that's the end of your turn grog scanlan you're up go ahead and roll for an attack 21 hits the babies don't have quite as hard armor as you bring the greatsword down you strike with a large swipe of bright divine radiant energy as it slams into the top of its head it explodes with radiant power you roll damage the stats are for me 4d6 plus seven slashing yeah dude planetar form isn't messing around 39 yes so first off i forgot earlier grog you did take another seven points of fire damage from being in the proximity of the corpse which is still emanating heat by the way correct well at the top of your turn you got that because you did not enlarge inside and you also as your planetar form did take ten points of fire damage in your proximity to that one there as well so mark that however you with that first strike slam down and cleave the head in half you watch as the baby's head (gravelly shriek) it had taken 49 damage before from her chain lightning so with that second hit (whack) it (gurgles) and falls to the ground no longer moving there is only one currently living child on the battlefield 18 still hits that was 12 plus seven so 19 damage 19 plus 19 38 damage that kills it yeah so you hack one down dart across the way with your blade screaming in the air it actually cuts through the rock as it sparks across the ceiling with what little space you have your wings open slam down on the second child and watch as its armored body cracks open the radiant blast expands and bursts when the blade is actually dug a few inches into its form causing you to destroy it from the inside of its armored shell you watch as its body inflates for a second then falls limp as smoke begins to pour from its wounds so with that you guys have wiped out the current danger on the battlefield yeah i pulled my leg earlier this week so moving up and down sucks so as you sit there in the silence there for a moment just hearing the occasional (plopping) with the nearby lava that fills the nearby hallway you don't feel any further rumbling there's just the heat emanating from the corpses of these three magma bullettes what do you do make an investigation check i'd say more of a perception check for this this is less of searching for details the pathway still continues to descend and curve around but that's it most of you aside from percival can see decently in low light anyway or have darkvision you as a planetar let's see here well you have a pretty high con bonus you could hold your breath for seven minutes previous spells and bonuses that's an interesting point okay i'll allow it you still have the same effect earlier that she put on you so you still have the water breathing you're flying in here with the small space you have being a large creature the fact that you even flew across-- you were only a few inches off the ground as you darted over it's only about ten to 12 feet and you're maybe nine feet tall correct you're maybe 40 seconds away from it you guys dart around the corner and follow the next pool you have your means of passing water around keeping yourselves viable the path continues to curve in a haphazard spiral it curves around and you watch as it passes evens out and then goes into a fairly steep decline a 45-degree decline this is further than you covered there's the pool of water you saw and if you continue around that way you can see it curve as you glance around and it descends in a steady decline it's a small little pit the pool of water by the way as you glance down and look past the surface it does have a cylindrical tube that is feeding the liquid into it but it's much smaller it gets to that big of a pinching point before it vanishes out of sight of the pool continuing down the path of the tunnel as it curves around and goes into the decline it continues and maintains its width of about 15 to 20 feet on either side you glance down the decline and there's a portion of the ground that opens up and glowing molten rock slowly drips and dribbles down for about 40 or 50 feet you glide down your own way the air is extremely warm as it passes by you holding your breath at this point because you are not near any source of water it looks like and you're not carrying one with you you glide down rapid speed past the lava which eventually comes and cools in a clump a small mound where it seems a recent hole punched out of and began to dribble down it's been cooling and causing this extra layer on the tunnel everything here seems to be in this weird state of flux you continue past it and it drops into a tunnel below maybe about 20 or 30 feet wide descends downward straight down you descend about 30 or 40 feet this cylinder-like tunnel comes to a halt it stops you are not detecting any evil no do you have darkvision in this form it says truesight you don't have darkvision you have everything vision given that case as soon as you land you look up and you can see across the rock here there is one portion of the wall that is smoother than the rest in a concave perfect square across the opposite side you can see faint runes or glyphs that are pressed into the stone like part of it has been untouched for quite some time because you can read any language right yeah okay glancing at the glyphs here there are roots of magical arcane glyphs here but whatever enchantment there was here is very faint it's more about the message or image that is set here it is an exit seal it is a final word of those that utilized the space within it translates to here the crafter's halls lay dark the means of making the world ender gone allhammer protect us all the allhammer make a religion check recalling that information you have this information in your mind i'll say as long as you didn't roll a one the allhammer is one of the prime gods of family craft and construction of fine important things it is the patron saint of all craftsmen blacksmiths forgemasters artisans and from the information you received from ioun the creator of and last user of the core anvil it was an exit phrase placed on this door by the last person who was in this just so everyone here understands imagine between most conversations there's somebody doing that into a small jar of water it is getting a little thick (laughter) who's doing what to get down there you (footsteps) on the side grog and keyleth on the carpet you two on the broom you flying we're good the rest of you guys descend down at a 45-degree grade and make it past where the lava stopped and cooled and collected and thickened up eventually you find the area where it drops off into darkness below in this cylindrical tunnel you make it down the 30 or so feet to where it stops it takes you a moment based on where scanlan points you towards but you can make out the runes he was mentioning percy you're the only one who can read them no indicator of that it was essentially (door click) key is locked up forever bye bless this seal you get that sense the forge was made by and for the use of the allhammer and the allhammer is locked somewhere on his own plane across the other side of the divine gate and has been for 800 years natural volcanic rock it's that same crumbly porous black stone it feels like the rest of the surrounding stone make an investigation check no current sign of anything what are you going to say ocean bean putting the words and thoughts out there prayer is still a foreign thing to you that you're still learning to do there's no words that respond but you do get a warm sense pushing you forward you get the idea from whatever guidance pelor is sending your direction that you can translate from your only recently somewhat-faithful heart that you're on the right path that's as much as you can muster from the conversation this is an interesting point i should have recalled grog are you still in your large form or not how did you use the magic carpet to get across that carpet will not carry you in your large form the passageway heading downward would probably be somewhere in the neighborhood of between 15 to 20 feet well the drop wasn't the issue it was the 40 feet of lava that was curling down from a logistical standpoint i recalled that okay so what are you guys going to do no the runes aren't glowing you get the sense scanlan that it was less that they were glowing more that your truesight revealed the presence-- you are a little neo in the matrix in this new physical form make an investigation check 22 glancing about with the help of his light as well you look and you can see most of the rock is jagged and broken in places and as you feel the edges some parts flake off relatively easy and when you get to the section of where that rectangular piece of the wall is that the glyphs are put across it looks like it's a little smoothed over like someone smoothed it down to make this intentional seal but there's no sign of any sort of keyhole or handle or anything it's heavy stone make a strength check liam laura and it's a d12 26 you jam your hands into the wall and push as you push and shove your fingers are grinding and breaking the actual stone until they feel something metal it goes from crumbling stone to a metallic surface and as you pull your hands back a little bit you pull away these giant chunks of volcanic stone the actual runes and glyphs breaking around your grasp and you can look inside and see hammered dark metal on the other side you then put your hand in and shove as hard as you can and with a very faint grinding you feel it give about an inch then another inch and then eventually it gives out suddenly and you watch as suddenly the entire square structure falls inward with a slamming echo sound that echoes again and again down a stairway that disappears from view about 20 feet ahead of you natural 20 doesn't mean you succeed necessarily all right both of you glance throughout the initial-- -- steps into the hallway which is now littered with broken rock for the first ten feet or so with a platform where the large rectangular metal structure fell over no signs of any traps no signs of any tweaking with the floor or walls for any triggers you do notice that the metal surfaces here are a texture of rough hammered metal you can see the series of small indentations like all these have been hammered into place and it looks like the seams where these large metallic wall slabs would be have a thin little placed bar over those as well you've gone from central volcano natural emerging and expanding rock and lava to a place of very intense intended construct make an intelligence check well this would be just an intelligence check just a straight modifier ten (sighs) you're not entirely certain of the metal it is a dark dull slate gray a little darker than that even and elements of the edges appear to be almost red almost like a rust or ruddy color but you don't recognize what type of metal it is necessarily okay you rolled a natural 20 using luck you've used three lucks today the campaign guide was something that was for other people to use (laughter) right i'm saying for the purposes of the guide being released and you embracing your fate-touched nature and the extremely dutiful adherence to the law of your raven queen sure i'll give you a fate-touched additional fourth luck you get an awesome angel dick (laughter) angel wang by the way is a good band name all right all right so this hallway that you guys have pushed through now it's about 20 feet wide 30 feet tall and this long ceiling gradually curves to an apex point like two adjoining sides of a roof and it continues to progress forward and then descends with the staircase you put your hand out and feel it and yes they are not like (sizzle) but your hand can rest for a few seconds before you have to remove it they're very hot all right so you leading right okay so as you begin first thing you notice the steps they're long steps they are about three feet wide each step so you're having to like step step step leap down a few feet continue again leap down a few feet and each of you are doing this who here does not have magic boots you're flying you're fine correct so you're fine you as you're walking the ground is very hot and you can continue to move your feet in a way where it's not too bad but you get the sense if you were wearing normal boots and not the usual ashari-made leather setup that you work on they would probably be melting across the metal floor here all right so the air itself now smells of very caustic fumes mixed with the smell of burning coal but there is oxygen now in this chamber you can breathe there's enough air to actually get a lungful here and there though it is still thin and there is still the toxic fume here that had you not had the heroes' feast you'd be having a rough time but you're not having to constantly dip into the jug anymore i cannot wait to get to halloween horror nights with you again you are quick that's why we leave you ten feet ahead of us it's going to be glorious anyway as you descend the staircase you ahead make a perception check 27 okay you continue down for about two minutes or so and even glancing ahead to the edge of your visual range here in the darkness because there is no light source below at this point the stairs are continuing and continuing and continuing and you have no idea how long it'll go for but you begin to sense as you're walking and you hear this faint rhythmic bassy rumble of a low nearly inaudible drum-like beat deeper than any sound you've heard quaking the ground ever so faintly (slow rumbling pulses) and you can very faintly feel it you get down and move your fingers to the ground and for the moments before the heat gets there the next time you hear it you can feel a very faint vibration only because you are very perceptive at the moment i'd say with your high perception check you can tell that yes it is precisely rhythmic you guys are about 20 minutes out both you and grog before you lose your forms another ten 15 minutes of descending these stairs that seem to go on and on and on and you guys are starting to hear this (low rumbling) but it is getting steadily louder the further down you climb vax you begin to see along the metallic walls occasionally shapes in the metal and you glance over vax and look and you can see carved from the metal humanoid armored warriors standing about ten or so feet tall larger than normal their poses vary some of them are on the side some of them are attacking some of them are defending and about every 25 or 30 feet or so there will be one on one side or the other no they're from the wall they're reliefs they're metallic reliefs in the wall made of the same metal it looks like as the walls around them make an investigation check nine 22 glancing around the seams these appear to be just reliefs in the wall there is no deeper seam their proportions are flattened they are designs in the wall the craftsmanship is extraordinary the detail because you rolled so high you can tell that these are just reliefs in the wall but up until that point it looks like the detail in the nooks and crannies are so microscopic you can see texture on the skin almost like pores carved in it's immaculate it's artistic the level of detail put into these so that lasts for an hour great okay roll stealth please okay so what is the marching order here please okay you're pushing about ten minutes or so at this point okay so vax behind it's percy and grog up front you heal 31 hit points grog there you go all righty it is a curse that can only be broken by a god grog continuing the charge forward taking the steps eventually you begin to see a source of some light a faint orangish-red light your initial instinct based on your previous travels through here is molten rock it's a very similar orangish-red color from this distance as you descend step upon heavy step upon heavy step you watch as you can see a square orange opening below as in the pointed hallway that leads you down comes to an end and the stairs descend into a chamber do you want to put trinket out of your necklace i would say trinket's not comfortable yeah okay so as you descend grog the staircase continues below as the hallway comes to an end and you find yourself descending into the center of a massive hexagonal chamber the walls climb about 25 feet on each of the hexagonal sides there's one flat wall ahead of you and you assume probably one behind though you cannot see it from your current perspective on the staircase you can see that the walls are still made from the long plates of intricate hammered metal black and red-tinted with dust and rock and whatever other materials were forged into the actual metal the support girders of dark red metal marks the seam at every wall-plate like when you entered the hallway above central to the chamber ahead of you across the wall that you see there there is a glowing pit of heated coals about 15 feet on any side that marks the floor before a giant metal wall with two x-shaped cross beams that hit the corners of where that wall begins on each side and in the center where they meet you see a raised relief of solid gold bolted there that surrounds an opening of some kind there's a space in that golden relief same metallic surface well no for the floor in here it would be fairly smooth it's 25 feet to the ceiling and it's halfway down so it's about 12 and a half feet in the center so from the ground you'd have to get up to see it okay you walk up and you come to the very bottom of the last step (grunts) leap onto the ground walk forward to the edge of where the coals are there at the base of your feet you glance up and you can see it make a perception check all right you glance up and you can see the relief of solid gold the opening in it is triangle-shaped roughly one foot across from point to point like that it comes into a triangular point and it's about that size it's about a foot and then a foot and then a foot it's a weird rough circle and then the triangle is carved into the center of it the two walls immediately to the right and the left of that where the hexagonal pulls back to each side you see two more of those metal warrior reliefs that you saw earlier in the hallway the coals are in a square section a 15 by 15-foot square section of the floor in front of you that leads right up to the wall with the giant x meeting the seams in the relief it looks like a gold relief that has a triangular hole in it that's all you can see you'd have to get closer to it all right you fly up above the coals and the heat emanating from the coals below you is extremely hot you can see it warping the air above it so you have to protect yourself a bit and squint the eyes and you swear you can smell the scent of burning hair and you get up close and you can see the relief perhaps some sort of triangular or pyramid-like shape would slip into it it looks like all the corners eventually converge to a point on the interior of it do you guys want to walk around the back of the staircase as you guys move around the back of the staircase the wall on the opposite side of that relief contains a third armored warrior relief embedded in the wall you can see there are four pillars right along the side of where the staircase descends that contain bolted-in large braziers that contain ever-burning flames flickering that give that orange-red glow similar to the coals you saw embedded in the ground as you arrived and then on the back side of the staircase and the column that held it aloft you recognize it immediately grog strangely because while you've not cared or understood what these things are before suddenly you know what it is you see a large metal-- it looks like a well almost but there is a furnace built into it and a number of tools that are hanging to the side small tongs and heavy leather gauntlets this is a smelter okay you swoop around the room you detect no evil you detect no magically consecrated objects and at that point the spell's about to fade or become permanent okay and with that a smaller scanlan form appears the planetar angelic form vanishing and he drops about four feet and lands on his feet on the ground and a moment later grog your form drops as well and you revert back to normal grog size still massive this triangle does not at all resemble any of the designs that you had imbued upon you okay so you walk up the side and look into it and you can see it's a triangle and then pushing inward all the points converge on the inside where it would fit a pyramid structure about one foot on each side corner to corner the point where it connects it goes to a complete point well the cross beams are bolted to the actual wall there are two metal warriors to the right and left and then one on the back wall the only hot coals are the ones that reside directly beneath the relief yes the smelter is on the other of the room behind the staircase yeah 24 you approach and look up into the warrior and you can see the three of them are all in the same stance they're all standing square they all are clutching a long greatsword in one hand the other appears to be open to either receive something or hold aloft something that's not there and they're all facing forward okay (whoosh) your wings arc outward looking ahead you can see the armored helmet that adorns its head that normally would pincer to where the nose is and you can see the pores of the face the helmet is one big domed curve on top and where a face would be there is no face there's the outside of the head and a similar triangle gap in the face that's smaller than the one in the relief you glance over quickly into the other warrior and the third and all three of them are faceless instead having an empty triangle that disappears into the face yes but they're smaller in the hexagonal room yes they would be it seems to be close enough at least based on the construction of the chamber no they're all greatswords but they're also part of the relief embedded in the wall one open hand it's embedded in the wall and the other one is open to the side but the relief is all embedded in the wall and you can see the triangular opening the only thing that darts inward is that vacuous shape in the face make an investigation check the smelter is low but it's burning 13 doesn't appear to be the floor is pretty solid there's no real detail that catches your attention well the statues are in the wall and you can see the outer shape barely protruding from the wall so it would be hard to place something in the hand okay the bellows are there the big old heavy bellows and grog you know exactly what to do it's a really strange phenomenon to be like i've never done this but it's second nature and you begin to get that forge to well and burn and brightly you can see the flames and the coals heat up from dull red to a bright orange to a white at times and as it heats up you have the tongs what do you smelt in you get the sense here that smelting is the heating and liquefying of metals one to remove impurities and two to then pour into a mold in which when it cools the metal makes the shape of whatever the mold is you reach out and you touch the gold relief it's built into the wall it's a smooth shiny polished gold but it's not moving at all you reach up and grab the side and feel the side of the face and reach into the inside of the gap in the triangular void if you will no your fingers slide in it does come to a vanishing point it comes to a point like the larger relief once you look inside and get a glance with the little bit of light that's in there the shape on the inside of it is different it's imperfect and messed up it's hard to see what it is but it's not a perfect triangle like the rest also immediately you guys see there's a flash of orange light that completely surrounds the exterior of the warrior and the two other warriors their entire outer line glows a bright orange and with that you instinctually step back-- or yeah step up as all three of them (heavy movement) step out of the wall unlike the ones you saw previously that were pressed in and relief these have a little more dimension to them and the majority of their physical form was embedded backwards into the wall they all of a sudden come storming outward giant greatswords swinging in front of them as they all immediately the heads creepily with the open triangular void of where a face would be spin to one of the nearby individuals in their space that's where we'll pick up next week because it is almost 1100 they're about ten to 12 feet tall they're made out of the same metal material it looks like that the walls are constructs of some kind no they're bolted against the far wall and it looks more ornamental or at least there are seams against that back wall to hold a relief there or at least that's where the relief is placed you get the sense with more inspection you'd get a better feel but it doesn't look like immediately at glance it's integral to the design so we'll pick up right at the beginning of those large metallic creatures emerging from the walls and the ensuing conflict next week in the meantime thank you guys so much for joining us on the next crazy step of our adventure happy birthday yeah yes thank you puzzle quest magic the gathering edition for being our fantastic sponsor thank you guys for watching we'll pick up next week and then after that is gencon so after next week is gencon so start getting that ready yep (laughs) two weeks all right have a good night guys rest well thank you for coming and as always--
