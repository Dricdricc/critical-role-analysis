hopefully keep that up all right anything else or should we get back into the chaos you should be where we left off it's okay the party as they ventured deep into the underdark beneath the cliffkeep mountains in the dwarven city of kraghammer they sought and discovered lady kima of vord a folk hero a paladin of bahamut who had been captured and tortured by the duergar that lived beneath it after saving her they discovered that there was an even deeper darker more dangerous evil brewing beneath the surface there was an illithid or mind flayer city of yug'voril deeper within these cavern structures and currently the elder brain of the colony was under the control of an entity known as k'varn they came to find out was a self-mutilated and advanced beholder who had come into contact with a dark artifact known as the horn of orcus that was actually gifted many many many many like hundreds of years ago by the god of undeath himself orcus to one of his avatars somehow it found its way to this beholder and gave it enough power to where it gained complete dominion over this colony and these caverns as a whole the party fought their way through and made a few allies including the ousted mind flayer clarota seeking to return to his colony has been fighting alongside them as well as lady kima the paladin they came to save upon finding their way into the final cavern they used their magic carpet to completely go around the giant city of yug'voril perch on top of the temple in the center of the city and using a polymorphed fomorian giant (laughs) cascading down hundreds upon hundreds of feet through the glass structure on top managed to break their way into the temple after which a very dangerous battle with k'varn the beholder took place a number of very close calls i posted the stats for them after the fight if any of you guys got a chance to see it they made saving throws where it counted or we'd have a lot more party members that'd be permanently dead but they managed to take him out using tiberius's telekinesis they tore the horn from its forehead and the beholder fell to the ground unmoving and finally killed as opposed to its undead form and that's where we begin as you guys all sit there looking around yourselves adrenaline still pumping in your ears the flow of blood at which point clarota turns to you and says you bring her points to kima who is still frozen in stone mid-wielding her maul stay but a moment i will talk to them that low enough level no unfortunately i know that (laughter) also requires verbal casting you also have to be able to speak so while you're talking to them scanlan is tapping you and mouthing words angrily orcus yes okay i assume you guys have come down in here then okay good as you say that clarota turns and the two stone doorways on each side of the temple shift open and you notice three mind flayers glide in from the side of the room two small bi-pedal brain-like creatures at which point clarota puts his hands up like this yeah you're still being held back but you can try to break from the grapple if you want to roll an athletics check nope you're still held against the bars still not enough unfortunately okay as they begin to move in and are hovering forward looking around the room taking in the scenery but they're all focused toward the center they're all just moving towards the elder brain and they make their way up towards it looking very intent and very frightened at the prospect of what maybe has happened in this room as they all approach you can see that low dull kind of purplish glow of the elder brain is still pumping but slowly brighter and brighter almost like it's coming to more life you can hear the cage rattling of the various entities that are still inside like the one that's still grappling grog off to the side the horn of orcus which is still being held aloft by your telekinesis spell is just hovering through the air slowly rotating on its own little strips of k'varn's flesh still freshly tumbling from the side so right here not this big of course as they all move towards the center clarota with his hands up turns around pulls back the hood and steps towards the other mind flayers hands stretched out moving up to the point here the three illithid look over and notice clarota and there's a good 20 or 30 seconds of silence as they just look at each other at which point clarota kind of turns around to the rest of the group and looks at them looks at all of you and lowers his head a little bit as the mind flayers move in towards clarota one reaches over and pulls the cap from the back of his head removes it at which point clarota raises up and if you think you've ever seen an entity with tentacles for a mouth smile the creases in his awful rubbery fleshy face almost give a look of joy of rediscovered connection and he looks out to the rest of you and bows a head for a second i need grog scanlan tiberius vax and pike to all make-- intelligence saving throws intelligence saving throws not very wise there grog this would be-- no it would not be 23 20 scanlan 12 pike okay grog okay so currently all the mind flayers at once including clarota angrily lash out with a mind blast you feel your brains all of a sudden fill with searing horrible pain some of you manage to shrug it off but the rest of you find your bodies locking in place all right everyone who failed their save which would be-- keyleth what'd you roll oh you need to roll as well sorry you're in the blast there you're still an earth elemental not good all right that'll be 22 points of psychic damage to grog to pike no you passed this you're fine scanlan you are currently stunned you are actually unable to physically move pike as well the rest of you manage to resist the mind blast but at this point in time you can now see that this crew including clarota now reconnected with its people your purpose serving its end you're about to be swarmed by the rest of the entire city let's roll initiative guys all right so 25 to 20 nice 20 to 15 all right 15 to ten all right grog vex you're up first okay as you guys do notice-- you guys are beginning to see what looks like shadows seemingly coming out from the outside and you hear what seems to be slight cackling of things sort of in the doorways so you're shooting hail of thorns down into the elder brain go ahead and roll for the attack 19 will hit yes what the teleportation one one minute pretty sure it's one minute i thought it was spellcasting time one minute okay so you release the first hail of thorns the arrow shatters into a whole-- that'll be all four of them how much damage do they take unless they make a what do they have a saving throw against it okay against what so two of them make it two of them don't all right so clarota and the one nearest to it get behind a pillar for a second and manage to reduce the damage a bit but the other two are completely pierced all over their bodies where shattered pieces of these kind of jagged thorn arrows exploded all over them and the elder brain the pulsing begins to-- you hear this shrieking in your mind like the actual presence of the elder brain is starting to yell out in pain you feel it's hardy but hurting i mean it's very hefty it's a large chunk of matter so god knows how long it would take to take that one down but it's definitely-- (laughs) it hurt it's not happy with that do you want to move at all or do you want to stay where you are yeah that's right 15 does not hit unfortunately you actually fire down and it hits the stonework and the arrow splinters against it stay where you are jump what could possibly go wrong okay that's the end of your turn keyleth you're up you have shadows moving in from the two open doorways on each side right now essentially it's a giant stone platform that houses the elder brain at the center this is one doorway that's the other that-- ooh that's maybe not enough yeah no that's longer than 35 feet what do you want to do just letting you know just putting this into perspective here you're fighting four illithid in the room you have a city swarming on you right now okay what are you doing are you casting a spell what's the movement speed of the earth elemental 35 feet as it's still able to move through stone as well okay it is a thick floor you actually shift into the stonework of the flooring itself and coast through popping up right out there that'll get you right at the doorway you can see there is a slow spiraling incline like a small-- like an inclined pathway that you can see four illithid making their way up right now with some large looming stomping sounds coming up behind them okay go ahead and make your slam attack or attacks depending on how many-- yeah 26 okay go ahead and roll damage on that since you are an earth elemental you do extra siege damage against structures don't you 42 points of damage so the stone structure which is pretty rigid and this is an old old structure the strange weird non-euclidean design of it has a slight warbling feel to it you take both of your earth elemental fists and slam them into the side as you do the structure gives way and a good 30 feet or so crumbles down around you you can feel the stones raining onto you because of your proximity you take four points of impact damage this entire doorway is ruined and there's a good 15-foot pile of stonework now blocking that entranceway yeah but there's a hole above it where the stone fell through so there is about 50 feet up a section of the wall that is collapsed down okay do recall that mind flayers do levitate all right tiberius you're up you can also see forms swarming through the other doorway over there yeah yep you are no i'm pretty sure-- if the item says attunement on it you have to spend a short rest attuning yourself with the weapon if either of them does right but your ioun stone-- you mean take it from him you would have to attune it to yourself in order to use it it takes a short rest what are you doing the other doorway isn't blocked you have mind flayers running in you have probably more and more swarming from underneath the temple probably over at some point from what you've seen of the temple structure okay that's true okay so you use your action go ahead and roll for that for the crushing of telekinesis you're adding your modifier which i think is five as you focus intensely you feel that the horn itself-- the sheer force of the artifact is far too powerful for your meager magic to have any sort of effect on its physical structure as you focus your arcane intent on crushing it you feel almost like the back of your brain begins to crawl with cold energy and if you could hear-- if you could hear laughter come from something that is inanimate you're hearing it coming from the horn right now that's your action not currently no 30 that's as far as you can get you already used your action to telekinesis that's how it works okay that brings us-- end of tiberius's turn to percy okay go ahead and roll twice 21 does hit yeah roll both no all righty all right gotcha okay good all right so as you (gunshot) turn over the barrel of your weapon fire again the second one bursting into flame as it hits the top of the elder brain you can see both bullets sink into the flesh there's no impact they just seem to be absorbed in by it the flame one you see a jet of flame go from the inside and the flesh of the actual large elder brain quivers for a moment you hear another shrieking angry pain growl in your minds just by the proximity of this entity you don't see it doing too much to it but it's definitely hurting it that ends your turn clarota spins and comes up behind you-- you are stunned currently so it gets advantage on that so that's 24 all right so clarota's tentacles wrap around your head-- (gasping) you immediately take 15 points of psychic damage and you are currently grappled yes all right that comes to pike pike you're stunned currently mind still reeling from the pain go ahead and make an intelligence saving throw your physical form is still unable to pull yourself out of that continuous psychic pain you're like (groans) trying to just tear your mind out of it unable to do so vax you're up you can rush there you would have to get up onto here all right got it all right go ahead and roll for attack twice as a note as you rush by for an attack of opportunity the intellect devourer does reach out and strike at you with its claws rolls a one you just kick it off to the side it rolls on its side its brain matter (clunks) on the ground you get three if you use your bonus to attack total 17 that would still-- it doesn't miss but as you strike down for it there's a psychic field that's defending it and your blade is held at bay by the protective sphere okay that does hit no okay it makes its saving throw rolled a 17 14 the second one strikes through the poison tries to pulse through but once again it resists the impact the third dagger comes down and before it even gets halfway towards there's a blast of psychic energy from the inside of the containment unit that holds the elder brain that (boof) forces your hand back the attack deflected entirely that ends your turn the other three illithids now go this one's also going to turn around reach forward and its tentacles are going to attempt to wrap around pike's head-- that's going to be a 20 no it's just 20 so pike you go ahead and take-- this'll be 15 points of psychic damage i rolled a total of 20 and you're stunned currently so you take 15 points of psychic damage as you feel-- as you're trying to resist yourself these cold tentacles wrap across the front of your field of vision and you can feel this weird toothy pointy biting sensation beginning to push towards the back of your skull this one-- this one here is going to-- tiberius that is a 15 versus ac what's your ac 17 as you're rushing toward the magic carpet that just took off yeah you look over and the tentacles swing toward you you duck just underneath and manage to avoid the attack now the two intellect devourers one's going to go ahead and look up towards the magic carpet that's taking off and-- here we go oh within ten feet no you're too far away so instead it's going to go for you on top of the elder brain i want you to go ahead and make an intelligence saving throw vax natural 20 so you feel a similar blast of screaming energy like you feel from the illithids but it's more primal and more guttural you manage to shrug it off in your mind and angrily look down at this weird fleshy creature the other one moves up and attempts to blast you again from the opposite side make another intelligence saving throw 19 once again you feel from the back of your brain this like stunning impact and you shrug it off looking over this way all right that brings us to scanlan yeah so go ahead and make your saving throw you shrug off the stunned effect you're currently grappled by the entity laura ashley and and then also make an intelligence saving throw okay unfortunately you're still stunned you resisted the mind effect but the tentacles on your head are now locking your brain in place and your eyes are kind of rolling back in your head as you feel the illithid's mouth begin to push against the outside of your head grog yeah just go ahead and roll an athletics check a natural one a natural one it rolled a four okay so it's still holding you in place you have your axe you picked up off the ground with your chain of returning you can't physically move from your position as it's holding you there well no you threw it over here and retrieved it at the end of the battle so what do you want to do you have your axe with your chain of returning you just can't move but you can still throw if you want to well you can throw to either of them right now they're both bent over gnome heads they're bigger-- he's here and that's pike you guys were right there okay go ahead and roll for an attack 22 definitely hits go ahead and roll damage 14 points of damage all right that one you throw the axe it slams into the shoulder of the illithid that's grabbing on to him you see it look up at you angrily and a large portion of its chest is now gashed open and blood is pouring from the wound but it's still holding tight right now i think that's going to end your turn do you want to pull your axe back go ahead and you (grunts) go ahead and make your check yeah a 20 you have to roll a d20 that was a d12 so you pull on the chain of returning and it yanks the axes out of the wound and you catch it in midair preparing for the next round all right first round of combat over let's roll better guys this is looking really dire vex you're up you're up at the top you have a clear view of everyone as it is these two illithids look kind of hurt these two look really rough this one looks really rough both of these guys haven't been damaged yet but they have low hit points oh right sorry (laughter) in the confusion-- 14 unfortunately does-- you're stunned no unfortunately unfortunately no you know what he is grappling and he is right in the way i'll go ahead and give you advantage on that attack roll again roll again take whatever it is 22 will hit okay because it is a stationary position completely engulfing and you have such a great view from above okay did you roll your hunter's mark damage don't forget hunter's mark okay gotcha that's your first strike 18 okay so both strikes (whoosh) go ahead and roll for damage 19 okay both arrows (zoomf zoomf) one embeds itself in the wound that grog had left with the axe and you see the body tenses clarota stares up at you with this beaming angry look on his face you realize oh shit clarota's the one that's going after scanlan your second arrow you bring down and release and it pierces the side of its face gashing through and embedding itself in the chest you can see now clarota's looking really rough but he's still holding taut this horrible thought goes into your mind suddenly a familiar voice saying you've all done your work now it's time to feast all right that ends your turn keyleth you're up okay so you're going to pop up here over here right there so what are you doing on the well you're just grabbing it no it's embedded in the ground what are you doing okay go ahead and make a slam attack on the side 16 you slam into the side of this you're not attacking the brain you're attacking the stonework you can feel there is some psychic resistance but because you're not attacking the brain directly your fist slams into it making purchase in the stone go ahead and roll damage against the stone double damage on this 20 damage the side of the stonework crumples inward pieces of the stonework itself seem to be jutting in toward the elder brain but it's stopped by some sort of psychic resistance but the whole side here to here is now just open entirely and you can see now the hole the mass of-- there's probably hundreds of various illithid brains that have slowly congealed into one large brain structure as now you can see the underneath area the liquid it kind of sits in is now pouring out down the side of the structure so you only have the one slam attack earth elemental doesn't multi-attack right cool that's good to know go ahead and make another one are you attacking the stonework still okay so we'll say you used some of your movement to move this way by the way guys you can break up your movement you can move attack then move if you want to yeah that'll definitely do it go ahead is that total damage oh that's the attack okay go ahead and roll damage 18's fine so you break out the second half and now the entire side of it is open all the fluid just spilled out the side and you get the sensation this is very frowned upon (laughter) as a note too just so you guys are aware-- you start seeing a series of other entities slowly making their way up from the downstairs tunnel area there is right behind you yeah yeah the other door is open yeah he's (whoosh) you can't get to him no percy (loud clatter) that's what you get i know i'm saying it's on his carpet right now staring at him from the side no they're just starting to get to the doorway you can see them right there what you got tiberius (laughter) how diplomatic of you so tiberius how many with that what level are you using it it's a little over five feet wide technically yeah okay okay all righty you now start hearing (boof boof) slamming sounds from the other side of the stone walls both sides of the walls are now sealed off with pillars and a large pile of rubble on that side all right percy you're up okay that hits okay so scanlan as you're stunned you feel the tentacles swirling around the back of your head teeth are grinding into the back of your skull and you feel this horrible pain as all of a sudden clarota's mouth is beginning to find a way towards your skull (laughter) in a split second your longtime ally now turncoat is scattered across the stone floor you're released you're no longer stunned you do there's still one on pike right now yeah right here that hits okay no you did not yeah the other one-- even further okay yeah you could probably pull it off it'd be an acrobatics roll but yeah okay so you're going down to here instead okay you can get about-- we'll say if you're just going-- all right okay that ends your turn that brings it-- he just took damage but he's not done yet so pike it's your turn go ahead and roll to get rid of the mind blast stun seven nope you're still locked in place she cannot move her entire brain is locked in with a searing clenching pain psychic energy is just clutching her brain and holding it hostage you feel once again the teeth beginning to pierce the back of the flesh you feel the teeth of the mind flayer beginning to scrape against the skull the actual bone it's found in the back vax you're up oh it's somewhere on the ground over here over behind this okay right here you can't with the speed you're running there because your hasted speed is doubled so it's 60 feet one two three four five six seven eight nine ten 11 12 you can move right there all right unfortunately-- no that does just hit how sneak attack works is if they're next to someone that's aggressive toward them they feel like they have people on two fronts which is why you get the benefit i will say circumstantially though because he is currently grappled on to pike and is in the process of trying to grind into her brain with his mouth he is a little preoccupied at the moment so i'm going to go ahead and make a perception roll versus your fast movement go ahead and make a stealth-- roll stealth to see whether or not he takes notice and changes his position in defense okay go ahead the first attack you rolled was a 15 that hits and that is a sneak attack he did not see you coming that quickly 33 with the keen dagger okay that was your first attack okay so the first dagger (shnk) sinks into the back of the neck you just manage to miss all the seriously vital stuff but you carve a giant section out of the side of its head the rest of its leathery black outfit's now slick with its own blood you see it angrily growls almost this weird guttural this (gurgling growl) sound as it still remains taut and clenched on pike its eyes glaring at you basically telling you look what i'm about to do to your friend that hits that does hit eight points of damage so the first one you stab in the side of the head you pull back and toss it in the air catch the second one as it bursts into flames you place the searing dagger down into the center of its back between its shoulder blades its back tenses and as it does it reaches back and tries to grab for the dagger as you pull back the third one as it looks back at you it brings up one arm to stop you as it goes in to directly go after pike's head the third dagger you then stab it right in the front of the skull its eyes roll back in its head and its tentacles limply drag off (cheering) i'll allow it oh my god because that guy was next if we didn't kill him this turn she would've taken 55 points of damage yeah and if it takes you to zero hit points they extract the brain and eat it let's see if they get their mind blast back nope nope seeing both of them get immediately slaughtered both of these illithids just plane shift a defensive standpoint self-preservation is kicking in however intellect devourers do not have self-preservation they're there for a specific reason so this one here is going to move over to this side and is going to attempt to make a devour intellect attack against keyleth keyleth go ahead and make an intelligence saving throw you keep your intelligence score as you the physical attributes you get from the elemental form you keep your intellect wisdom and charisma 18 okay you resist the blast of mental impact from the intellect devourer now on the ground with its four feral legs its brain form rippling the second one is going to turn over here and saw the two shots the one that took out clarota it turns up towards percy as you've lowered on the magic carpet percy go ahead and make an intellect saving throw eight all righty you take 11 points of psychic damage and you take eight points of intellect damage no no no no for this it basically-- what's your intelligence 16 yeah the blast hits you and you just shrug off the impact it has to exceed your intelligence no no no you just the additional-- yeah the intellect damage is not permanent not quite that bad all right that ends their turn that brings us to scanlan you're no longer stunned you now have full capacity of yourself and you're looking around oh shit make a perception check by the way swarming thing that drift up the sides of the temple from the floor coming from inside the temple and out toward the top you're still stunned from the mind blast you haven't made your save okay as you dimension door you just go ahead and look back using the song of love you gave to pike you give back give a wink to grog grog you take a 1d10 inspiration 1d10 inspiration dice to you it is now you can go ahead and go ahead and make your athletics well you can use it after you do it see what you roll and then add it athletics yeah 18 yeah you (boosh) break out of the creature's grasp suddenly it's reaching at you from behind the bars you can see there's this slick brackish oil on your body from where it was holding you fleshless arms clutching you to the bars there is lady kima who is turned to stone you can she's not a big stone structure okay so you rush you grab the stone form you run up you grab lady kima you grab her in your arms and you rush the rope is currently dangling from this side where you guys first came in 50 speed you can get up to here you can just get up to the rope and we'll say as your dash action you can begin to climb if you'd like okay it gets you about there rage climbing like (grunts) one-handed up the rope that's pretty intense go ahead and make an athletics check 17 yeah it's sore you know that arm is going to be dead tomorrow but right now it doesn't even matter you're just clutching lady kima still locked in her attack pose in one arm as you're overhand grabbing the rope and getting yourself up as fast as you can rage-climbing up the rope that brings us to vex right now there's two brains and you can see just in the outskirts of the temple's side here two more illithid that are making their way up the side of the temple with about a hundred or so just now gathering towards the bottom of the temple base the elder brain is still inside just the stonework on the outside of it is currently knocked out all right that'll hit releasing again in midair you can see all the thorns appear out the sides of the arrow shaft it explodes into a giant conical-- just a ray almost like a blizzard of thorns at the end of all the damage you dealt with the attack you then add hunter's mark to that 24 all righty keyleth go ahead and make a reflex saving throw or deflect yeah sorry old carryover it's dexterity ten versus your spell save of-- yeah so you take the same damage you take 24 points of damage 24 so all the thorns explode against your rocky physical form you just shrug it off like it's nothing (laughs) it tickles a little okay all right 17-- actually no 17 will miss the second there's some sort of psychic protective field in the brain as you fire down the arrow looks like it should strike and then it just arcs off to the side nonsensically and then just splinters against the stonework next to the-- you going to stay where you are you going to move okay you climb onto trinket's back that brings us to keyleth you're up the liquid is poured out no it's actually all-- at a long distance it looks like one giant brain close up it looks like all of these smaller brains have all congealed into one giant mind yeah literally the fluid it was sitting in it was mostly submerged in is all now poured out onto the ground near you beginning to get slick okay go ahead and make an attack roll 23 that hits go ahead and roll damage it's not double damage because you're not hitting the structure so 11 points of damage all right now i want you to go ahead and make a strength check so just roll and add your strength modifier of the earth elemental okay as you punch upward you're still partially absorbed into the earth but your fist comes through and it slams in and you feel this sickening thud sound as your fist hits the interior of the brain it still moves a little bit but it stays in its place held aloft by its own psychic defense mechanism make your second attack 21 hits go ahead and roll damage on that one 16 damage go ahead and roll another strength check eight okay once again you slam your fist into it and you feel like the impact is absorbed partially by the psychic field around the brain it holds itself in place it's still not moving from within that small-- you still have about-- i'd say it only took you about 15 feet of movement to get underneath it yeah okay so we'll say 25 30 35 40 45 what's your total burrow speed so you'll be about there so you're about as high as tiberius is partially up the wall up on there as you glance in you kinda have a brief look at the outside of the wall and on the opposite side there are two other mind flayers one more coming up on the side and another troll behind it and the troll's slamming onto the bricks you left up and these two illithids are starting to look up and see you moving up and their eyes go up and they can see the opening in the top of the-- where the wall collapsed earlier and they both look up and kinda start drifting up towards it so that ends your turn tiberius you're up well it's percy pike vax and then they go then scanlan grog all right so grog trinket and-- yourself okay what's the fly speed on that it's on the card the cards i gave you 60 feet you make your way up top and you're now hovering trinket's now having another peter pan moment with you on his back awkwardly it's just gotten used to flying on its own that one time it had now it has an extra weight on its back (bear noises) all right it's a free action i'll let you do that (laughs) percy you're up you're holding back okay percy holding back pike go ahead and make an intellect saving throw 19 you finally shrug off the effect of the mind blast your eyes clarify (laughs) the first thing you do see is scanlan holding you you're now outside of the temple there's the dark kind of dull glowing green atmosphere outside the entire yug'voril city around you with bits of blue crystal you know against the cavern walls it's scary you look around you you can see illithid charging up the side of the temple just gliding toward you angrily you look forward and on your shoulders clutching you is scanlan blood streaking down the front of his face with a big smile okay mass cure wounds on yourself because mass cure wounds is for multiple people you can cast cure wounds on yourself yeah it's your choice it's also touch you have to be next to him to do that at six hit points i'd recommend it to you you were so close to dying again i was so scared okay so you heal yourself 17 hit points you clutch your holy symbol you feel the warmth fill your body and your wounds seal up slowly you feel a little better because you were on death's door there all right you want to move at all anything else you want to do this turn or are you good you don't have to what right now trinket can barely hold vex you do (laughter) it's this strangely romantic moment as she reaches forward grabs him and kisses him on the cheek and pulls away and he looks at her with this beautiful smile and then the sound effects kick in again of the bats screeching ahead and the (inhales) of all the illithid swarming up the side of the temple all right vax 25 okay all right no jump on the flying carpet all righty no down the road maybe this is the start of something beautiful let the seeds germinate for a while then the dice may come naturally so you're holding your turn percy you want to go now all right so that brings you here percy go ahead okay okay we'll say here for the purposes of this taking two more shots oh no it's fallen over what's the first roll 16 does hit oh it's not even flat okay we're just going to put it down there 16 doesn't hit the 19 just barely hits it it pierces through the psychic barrier (zoomf) the bullet sinking again into the fleshy membrane ice shot okay so 16 total all right as it blasts inside you can see the ice these strange crystals of frozen liquid they burst out almost like it actually freezes the blue explosion in place for a moment and then the ice just slowly melts away yeah there's some damage dealt to it but this is a hardy sack of hit points and it's coming online so with the end of your turn the brain now taken a bunch of hits begins to pulse with energy now that it's been freed from its control and it's slowly brought itself out of this trance-like slumber that it was placed in by k'varn the elder brain is now becoming conscious once again so at a 30-foot radius which you guys are it gives off a pulse of energy (boomf) this giant psychic burst of purple-ish psychic blast just cascades out of the center and just fills the room for a second with this large dull thud-like thoom sound all of you instinctively look down and see this explosion that just dissipates as it crests the bottom of the magic carpet which is just out of range at which point you guys who are at the top looking off to the side all the illithid that are rushing up the tunnel there's a sudden flash of purple energy in their eyes simultaneously like now the elder brain has come back online and has reconnected with its people all right that brings us to grog grog all of the sudden the rope is really easy to go up it's nothing you're just going hand over hand yeah they're moving around they're angry they can't quite get to their targets fantastic rolling for the bottom of the attack round okay the troll bursts through the door filling in with the two mind flayers behind it they both look up frustrated and both begin to drift up as far as they can get they are going to attempt two mind blasts all right that's as high as they get with levitation with the full height that takes the top because technically you guys are up here i just couldn't put the structure that high up the only people-- the only person that's in the radius would be scanlan and pike again both of you guys make intellect saving throws again what did you roll okay 14 all right (laughs) unfortunately you have to do that on your turn you manage to resist the effects of it you take 22 points of psychic damage and once again your brain clenches-- damn good thing you healed yourself you feel all of the sudden the blast hits you and you see her eyes roll back in her head as she reaches up and grabs the side of her head again nearly dropping her shield and mace which you manage to catch before they clatter down into the temple all right grog you're up oh no you're up there they went that brings it to the top of the round vex you're up yeah we're at the very top now at the very end the new guys burst in and attacked percy shot-- no actually you didn't do your turn on that one i'm sorry i think we skipped scanlan it's currently dangling over to this side because it's been busted from three different corners and it's precariously hanging it's pretty heavy it probably weighs close to 700 to 1000 pounds the giant brass structure it would fall down and then topple over unless you made it fall in that case we'll see okay go ahead and make a roll adding your plus five for your casting ability 13 plus five which is your charisma 18 as the spectral bigby's hand reaches over and grabs the top of the structure you can see the weird bit of bent metal that was once part of the mostly-destroyed structure that held it aloft in the center of the temple (metal creaking) wrenches forth and snaps as the entire structure begins to be pulled at an angle it slams down at an angle into the side of the brain and coming to rest on top crushing even further the corpse of clarota currently smeared across the ground oh man go ahead and roll 6d6 force damage on that crushing damage as this heavy thing jams itself into the brain 16 so the structure slams into the elder brain and you can see like a bit of purplish black liquid kinda squirts out to one side and for the first time you can see a part of the brain is actually torn open and the purplish glow that you see throbbing in the middle of its folds is now visible from the interior you can see now it's taken some real damage immediately the two mind flayers that were floating up look down freaked out and begin moving towards the brain now instinctively to defend it you can (laughter) anyway all right so vex what're you doing oh it's a superior one superior goes to it's 8d4 plus eight you roll it's your potion yeah five nine 13 sam and one more plus eight 30 you heal 30 hit points very very expensive potion used all right so vex you're on trinket still do you want to hold your action and wait for the rest of the carpet do you want to attack anyone what do you want to do okay go for it okay yeah well how big is the cone 60-foot cone from your angle here if you're going for the brain it'll catch this guy maybe as a cone that goes down this way unless you want to go this way and hit these guys or this guy yeah you can get you can get probably these guys there all right so they get saving throws right how does that work so roll damage and we'll see what their saving throws are no for that one it's just a barrage and they get to roll a saving throw against it all right yeah so the elder brain takes additional damage technically yes you would because they're ranged 19 all right cool and then this guy fails its save so total damage on him 19 on him okay so it's still alive just looking really really rough the brain's just now pierced with a bunch of arrows some of it it's barely holding itself on top of its feet and the troll also takes the damage as well just seems to shrug it off just seems to angrily-- roars up from the bottom of the temple at you now seemingly helpless in the current circumstance all right so you release it down very nice that hits go ahead and roll damage 11 points of damage all right 13 okay there we go (laughs) reach down again release this one aiming towards the now torn-open wound on the side of the elder brain as the arrow now sinks in there's another pulse of purple energy and you hear all of you simultaneously in your heads this scream this screech (screech) that echoes through your heads as it does the two illithid that were hovering towards it grab their heads momentarily out of frustration and glare up at you angrily that brings us to keyleth all right you just manage to make it to the top of the temple yeah all right keyleth is on the field nothing good ever comes out of this what do you got keyleth what are you doing theoretically make an arcana check you have no idea you have never encountered an elder brain before okay go ahead and roll a d20 and add your wisdom modifier to it okay there is an element of liquid to its structure however it is difficult to extract it from a form that you're unfamiliar with let alone one that's this stable you manage to find a way to pull moisture out of parts of it and actually deal damage to it as you're beginning to shrivel sections of the brain go ahead and roll 3d6 you do 3d6 points of dehydration damage oh yeah oh you don't even know the half of it just 3d6 15 all right 15 points of dehydration damage to the elder brain you can see now the portion of the wound that's been opened the corners of it kind of shrivel in and tuck in and the actual purple glow in the inside dulls slightly and you now have currently in the air a small amorphous globule of brain fluid that's just kind of floating there in this in the air tiberius you're up yeah they're swarming up the side they're probably about halfway up okay are you using your movement to bring the carpet to take control of the carpet from percy and move it up higher oh that's right sorry yeah all right so into the brain all right all right so that's enough to get both of these guys go ahead and roll damage and they both failed their save so full damage i like that good 40 those incinerate and 40 points of damage to the elder brain as this giant echoing explosion blasts up from below all of you at the top you are underlit momentarily from the flash of red and yellow flame as you look down there's now a sizzling sound and this like smell of horrible burnt flesh as part of the elder brain now that was originally dehydrated is now also burnt and singed you can see now it's looking a little rougher and it's very very unhappy with its current circumstance all right pike go ahead and make a saving throw still trying to get rid of the stun so intellect saving throw 16 you shrug off the effect-- that's your turn you just get the fuck out of dodge tiberius is that way vax okay they're at disadvantage at this distance 17 (ricochet sound) reflected deflected by the arcane shield on the brain yeah so all three just (ping ping ping) as it gets more and more damaged it's waking up more and more and it looks like it's actually gaining power the more it does (laughs) okay so as your movement you manage to move the carpet all the way up it swoops up into the center of-- this right here you guys are all looking precariously at this carpet that is now floating up from the center of the temple as you get to the top you look over and you can see there's probably close to 20 mind flayers that are swarming up the side that brings us to vax percy you're up okay i'll say it takes you your-- movement to get it out so you're there you're unable to move the carpet you pull the bad news out you get down you're precariously off the side of it and it is sagging as your weight touches it you get ready go ahead and fire okay as you fire the blast sends you up almost onto your feet on the carpet again and you hear this impact sound this (crash) of the blast hitting stone as the psychic field around it deflects the bullet sending it into the ground yeah i'll trust you on that that's true okay yeah all right go ahead and roll for that that'll do it as the brain continues to wake up it improves its defenses improves its capabilities-- but that will hit so go ahead and roll damage on that essentially so as you release the blast it hits the psychic field the first impact you hear is it hitting the psychic field and pushing through into the actual brain matter 25 points of damage boom you see the section of it that's kinda charred and burned gets blown off and now there's a corner of the brain that's just an open and gaping wound the purplish glow on the inside is pulsing more and more angrily it's taken a beating but it's hanging in there this is you guys have left a good mark on it you get the sensation with the swarming incoming you may start to consider self-preservation because the elder brain looks like it's taken some hits but it's not on death's door yet scanlan you're up yep you're hopping up okay cool so we'll say for the time being we'll use this as scanlan you are a giant pterodactyl a creature that you've read in books in the past you haven't actually seen in person and what are you doing you can carry one person with your claws you haven't used this form before and this is you figuring it out so pick one and you can take them with you grog can fly as the pterodactyl scanlan swoops down and both its claws grapple on your arms and lift you off the top of the temple flying after tiberius all right so they're now out of harm's way very top of the round that brings us to grog still carrying kima under your arm so you just awkwardly fly with kima under your arm off with the rest of the group we'll get these guys off the board here because you do have two illithid that get up to the edge here they're going to attempt a mind blast still holding back so-- that can just get trinket and vex if you can go ahead and make an intelligence saving throw for both of you nope okay roll for trinket so go ahead and roll for trinket okay laura and okay and roll for trinket nine for trinket so communally both you and trinket freeze in place and trinket who is flying slumps onto the top of the temple limply laying across the edge about to tip over off the temple that ends your turn keyleth you're up okay so you leap up here with these guys trinket is currently catatonic (moans) just barely holding herself right there you can see she's struggling with the flight spell like she's kind of levering herself into the ground-- him sorry i was thinking of you i apologize trinket i'm sorry okay so as you leap onto the carpet you reach down and the fibrous nature that the carpet was originally made from you manage to pull the essence of that out to create a vine of similarly patterned color of the actual magic carpet material the various silks form into this tendril that wraps around both you and trinket and pulls you guys hanging behind the carpet so you guys are essentially now towed to the carpet you currently do not have control of the carpet because you used your action and everything to use that spell and your concentration at that point you're just holding them there that brings us to tiberius you're off flying off pike is off vax you're up you tow trinket and vex out behind as you guys pull off at full speed the rest of the illithid swarm to the top you can see about 15 or so get to the front top here look down at the elder brain look up at the rest of you with this angry look and as you're pulling away your eyes adjust to the darkness of the cavern and you look down and you swear you can see hundreds and hundreds of sets of purple glowing eyes just staring up from the city as you all slowly fly away to the far end of the cavern as you're moving so are the eyes okay all right so a few minutes go by you guys are moving past and over the water channel that's between the north side of the island and the beach where you guys previously set (laughter) a few seconds pass you finish the incantation you place your hand down on the center of the sigil this wave of arcane energy blasts off and suddenly above this circle this tearing sound pulls out of the middle of the ether and this kind of purple shimmering doorway opens above the circle sigil that he crafted on the side of the beach at which point the doorway that he just created takes some sort of a solid form and from what you can see on the other side there appears to be some sort of low-lit room all right tiberius runs through everyone else you guys have all landed on the beach as he finished casting this yeah you all rush through the portal one after the other towards the very end is grog you bringing up the rear holding kima you go rushing towards it as it begins to slowly close this only lasts a round you barrel through just in time as it closes behind you with a sparking sound you all emerge within a small 20-foot-by-20-foot white stone chamber you all are kinda crammed in this space currently but you are all apparently safe and sound as the doorway closes behind you you turn and look and on the ground there is a similar circle across the stone flooring different patterns different you know arrangement to the one that he had drawn but with some similarities that are kind of a reminiscent glow almost like a code to this circle fade away based on what he had drawn previously so it's just kind of sitting there the carpet's bunched to the side now as you guys kind of flew into the portal and kind of left it there and the horn's just resting there it's a small yellow room sorry a small white stone room and there is a kind of yellowish brown stone doorway that is closed there's some very faint white orbs that are locked into the wall so you're not in greyskull keep now you guys don't have a teleportation circle installed in your keep yet you don't know where you are you're in a room you're in a 20-foot-by-20-foot room with two small white orbs on the sides that are kinda set into the walls to give off a faint white arcane glow there's a single doorway that exits the room that is currently closed okay you still have the spells roll a perception check 24 all right the door does appear to be locked it is not trapped okay 32 you relatively easy the door comes unlocked the small it's like a very very intricately carved brass handle that has swirls upon it like it's almost like a burst of wind being blown and frozen in gold you turn it and the door opens slightly okay as you open the doorway it leads into a secondary chamber this is an 80-foot-diameter circular chamber now so you're entering the edge of a giant circle there are a series of other doors almost in respective rows next to each other and you also see in the center of the room a vibrant chandelier made of white crystal like the spheres you saw in the previous room you were in giving off a warm atmospheric glow to the entire room in the center of the room there is a semi-circle desk that is also made of a similar white stone material that the rest of the room is made out of with polished gold leaf trimming on the edge and you do see what looks to be an elven man sitting at the desk longish gray-white hair he's wearing robes that are finely dressed and he's half-falling asleep at a desk with a series of books kind of piled up on the side as soon as the doorway opens he looks up and you hear a slight little arcane tinging sound like a little bell being rung as you open the door he looks up for a second stay right where you are do not move do not move apparently who else is in who else goes there who else please step outside reveal yourselves as soon as he sees you he goes (screams) okay (laughs) so as you cast the spell and transform he stops in the middle of casting a spell reflexively and goes oh and a bear interesting he opens a book and starts thumbing through the pages we have no expected arrivals at this hour i need to know your business your names and your affiliations immediately well make a persuasion check all right he looks to you as you guys are saying he-- 25 (laughter) here within the lyceum the hour is late we are two hours past midnight well i'm certain the headmaster would like to know your business in the morning headmaster thurmond he runs this alabaster lyceum within the erudite quarter if you would please submit a report for your reasons for using the lyceum junction property by tomorrow i'm sure that would suffice for the required paperwork gives you a very a disbelieving look and kinda goes very well okay he goes i seem to recall hearing about a vox machina at some point discussed but i don't get out very often running the graveyard shift here at the lyceum has taken its toll on my social life well here let me show you out and he walks you through the rest of the hallways it's a beautiful beautiful kind of domed center chamber into a long series of white stone hallways similar material to what the first room you arrived in looked like eventually to a main foyer area which has a very high ceiling and a series of beautifully carved pillars that show different creatures almost like devas and demons battling each other as they spiral up these pillars to the front doorways there are two guards that are adorned in kinda silver and gold armor with these very high elven in design-shaped helmets and they step to the side as the doors open on their own guards do not respond to you whatsoever they just step to the side gatekeeper says all right well here is your way out have a wonderful evening and do please return for your report on the morrow the erudite quarter good night the doors slam (boof) behind you as you guys exit and you're now-- you look up and for the first time in close to a week you can see stars you can see a crescent moon probably just past its single quarter phase it is a sight for sore eyes right now currently the most beautiful night sky you've seen in all of your years i'd say it's probably a good hour walk all right so as you guys begin making your celebratory pub crawl starting with the laughing lamia tavern you buy drinks laugh chatter and kind of take in the lively atmosphere that you would find at 3am which is a little at this point most of the fun folk are pretty drunk but at this point you don't care you'll take your own and we'll take a quick five-minute break to use the bathroom and we'll pick up from there in just a moment we'll see you guys here in five minutes to continue holy shit guys welcome back we got a little refresher here and apparently our overlord has an announcement yep 3400 awesome guys well done and congrats to whoever ends up getting that real fast i hope so thank you overlord pass it off it's fine so eventually you all manage to make your way towards the outer wall of emon to the southern portion of the city the guards let you through two of them recognize you from the winter's crest celebration that occurred about seven months beforehand don't do that that's going to end poorly you make your way around the bend to the large grass hill that is surrounded by the river that skirts the outer southern portion of greyskull keep looking up you can see against the moonlight the very welcome sight of your home there beckoning to you to rest you make your way to the front gates that surround the outskirts of it and an iron bell kind of goes off for a second and as you look up you hear a voice go who goes there speak your mind or a bolt to the throat you'll find it's dark yes okay a light pierces off and you guys look up and you can see sitting on kind of the watchtower perch-- no you see up there short rough red hair shayne tranter one of the mercenaries you hired-- she's got her crossbow ready to go and she's just kind of sitting back and pointing it at the group and she goes she laughs takes her crossbow sets it to her side well aren't you a sight for sore eyes it's been nearly a week since you left well it's probably closer to two weeks fair enough either way open the gates cordell open the gates cordell he's one of the other half-orc guards that you hired when you left so as the gate slowly opens cordell walking out this is the hearty half-orc merc dressed in scale armor and he has a large sword slung on his back just shoves it open to about a two-foot distance come on welcome home as each of you guys walk through he kinda claps you on the back as you walk in you make your way into the small courtyard leading to-- making your way into greyskull keep towards the front door as you get there the front door opens on its own as you're about ten feet away and peering from the inside of the low-lit interior you see a woman's face a plump blond woman's face peek through this is laina laina goes oh you're back fantastic it's early and she rubs her face and you see as she pushes the door open a little more she's wearing her nightgown and she's excited but still very tired come in come in come in please please who's that and points to the large stone statue you're dragging behind you very well very well come in so the human woman leads you all back in she steps back with her knitted boots she's definitely in comfortable mode she eagerly hugs each of you as you enter happy that you've all arrived she's like i swear it's-- i've not had an employer leave so quickly after my hiring but glad to see you're all safe shall i make everyone a meal are you hungry i'll get right to it and she turns around and you see further down the hallway erwen dastell your older halfling servant who shuffles up with his nightcap on it's long and dangling off his shoulders he's got this long night robe on he's kinda carrying a small candle my goodness the hour is late of your arrival but i can't say i am not excited to see you come in your beds are ready everything's been cleaned and made to your specifications laina to food i'm already on it erwen she kinda smacks him on the back he says very well then i will go back to bed if that's fine with you no i believe your friend the mage woman with the blue robes came by once allura she came by a couple days ago just to see if you had returned but i didn't know where you were and she said she'd try again later none that i know of no in fact it's been very quiet back to my quarters and he shuffles off goes towards his bed you guys make your way into the main dining chamber of your keep four large round tables set out with the chairs around it you can see for the most part it's been untouched other than a couple of chairs that are set ajar probably by your mercenary soldiers who've been eating and/or have been keeping up there's a couple of empty tables set on the side that immediately laina goes i'm so sorry i guess i should've taken care of this and she stumbles off towards the kitchen and you guys all eventually find yourselves sitting sore exhausted mildly intoxicated around these chairs and take a very deep-breathing sigh of relief at being back home here in emon in greyskull keep go ahead and make a wisdom saving throw tiberius nope you cannot talk you go under your covers go to sleep nuzzle in you snacked a bit as you made it through the town but for the most part like a meal's being prepared you begin to smell now the cooking of meat laina's setting it up for you guys you start to wake up and then he scritches the side of your cheek and you go right back to sleep laina comes out with plates for you guys and sets up these-- they're not pretty but functional meals of cooked pork some fine mashed potatoes and you do ravenously and this is the first warm meal you've really truly had in five six days there were no portions made for your garden structure that's okay there's plenty more you did not have a safe built but you could possibly have that done with what you re-polymorph him no it's his incantation it's like this viscous grog spit mixed with chunks of pork and mashed potato rubbed in your fur no it's been ten minutes horn of orcus there's a pile somewhere with armor okay all right you guys all go to rest for the evening the best rest you've had in a long time your beds are comfortable well set it's a warm interior this is the first time in a while that pike you've been able to sleep without your armor on and it's so nice you sleep hard you sleep for an extended period eventually you all begin to rouse as you all wake up the smell of fresh breakfast food is already coming to-- yeah you're going to have to wash that armor girl it's bad you haven't inquired you could ask around if you want yeah oh but he didn't transform you though he didn't transform you yeah there you go out in the front of the keep so you guys head down into the dining room again kima's still standing there with the maul left where she was grog is still face-down like on the table grabbed the plate up against his face with mashed potatoes across his cheek across the way at the far table you see cordell and shayne are both finishing their breakfast and are sitting there at the table with their arms kind of gathering as you enter morning morning and they both kind of finish their meal get up and stand up enjoy your breakfast you've earned it i think our shift is done she pats cordell and they both get up and they exit out you look in the bag and you see nothing you imagine something you reach in you pull it out okay so you use telekinesis you lift the horn out-- mage hand gently and slowly lifts it out you can see the horn kinda holds there for a second it moves very slowly put it back in the bag okay so you head down into the temple to sarenrae which is beautiful it's all like a giant two-story stained glass three-set walls with trees and hedges set up and flowers bunch of wooden kind of long benches set up towards this the altar in the center it's beautiful especially this time of day it's close to noon right now so the sun's streaking through the top of it and it's cascading through the tree boughs of the two trees that are closest to the entrance it's a beautiful sight even you grog are moved all right so while he's down there the rest of you guys what're you doing okay okay tiberius is gone tiberius is gone okay you reach out and touch the back of kima her stone armor turns to gold and rapidly her entire form goes back to flesh as she finishes her swing with the maul (impact sound) against the stone wall and she kinda steps back for a second confused and looks over her shoulder at the rest of you just drops the maul for a second and kinda leans back against the wall thank you thank you oh thank you what happened she's not even using utensils she's just like scooping it with her hand at this point obviously it's all right he had his uses certainly that isn't necessary but the compliment is appreciated regardless thank you for bringing me back with you you could have easily left me back and i appreciate that you took the time not a suicide mission where's the horn all right it's not with the illithid is it how safe she looks visually nervous and she goes-- well that's what the order that originally sealed it believes even if it's somewhere safe temporarily we can possibly relocate it but we have to-- (sighs) well if i were to fall in the process of trying to get the horn others would come after me i sent word to my order that if i did not return they would send more go for it yeah go ahead and roll insight and she goes so this horn which is one of two if allura is correct was sealed a thousand or so years ago by those who originally cut it from the head of the avatar of orcus of which it was bestowed they once he was slain did everything they could within their power to destroy it yet this artifact instilled with the purity of orcus was indestructible to their knowledge so the least they could do was to seal both horns across the world from each other and forget that it even existed which worked well until recently it wasn't until these visions came to me and other members of my order that we knew that this this was a thing and me being the closest in my pilgrimage we took that as time of the essence i was to go in there with a team and retrieve it if it couldn't be destroyed at the very least we could convene and decide a safer place to possibly reseal it and forget there are magical ways of forcing those of us who know how to forget that would be the safest thing for it if there is a way to destroy it we don't know but that could also be sought after we have arcane and divine knowledge we didn't have back then so in the long run it needs to be retrieved the longer it stays down there in the underdark no matter where you placed it it draws like a beacon all darkness to it until something else like this beholder k'varn will take up the mantle and themselves be as dangerous or more so than he ever was as far as i know the visions only gave me access to where this one was i can only assume that it's out there but if someone else were to find it i would know that they probably have knowledge of the second one existing as well i don't know if k'varn shared this information but if someone else takes the mantle of this horn what's to stop them from seeking the other regardless i appreciate that we're all alive and we're together and where are we we're in emon well that's wondrous we can speak with allura she would have the wisdom to know what to do with this next what are you saying i don't know much about the illithid themselves but they reside deep and they are not fans of the surface i believe that it was k'varn's initial onset that was pushing them both in union with the duergar and pushing them towards the siege they spoke of something about bringing twilight to the surface world i don't know what that was about but i fear what knowledge they have if left alone at the very least i know that they're probably having to return and lick their wounds where we left behind it would be folly for them especially knowing that we're aware to attack now but we can notify those in kraghammer to buffer their defenses close the tunnels that you took down there and my army as well and that should give us time to prepare if we choose to seize or at least seal them off the order of the platinum dragon it's a religion check you could roll a history check and probably gain some knowledge based on that but the-- if you'd like to go for it i mean you guys are familiar loosely with the name bahamut you've heard tiberius bring it up before you've seen temples to it but your knowledge knows that bahamut is very well regarded as the lawful good deity of justice and honor and is primarily one of the great good gods of this pantheon if we had the means of doing so yes we'd have to talk to the order we'd have to talk to the council we'd have to bring people that we could trust and that had the capabilities of knowing if this were possible how we would go about it it's beyond my knowledge don't go into contact with it i don't know i saw it for as long as you did the essence of most artifacts like this it goes more than just touch one has to be imbued bond with these artifacts to attune with them like any powerful magical item to truly gain its power but that's not to say that itself does not contain some sort of foul intelligence okay so you walk your way down as you're walking past as you walk past you are immediately met in the hallway by erwen your servant your halfling elder servant who walks up and says dear i wanted to let you know that a scroll came for you some sort of a summons and he hands it to you and he kinda walks past you in the tunnel you open it up a little bit it's not hasn't been opened you kinda pull the paper and open it up it's a summon to the council of tal'dorei it's written by the hand of the clerk and it says essentially the sovereign uriel has been notified of your arrival and would like to see you at the council chambers posthaste it was addressed to vox machina all right you make your way back in kima finishes her meal and you guys are chatting a bit she's just like all right if i may ask how did you seal it i feel uncomfortable knowing the process and that it's at least safe she glances at you and goes all right very well just be mindful that you don't go reaching in there lady kima who is currently covered in dirt and sweat still in the golden armor that she wrestled from the long-dead corpse of a dwarf in the underdark her chin is smattered with dried mashed potatoes and a bit of her breakfast kinda gives-- (laughs) gives you a look as you're walking in like it's good to see you alive friend she stands up and kinda wipes the food off her chin clutches her symbol and then steps right before you looking up towards your face and says i thank you friend grog and then reaches out and gives you a big hug she releases grog slightly and kinda gives you a keen look and goes also appreciated please i'd love to see her it's been too long all right i'm going to is there a room i could rest erwen who's by the door leads her to the guest room and you guys take a moment to rest we'll go ahead and pick up next session at that point where allura's being brought in so we'll stop the game there as i have to rush to the airport but before that we have some gifts to open from you guys huh yeah i got a redeye 1am to be in sandusky ohio at collisi--er no collosalcon please come it'll be fun guys thank you so much for watching that was a lot of fun and everyone lived barely barely oh my god her and scanlan twice for you all right essentially it says vox machina i have sent you a disposable camera basically i had this idea to send this to you and have you guys go crazy fill up the camera with random shenanigans whether it's behind-the-scenes setup during a stream or elsewise of your shoes and then once you guys have filled both cameras you can send them back with the already printed label included in the box i sent this in send it back to me i can get the pictures printed and doubled and then send
