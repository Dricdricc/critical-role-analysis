episode of critical role [water bubbling] [thunder] [explosion] (chanting) role critical role [dramatic critical role theme] and welcome back (laughter) i salute you laura bailey so last we left off the mighty nein had found their way back from the menagerie coast to check in with some friends and the general chaos brewing based on the conflict between the empire and the kryn dynasty upon traveling making your way towards the city of felderwin a city involved with nott's history you discovered that this apothecary that had burned to the ground belonged to a male halfling who has now gone missing and discovered that nott had a little boy after learning about nott's history learned more than that you learned that nott at one point was indeed a halfling through a vengeful plot by the goblins that stalk the southeastern regions of the empire's marrow valley she managed to help her family escape but was drowned and then reincarnated by some sort of a hooded power figure that had an alliance with these goblins it seemed brought back as a goblin and has been living as such for the better part of two years now upon asking around the city and getting some information you discovered that the husband of nott or veth if you will has been apparently taken by the kryn and had some involvement with his alchemical studies with the cerberus assembly and this study of dunamis you acquired a few objects from a subterranean basement laboratory that was mostly trashed apparently in the razing of the city you then decided to go and inspect the tunnels where these kryn emerged from one of them apparently was still somewhat intact deciding to not be balked by a sheer wall of stone and rock jester proceeded to twice polymorph herself into a dire honey badger and burrow her way through hundreds and hundreds of feet of rock emerging on the rest of this uncollapsed burrowed tunnel of a large worm creature they had used to attack without warning the city of felderwin as you the mighty nein had made your way beyond that boundary and began to step into this subterranean cavern system stalking and seeking the path that these individuals took here beneath the surface we begin tonight's game first off how would you like to prepare what is your marching order let me know what your plan is now going in to the sheer dark underground beneath the marrow valley not frustration they're not knives well first off a marching order these tunnels here can range between brief bits of cavern and open chambers to following this carved worm tunnel which is about ten feet wide and is cylindrical you can have at most two people shoulder-to-shoulder going through each place i would like to know for the majority of this journey-- and tell me when you want to change it up at any point-- i want to know what your marching order is traveling through here we have caleb and caduceus towards the center go look there you go yasha and beau at the front behind that caleb and caduceus who's behind them so fjord and jester at the front then nott you're taking the back so then where's yasha don't apologize it's okay we're figuring this out okay yeah if you would like to have taken your-- i don't have the mini on me at the moment i can do that at the break however as you've worked out your grouping traveling through these tunnels you go on for an hour two hours those at the front which would be you two i'd like you both to make a perception check please so you're helping keeping a watch as you guys progress the faint perpetual decline goes deeper and deeper beneath the earth the rushing sounds of the underground river that seems to be walking alongside this passageway slowly fades as you see the river now pass beneath stone the cavern come to an end and the entrance of the next portion of the tunnel where the worm creature had to burrow into this chamber there are natural pockets of cavernous areas here but a lot of them aren't connected except for by this particular burrowed tunnel so that's probably going to be the path you're going to be looking for wherever you're traveling yasha stares ahead for a moment and goes having been to places like the coast it's not very nice rolling your perception you don't see anything aside from the natural formations there's the smell of hard water and wet earth that permeates the entirety of this chamber and continuing on for quite some time the natural chambers and pathways here are chained together by these tunnels but within them it doesn't look from anything you've seen so far is lived in you don't see signs of any other creatures making homes or nests you do see bits of quartz-like crystal forming from gathered minerals over time a series of stalactites and stalagmites that find their way through the-- see thank you guys for your help yes just keep giving me suggestions really figured it out it's not condescending at all make a survival check yeah the previous tunnel yeah based on looking at the ground here which is mostly packed dirt and general loose pieces of pebbles and things that were pushed and ground around by the creature that made its way through the area in its wake you can see familiar footfalls similar to the shape that you'd previously seen that didn't match the rest of the crownsguard and/or the righteous brand that existed in the vicinity of felderwin you do notice the trail the tracks of the kryn warriors that had exited and it does lead and follow the burrowing path of the worm it's about ten feet wide eight to ten feet wide no roll a nature check you have no idea if sheep's pupils are square all right you push on what little light you have shoving back the darkness via the dull orb that caleb is carrying in the center of the heart of your traveling troupe you leave that first winding cavern and begin to continue down the burrowed hallway created by this worm it stretches on for a mile two miles five miles sure make a perception check walking along the things you do notice is the stone and earth seems fairly smooth the way it's pushed through but getting up close you can see tiny little scrapes or hooks where you gather is probably how the creature manages to break through and push its way through through expanding and contracting muscles within its long body and these spine or scale-like protrusions that dig in and pull it along rather quickly underground beyond figuring out the locomotion of this entity this creature you don't along this part of the journey at least yet see any signs of purposeful markings essentially continuing on for the next five to six hours still following this tunnel starting to get a little tired if i recall it was somewhere around midday a little after noon i'd say at this time it's probably close to dusk on the surface fucking feat i know it's in the book you passed water in the first cavern that you went through that lasted for maybe about a mile or so the bulk of it weaving through where a lot of the water passing through that river carved through the rock over time but then eventually that trailed off and this burrow was the only other path to take you've been there for a number of hours now you keep pressing on all right a few more hours pass people at the front roll perception checks for me please good to know you had a question for caduceus you said you continue on for another hour or so you do come to another chamber but it's only about 30 by 20 feet wide and it's a heavy geode it looks like there are a locked piece a pocket of old stale air that was opened up as this worm burrowed through you can see broken crystals of many beautiful colors a lot of them milky white quartz-like a few that are almost a purple amethyst tint to it it's a beautiful prism as you see the entire room is a scattering of shades of purple pink and strangely orange it refracts the light in a way you haven't seen before and for the moment this dark ominous space becomes this beautiful disco make a perception check just a perception check you take a moment and listen to the quiet no sound no vibration yes on the edges of it however where the worm had burrowed through there's a part of the ground that's digging into a divot the interior of the geode's been carved out in that space there are small bits maybe like two- or three-feet pockets but a large portion of this little geode chamber is mostly covered in crystal yes quite a bit of it has been cracked and broken make a nature check for me a lot of this appears to be natural crystal it's not a particular gemstone or anything really precious per se you're sure you could probably-- there are uses for it some people like to use them as focuses for healing and for general decor simple cheap jewelry can be made from this as well yeah there you go okay you're not sure what the worth is you haven't delved in the realm of selling or purchasing crystals in the street before but you imagine depending on the person you could probably get a little bit of coin for it what are you doing yeah you couldn't cover the entire dome but you could definitely create a portion of it that's in a shell you essentially diffuse element of that rock away from it to create the shell on the opposite side totally doable you create a hut you guys take your evening's rest there's a pause then the voice comes through well i would say it is not advised to give it up to pull it out of your bag but who am i to keep you from taking an artifact into the heart of danger you have a high enough wisdom to know that there was a hint of biting sarcasm to his statement but interpret that as you will now is everyone taking a comfortable evening's rest within the hut you do have a pretty decent setup between the tiny hut and the alarm threads okay you guys all find yourself to rest here deep beneath the surface of exandria for some of you dreams come for some of you no it's a clean sleep-to-wake experience until eventually you slowly come to consciousness feeling rested though strange to not have a day or night cycle nothing has changed from your experience you feel like you've rested but have you it could have been an hour it could have been eight hours being this far beneath the surface for an extended period of time is going to be a little strange for those of you who have not had that experience which is all of you you would know-- that's a good question let me look it up real fast you always know the number of hours left before the next sunrise or sunset i'd say yeah you'd be able to tell everyone even just informing everyone of the time it's still-- you can say it and be like oh yeah guys it's 900 in the morning you're like cool no issues nothing has changed frumpkin did not notice anything out of the ordinary as the hut comes to a close and you step out from behind the somewhat created stone shell placed by caduceus the tunnel is yours you got it as frumpkin keeps you warm in the throat region you all continue onward same order those helming the charge at the front either each take an individual perception check or you may help for advantage mage armor yeah good call nice a few more miles of winding tunnel continue before you and it's a very trying monotonous experience where it's lengths of time and travel where there's no real change in topography slight variations as it winds in this natural shifting with the physicality of the creature that burrowed it but it's this cylindrical of stone and earth for hours and hours until you catch the next first glimpse of another chamber opening before you you do not see any movement as you get a little closer you can begin to see the interior of the chamber near where it opens up inside the air here is already pretty chilly here beneath the surface the air has more moisture to it than the tunnel you've been traveling through you can smell a bit of that heavy mineral subterranean water scent you listen in for a second and you can hear the subtle dripping of condensation probably from the ceiling which means there's probably a nearby water source somewhere in the vicinity there is a chamber that opens up ahead of you roll stealth checks for me please sam laura and pass without a trace good call did you roll for yasha as well moving into the chamber as it opens in you can see this area has quite a heavy clustering of stalagmites and stalactites all across the interior of this chamber it opens up maybe 40 or so feet wide and it seems to curve around this large bend elements of it rise while you do not see a river looking up at where the water's dripping from you get the sense there might be a large body of water not that far above elements of the groundwater are trickling through and elements are gathering to create the interior of this chamber yes you know where north is you don't have a gps per se but you know where north is right so you have a vague idea you've been traveling for a day from felderwin right so it's about say 24 miles in a day you'd be about there this vicinity here so you're right in this vicinity there are the heavy stalagmites and rock protrusions from the ground that litter the interior of the chamber as it curves off to the side you cannot see where the worm went through can't see the other side it looks like the worm when it entered this chamber-- you don't see in your vicinity where it may have continued to burrow you get the sense that maybe this creature and the people that were steering it were leading it through whatever open chambers were possible and then only burrowing when there was no continuation make a survival check you're looking for okay so both of you are looking for essentially signs of things okay perception check and then survival check from each of you 21 okay that's better all right looking around you continue to see the footfalls the footprints along the patches of ground where it seems like dirt and dust has been settled in areas that are a little bit wet from the moisture in the air you can see some of these grimy recesses in the muck and the dirt that is similar to the footfalls you've already seen in previous chambers of what appears to be of the kryn you can see some of the stone formations in the ground two of them appear to be broken and pushed over where it looks like the creature may have shoved its way through it goes around the edge and then curves up out of sight you can try to continue to look in that direction but from what you can see the vicinity that's the path it's taking you were looking for holes in the wall all right looking around the vicinity you don't see any holes in the wall you do see there are elements in the rock where there are cracks and you can see where small bits of water are slowly dribbling through and then (dripping) they're pretty decent perfect so you paint a little figure of the-- so you're watching the entrance-- okay so yeah as you walk over there there is an area where it curves in then rises up a little bit to the left you can see a small pool of water where it's gathered and created this little tucked in the side pool maybe five-foot by 15 feet go ahead and get close to it it looks clear it looks very-- you can see the bottom it looks to be no more than have five six feet deep you can see where it continues up off to that side jester finishes painting the statue you look around for somewhere to place it there are a number of these larger rock formations five ten feet tall eight-foot tall little squat ones what do you want okay perfect all right she's writing that down you were at the front who's watching the back all right perception check both of you guys just to make sure you're keeping watch all right you watch the distant path the dark that continues curving up off to the side you look over there no movement you're looking towards the tunnel where you guys came from no movement you hear the chuckles and look back at what they're doing you see one of these stalagmites these tendrils (slurping) need to roll initiative (yelling) get a surprise round by this little tiny squat one you were over on this side looking off this way nott were you helping them out beau is right there yasha will be keeping an eye not noticing caleb where were you all right then so initiative orders 25 to 20 i just said roll initiative just so we have it okay 25 to 20 it's fine all right 15 to ten then we have jester at the bottom so fjord you go first you're the only one who noticed them in this scenario because you were the one who's closest to the actual-- caduceus is facing on the back side of the chamber what are you doing yep two of them you see that one and go shit shit and you see them both go (gurgling) all righty go for it roll attacks for each it (poofing) just dissipates without effect across its rocky armored surface sure which one this one all right (poofing) no effect you watch as the eldritch energy the green burst just scatters across its rocky exterior no impact you all of a sudden heard a (poof) and you heard him shout as you turn around and saw fjord shout big trouble and then vanish behind a nearby rock like a hero i know in this moment of realization of what's happening these two large stalagmites suddenly have a single eye that opens in the center this burning red orange-ish eye with a vertical slit the center of it opens up into this large gaping mouth of sharpened teeth and a liquid tongue on the inside that's slimy-ing around these four tendrils that unravel so it's now their turn it's going to move there five ten they shift it looks like they're gliding but there's thousands of tiny cilia underneath that just cause them to glide across the ground this one on this end is going to go ahead and make three attacks each can make four tendril attacks yes so jester that is a 21 to hit all right you are grappled while you're grappled you are restrained and have disadvantage on strength checks there's one now to beau that's going to be a 14 to hit against beau again that's going to be a 25 to hit so you are grappled yep we'll say you're grappled beau you're also grappled i'm putting restrained there because you are technically restrained as well against nott-- yep as it (whoosh) out that way that one's going to be 17 misses you just duck underneath the fourth one's going to swing out towards you as well that's going to be a 20 you are also grappled correct you can try and escape it it's an action to try and escape from the grapple you can still attack but you're restrained so you have disadvantage on your attacks it's your athletics or acrobatics you choose now it's going to go ahead and make a bite attack against jester because you're the closest one to it since you're restrained it has advantage on the attack it's a natural 20 and a three so natural 20 it is so that's going to be-- ooh oh no 34 points of piercing damage from the critical hit as its tendril pulls you in towards its mouth shoves your shoulder and the side of your neck into it and it grinds down onto you the armor pulls in and you can feel it piercing the back of your neck sharp pain arcs through your body this one here is going to go ahead and go for caleb for an attack that's going to be a 14 to hit shield (whoosh) it actually almost grabs you and in the last minute you throw your hand up and an arcane barrier flashes in front and the tentacle gets knocked off limply yes yes you may go for it he's got three more tendril attacks each round they get four each yep haven't encountered adventurers in a while buddy i admire your creativity 3d10 damage as it bites into you you angrily focus-- and what's its save dex save haha a two the damage definitely takes (shattering) these ice crystals suddenly apparate around its mouth where it bit into jester and it seems to pull back a bit its eye closes and winces with the impact now its other attacks its second attack against you caleb that's going to be an 18 to hit because the shield's still up deflects the second attack third one's going to go for caduceus it has a 50-foot range on its tendrils (exclamations of shock) all right now you are also grappled well you are considered grappled but while you're grappled you are restrained which means you have disadvantage on attacks you also have disadvantage on strength checks and strength saving throws you cannot move your speed is zero its fourth and final tendril it's going to go ahead and shoot for caleb again natural 20 yeah well it still hits but it doesn't-- right it doesn't do any damage the tendril is just a-- right it gets one bite attack per turn but it grapples each of you just letting you know you probably want to hold onto that that's okay you are also grappled there caleb and restrained it's going to use reel pulls caduceus into it and caleb into it it's going to make an attack against you as you are restrained attack rolls against you have advantage a two and a one motherfuck it goes towards to bite you and the shield is still holding and it's pulling you in towards its mouth but you see the barrier pressing and bits of its rock exterior are cracking being pressed up against this shield all right surprise round's done top of the round beau you're up first you are currently grappled and restrained you have no movement well technically you are adjacent to it because you're both right there and it's in this space you and jester are both adjacent to it yes you can hit it nott it did not reel you in that turn because i forgot it can do the reel as part of its action your attacks have disadvantage by the way because you're restrained miss that two attacks so far the first attack you can't quite get your hand free you manage to get it free for a second attack and it hits the rock no impact still have your bonus action she rolled low you can disengage but you still have no movement you have to escape from it to gain your movement speed back right now you're wrapped up by its tendril and you can't go anywhere no disengage prevents attacks of opportunity but you cannot get away from it to even trigger one fjord you're on deck with yasha after that you can use your action to try and break free yeah there you go flurry of blows get two more strikes on it each with disadvantage 20 just hits the first one doesn't even get out the second one hits the rock and hurts you get your other arm free and (impacts) into the stone again this time you look down as the eye opens up and you see the eye and go (whack) right into the center of its giant glowing eye roll damage on that one that's the end of your turn cool that brings us to fjord you can do stunning strike if you want to but that's up to you yeah even when you attack on your flurry of blows as long as you hit with an attack you can do that all right spend another ki point constitution save it's a natural one motherfuck we'll take this stunned token and put it on this one that's hex correct now fjord you can take your turn as you take your turn you look over and watch as beau plunges her fist into the eye of this living stalagmite and it starts suddenly wriggling in place it looks like it's having a rough time your attacks have advantage on it because it is stunned yes that hits got you 19 just barely misses unfortunately you rush up with one attack carve across with the scimitar and you expect it to completely deflect the blow but the blade does cut through the rock where it splits where the blade was there is a muscly fleshy interior the creature is heavily armored by the shell it's created around itself but it's definitely mortal your second strike however glides against the outside of its rocky shell and makes no damage all right right there i would say because you can only misty step to places you can see you can go there but you have five feet of movement left so you move there anyways just as a point of reference that ends fjord's turn yasha's up go for it all righty that is a natural 20 for the first one and the second one is only a ten times two you mean any bonuses on top of that 29 points of damage from that first strike as the magician's judge carves down through it one of the tentacles gets damaged and you can see it still holding tight but starting to wear this thing down still looking okay though that finishes yasha's turn they're after the ropers they're right before you guys they're squeezed right between yasha and your trio's turn this one here is going to reel in nott now you get pulled oh that one's stunned so it can't never mind that one right there is going to attempt to ensnare with one of its free tendrils yasha that is going to be a 15 to hit it hits she is also now grappled and restrained it's going to make a bite attack against caleb you have to break free that's another natural 20 reaction from caduceus to-- what's the ability called again channel divinity was it once per short rest grave clerics man that's awesome well be thankful he reduced that critical 28 points of piercing damage as it jams your entire arm into its mouth and it's starting to pull you in from the torso up the other one is stunned and does not get its turn that brings us to the trio he's already going he's already on it what's the save what is it wisdom this is for the guy over there 14 he is slowed that guy is a 15 they're both slowed yeah a fan sent those actually you've got it caleb that's your go casting frantically with the off-hand their whipping tendrils that are wrapping you all of a sudden go (slow-down sound) its chewing on caleb is like (slow grinding) jester's still part way in like oh god slow chews nott or caduceus what's the save charisma oh they are not charismatic there is a 12 and a zero yeah you've got it caduceus is pulled in manages to curse them both with this divine power pulled from the wildmother's darker side of nature and then holds the staff up through a burst of insects beetles then fly out of it clouding around this central stalagmite and begin to assault the opposite side of the creature it is still stunned so you have advantage on your attack it's stunned until beau's next turn 18 just hits because of the slow spell their ac is reduced by two no it's just 4d4 ten is the average damage ten points of damage the beetles are now biting into the side of this entity that finish your turn you've got it it is stunned yes 15 misses it ricochets off of its rock-like hide the bolt goes scattering off into the shadows somewhere go for it they appear to be of similar material they have a similar look to them but they're flexible so they're probably not as-- 28 does hit and it is adjacent-- well it's stunned anyway so you do get your sneak attack damage on it all the dice 30 points of damage nice as the first bolt ricochets you see a spark as the rock-like exterior shoots it off as it's sitting there (groaning) with its one eye open its jaw still chewing on jester jester manages to wedge herself out of its mouth just in time for you to aim the bolt into its throat it begins to cough a bit of its own blood it's looking pretty hurt that ends your turn nott jester you're up oh shit it rolled a natural 16 minus two (cheering) this guy vanishes the tendrils are no longer around you so none of them are-- you're all of a sudden released from it and the creature's just not there anymore right because you're still wrapped up by its tendrils beau you're up it is stunned until the end of your next turn i believe right you still have advantage on the attacks you have disadvantage because you're restrained so it's just a straight roll for you go for it 14 misses you're punching a rock and it's hurting but you're going to get through looking for those soft spots yes that hits seven points of damage that is an 18 so it resists it that's minus two to it so it's a 16 what's your dc yeah so it resists it i saw it 11 points of damage on that strike as you jam the staff into the middle of its mouth and are prying it open you get down and see where its eye is trying to keep closed and the moment it flicks open to be aware of its surroundings you whack poking it right there 18 just hits because of the slow spell 11 points of damage oof this thing is not having a great moment fjord you're up both hit damn nice it is no longer stunned actually did you roll with advantage or did you roll regularly good it's no longer stunned so you do not have advantage on the attack how do you want to do this (cheering) you see fjord holding the pose there for a second as beau's holding its tongue and the tongue comes out you look past and watch as its eye goes limp and it shifts off into three separate pieces you guys book it ropers man yep you can add a roper tongue to your inventory there you go that's the other inventory it's pretty tough strangely salty it's the minerals as you guys are rushing up around the edge the cavern ends about another 50 or 60 feet up front it just ends jester make a perception check you're looking around and the tracks that you noticed earlier you guys pick up on and you see that it is still traveling this direction you can glance at the area though the wall itself is this surface of loose rock and stone formations there following the tracks there is an area where it looks like the stones are just loosely there part of the wall fell in and covered the interior but you can pull stones out of it okay so you start pulling stones out and passing them off some of them are pretty heavy yasha is helping you guys are pulling them out one by one you get a small section of opening available to you it wasn't a huge collapse it looks like when it was passing through it might have bumped into the wall and caused a portion of it to fall in and it's only the lack of light in here that's really making it hard to originally even notice this exit you get halfway through it before you hear (whoosh) in the room behind you sam and yes go for it it moves very slow you glance back in the area and it goes (squelching) it moves ten feet a round and you're about a hundred feet from it around that way it'll be about another minute before it gets within range 22 that hits technically it's still-- no it's not slowed anymore because slow has worn off right it's been banished for a minute (laughing) go for it you can still attack from a distance it's about a hundred now it's 90 feet from you go for it yasha and beau are moving rocks make an athletics check for me make an athletics check for yasha yeah she's good 28 hits it's not in range yet it's 90 feet from you roll for attack all right that's as far as you can get you're up against the wall now you have to roll attack for that yeah that hits 13 points of radiant damage and it's also glowing the next attack on it has advantage it moves forward again it is now 70 feet from you go for it that's the way to do it 21 damage for you 18 from you 21 hits yeah and 18 damage all right it's taking hits and slowly moving towards you it feels like the old 1950s sci-fi movie with the weird carrot looking creatures that these are loosely based on visually this is like a dude in a suit trying to scoot it forward they don't chase very well ropers okay go for it you got it but it's advantage because the-- well no because you already used the guiding bolt that's right there's a burst of powder and smoke you've never fired a firearm it's still a relatively new technology for most people outside of the main military and even then they've only been producing them out of hupperdook for the past ten years so your first time really using this and yeah the ringing's in your ears your hand feels numb from the blowback not great it (pings) off of the front of it now it's 60 feet a natural 20 on its save that is a 15 yep roll damage ooh so both hits one with a crit that first attack's a crit double very next round okay mighty nein how do you want to do this with vague interest it's starting to loom forward (blasting) it goes limp it gets really tense for a second and then really sad and is like okay it's dead at this point in time beau and yasha have managed to pull enough rocks out of that tunnel to make it large enough for each of you-- and fjord-- to squeeze through you can step through each of you and eventually find yourself on the other side the burrowed tunnel continues ahead of you into darkness strange gnomish engineering that's still in the early development stages continuing down the familiar monotonous carved tunnel if you're keeping the same order make your perception checks keeping a watch out front nice you move on for the remainder of the day before getting to a point where you're starting to get a little tired and you figure you can continue to push on if you want to but you'll begin to push into possible exhaustion territory you've now hit what would be a full day's worth of travel and this burrowed tunnel continues on you've found one chamber and then passed it so at least you know there's probably more to come in the level you are currently traveling in but this day's travel after that last encounter you have not found another chamber nope but the good news is as long as you have this tunnel you know at least you're probably on the right track okay and the width of that is i think it might be a bit large to carve the whole thing ten-foot radius yeah so you can carve part of it and it'll still be partially exposed but he can color it as he wants and with the stone it'll help somewhat camouflage it so you guys spend the evening another long rest roll perception for frumpkin for the evening if you don't mind okay there's a brief pause and then ah no they just have me in a room we haven't been traveling underground since we got out but they have me in the city now perception for frumpkin good to know the evening goes by frumpkin does notice throughout the evening some movement through the tunnel a strange creature similar to what seemed to be the stalagmite-type roper creatures who you had fought before but a little smaller scooting along the ceiling it made it through the tunnel over top of you guys and then continued on without noticing or caring about the location where you had placed and camouflaged your evening's rest the next morning comes to you continue traveling all right keeping a watch out laura please as jester roll your perception check it's a long subterranean journey for me doing day-to-day here i'm sorry okay you got a keen eye out there in front of you this day is the hardest so far because it is an entire eight-plus hours of just winding tunnel once again that continuous pace it seems to dip at times and then it picks up it has its own organic shifting to it in small bits but it is a day of travel of that same ten-foot wide continuous tunnel and it is maddening perfect all right that day's travel goes by uneventful so day three is done do you guys set up camp once more here in the tunnel okay i think so she loves a lot all you hear is i can't so you settle in for your third evening here underground i would hope so because your provisions are going to run out pretty quickly otherwise divine mac and cheese doesn't taste divine just is divine maybe tomorrow so same set up evening's rest frumpkin's keeping watch go ahead and roll perception check for frumpkin six okay good to know as the evening goes on frumpkin doesn't notice anything you wake up your fourth day begins you gather your things and begin to trek even further into this single perpetual tunnel this is just an overall penalty to stealth (laughter) both you and jester both make perception checks travis fjord at this point trying to ignore that and facing forward is continuing the path this protracted tunnel you begin to notice smaller tunnels intersecting with it like one on the side one a little higher all right you look up and you can see they are maybe about two three feet wide each from what you can see the entrance to the first one on the right that's on the right side a lot of dirt and rock has been pushed into it it's kind of closed off you walk up to the second one it's a little more up on the left higher range of it and you can see there are bits of stone and dirt that have fallen out and created a small pile on the ground beneath it no you who have been so distracted by the reading of the book hear nothing caleb looking at this you figure these tunnels existed before this burrowing happened and it looks like when this worm came through it tore through whatever these tunnels were and pushed shit into them and wrecked a little bit of this tunnel structure make a perception check listening in looking up there you don't see anything-- the one to the right you don't see anything you don't hear anything you do notice some markings quick little cuts in the dirt or stone like hand or claw marks dragged across bits of it small you see the pile of rocks and dirt that have fallen along the top you glance over and you can see something somewhat shiny that's picking up the light from your globe it looks like a hammer but it's not well taken care of per se your nose picks up a little bit of the air here it smells somewhat rancid a little bit just a faint hint of rot it's about ten feet up the whole tunnel is one big ten-foot side to side no body yeah just like a discarded tool it's a hammer it looks like it's seen a lot of use the metal's wrecked a little bit in places and it's been bludgeoned and misused make an investigation check they have been dug and you see signs that they were dug out by hand and dug out by shovel or some sort of a tool used for digging from above and the side you get the sense that the one that opens up here connected to the other one and this tunnel was burrowed in the middle and took out that connecting point looking around here most of it appears to be carved stone and dirt well the tunnel continues also it's up to you guys the ashkeeper peaks are what divides the two sides of eastern and western wynandir yeah it's a couple of feet deep and the rest of the tunnel goes beyond but for you caduceus it's a tight squeeze we're talking bishop in aliens getting through the tunnel no yeah there's no breeze in here no so you send frumpkin ahead roll a perception check for frumpkin in the dark so disadvantage on the perception check okay good to know what's your idea you tie a little ribbon around frumpkin's neck you cast light and now the ribbon gives off this torchlight glow from the back of frumpkin now roll a straight perception roll for frumpkin 16 okay frumpkin continues on 50 feet 80 feet about another hundred feet or so there's another tunnel intersection it's breached by this carving path then about another 130 feet or so another chamber opens up this chamber is about 40 foot by 80 foot and the smell here is strong frumpkin picks up on it smells of rot mildew feces it's not a pleasant smell and there are piles of refuse and furs and utensils and belts and odd objects that are thrown into piles here you can see a number of other tunnels that all intersect into this area nope ten or so different tunnels lead into this chamber all ranging between two feet wide to about three feet wide you see a small broken shovel there are piles of dirt bones coins looks like a lot of things that have been gathered you can see warped pieces of wood that are partially whittled and then abandoned in the moment stacks of a bunch of junk frumpkin hears a small growl and looks and in the far-right corner there's a small cage in the cage there's some sort of a furred creature no more than that big or so that's missing tufts of fur and it's in the cage going (growling) they're platforms the topography of the inside-- it's not just a perfectly oval thing it has a bunch of pieces of rock and stone and levels where these tunnels are emerging and appearing yeah yeah the cat continued down the big tunnel and found that other chamber the tunnel continues past that chamber by the way no this was frumpkin going ahead on the tunnel you guys were traveling and found that other chamber and the tunnel continues on the other side of this chamber yep frumpkin returns frumpkin heads into the small side tunnel curves around about 20 or so feet and then it opens up into another small chamber what frumpkin sees is a ten by 15-foot opening area with a pile of matted material like cloth-- it may have been at one point but it's soiled you see two figures sitting there one of them is in the process of fitting something together or pulling something apart and the other is currently gnawing on some sort of a long-dried bone they're tiny humanoid longer snout tails scaly skin i would say lizard- or almost dragon-like but very tiny they're both sitting in there spears set to the side (gnawing noises) about 30 or so feet the last thing frumpkin sees is them go (hiss) okay you guys all heading to split to the sides you hear a (snarling) and you see a spearhead slowly emerge from the tunnel and its head poke out ever so slightly make stealth checks guys by the way because this is now going to see you i'll say a straight stealth check on this one this happened too quickly yeah your cloak affects any stealth check you make for the most part cool all right okay it pokes its head out (sniffs) looks right over towards fjord and goes (questioning chitters) (yelling) the one behind it looks through and is like (alarmed hiss) and turns around and runs down the hall and the one that's there is like (panting) all right well as you're casting the spell you hear the one that ran back go like (shouts of alarm) you begin to hear this echoing sound of lots of claws scurrying their way through the nearby tunnels and that's where we're going to go and take a break (yelling) we'll come back

there's a rick and morty versus dungeons and dragons comic book they just released the fourth and final issue it's written by our friend of the show patrick rothfuss if you remember from campaign one patrick rothfuss drawn by jim zub it's a great team and a number of people from the community make little cameos in it our friend and love of all d&d chris perkins is in it satine's in it apparently i'm in this issue which is kind of nuts so yeah it's pretty awesome you should check it out if you have the opportunity it's pretty awesome gary gygax's ghost says a fun phrase indeed anyway getting back into the insanity you had just grabbed the spear from a nearby kobold as the other one rushed off i would like for you to make a strength check please no you grab its spear and it goes (yell) and pulls it back from you as you hear the mounting skittering of numerous creatures now coming from behind where you were and from the nearby tunnels what are you guys doing multiple directions behind you apparently as you're casting the spell transforming into a larger kobold you start rushing forward are you guys all heading forward with fjord okay you guys charge forward around the corner into the next chamber that chamber has about 20 or so kobolds that have emerged from or are in the process of emerging from the different tunnels that are all facing your direction with small dinged blades and crossbows that look like they might work spears and small leather and wood shields and they all fill the chamber in front of you going (chittering snarling) they're holding the line what are you doing yeah there's definitely a confused division and attention here as they're like (chittering) the ones behind beau-- as you're strolling up and he's shouting this out there are about ten or so kobolds that begin to rush up from behind and they see you and they slow their step and start taking their spears and prodding you to join the rest of the people there's one in the center of all of them that are there there's one that is covered in cages and boxes and leather straps there's another that has heavy pieces of armor almost weighing him down you see others that look like skirmishers that are all gathered around and they all have this growling barking energy they look a bit hungry a bit sallow and the one that's in the full armor steps forward towards you and you and is looking back and forth and gives you this curious look (grunts) you hear him say in draconic come forth loud meal there are a number that are staring at you in half awe like-- do you approach all right make a dexterity saving throw as you're saying this with intensity and force you guys watch as suddenly there's a cloud of dust around his ankles and a rope loop wraps and pulls your legs together and hoists you up and you're now dangling about three four feet off the ground at which point all the kobolds-- there's this large wave of cackles the one raises his hand up and they all get quiet and he goes-- you loud food points at the rest of you you want pass yep as your hair is just dripping there and you're slowly (creaking) he's following you with this nasty looking shortsword that looks like the edges of it are grimed up with black oil or something ugh takes a step back make an intimidation check he who summoned kitty spirit we already cursed you in no position you in that position so you give one to feed or trade for food he's looking at you he's making this challenge to you but is definitely keeping a distance and is taking a step back from where he was standing so confidently in your direction yes yeah-- looking at the specifics of tongues here any creature that knows at least one language can hear and understand it so it's not so much that you're speaking draconic but any creature that knows language can understand you so all of you hear this yes actually strangely enough it's speaking in broken common taliesin and how so what do you want to enhance as frumpkin does that and the rocks shake and tumble around in this small quaking noise about six of the nearby kobolds go (gasping) and start skitting away from it holding their weapons at bay two of them in the tunnels all of a sudden go (squeaking) and climb up in the tunnels and vanish make a deception check you see two of them begin to reach towards you like-- (excited breathing) the one in the full armor goes no pay attention and slaps them with his spear and they (snarl) trade sybil points to one in there and you see this one kobold that's covered in rags-- kind of looks like the collector lady from labyrinth-- and pulls out this large billowing leather sack that's stained of all sorts of colors around its basis (heavy breathing) it holds it up its jaw is slightly dislodged on one side and gives it this crooked grin to its face holds it open we have water fill food (thudding) the thing all of a sudden slams into the ground the heavy weight from the summoned meal hitting the heavy rock floor as soon as that kobold leans forward pulled off of his feet and manages to stumble into it and look inside (sniffs) whoa begins to shovel it the leader then goes stop we eat taliesin and two may pass more food for trade rest huh two and the fey king can also pass you see the others all nervously looking towards the other and you can see him feeling really intimidated by your presence there's this idea of him being the head of this sect and you storming in here and he's just-- this jealous intensity as it stares towards you and goes do not listen why you come false leader may go as well what gator what you can see four other mouths watering as you're describing this tough gator skin give us gator skin no all of it (satisfied grunt) puts it over the side pouch of one of the other ones-- carries it and (excited grunt) is that both of them one of them steps forward and goes i think that is-- shh i'm making number it leans forward towards you giving a look and goes you (sniffs) goblin make a persuasion check takes the pouch from you (sniffs) accepted takes and places it in the pouch (shouting draconic) it shouts you being able to recognize saying all right let them pass (thudding) like a sack of potatoes from that height yeah that would be four points of bludgeoning damage okay you're keeping watch and a few do get close and they're definitely eyeing the various trinkets that dangle from your belts but as any of them start getting close you grab and they pull back the leader goes go follow path of big worm make big mess go just looking at you angrily this-- big mess move through no longer here days weeks very loud ruin tunnel very big no no go stay here home eat food from you what points over to the small cage with the little creature you mean is food it's pretty ragged from this distance it looks closed with a little tlc maybe you're not even sure what kind of creature it is it kind of resembles a squirrel kind of resembles a small dog but it's greasy and ratty and-- most likely yeah make a deception check yes 16 you can give fey king take food keep king okay picks up the fey king from the scruff of the neck and goes you i eat gain power bigger than that one false leader matt and let go all of them pull back and begin to disappear into the tunnels behind and you guys are given a path through the cage is just right there okay the creature immediately jumps out (shrieks) and darts off down the tunnel you guys continue on the path as you're leaving caduceus you notice that the leader leans over to two other kobolds and whispers something to them you hear a low muttering but not in a language you understand so what was that okay after you guys leave everyone scatters into the chambers but stays behind and watches and two of the kobolds slowly begin to follow behind the group in the tunnel after you one of them is the one that's covered in all the different boxes and pouches there's a staff and it has an actual small cage like the one that you just opened on its side with something inside it the other one just looks to be a small spear-holding scout and they're both being quiet as they can but the one carrying everything isn't very quiet caduceus you can hear the gentle clanging of various accessories of this kobold trying to be quiet pursuing you down the tunnel well one of them is just covered in-- --random shit the other one has a spear you travel for about an hour or so away from that the tunnel continuing before you they're still staying back by about 60 or so feet i'd say you're probably within another hour or so of that all right so you guys eventually reach that point and you begin to bed down what do you do okay okay do you guys lay down what do you do is the dome out or are you waiting yes you are ten feet always been ten feet okay you guys-- as you're invisible-- are you walking back towards their direction okay you see the two of them around the bend are both looking and the one with the spear is looking kind of eager the one with all the shit on it is looking a little apprehensive and they're both just watching and talking back and forth (kobold speech) yeah nott vanished a few minutes ago all right okay go ahead and make a i would say with advantage make an athletics check to try and-- seven the spear vanishes from its hand (confused kobold noises) he looks confused and rubs his wrist and starts walking back towards the spear on the opposite side okay go ahead and make an athletics check i would say advantage because it doesn't know you're there i'll allow it it's fine 19 okay if you'd like to describe your kobold (yells of surprise and disbelief) move over taliesin there we go welcome chris so suddenly out of nowhere apparates in the nervous energy of the moment the small goblin creature that you've been eyeing nervously as the group wandered through and it just reaches out and grabs a hold of you so as you hear this sudden clattering commotion and both this kobold voice screaming out mommy and nott going yeah mommy the other kobold down the way goes (panicked kobold yelling) and runs off to grab the spear you guys hear this noise what are you two doing yeah what's your reaction go ahead and make an attack so two piercing damage with the crit technically the dice damage is doubled because it's a crit too so it's just straight damage the eye immediately swells up from the impact and you're like ah just spinning around in a circle the one with the spear rushes up like ergh can't quite figure out where to go what are you guys doing you rush around the corner and you see this whirling whirlwind of clattering pots and cage and goblin and kobold screaming anyone doing anything or are you just watching all right gotcha all right so it's wisdom saving throws go ahead and make a wisdom saving throw if you don't mind okay so-- 12 17 minus two which is 15 so immediately the one holding the spear looks at you huh and you find yourself all of a sudden stop struggling and weapon freezes in place at the same time the tiny goblin arms around you suddenly hulk out and you find yourself lifted off the ground your legs dangling a few inches off the floor of the cavern i'm bex yeah oh (sigh) don't have to tell them this okay sorry (scared kobold noises) there's only one other target in the chamber learning the cutting-edge kobold technology fjord just comes running down the hallway the kobold in right in front of you goes ah just screams at you as you slam into it the spear goes clattering to the ground at which point the enlarge spell fades (whoosh) as he holds up the skunk the nervous energy around it the skunk just instinctually-- (snarl) (spray) travis dexterity saving throw for jester and nott all right you manage to just barely escape out of the way as it-- (skunk noises) okay the other kobold has fled it saw the running fjord centipede nightmare and just left still hitting the skunk (laughing) all right so what's the marching order all right got you so you're leading with your scorpion perfect spurt continues forward do you guys follow travis marisha and all right spurt roll a perception check for me (laughing) okay continuing on for the next few hours getting slowly used to the smell of kobold-- especially a moving-hoarder of a kobold-- the tunnel continues to curve and it goes down a little further then it evens out and goes down a little further then evens out you get pretty late into the day before you begin to notice the rock and stone having some slight changes the general bits of materials that you've been used to seeing down here-- the heavy gray and brown rocks-- occasionally you see flecks and glimmers that your passing light puts a shine across you go over and inspect it and it is a black glass-like substance it's obsidian you continue moving forward and there's more sections of it and you can see where bits of it are broken and flaked off where the worm was burrowing through and battered through a section of obsidian that then shattered yeah definitely you gather up a bunch of obsidian shards a lot of it is broken and brittle but there are some larger bits that you can find that are pretty jagged really you see them first so you gather what you want there you go hey guys kobolds have ecology down exactly i'm just saying none of you has a weapon that feeds you the air gets steadily warmer and warmer as the hours pass and the floor itself begins to give way from the softer dirt and dust with loose pebbles to become a harder more porous rock and the obsidian begins to become more apparent and more consistent you spurt begin to see a dull light ahead a dull low red light it looks to be the tunnel coming to an end for some sort of chamber you're too far away to make out any details but it looks like there is a room beyond it that has a dull red glow to it you just run out you guys see spurt run out the temperature here is getting warmer and warmer as you progress you're starting to find yourselves sweat uncomfortably you rush out into an open field of rock like hewn carved rock floor-- like a courtyard if you will it's about a hundred feet or so across at first glance across the way there is a wall or portions of a stone wall built into parts of an obsidian and stone cliff face or the interior of a cavern you look on the inside and in this brief instant you take in the vicinity through your kobold eyes this large chamber that continues on far to your left to the right is at a very steep incline an obsidian wall where a pouring river of molten magma is coming down into a trough that goes across this open chamber-- this river of lava with a bridge that goes across it to the opposite side to the left there is a very interesting massive black iron citadel that sits maybe a quarter mile to the left of you at the peak of it-- and this is a very large chamber-- dozens of thick heavy black chains affixed to its peak drape off and connect to the odd corners of this large cavern this is far to your left you're in a small side courtyard on this side as you stop and look around-- (laughs) hilariously unnoticed by the two massive fire giants that are currently playing sentinel there's one across the way leaning against the wall standing at roughly 18 to 20 feet tall dark gray skin what little bit of red hair you see peeking from underneath its armored helmet as it's wearing heavy dark armor covered in spikes metallic thorns one hand is holding a tower shield roughly its full height also covered in spikes in the front with another shield just like that that's leaning on the wall it looks like it's currently spacing out for a moment looking back towards the citadel to the immediate left of you on this side of that molten river you see a female fire giant wielding a giant maul who is in the process of picking her teeth with some sort of pointed bone and neither have noticed you strangely they rolled really shitty you guys aren't seeing this you just see the kobold rush out so what do you do spurt the closest one to you is about 20 feet to your left okay roll for attack on it-- or is it a saving throw on their part spurt runs out turns and ah (impact buzzing) the giant goes (grunts) and slaps-- 22 to hit against you you take you watch as spurt turns after throwing this and then a giant hammer (slamming squishing) gallaghers spurt across the stone floor of this open way laura and the hammer lifts up and you see the stringy mess that was once spurt detaching from the hammer everyone make a stealth check here your work is done here (cheering laughter) thank you chris stealth check no pass without a trace was not cast oh wow okay as you guys all pull to the sides you hear (heavy stomping) a hand reaches down and rubs it through the smear that was once the kobold and rises up a couple of pieces (plopping) into the stonework then the light goes dark as the giant's head bends down and one giant eye peeks through the tunnel in your direction the tunnel is ten feet wide the giant is going to have a hard time it could probably get in there if it crawled right now it's leaning down and looking inside it glances around inside bends its head inside-- and it's completely engulfing the entire exit (grunts) backs out of the tunnel and then steps to the side you guys just barely fucking made that you hear it shout something in giant any of you guys speak giant you do that's right because of his background his race it's not a secret it's actually one of the languages that you get as a-- sure enough there you go what you hear is (speaking giant) you recognize it as be careful looks like we got rodents you guys hear on the opposite side the one that was laying with the shield sits up for a second and takes the shield walks over to the river of lava scoops up some of it and pours it across the top of the shield it's like a pachinko machine the lava fills the front of it on the inside there's a pocket and where once there was just dark iron shield now is heating up and the shields have a fiery exterior to them after it fills both the shields it holds both of them gets back to its position and they're both looking around you guys who are off to the side can glance over and watch this happen it's across the way you have no idea what the other giant's doing but this one is across the way and is visible from your position it looks you would guess probably a hundred or more feet across to the other side but there is a wall there make a perception check it's hard to see from this distance make a perception check for me to take in the details of the scenery no shit okay not only as you lean forward and poke through really assess the scene-- i'll just pull out the map and show you because you rolled a natural 20 i'll be right back here's where you guys are this is the tunnel because you rolled a natural 20 you can see on the other side a continuation you gather that when the kryn traveled through they probably had to make their way through this chamber and you gather from the surrounding and the vicinity the obsidian was probably a difficult thing to pass through for this worm and probably why it was forced to briefly make its way through this courtyard that's an interesting observation yeah that's where spurt met his end right there then that's the other one on the opposite side no the citadel's way that way yeah there's laser and target and you're going to fight fucked go ahead and roll a history check for me they generally live beneath mountain ranges and areas of heavy volcanic activity they are considered the artisan crafters and forgers of giant kin and the ordning they have-- they're evil no that's just giants they can be if it suits them well they enjoy free labor so they like to take slaves to force to do the menial tasks no they're intelligent like an average being would be from what you've heard you don't have a whole lot of knowledge necessarily you haven't heard of tales of the great crafty intelligence but nevertheless they still built this entire underground city they're both medium sized you hear this heavy smacking sound as the fire giant on your side of this courtyard is putting to bed the rest of the bees that have been harrying its kneecap okay you take a moment and focus on the dodecahedron you take your fragment of possibility all right you guys are over on this side here while you guys are working out the specifics i'm going to grab something real fast keep talking amongst yourselves yes yes correct i love it so what order are we doing this guys so you're polymorphing caduceus into what laura and i'll say for the purposes of that we'll say this is you all right the dragonfly jumps onto beau beau is now in the position to hold— okay out of the molten rock wings (growling) the manticore begins to rise both of the giants look confused towards it and then each other the one with the shields braces the shields in front the other one looking off to the side goes and reaches off to one of the boulders off to the side and grabs it as it picks it up those at the front can see the rock seems to heat up there are veins of heat on the inside as it grips it so you create the effect this is major image right yes all right they're both going to look forward towards it to see what the hell it is watching a manticore rise out of magma is insane correct correct the guy with the shields he's attempting to ascertain with his investigation as to what the fuck is going on he rolled a natural 19 minus one that's an 18 what's your spell dc yeah the one with the shields goes like-- just looks confused as it takes off the other one no i literally rolled two 19s in a row laura and i'm sorry as the manticore takes off the one holding the rock is like-- it twists the rock in the other hand and reaches over to the side and grabs a chain and starts ringing this loud bell it's echoing through the chamber they're both confused as this thing flies off and they look at each other like-- yeah they're looking at each other what's up next i can't believe i rolled-- it was such a great idea i just rolled really high who's doing what you don't know you would imagine it has larger reach than an average creature being a giant on the giant okay what's the save on that 16 wisdom you got it for that one five (laughs) all right i don't have a cow mini on me at the moment i know how fucking dare i i'll use this horse so the fire giant suddenly (swoosh) (moo) the one over here goes and looks confused at that everyone needs to roll initiative on this because you're entered official combat all righty 25 to 20 damn beau all right 20 to 15 15 to ten no one 15 to ten all right so yasha's at nine caleb at three all right beau you're up first all right (counting) as a bonus action (counting) oh right it's actually ten more and you still have your action beau goes (swoosh) and is already on the opposite side the giant with the shields goes (exasperated grunt) and goes to go for a shove and watches her vanish and goes (confused grunt) and looks back at the tunnel on the other side she completely just skids off no effect okay so you go (smacking and falling) and caduceus suddenly apparates next to you almost collapsing you from the weight of his much larger body you got it all right that finishes your go jester you're up all right (swoosh) on the other side of the tunnel all right that finishes jester's go fjord you're up there we go got me a horse nugget comes out blink dogs have a movement of 40 so that's (counting) he's going to do action to run as well (counting) and then is going to use his teleport ability which he gets to teleport 40 feet gets right there (panting teleporting) that finishes your go fjord what are you doing all right you got it all righty that ends your turn caduceus you're up (counting) you get there to cast it all right what's the dc on that constitution 26 they got a lot of constitution these fire giants sorry you do isn't that once per long rest though you did i believe that's right all righty the beetles scatter and go-- it has been yeah i was thinking of the kobolds but no it was earlier before that go for it they're attacking the shield and it's burning up the beetles because it's a flaming shield right they couldn't quite get there there's so much shield for it to get to (sizzling) you popped out and-- this is the wall here this is a tunnel for better appearance here there that's the tunnel all righty that finishes caduceus' turn it is now the fire giants' turn seeing fjord there (counting) he's going to go ahead-- he doesn't know if he's going to have enough range for it he's going to attempt his shield charge no actually it's going to instead cruise up 30 up to that point and it's going to grab a rock off the ground and chuck it straight at you fjord like a rock it's about the size of your torso it reaches off the side and it's been sitting next to the lava and it's actually orange on one side from the nearby heat picks it up-- drops the shield for a second picks it up and (swoosh) lobs it right towards you oh that's going to be 32 to hit yeah you can't tell where fjord ends and spurt begins oh fuck all right that is 34 points of bludgeoning damage i need you to make a concentration check marisha and because you are currently holding your spell no not polymorph he's holding-- like when you begin casting your thunder step it's a constitution saving throw and you have to have half of 34 that puts it at 17 the dc of 17 you have to beat to maintain concentration the boulder slams into you and for a minute your lights just go white your eyes go to complete and utter absence of image just the color white the pain streaks through you you can feel the burning scrape of when it impacted your forehead and as soon as you right yourself you look down and the spell begins to fade from your fingertips and you just barely hold on to it it's like rocketing in your hands you can see the energy and the thunderous power beginning to build in your palm that finishes that giant's turn the cow's going to move sam and oh god all right i don't have movement for a cow here yeah dude they can move hold on cow there it is large beast 30 feet the cow's going to go ahead and attempt to attack you 21 to hit what's your armor class you take eight points of piercing damage as the cow gores you with its horn i need you to make another constitution saving throw correct it's dc ten oh my god damn it yasha's turn she just barely makes it around with her 40 feet of movement to get to you the cow now blocking that space that she was going to run through no she hasn't left the cow's melee range yasha runs up to you and-- yeah you guys appear already in the tunnel across the way it does is there a save 13 fail takes 20 damage (poof) laura and the cow form is sundered as the thunder blast destroys its polymorph form and then (grunt) emerging from it the second fire giant pissed off real angry but that does carry over seven points of thunder damage to the fire giant all right that finishes yasha's turn nott you're up so you've already cast invisibility on yourself there you go your speed is now 35 because you took the halfling feat so if you're moving at full speed-- the stealth rules looking this up right here as you're invisible impossible to see-- the creature's location can be detected by any noise it makes tracks it leaves-- so still means stealth check but you have advantage on the stealth check i believe if you're moving your full speed it's disadvantage on stealth i'm trying to remember if you have disadvantage and advantage it just cancels out no matter how much you have of each so it would be just a straight roll i'll put it there that's fine so go ahead and make a stealth check it all cancels out so (counting) that's your movement as you come through quietly the giant who just appeared goes-- and looks over passive perceptions are 15 and 16 both giants look and they see footsteps and they're both like (grunts) they still don't know-- they know the general vicinity where you are anything against you still has disadvantage but it's still your turn you still have your bonus action and your attack yeah this way all right so five ten as soon as the footsteps are happening it makes an attack of opportunity in your general direction it has disadvantage on the attack so for this here-- this is with its giant maul that is a 20 to hit okay so it's a giant hammer that's large enough that sweeps through the general area and catches you in the back you take-- 28 points of bludgeoning damage okay so you use your reaction so that makes it a 14 go ahead and make a constitution saving throw dc ten to try and maintain concentration on invisibility no constitution saving throw you just barely maintain concentration that was the base dc 15 20 25 you still have ten more feet of movement there okay you're under the bridge now go for it go ahead and make a stealth check this is with advantage yes 18 okay they both saw where you went but they don't know exactly where you are that finishes your turn caleb you're up if you want to do anything okay what's the save on that gotcha natural 19 plus five i'm rolling really fucking good for these guys that is ridiculous they are that's a plus five-- there you go there there all right okay is that your turn you got it that finishes your go to the top beau anything are you staying put to what to-- okay you got it that's your action jester your turn you doing anything you're back in the tunnels so you have to move out to really get a good view all right fjord you're on deck okay where are you placing your— right there as it is an illusory duplicate it does not need to make a check it just appears to leap and land okay i will say make a deception check okay that finishes your turn jester fjord you're up all righty caduceus nope you would have to get a lot closer than you are yes you are actually further than 60 feet from nott not too bad you can move 15 feet and get pretty close you could do that yes yeah you walk out and go-- and don't see nott all right do you move back in what spell you got it okay now it's their turn the dreadnaught is going to step off there and use its shield charge against the bridge stepping forward and slamming into the stone there it is and there's a lot of people really confused out by that citadel ooh the whole bridge comes crashing down into the lava there this bridge part collapses nott i need you to make a dexterity check or saving throw please 19 you avoid some of the damage you manage to just skitter out of the way so you take half that puts you at it would be 14 down to 7 points of bludgeoning damage yeah so pushes into this area knocks the bridge over continues the movement into that point there this one here is going to go ahead and move forward you do yes you're fine and it's going to use its action try to perceive you it has no idea where you are that is total-- you rolled an 18 right still cannot see you all right yasha's turn anything yasha's staying put nott your turn okay you can do it you can you run across (burning) it's up to you are you going to try and leap across yes there is one chunk here that is splashing and hasn't sunken in yet all right go ahead and make an athletics check we'll say just to try and-- yep that's fine that's the base you needed (swish) making it across this way as you rush across though the movement catches its attention it gets an attack of opportunity on you however it's at disadvantage on the attack so that would be 17 to hit as soon as you rush up and leap in the air it sees the push off of rocks and backhands with the hammer and as it swings out you pull your legs up and it just barely (swoosh) misses from beneath your feet as you tuck them closer to your chest and land on that rock piece there so that's (counting) you can attempt one more jump athletics check nine (burning sound) so the good news is you don't (splash) into it because lava doesn't really work that way however it's a lot of fire damage yeah i'm trying to remember where that is yeah it is that's right okay pardon me here-- it's not in that book yeah it's all good thank you google it's pretty bad it's pretty bad on page 249 of the dungeon master's guide bless you all right your foot hits the edge and just skips you fall back and land and hit the lava on your back and legs the ring keeps you from sinking into it so i'm not giving you full submerged damage so you don't take the full 18d10 (shocked screaming) it is 48 points of fire damage it's not an attack you can't really dodge the fire a cure wounds which has to be up next to him you said cure wounds earlier-- i'll allow it all right i need you to make a constitution saving throw please oh you're unconscious oh okay the second nott falls you see a burst of fire and nott's unconscious body is currently in flames travis and all right so go ahead and roll that that's right because you are a grave cleric you're also on fire okay on the big one what are you polymorphing them into okay so that is a what 16 wisdom that is a 15 the large giant suddenly turns into a large octopus i will say for the purposes of not having a giant octopus thing we will just use that for now it's aquatic in nature it suddenly (wet impacts) and is now trying to pull itself forward on its new cephalopod body so that's your action caleb okay that ends your turn beau you're up so as soon as that happened you would be (counting) 35 so you move up with your action you haven't grabbed yet that was your holding your dash so you reached down and the flames are burning your hand the heat is causing the skin on your face and arms to begin to bubble from just the sheer intensity of it as you reach down and pull nott's flaming body up from the lava nott your eyes come open at that moment and you realize you're on fire but beau is holding you you're going to go ahead and-- well you still have a movement and your bonus so it was just your action to pick up-- it's half-speed to drag somebody with you so you move 20 feet (counting) and then you can move (counting) 15 to get nott into the tunnel okay that would be your next turn because that was all your actions left jester your turn you see beau suddenly rush in and drop to the ground and nott is on fire nott currently is the only one on fire but you do take five points of fire damage just from the proximity of reaching out and grabbing nott's body go for it roll for an attack that hits go ahead and roll damage 36 points of necrotic damage as your duplicate rushes forward and reaches out and grabs the knee right in front of the storming fire giant you watch as the surge of divine energy goes from a blue to a green to a black and as it pierces the knee cap and shoots up the leg the giant just howls in extreme pain and while it was currently focused and reaching down for another boulder while watching beau carry nott away it suddenly drops the rock grabs its hammer and looks down at your duplicate furious all right that finishes your turn jester is that your turn all right fjord anything nothing all right caduceus okay you use your action to put the fire out on nott you got it that brings us to their turn this one is going to-- no just up there and then dashes it's still not in range but it's curling over the ruins of the bridge your blink dog gets into your space there now at the end of polymorph it doesn't get a saving throw right i don't believe yeah that's what i thought it was okay all righty right it's just concentration that's right cool the other fire giant is going to-- it does not discern that this is an illusion and just spends its turn with two giant hammer swings towards your illusory jester just through it with no effect angrily swings again no effect definitely knows it's an illusion now but wasted its entire turn doing that that being the case it's going to go ahead and move (counting) 20 the thing sinks into the lava and its feet (sizzling sounds) into it doesn't matter it is now starting to step out of the lava has one leg up and its hammer ready and it's just steaming towards like you like an angry freight train that ends their turn moving forward yasha's up anything all right nott's turn no fjord has put the fire out 16 misses or it hits but it hits the plate armor in its chest and just ricochets off 17 actually it hits the armor and gets stuck but it didn't pierce enough to actually hurt the giant all right that finishes your go caleb your turn the entire door wall closes off with five feet of stone as soon as that happens you're like awesome all right let's go and you hear (pounding) from the back the stone is already (cracking) all right you guys go running and running you hear the impacts from behind get more and more distant as you feel like you've managed to safely make your way beyond this strange encounter from the outskirts of this unknown fire giant citadel and that's when we'll finish tonight's
