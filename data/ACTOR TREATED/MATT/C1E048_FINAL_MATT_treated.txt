i've been busy working on this shit for you guys (mock weeping) no i have to prepare cool all right now we bring it back i will ask if we could turn that speaker down a little bit a little bit more that's good great all right guys let's plug in to the world of exandria as we begin tonight's episode of critical role so last we left off the adventuring party of vox machina traversing the lands in search of lost artifacts of wars of old referred to as the vestiges of divergence in hopes of eventually tearing down and defeating a conclave of chromatic dragons called the chroma conclave that have destroyed society all across the continent of tal'dorei and beyond you returned to the outskirts of a city named westruun that was very important in your early adventures to find it from a distance partially destroyed by the dragon attack but a couple weeks before and since taken over by what seems to be the remnants now swelling in power and size of grog's old herd of wandering barbarians and various savages having taken the city by force and ruling it with an iron hand it was also deemed not the right time to face this foe and as such the party continued venturing southward in the direction of the frostweald where somewhere at the base of the stormpeak mountains the mate of osysa the gynosphinx you had met in vasselheim-- her mate resides somewhere in this vicinity that's all the information you have to go on as you head down towards the frozen forest so that's where we begin as you guys continue pushing south from westruun seeing the distant pillars of dark smoke that slowly drift into the atmosphere disappear as the town itself vanishes over the horizon you continue to push southward through the open grass fields you continue traveling for the better part of a day eventually coming up along the side of the silvercut channel which is the river that comes down and cuts through near kraghammer to the west of westruun it goes past kymal and then eventually heads down in this direction towards the foramere basin you guys travelling fairly quickly as you're in your mist forms which is making up a lot of the normal travel time you would have to worry about here by the time the sun finally begins to set across the mountains-- pay attention please sorry i've got plenty of things i could throw in here if you guys aren't paying attention no it's really funny for me as you guys continue pushing southward as the sun slowly begins to set in the distance you glance over towards the foramere basin you can see just over to the right the city of kymal which has lights glimmering in the far distance but what you see by the basin itself is this large lake that is centered in this region just north of the frostweald you can see where the two main rivers diverge before heading southward towards the ocean there's a smattering of various tents that are clustered right towards the side of the riverbank and the edge of the lake itself as you continue coasting overhead in your mist forms you see small trails of smoke from smoldering campfires clusters of people and families wandering the shore in this small group you continue going forward you don't have to you can keep going it looks like it yeah there's probably a few dozen close to maybe 50 60 you can't really tell from this distance especially as the light is beginning to slowly diminish as you coast down closer you get a better look and yeah there are about 50 60 or so people on the outside you don't have an idea of how many are inside the tents even more most likely but these tents are fairly ramshackle barely standing the people look destitute they look like they're holding onto survival here on the outside of the city you see a few boats that are going in and out on the shore probably fishermen there are a few bonfires that are now starting to kick up as the night's cold begins to swell in it looks like this is a fairly thriving a fairly functional refugee camp okay these are open grasslands there aren't a lot of trees and they're spotted around there are a few rock formations and small hills you might be able to get out of sight so you coast around there and you go back into your physical form the rest of you follow it's probably thigh-length for you close to the knee so you guys set down maybe 300 feet from the outside of the nearest part of the camp reconstitute into your physical forms at this point the sun has now disappeared over the horizon and the blues have now gone to orange to purple and you can see in the distance the darkness of night is starting to crest over the sky what do you want to do go ahead and roll an intelligence check though the magic is new to you you've spent in your first time casting it and a large part of the evening especially since you realized you weren't going to have as fun a night as you thought after the broom had been taken and vex left your room learning the intricacies of the spell itself and the pocket dimension that is created you can fit quite a few people in there however it is stationary in its entrance and exit and then once the spell comes to completion after a 24-hour period it expels anyone and anything that was brought into it on the spot where it was originally cast this is true as the night takes over it's still quite a distance to be able to make out a lot of detail you'd probably have to get closer but you're going alone twins going together why don't you both roll a stealth check no you are in the plains all right there's no-- (annoyed hmm) this is true actually it's more of a rose bush so as you guys push forward pushing and stalking through the grass you come to about 40 50 feet outside and there's a little bit of chatter it's hard to make out at this distance but the people seem to not necessarily be jovial almost like they've accepted the circumstances and are just surviving it for the time being there are a few individuals that are armed though the armor itself seems patchwork or you know not the best or most trained of individuals currently guarding this group of survivors but there are patrols going around people keeping a close look there are torches being lit now as people begin walking-- not from this distance with your darkvision you can make out the outline of the very very nearest individuals the guards in particular but at this distance nobody catches your eye that you'd be able to make out much detail on that you would recognize (chuckling) you don't know that as far as you know you're so hidden no they're just wandering just patrolling okay i'll have you both roll perception checks if you could okay you two at about the same time focus best you can you have to scoot a little bit closer once the guard that's nearest to you passes by you wait for your moment scoot up close get by one of the tents and look off to the side there are a few folks that catch your attention a little bit there's one that was elowen brist who was the mother of the first child that went missing in westruun you see her with her daughter who's a little bit older now that you guys helped save her a little dirty but alive they wander off you scan through the crowd keeping an eye out for the guard as well no one really catches your attention you see one older gentleman that walks by 60s not completely withered away but you know older but carries himself with much importance very expensive clothing reds and blues it seems like he's attempting to hold a social station even though in his current location society has crumbled he doesn't really catch your attention as anyone you recognize but the person to the left of him is a very familiar-looking elven man with long brown hair slicked over and behind his ears this is drez vina who originally contacted you when you arrived in westruun he's looking a little rough too this has not been the kindest time to any of these people (laughing) that's not him at all that's abjurist noja marisha and taliesin (in unison) oh abjurist noja he had a master here i should step in here and clarify-- (laughter) no i know drez vina came to you under the pretense that he was working for an individual called the master he called him his master who was interested in hiring your services originally sent you into the mage tower of eskil ryndarien the realmseer to steal the brass box with the pearl top however you did not steal it and instead you ended up befriending the archmage yes he let you pick something from his array of items drez then found you guys at your inn a number of weeks later and drez was very unhappy that you both didn't return with the item and used a very powerful and expensive object that was part of this endeavor and never paid it back so to pay back your debt he sent you guys to the druid barrow where you had to retrieve this cortex this magical gem that was embedded in the center of-- yep where you fought the golem and you retrieved the cortex successfully and that's the last you've seen of him elowen i'm pretty sure let me check my notes yeah elowen elowen brist go ahead and roll a performance check yes okay plus 14 okay okay so as you guys begin strolling up immediately you see torches (fire sounds) you see guards come forward two of them with nocked crossbows who goes there and they don't really recognize-- they're all looking at this source of singing crossbows-- the guards slowly drop their crossbows what's your business we've already got enough mouths to feed move along make a persuasion check while their crossbows are notched they haven't lowered them completely they're still on guard and still nervous of your approach one of them glances over at the other one one of the guards who was paying attention walks away and they all raise their crossbows again and just train them on you guys for the next few minutes one of the guards takes a moment and gives you an eye and just goes-- i remember seeing you around town you were-- oh man jeez it's good to see you sorry if i gave you any trouble back in the day i was young and stupid i mean no offense but we're very guarded with your kind at the moment at which point the guard that had left comes back with elowen she walks up with her tightly braided reddish hair with a little bit of grey on the sides that probably has come since the last time you've seen her and the experience of having her child gone so long it's taken a physical toll on her but there is a smile on her face now she looks over and focuses her eyes-- that's them that's them let them in let them in and she runs forward immediately and gives a big hug to you vex and starts moving through and you know just this big smile and surprise and you can see her little boy simon come up to the side simon who last time you saw you were retrieving him from the pocket dimension that the dread emperor had called his domain at which point there's a few quick pleasantries as she says hello again she says please please come in please it's fine they're trustworthy and the guards nod and they follow behind not in an aggressive way but just in a being-careful kind of way so you have two people two armed individuals flanking you the entire walk that you guys are doing but it's at ease hi this many--  he puts up nine fingers thank you he freezes up he's gotten a little shy at the interaction really yes (laughter) he locks up again snakes and women have the same reaction to this poor little boy he gives you a stern look and the snake just wraps around him for a second he goes (giggles) and starts laughing reaches up and rubs his ear from the tickle he has a big smile on his face now that's so cool (sighs) well we're one group many went to kymal but they're at capacity now and based on many of the farming fields that were destroyed or burned by the dragon ransacking there's only so much food to go around so they had to turn us away but there were some small farming communities along the river that were kind enough to take us in and we're we're getting by hoping to find out if anything takes care of the problems in westruun you should probably talk to cornelius i don't know the details of everything happening no no cornelius is rather-- he's not very well-dressed he-- and she scratches her head he used to be the bookbinder in westruun but when everything fell apart he rose up and took the lead in keeping everyone safe and so i mean he won't say it but we kind of look to him as a leader for now i think he did business with them but i don't think he worked directly with here let me take you she walks over and as you guys are talking to simon she scoops simon up and pulls him to her side and gives you guys a smile of acknowledgement come and leads you guys-- you guys are led through most of the folks stop what they're doing and pay attention some look wary and guarded others you see their faces brighten up as they begin to connect the dots between the whispers they've heard of vox machina throughout the landscape and the individuals walking through most everyone seems to have a somewhat visceral emotional reaction once grog passes by it does catch you you know as a person who has always stuck out against the society as it was and you've worked hard to a degree to get some respect especially in that city having so many eyes on you and you can feel the while unearned from your standpoint the heaps of hatred that are thrust upon you by how you look right now is uncomfortable eventually the guards and elowen bring you guys up to a central tent around what looks like a larger bonfire in the center where a lot of people are starting to bring their big nets of fish over and starting to divvy it out and set up small cooking arrangements so that people for the evening can have their dinner she walks up to the edge of tent speaks to one of the guards mentions you guys and your wanting to talk to cornelius the guard leans in shouts off to the side cornelius you've got some visitors is that okay a voice muffles through that's fine go ahead and let them in the guard pulls open the tent and at this point elowen says i'm going to go get my son some food if you need anything just ask around thank you guys again she rubs simon's head and walks off and as she walks off with him he keeps looking over his shoulder at you the whole time with a big smile on his face you guys walk into the tent and it smells like a tent that's been lived in for a couple weeks the interior's not fancy by any means it's blankets and burlap and whatever functions to guard against the relatively muddy shores of the river and you get a sense that most places here just because of the landscape and how close it is to the river mud is tracked everywhere so it's mostly caked ground there is a small cot on the far edge and there is a table set up and some elements of dried fish that are just being pulled from a sack on the side and there are two guards and you can see what appears to be cornelius coming to greet you as you enter a man in his mid-40's blondish hair with a scruffy unkempt beard you get the sense that he's a working man his hands look calloused he's got a layer of just dirt and grime across his brow that tells you he's definitely one who gets in the thick of it when it's needed and you can see why in this circumstance people put trust into a person that can rise up amongst all the chaos from simple means and prove themselves to want to help everybody and in the moment he smiles you immediately see also why people follow him he's got this bright toothy white smile and he puts his hand out immediately to each of you pleasure to meet you i'm cornelius so i'm told that you all are here to talk to me what's this about well counts all say that we have upwards of three dragons that came through here and tore into this city and-- they were gone for a while and we'd hoped they weren't going to return but that's when-- he kinda looks over to you grog that's when the savages came in and took what was left and i mean no offense to that i recognize you i've seen you around the town before you seem like you're not like your ilk that's okay no one really knows who i am and i want to keep it that way when all this blows over don't like all the attention we're going into our second week now i think we sent a few of our most able-bodied up north in hopes of trying to figure out if the city was safe to return to and well only a few made it back and those that did said it was a bloodbath yeah let's see he kind of takes a moment to think and does couple marks on the dirt in front of him to do a count you can see he's not a very numbers-guided person i'd say we got probably about close to 60 70 people left we used to have more then we lost the scouting parties up north and well these past four days we've had a few of these orcish fuckers been raiding the outskirts of our camp every night and taking goods people-- hah we got none we're just staying here and staying alive fish mainly i mean all the farming grounds are destroyed or they're being guarded currently and there's no space for us in kymal we can keep going east but-- we got a few older gnomes from the city i don't think we have any among us though no how do you mean i appreciate the offer and-- hah 'yet' i tell you what we greatly appreciate the offer and we're liable to take you up on that at some point in the near future but right now we have too many of our people that are unaccounted for to the south we got a couple scouting groups who're trying to find out where these orcs are where they've taken them see if we can retrieve our own before we go ahead and find a new place to live well we lost 11 in the last few nights of exchange to blade and we've lost about nine to the actual bands themselves so there's nine unaccounted for we're hoping-- do you have the means to keep them safe for that kind of travel that's a long way up to whitestone we don't have the guards to keep them up on that i don't know anything about any of that weird magic stuff but you seem like a reliable group ain't that the truth well-- into the frostweald that's where we're thinking our scouts are saying these orcs are holed up anyway at least that's where we've been sending our folk and follow them out there only one group went in after them and they never came back so-- oh we've gotten one group that came back that's how we know they're there but they were just a scouting party they got to the outskirts and came back i think they're out right now actually going to get more information sorry can't say i do but i do have some stake in this personally if you don't mind me asking we don't have much to offer you at all really other than my gratitude tell of a few friends of ours that've found their way wherever these savage creatures are stationed one of the individuals that was taken in a raid two nights ago was my brother cyrus don't know if he's still amongst the living but if you are indeed planning on taking a look at where these orcs are and bring folks back safe if you could just keep an eye out for him he's about 15 years younger than me shaggy brown hair bit of a puffy goatee he looks like a lazy man he is a lazy man but i love him if you're looking for someone who's hiding in the corner shaking in their boots it's probably him it's his defense mechanism i hope his eyes go a little colder at that moment i hope we've got plenty of folks who aren't feeling too well illness and disease unfortunately tend to go hand-in-hand with these type of nomadic lifestyles we can probably-- about seven or eight people that could use some relatively immediate attention couple survivors of the recent raids if you can indeed do this you might be saving some lives here nope it would say it next to the spell ritual okay you guys are given a relatively ramshackle tent in which you can sleep for the evening cooked fish-- that's about all they have to offer-- with a few leftover potatoes that appear to have been recently either located amongst their remaining crates you have no idea but a passable meal is presented if you'd like and a place that has cloth over your head you do recall last time you were in whitestone you left the other half of your gatestone with pike okay don't go on break for that just move your seating arrangement you haven't met them no you guys are led with keyleth as well there are two armed guards that are hobbling their way through their patrols tonight as they've been wounded in the previous orc raid that happened the couple nights beforehand there are a number of just relatively sick people couple of children whether it be having to eat whatever was around to stay alive but some of the food had spoiled in travel or just catching disease as when you have clusters of people in cold environments especially cold wet environments like this tonight it does tend to happen nothing seriously life-threatening but you know definitely worrisome possibly and you can organize whoever you'd like someone you know you could bring along okay so you tend to the children helping them feel comfortable deal with any wounds scrapes relative inconveniences and it's easy enough for you to take a moment to cure disease if need be okay yeah you manage to-- and with elowen and her son simon as well-- you see about seven or eight people that could use it so you can get a bunch of other folks through as well i'd be happy to i-- yeah about your size lightish hair-- right yes i remember i'll find her yes she begins to cover simon's ears (laughter) what all right all right so as the evening comes to completion you're taking guard for the course of the evening (bear sound) he curls up yeah warm fuzzy trinket makes for a very good bed for one it's just a fart exchange back and forth forever (laughs) that got weird did you want to do anything for the evening okay make a perception check okay all right the evening goes by without a hitch (groans) you all come to consciousness you eventually get your rest as well for the evening at this point the tent city is back to a bustling sound of folks going about their business for the day what kind of business that can be done the people that you've requested be sent over to whitestone have been gathered on the outside the western side of this small city area and some of the guards there are prepared to greet you in preparation for sending these people over no it's a plain i mean there are the occasional small tree scattered in clusters around but you're in the grasslands the forest is south of you guys i'd say probably-- no from this area it's most of a day's travel there are trees closer but the forest is that far to find a tree large enough to do this is probably going to be about two hours' walking distance all right go ahead and make a perception check 23 you find actually hiding just around the bend of a series of small hills that butt up against the southwestern side of the foramere basin there is a small cluster of trees one of which is the largest of the group that may function as a function of this that is only about a 30-minute walk from these yeah you didn't blend in too well as when you crested over a number of the families and kids that were prepared were pointing up mom she's flying people were excited to see you take off into the distance it was quite a display well done go ahead and roll a dexterity check dexterity so as vex takes a moment to do some unique tricks with her elaborate and long-running experience directing brooms across the sky she gets a bit cocky and does a look ma no hands moment however in doing so the broom sputters out from under the grasp of her legs and suddenly goes limp as it begins to fall almost as fast as you are as you both begin to plummet unfortunately you don't have any momentum to go forward and it's already coasted about 15 20 feet away from you and there's nowhere to swim all the kids are like yay cheering and all of a sudden you start falling and they go (screaming) and starts yelling i want you to go ahead and roll an acrobatics check 25 okay so you only suffer nine points of falling damage as you hit the ground and do a tumble land arms out and catch the broom smiling amongst the serious pain in your legs and back all the kids are like yay and start cheering clapping even the parents start clapping the guards start clapping like that was genuinely impressive played it off it shoots off for a second carrying the momentum of the propulsion and then it falls limp as it no longer has the immediate connection with the person but she did catch it after she tumbled all right finding the tree you guys walk and bringing the families and the children and the people that were chosen to go to whitestone keyleth you create your transport via plants spell (whoosh) the doorway opens and it barely fits onto this one half-dead willow that's cresting the side there everyone (gasps) at the very end elowen's the last one through and she's holding the letter and she looks back and says promise and leaps through right as it closes in the tree you look toward the guards that were with you guys who are just watching this whole thing with their eyes wide open yeah at this point you see two figures walking towards you at this southern forest towards you guys rather hastily okay whip's out you glance over and easy enough to see it is drez vina and this older individual both rushing up drez has his hand up excuse me i'm sorry pardon me it has been some time everyone pleasure to see you again wondrous wondrous i'm here with-- and as he gestures the old man puts his hand in front and goes would you please just let me talk for once hello i am-- and he looks over has he been giving you my-- i am master quall pleasure to meet all of you i was the collector that had hired you in previous times as drez has recently made me aware and while our track record has been spotty you seem to be rather able-bodied and whispers this morning that have come to my ears mention that you have interest in returning to westruun is that correct wondrous wondrous he looks over to drez drez goes yes well you see the master here lives within westruun and--  i'm talking i've got this my abode which is a relatively humble structure two stories bricks and dark wood southeast of the town square right by the fountain crossroads i'm sure you've seen it before since this whole endeavor has happened it has usurped a bit of progress in my experimentation and i would be remiss if i didn't request your assistance in perhaps retrieving a very important piece of my collection so i might continue this research in this desolate place various things i enjoy finding out the base elements of existence and life insight check 18 really oh quaint of what it may be a bit beyond your understanding very well i appreciate the synergies between various elements and the ability to link the essence with that of a living organic entity or the transition of such living essence into what is normally non-living matter no i don't deal with that ridiculous stuff yes yes thank you the transitioning of essences or sparking essence within what was once non-living matter i'm talking about elements i'm not talking about flesh what was that now i had previously asked you to retrieve an item in the past that was part of this research and i was nearing a breakthrough i believe however if you could find your way into this abode and retrieve for me-- it's in the basement amongst my work desk area it's a simple dark iron and cobalt circlet a band if you will if you could retrieve that for me i would make it quite worth your while and be ever-grateful and in your service as i said before i am quite the collector and while i do hate to relinquish my grasp on various parts of this collection for someone who does me a grand favor i am willing to look the other way as one might disappear it's more of an experimental piece drez at this point steps forward and goes i would appreciate if you respected the master for his research he is going to offer you a great guide sir perhaps we need to-- at which point he looks over and the master's like (cackling) about time someone called you on it yes i've heard of this title before you say you're seeking them are you where are you seeking these whereabouts are you off to don't worry see there is a woman who speaks both her mind and a mind of quite acute truth as you guys are having this conversation there's a little (crackling) flash of divine energy before you and a slight popping sound as out of the middle of the air next to you there comes jogging in a freshly winded fully armored pike at this point master quall is going through a series of notes he goes i'm very certain this gnome was not created yes it is a delight to see you as well small one well this grew very complicated yes good luck even attempting such an endeavor well let's just say that it's a device that when completed to the specialty of my own training and studies would enable me the means of personal defense to get me through these rather difficult and dangerous times as i am not getting any younger and it seems that we're having entities of great power and mischief intent on destruction continuously tearing down my very doorways-- he looks off in the direction of westruun i would feel more comfortable if i could keep myself well guarded and that is what this circlet is intended to provide yes a simple trade of my collection you bring me one of my items and i gift you one of mine as well i am more than willing to offer information for trade it is quite a grand trade indeed if that is acceptable all right then as part of the deposit what do you require of me can't say that i am i'm sorry but they don't really wander in open daylight he gives a curious look at both of you i am not a master of mythology i do not know of such entities and where they might reside or exist i apologize so you say and you're saying this sphinx may want to help you in this endeavor well what i do have-- and he turns around come with me to my tent please i may have something that can be of service to you all right you guys eventually make your way back to the small outpost at this point to the tent of drez vina and master quall master quall steps inside you hear him rummaging through some things something rolls and breaks and you hear oh damn it from the inside he comes back out and goes all right so this and he holds up this small glass bauble the inside has a spinning looks like a brass gyroscope-type interior he goes this item when clasped and concentrated on should light up any sort of nearby magical incantations or enchantments this if you are in the presence of such objects as you are seeking should be quite helpful in locating their presence it does not have an incredibly long range but it should at the very least be somewhat helpful i'm lending it to you should you wish this to be part of the trade instead of something from my collection now i have lent you something in the past and not only did it not return to me but i had to extract the funds by forcing another contract on you can i trust you to complete this endeavor deal and he hands it out thank you i appreciate that i haven't named it actually i made it for myself call it what you like should you wish certainly enjoy carrying among yourselves the hunk of quall drez crosses his arms indeed all right good luck yeah all right the information that you received was somewhere in the base of the stormcrest mountains past the frostweald stormcrest mountains as you guys take a short rest to prepare for this ashley you take some time with the gauntlets and while you're looking them over and taking your own armored gauntlets off and replacing them with these your hand goes-- it's like placing a baseball into a bucket it's so big around your arm but then as you take a moment to see the metal and reflect upon it you can feel the hum of magical energy that begins to invisibly intertwine with your forearm as the metal begins to creak almost and it shrinks down encases itself to your forearm while it doesn't match the metal of your armor the silver-gold theme that goes on along it with this weird ogreish face that's built into the plate there you feel suddenly this surge of strength begin to spill through your body and you're pretty confident that this may be useful in the near future you are technically now stronger than grog and it hurts you a little bit pike what was your strength before okay at a 19 you're now at a plus four as opposed to a plus one to all your hit and damage with your physical weapons so on your sheet where it has your attack bonus with your mace or with your morningstar and the damage add a plus three to both the attack bonus and damage it's now plus ten on foot travel it's about a day and a half mist form you'll get there by nightfall you glance back and see vax towards the back of the group noticing this conversation vax immediately turns around and walks away and dodges around one of the nearby tents actually today it's spotty clouds but blue sky it's actually pretty good weather versus a lot of the rain that you had over in vasselheim no because you're getting a little further south than the northern area of it the temperature is probably around high 70s low 80s the few horses they do have are currently quartered to wagons and look to be more beasts of burden for if they have to move to carry most of their goods with them as opposed to riding horses and those horses will survive because you didn't take them that's a good vox machina bumper sticker all right you guys make your fellowship trek southward with the sweeping camera drone shot thankfully most of these fields of varying degrees of grass height but for the most part it's pretty wide vision of where you're heading sure roll an insight check i believe you what does she see and read on your face and body language vax i can say it if you want to you can text it to her real fast if you want okay so you'll have an incoming text of information as you guys continue walking these are the observations you make of vax as you travel southward you travel for the better part of a day you get quite a bit south you do see in the distance a few times what appear to be some pack animals some larger beasts that roam the land none that are necessarily aggressive unless you encroach upon their territory and keyleth you have experience with some of these beasts so you manage to keep people at bay and traverse around what they claim as their own landscape no terrible detriment to your traveling speed you make your way to the point where the sun goes down you can stop and camp for the night or you can push through the evening what do you wish to do little periods here little tiny groves that might be spotty along your journey but for the most part it's open fields one more day one more eight-hour period of travel save versus brain swelling are you guys setting up camp so pike as scanlan creates this somewhat shimmering door of mystical energy in the middle of the air off of the path you guys have been walking in the middle of this field it's just the open grass that's blowing with this gentle night breeze a little bit of the moonlight is coming through the clouds giving enough of a visual of this change in the air space he pushes open the shimmering door and on the inside is this beautiful mansion tall foyer with marble floors pillars that raise to the ceiling with gold trim there's a giant portrait in the center of the main stairway now that has both scanlan and you on horseback over a beautiful landscape there are a number of mystical servants that are somewhat transparent and spiritual arcane energy in form that take your coats and offer food a delicious meal is presented for all of you it's mostly chicken it's a lot of chicken protein bro scanlan does lead you to your room which is right next to his and covered in yellow rose petals a beautiful interior the color scheme is marked tailored specifically to your tastes that he's been able to glean from conversations with you over the past couple years yeah if it was prepared within the house okay you guys find the all-purpose room which does have the basics required for smithing the smithing gear that is brought to you by the servants in itself is very very finely crafted and nearly weightless it's really impressive and you look at the label and it has a small timer on it before it becomes immaterial yeah anything you leave in here will just be spat out yeah onto the ground where it was work on jewelry do you have a jeweler's kit it's a whole different skill set man you can tinker something but jewelry is different from tinkering what is the function of this object you need to tell me these things i'm going to make something make me roll for it i got to know what you're doing okay it won't be pretty but you can make it functional yeah go ahead and make a tinkering check this will be a dexterity mod because it's not a very complicated piece based on what you've constructed in the past it's more about your ability to make it work 14 okay it takes you the better part of the night with a job this small there's not a whole lot you can assist with except handing him tools okay so you get the first stage of that set and ready to go you all eventually find yourselves to rest tasks completed to the extent of which you wanted to conversations finished you find yourselves at breakfast a delightful spread of breakfast chickens prepared for you all of you duck instinctively as the chicken has enough time to arc and begin to plummet down before she gets her arrow out and you see her aiming downward as it falls as she releases the arrow it manages to catch it go ahead and roll for an attack see how well it hits (arrow impact) (slightly quieter arrow impact) it pins the chicken to the wall and then it just sags the wooden shaft slowly snaps under the weight of the chicken before it hits the ground one of the servants scoops it up and sets it back on the table in front of keyleth with the broken arrow shaft sticking out as the rest of you enjoy what is the strangest of medieval times experiences you've had glancing upward to the raised ceiling of this dining room area you watch vex spiral around on her broom before scanlan roll with disadvantage so as the first chicken goes in the air she reaches and goes to aim however she catches herself the broom throws her off and she stops just in time and haphazardly focuses on just the chicken not realizing where the chicken had now fallen past releases it scanlan i want you to make a dexterity saving throw go ahead and roll damage yeah so scanlan as you're watching this chewing suddenly (impact) a big old chicken dangling at the end of the arrow you'll find out go ahead and roll for healing as vex reaches out and grasps you and manages to heal some of your wounds 1d8 plus your wisdom modifier so you heal 11 hit points sure a gout of blood sprays out pike you're just casting a cure wounds the wound closes as pike reaches out and with a small chuckle heals how many hit points how much do you heal roll 1d8 plus five i'm pretty sure that was amazing you're back to full the wounds close pike's there holding her hands on your shoulders closing the wound the other servants are holding their chickens at the ready okay as he's about to throw it up pike runs over and grabs the chicken and throws it and (boom) punches it in the air pike roll a strength check roll a d20 and add plus four to it roll a d20 add four to it 11 okay you (boom) bat it up with a pike punch we'll say for the sake of brevity on this go ahead and roll one more attack and this will count for the rest of the shots with disadvantage 16 okay you do manage to recover your sense of self-esteem as you manage to pin a couple more chickens against the walls and the table in here but each arrow is just a reminder of the one stray that began this whole breakfast excursion you guys say good-bye to your servants gather yourselves as you step out and the door closes behind you do you choose to leave the spell up or are you going to fade it as you walk along anyone that you allow into it okay you guys continue walking southward towards the frostweald about another seven to eight hours of travel along that way you begin to see the stormcrest mountains in the distance get closer and loom larger and larger and you get the feel of the stormcrest mountains especially because there is a very large storm surge that seems to rise from the ocean to the east of it that has caused a very heavy thunderstorm that's blasting through you can't see the peaks of the mountains from this distance there are clusters of trees and forest areas along but ahead of you you can see coated in a very very bright visibly white forest this is the frostweald itself with snowfall once again you've been here before and there is an essence and you don't recall the specific reason for it but there is a purpose an ancient purpose as to why this one area is perpetually sitting in the heart of winter amongst what is a relatively temperate in some places almost tropical temperature layer it is very strange and part of the mystical calling to the frostweald is that it is perpetually locked in a winter state you-- don't worry i'm working on it where are you going if you name a destination on another plane of existence a destination that moves or a destination that isn't specific such as a green dragon's lair the spell fails yes you're approaching it now no but do you have a specific location that you're familiar with that you want to go to yeah you can see them i'm trying to figure out for the spell to work you have to choose a specific location that you're already familiar with to lead you to it so what are you saying that's true i will give you the benefit to say that you can see the mountain range this is more useful if it's trying to find a place that you're very familiar with seen a picture of or you had a very specific bit of information for it for a general location or a location that you're unaware of the spell wouldn't have an effect it's a large range that's very visible so as you guys press forward to the outside of the frostweald the snow- and ice-covered treeline is a very familiar sight from your last time traveling here there are canopies of pine-like trees that interlock with windless snowfall that leave a fairly dark interior set from the frozen-over canopy slick surfaces and knee-deep snowbanks permeate this entire forest region your breath is immediately visible as you step past that threshold and the temperature drops about 40 degrees from what it was before getting steadily colder the further in you travel pressing in as the temperature drops further and further you occasionally come across a broken sunbeam that manages to penetrate aspects different places in the canopy and even stepping into those they don't lend any change in temperature or warmth the enchantment that surrounds this entire forest doesn't seem to be moved by such natural incursions everyone go ahead and roll a perception check as you guys are walking through keeping your eyes peeled vax you're so lost in thought that your eyes glaze over for a second and you forget where you are pike and vex the two of you get a little bit ahead of the rest of the group pushing through the snow you come around from a tree and you can see this is about an hour or so into your entrance to the frostweald you see a small clearing with a few patchy trees outside of the heavy canopy and what appears to be a couple of small stone ruins and a single obelisk a monolith-like pillar of stone that juts out of the snow it's about 200 feet away from you guys 250 feet from this distance no you don't see any there are no figures there is no movement there is just that stone piece that at a slight angle stands out amongst the rest of the treeline listening that's what's interesting usually forests because they're teeming with so much life there's a perpetual sound of things that live amongst the boughs and the treeline because it's so cold here it's eerily silent every footfall that hits the snow you can hear the crunch resounding and echoing through the nearby vicinity it is just a still silent atmosphere in this forest it's the clearest snow you've tasted in a long time are you moving ahead grog grog keyleth so grog keyleth pike and scanlan are all going forward looks like vex vax and percy are staying are you going with percy okay percy and vax splinter off to the left vex you go ahead and take the right and you head around this clearing while the rest of you walk into the center of it you guys approach and as you're stepping through the snowfall which right now is for you up to just past your knees like the grass was for keyleth it's just up to your waist scanlan you and pike are both (grunting) like the dogs jumping through the snow that vanish with each leap as you're having to find your way through this heavy snowfall go ahead and make an investigation check as you guys approach this obelisk what did you get pike 14 okay so as you guys approach from this vantage point it's carved definitely and the carving is very old weathered somewhat but not too heavily so it's either not very old or there's not a whole lot of weather that comes through here and by the stillness of the wind since you've entered you get the feeling that's probably more the case it's hard to gauge how old or how long it's been here but there are various carvings amongst it there is a big symbol i want to have you guys roll a religion check real fast pike 15 okay it looks familiar but you're having a hard time really getting the essence pike you recognize this this is not the largely understood or most commonly utilized symbol of ioun but it is a very ancient the basis of the religion of ioun which is the same goddess of knowledge that osysa was overseeing the temple beneath ioun i-o-u-n you actually carry a stone enchanted with the essence of ioun's knowledge it's solid solid stone and goes up about 35 feet or so you guys are about ten feet from it okay make an investigation check 18 okay you have to leap off grog and start wading through you're finding pieces of broken stone smaller chunks about that big and bits of stone dust that are scattered amongst the snow you push around because you see the ruined walls around you do find a larger piece of stone that looks like a broken statue like there must have been some sort of a statue here that had lost the hand and it's stumbled there on the ground (laughs) you hold it aloft it has a small vibration of energy as part of the crystal sliver itself but it doesn't seem to change in the environment as you're stepping closer to the obelisk you also notice there is some writing or some sort of scripture that is carved towards the base that is partially buried by the snow that has gathered at its base you find more pieces of statues arms part of a torso like somebody had knocked over a series of statues a lot of them have deep grooves in them like these statues were either carved to pieces like they were physically torn down-- it takes you a little bit of concentration because it's in a different state than liquid but you begin to focus and as you guys are watching keyleth focusing a lot of the ice begins to rapidly melt into a water form and it begins to melt away leaving the wet muddy ground around it yes around the areas where they're broken from this distance you can't unfortunately okay as the snowfall begins to melt away you guys see around the base of this obelisk it is a garden of statue-pieces some poses look aggressive some poses look surprised-- and we're going to go ahead and take a break on that note so we're going to go ahead and take a quick break here for the restroom and-- see you guys here in a few minutes hello and welcome back everyone so as the snow is melted away revealing this garden of statues in various states of-- some of them are still solid some of them are just missing pieces some of them are entirely shattered many of them crushed or torn thick heavy grooves visible on the pieces of them that have been torn asunder-- the party begins to gather their thoughts and figure out what this might be you did notice as well that there was writing or script among the bottom of the obelisk and as the snow melts away there is another large shape that is carved into it sure as you walk up to the edge of the obelisk and put your hand to it no heat being radiated it does not seem to be reacting to anything in the immediate vicinity what languages do you know sure as you walk up and begin to hold the hunk of quall towards it you see that the language-- the script that is beneath the initial symbol of ioun that scanlan had seen is elvish the rough translation is of old old old text it reads a name is earned a name is earned and beneath it there is what appears to be-- the other large carving you saw on it-- it looks like a triangle a dark recessed triangle that is just built beneath the text that tapers internally into a point it is almost like a reverse pyramid on the inside it is just an empty space that comes to a point sure make a nature check and you make perception check no 21 26 you glance up above and you do not see any basilisks what you can see this clearing itself is visible from your height but once you get above the tree-line you can see the trees are pretty thick you don't see any signs of basilisks in the vicinity you upon looking around the ground you can see-- it's very muddy now from all the snow that had melted down and you see that some of the mud is slicking into holes in the ground like four-foot-wide cavernous holes that were dug like little burrows that now have all this water and mud seeping into them it looks like which one of them (bubbling) expels a bunch of the mud and water it just comes bubbling outward at which point you see something burst out and emerge onto the ground nearby more of these holes start bursting forth all the mud and liquid that has seeped into it is now being forced outward and these creatures now covered in mud you can see long lizard-like bodies with a toothy snout multiple legs rows of them of them down the spine and its tail flickering about i would like you all to roll initiative it's hard to see with the mud across their surface but you do see hints of blue coming through you have encountered these previously-- these are referred to as the ice-scaled basilisks the ones that are more specific to this indigenous region all righty so going by initiative order here folks 25 to 20 22 20 to 15 15 to ten all right is that everybody pike oh all right due to the series of rolls here they're going last they rolled a five minus one penalty to dex so as these-- which more of them burst up right next to scanlan right there as they all burst out of the ground shaking their heads off of the mud swinging off slapping into the stone splattering across the white snow around them across some of you they snarl and hiss as you see their eyes now (click) so top of this would be you vex you actually would be on top here on the broom looking from above you remember you'll want to try not to you can choose at the start of your turn whether to avert your gaze or not you'll have disadvantage on pretty much everything as long as you're doing that there's three right here and one right there behind it's one two three four you can try to if you would like to try to let's say for the purposes of this that you coast down to the height stupid broom let's say you land down somewhere over here all righty there you are you kind of guess where it is real fast in the peripheral and kind of-- which one and what are you doing go for it okay so go ahead and roll with disadvantage for the first strike it's disadvantage for averting your gaze advantage for being your favored terrain-- i don't think you get advantage on attacks for being in favored terrain do you i think it's just on ability checks yeah so you're at disadvantage i'll double-check this so the internet doesn't scream at me 18 with disadvantage that still hits go ahead and roll damage first attack on the basilisk near scanlan 17 damage all right go ahead and roll for the second attack with disadvantage as well 17 does hit as well so roll for that one you included the blazing bowstring for the first one right 15 points of damage holding on the top of the tree which is starting to bow a little bit with your weight and you're clutching the broom under one arm and you pull back and release two arrows in succession both finding their mark you did hunter's mark damage on top of those all right good you see scanlan as you try and avert your gaze momentarily as you see the giant creature there and you recall two arrows streak past which gives you a little ptsd based on your morning so that'll complete your turn all right scanlan you're up yes are you averting your gaze or not all righty you saw them all burst out once they shook off the mud you heard her shouting and you were like oh hmm it lunges out at you with a strike that is a 22 to hit all righty as you pull away pain strikes your body as the sharp stone-crumbling teeth of the basilisk reach out and pierce your body for 12 points of piercing damage you wrestle your elbow out of the way you can feel the wound beneath your leather armor yes on him or behind him or where-- right and not yourself i figured that's probably what you want to do okay as you back up release it in that direction the beam of light streaks out from the wand hitting the snowbank right behind it and exploding already the slushy atmosphere is-- snow and fire scatter around it as they both screech out in pain dc of what 15 that's first one fails second one rolled a 15 with its minus one dex that's a 14 that's a fail and a natural one so full damage for all three of them go ahead and roll that 8d6 vax you're on deck so be ready 25 points of damage total the flames subside after the force of the explosion the obelisk itself shakes from the impact the three basilisks look notably charred whatever mud was on them is immediately dried and is now cracking on the outside of their scales you hear the hissing at their presence you want to keep moving or stay where you are okay take your d10 inspiration die pike all right so d10 inspiration die for you vax you're up okay you're far away you're off-map okay okay go for it are you averting your gaze all right so at the start of your turn on your first part of the round i want you to go ahead and make a constitution saving throw when you started your turn you were in melee constitution saving throw 16 total okay the gaze is upon you as you glance over and see the basilisk turn its head over its shoulder at you and hisses and the eyes catch you you can feel the magical effects take hold of your body for a moment you back away and quickly close your eyes and you can feel that it begin to reach over but you shake it off so you do not have disadvantage in these attacks minus five for each attack 18 hits first hits last hits yes correct 49 points of damage as you run backwards at the basilisk glaring back at you its toothy mouth opening and the breath out you shake it off throw the daggers one (impact) sticks into one eye and the other just (impact) into the other and it-- (cheering) the snow nearby is spattered with this kind of dark-purple basilisk blood you want to stay where you are all right percy you're up avert your gaze or  roll a constitution save 21 what did you roll that's great you stare it down and it kind of (snarls) orthax has left his mark on you same one that she's hunter's marked okay go for it misses unfortunately yeah third shot hits go ahead and roll damage with the hex damage as well 22 points of damage so the first shot goes wide second shot goes wide again for some reason it's moving faster than you expected at this moment missing your sights the third shot manages to find the front of its nose and (shattering) the front of its skull shatters and it kind of crumbles to the ground okay so you run this way over here because you can only get about that far with your running right there okay then you got behind there that's fine all right that ends your turn percy grog you're up all right all right there you go yes you would have a normal roll on this all right (whoosh) you rush forward (sword swinging) you thought it was there you're sure it was there you heard it hiss it's about two inches below where you swung you don't have to hit it you have to attack there's a difference yeah (laughs) ending grog's turn keyleth you're up there are two left avert your gaze or not so scanlan as you're averting your gaze you glance over as keyleth goes (poof) into this giant scorpion big tail big pincers black and red carapace it's upsetting okay go for it do it disadvantage on all attacks because you averted your gaze right but at the start of your turn before anything happens is when it happens did you avert your gaze or not before that happened at the start of your turn did you avert your gaze or not right but the effect takes place before your transformation happens so yes or no do you want to take the advantage or not all right so disadvantage on the attacks let me think here for a second the scorpion has blindsight no you're right i was thinking more in terms of it averting the magical power of the basilisk but you could still avert and blindsight would allow you to still know where it is without having the disadvantage so yes this is true i'll let you reroll those attacks just reroll all three that's on me i was thinking in wrong terms i know i know i am the worst they've already been sent i'm sure 14 does not hit unfortunately that does hit and for the tail 16 hits that was my bad 15 what's the dc yeah so it makes the save okay so roll 4d10 total so that would be eight for half of it nice that's not bad at all all right so as your first claw streaks off its armor the second one grabs hold and-- hold on a second thank you eight damage all right all right so as the first claw streaks across its armor second one manages to grab and actually pince onto it dealing some damage as you're holding it there the tail strikes inward manages to pierce the outside of the scaly basilisk hide not as effective as it could've been but still you see its body tense with the sudden pulse of poison in its system that brings us to pike what's up yeah but for guiding bolt i believe it's a spell attack roll am i correct on that or does it automatically hit i'm trying to remember which one it is you guys have so many spells guiding bolt yeah you can totally guiding bolt you'll have disadvantage on the attack roll but you can do it still all right so go ahead and roll with disadvantage on the attack it's not so much you hurting anybody you wouldn't hit anybody it's about if you miss or not okay but it's with disadvantage so you have to roll it again with that unfortunately as you're holding your eyes at bay-- you can add the inspiration dice if you want to okay so roll a d10 and add that to the attack 13 plus go ahead and roll damage on guiding bolt so 4d6 radiant damage nice all right 17 points of radiant damage and now there is a glowing hue of radiant light around it so even though you're not looking at it it's a pretty decent beacon so it gives advantage on the next attack roll against it keep that in mind do you want to move at all or do you want to stay where you are pike all right now it is their turn this one turns around and it's going to go ahead and make a bite attack against you keyleth in scorpion form that's a 17 plus six all right you take 11 plus three 14 points of piercing damage plus seven points of poison damage against you grog it hits you regardless it has advantage on you because you're averting your gaze plus you had your reckless attack last round it still only rolls a nine plus six so that's 14 15 to hit this one bites out towards you and even though it's not there because it's so bright you see it shift and you (boom) hit it in the front of its snout with the base of your sword that brings us to the top of the initiative order vex you're up you do yes okay so hunter's mark moves over yes it cancels out the disadvantage so roll your first attack against it 31 hits yeah 18 all right so the first arrow strikes into it it's still standing it's looking a little hurt but it's still standing disadvantage on the next one yeah yeah what's your total 19 with disadvantage that does hit yep 18 all right this arrow however manages to strike through the top of the head stapling the mouth shut and it falls to the ground as its eyes slowly glaze over yeah she's clutched up on top of a tree all right that brings us to scanlan are you averting your gaze or not there's two that are near you okay so scanlan you walk over to the nearby holes behind you where the one that snuck up behind you essentially came out of aim down and make sure you mark off these charges for each use of the wand you (whoosh) release the beam which gets about 15 20 feet down before it blasts i need you to make a dexterity saving throw roll 8d6 but take half damage because it's mostly guarded and this is a circumstantial at the outskirts of it you're not taking the full brunt of the fireball however you do get caught in the very edge of the backblast so you take half that so you take 15 points of fire damage and are blown about five feet backward onto the ground however the ground shudders beneath all your feet and the earth the wet damp earth (squelch) sinks inward and the tunnel collapses a few of the others (squelch) into it there's still a couple more on the opposite side that are open there's two more on this side that are open the two that were there and there both the ground from it shuddering collapsed inward and now the mud has filled the space there's these small sinkholes where they were okay you can see the text that she saw upon there the elvish script but you see it there and you see the triangle a dark recessed triangle about that big that is in the base of it it's a hole but it's carved it's not a perfect triangle it starts as a triangle and slowly as it recesses inward comes to a point towards the back (impact) vax you're up mm-hmm 21 hits hits hits these are not with sharpshooter with that your final dagger hits in the side of its rib cage and the creature slumps over on the ground letting out a horrible gurgling hiss as it slowly dies amongst the mud currently yes make a perception check you're about to look down to inspect the vicinity however the tree is starting to bow forward and you (grunt) have to catch yourself and you have no chance to even survey the territory as you take a moment the rage still in you can hear the blood pumping in your ears but you also hear the (hiss) rising hissing what sounds like a distant echo coming up from a subterranean tunnel you do you feel beneath the ground it's less of a tremorsense more being able to sense the vibrations in the air around you you can tell that there is motion coming from underneath a few more so from the stone chunks and portions of the shattered bodies that litter part of this garden a giant stone wall forms around them and builds over it sealing these holes eventually you hear a (knocking) (reptilian snarl) scraping sounds they're not budging it they're just hitting it from underneath and it's getting more frantic as time goes on one of the stone parts of the wall begins to crack from underneath you say it out into the air a moment passes a basilisk face bursts through the stone wall yeah do you want to avert your gaze or not all right i need you to make a constitution saving throw without an issue the eyes find yours and you just grin as you bring what kind of attacks do you want to do all right go for it okay and the other one both hit the first is a critical this would be over here did you roll the is that times two before you add your modifier so 24 plus the modifier 42 did you roll the additional brutal critical rolls so roll 4d6 on top of that because of your brutal critical i think it is for a grand total of yeah all right 59 points of damage you square up you strike down with the blade at an angle using the stone holding it in place like an executioner's block and the blade scrapes against the stone as you strike finding itself embedding about seven to eight inches into the throat of the basilisk as its head's protruding out immediately blood begins to pour out of its side and it's gurgling at its attempt to try and push through you wedge the blade out go for your next strike you already rolled your attack which was a 19 so roll damage on that one with the second strike you (whoosh) clean slice the head (splat) onto the stonework there the body still wedging the hole shut the neck is a clean cut and starts gouting blood out which by the way both saving throws were failed so you gain another plus two to strength all right so you can feel the impact still attempting from beneath growing more and more frantic sure and you notice that the longer it stays out there the blood itself is beginning to freeze in the general atmosphere and get slushy yeah there's plenty of carcasses of basilisks around as they're inspecting and you still feel the impacts from underneath the stone wall from the other tunnel you manage to gather we'll say two small vials of basilisk blood okay the slamming on the other side of the stone wall slowly subsides until silence comes where the one you killed is okay so you take your hand and you place it inside this empty recess in the obelisk it reaches in and the shadow of the obelisk completely takes it to the wrist nothing happens okay you take the ioun stone and place it in the hole and it has a soft light that it gives off naturally from the magical enchantment and it lights the inside of the dark recess and as you place it inside the top of the obelisk begins to glow ever-so-faintly like a little beacon the very top of the stone glows a matching color to your stone yeah i need you all to make a perception check okay you catch a little bit of this grog and you perk up as you notice and you see immediately there is a matching beacon a faint glow that appears to be streaking down the mountainside in the distance it's a little bit off-center from the direct south direction that you're facing but there is a slight marker very faintly visible on the mountain range just visible over the treetops you had it already memorized when you guys got to the edge of the forest i'm pretty sure up to you it's all good okay so what is it that you're focusing on for the spell no you're not doing it wrong you cast the spell and concentrating on the source of this beacon you feel the direction that would pull you the best way to travel towards that beacon is to travel towards that beacon as you pull the ioun stone out of it the beacon does fade yes but you have a direction right no matter where you travel in this place you will have a directional position towards that beacon are you guys leaving you're standing amongst the obelisk a long series of mud with a bunch of mostly together stone statues of people and pieces of people around make an investigation check investigation yeah 19 all right you guys both start gathering around the sides of the ruin glancing about the outside it looks like at one point it was a smaller structure probably part of the construction like this here was a satellite place of worship for ioun like a beacon as part of a journey but nothing about it catches your eyes as you're stepping over the remnants of the stone individuals on the ground you catch your eye on one of the individuals you see lying partially submerged in the snow and mud you glance down and see two arms that are out like this although the right arm from the elbow down is missing it's broken off in stone both are reaching out a young human male shortish brown hair spectacles at the end of his nose thin body and tucked-in nice buttoned shirt slacks this is tyriok the mapmaker i didn't do this he was travelling the world to take notes people you don't know eventually after you guys do a perusal of the ruins you find your way back to the party and you guys continue travelling which way towards the beacon you walk over there and you do see a number of broken body parts all turned to stone in various states of disuse and crumbling you do see a young man who's caught with his arms out one broken off at the elbow staring up glasses at the end of his nose looking both frightened and frozen in a moment of complete unaware danger sure you take one of the vials that you collected and take the basilisk blood and pour it over the statue the blood congeals and spills over crystallizing slowly as the ice cold gets to it it doesn't seem to have an effect you gather based on the last time it happened the blood needs to be applied within a short period of time after the person turns to stone do you have anything else that might help do you have that prepared you concentrate grasping the symbol of sarenrae around your neck and touch your hand out the warm glow of sarenrae's divine energy transferring into the stone form the form glows with energy and the glow subsides and fades the stone texture of his body beginning to slowly soften and the color returning to his skin and for a moment the head seems to shake and the eyes clarify and a voice begins to peek through these previously frozen vocal cords i mean no-- (screams) as all of a sudden his arm begins to spray gouts of blood (stuttering) he turns to you and sprays right across your face help help me go ahead and heal him up a bit you gather that might have been something to do before you had restored him however go ahead and heal for cure wounds roll a d8 plus five depending on what level you want to use on him a level one is 1d8 plus five level five all right go for it 5d8 plus five so how much is that 29 okay as you reach out and grasp the edge of his bleeding stump i just-- (yelps) the warmth causes the pain to fade and he calms for a second oh sorry he looks down as the wound has stopped bleeding skin is scabbed over and it looks like it's now in a place where it's no longer an open wound it is mostly healed over though he is now missing part of his arm this is a bit beyond your healing capabilities at which point he goes thank you small one i-- and he goes to reach up for his glasses and other hand he looks around at the rest of you oh hello it's been a while we haven't well i seem to have gotten myself in a bit of a predicament well i was well i had two escorts and i had been making my way through most of tal'dorei and had gotten as far as this region and that's all i remember yes very scary i tried to run and that's all i remember no just three of us i was trying to finish this portion of the map if i ah and he goes over and reaches through some of the snow and pulls up a large stone bag that is currently still attached to his broken arm um is this all right well these were my maps they are stone currently no he's standing oh boy he takes his glasses off and goes to rub them into his shirt and does it with one hand and puts them back on well what do i do he has his left hand i'm kind of ambidextrous there's shock on his face he still hasn't quite taken in all of this stuff this is very true this is a valid point i hired them as part of this endeavor they were nice fellows hold on a second he starts walking off and starts rummaging through the pieces of stone and various people picking up heads no well that's alex golly i don't i don't know where gerald is but can i come with you for now i don't want that all right whereabouts are you going i'll head for the camp i'm good i'm all right thank you though i appreciate the offer i have a lot to think about he starts walking northward basically trailing past the path where you guys walked from what's the duration on that one it's an hour of concentration i was cresting through the base of the mountain and made it most of the way down the stormcrest and was heading back through the frostweald i was kind of along the side we were trying to make our way through the central portion of the mountain pass so we could keep track of the division of topography on both top and bottom uh he looks back and thinks to himself not quite like this though but there are a number of cavern entrances that litter various portions of the base of the mountain no see i was afraid those would be too dangerous so i went into the forest anyway that would be fantastic and thank you i realize now that if you hadn't come by i probably would have been there forever there are worse things and i can retrain to write with this arm it's totally fine you know what make a charisma check yeah add your plus five charisma bonus 20 as you do that he yeah you're right you're right i'm thankful to be alive today and it's because of you guys let's travel all right so where are you going because this place was dangerous and that place is dangerous and we don't want to go that way he points and says there's a lot of them that way we came through here to avoid them and that's when this all happened i don't want to stay here i can do that i can definitely do that all right sure roll a stealth check okay based on passive perception nobody notices your exit in that moment the white snow suddenly flashes to dark and it's like you were struck blind you gasp instinctually as your vision goes dark nothing and you see come from the shadow another flash another vision it's of vasselheim another flash you look out and you can see there's one large darkened structure that you have not visited but passed by on the southeastern side of vasselheim the actual name of this and you've heard it in passing before when you were given your initial pass over of the i'm trying to find the specific name here so i don't mess it up it's in here somewhere you see this dark obsidian structure that is ridged almost like an even rib cage along each side it is ominous and it stuck out in the middle of the city because amongst the rest of the jovial atmosphere it loomed over the amaranthine oubliette but this was the central temple to the raven queen you then flash once again in a long chamber and you see veils dark veils passing by one after another after another another flash forward and you see a chamber with dark brown smooth floors you see gold trim along large pillars that reach up to a dome-type stained glass ceiling of amber colors and white and in the center of this chamber you see what appears to be a pool of still crimson liquid you see the crimson liquid shift and a form rises up out of it an arm rises up and beckons a finger your vision goes to black and you're back in the forest as you guys gather yourselves your new companion and start heading in the direction that he ushered you within the frostweald towards where supposedly these orcs have holed up and made their camp you know that the good news is you probably have the element of surprise in this but you're not entirely sure what it is you're in for when you get there that's where i'll end today's session (groaning) that's all right sidetracks make it fun i know come back to us soon physically all right guys we'll pick this up next thursday thank you for coming and watching us play around make believe on the internet 21st is our 50th episode don't miss
