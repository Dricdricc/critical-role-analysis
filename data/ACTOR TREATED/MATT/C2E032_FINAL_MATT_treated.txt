hello everyone and welcome to tonight's episode of critical role where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors sit around and play dungeons & dragons you will find out liam he who ran it earlier for his daughter congratulations on them making it through the-- the bonegrinder yeah yeah you weren't going to tell them what it was made of and then you did well how much of them lived it's barovia to be fair anyway welcome before we hop into tonight's game we have some announcements to get through first and foremost i believe if sam is ready it looks like he's stretching himself we have our fantastic sponsor for campaign two since day one our friends at d&d beyond sam yeah i will say unfortunately without satan at your back i don't think you're allowed to play dungeons & dragons anymore it's kind of a requirement yeah if the 80s taught us anything thank you sam and thank you to our friends at d&d beyond all right so a few other things to mention we put up a video on wednesday announcing one of our first upcoming series here on critical role's channel entitled handbooker helper we were discussing how excitedly the people in hamburger helper's marketing team are like why this sudden uptick in interest in our brand so if you guys want to sponsor handbooker helper let us know yeah so anyway it's going to be a short form series bite-sized video snippets introducing people who have either never played dungeons & dragons or want a bit of a refresher course on the 5th edition rules from the handbook but in very easy to understand presentory fashion yes we can't tell you how many people we've been like you wanna know how to play d&d and we show them the book and they go (breathy recoiling) so hopefully this will help alleviate for some folks that issue and get some more folks that you've been wanting to get on board with the game to play with you in your campaign a little more of a softer introduction to the game look forward to that it launches on august 29th right around the corner it's going to be our first episode so look for information on critrolecom marisha did you have anything you wanted to mention on that hell yeah but if you're confused all that information is on

production with this crazy zany bunch of people it'll be tomorrow on the critical role subreddit at 200pm pacific time they'll be on there live answering questions discussing all the chaos behind the

be having our wyrmwood giveaway the giveaway will be requiring you to come over into the critical role chat room twitchtv/criticalrole we'll keep you up to speed when all that's happening i think that's it unless we have anything else to mention this is the worst arg element of our whole show's campaign go find out with that being said let's go ahead and bring us into tonight's episode of critical role and welcome back last we left off the mighty nein having completed their journey north and their two jobs for the gentleman return with a new friend a new companion and the memory of an old you spent two weeks in zadash utilizing your downtime some to a very successful level some at a nearly terribly not successful level but managing to skirt by you've taken your time decided on a new path a new adventure ahead of you loaded up your things and currently with your cart horses and selves together you begin making your way towards the southern area of zadash and out towards the roads ahead so this is your very last chance if there's anything you need to do in the city or forever hold your peace roll a constitution check 21 you can hold it for three more days as you guys reach the southern gates to the exterior of zadash with the creaking of chains and the heavy (thudding) as the large wooden barriers slowly drift open to allow you and a few other carts outward onto the main road you glance out onto the southern hills below you in the marrow valley and you can see the faint dusting of distant snow that has begun to melt in the recent warmer days that have come the roads themselves are slick and heavy with mud from the snow and rainfall that has managed to still seep in you can hear hooves making their way through the mud as you push past the barrier now last time you were here you recall seeing large numbers of military that had gathered of the righteous brand of which there are very few left it looks like most have gone eastward and found their way towards the skirmishes you continue to hear about on the borders of xhorhas and the ashguard garrison the gates close behind you and you begin making your way now free again in the marrow valley southward towards your destination of the menagerie coast first off who is going to be guiding this first leg of the path that is three days of travel to alfield along the road who's going to be keeping an eye out all right we have caleb for that anybody helping caleb because i glossed over this last session caleb as you sit there holding the reins to the horses in front and you're focusing ahead your mind slips back into contemplative thought recalling the time you had spent focusing on the dodecahedron remembering when you had spent a bit of time over this two-week break studying and trying your best to understand the nature of its enchantment or history it's a strange device to behold for sure it both seems refined and primal you have no idea the source or the length of time that it's existed or what its true purpose is focusing onto it once again allowing your consciousness to slip gently towards wherever this object draws it in it feels like you're looking into infinite space both within and beyond this small geometric shape you take a moment to focus you can sense and see light and cloud and matter and vacuum this kind of expanse of everything and nothing between these long stretches you feel like there's an absence around you but the more time you spend the more you adjust to the space the more your vision clarifies the more the darkness is not pure darkness but a weave of millions of tiny threads all moving faintly traveling in different directions tugged by some unseen force independently you watch one thread you pick one focus and you can see it pulling along and it brightens and brightens and brightens until it reaches in that tiny little infinitesimal push a burst of light and it changes direction and you see in that space where that burst of light had happened you see seven other shadow-threads begin to emerge from that point that then fade away to nothing the thread having now curved and taken a different path a choice a decision made and a different destiny for whatever that strange thread is following and pulling back you now see the thousands tens of thousands millions of these that all wander in their own independent solitary directions some crossing some parallel some alone and you wonder what all of this means and what this has to do with the essence of this device the powers that it seems to impart and what it is that the kryn dynasty has designs for you come back in to your moment on the cart as you're rocking back and forth down the pathway hearing the hooves on the muddy-- now getting drier-- portions of the roadway you glance around at your friends and shake your head for a moment and focus once more on the road before you yeah it's gone critical okay you focus and you're familiar-- roll a third character (laughter) you who have spent a large portion of your life in various states of meditation the gravitational pull of whatever essence of this object is is something you are familiar with and comfortable letting take over and with that your consciousness slips seemingly beyond your physical form and into whatever dark space it seems to have drawn you towards in this space you begin to very quickly pick up on details similar to what caleb had taken so long to focus on independently you begin to pick up the themes and the ideas of what all these strange threads these-- no it's-- it feels in a weird way like you're-- (bird sounds) i'm just turning it down shh we're roleplaying marisha (laughter) is the best way i can describe it but it doesn't bother you it's a little cold and a little alien but it doesn't feel unnatural as you pull back you feel something comes back with you and as your consciousness refocuses there's a slight shred of milky grey energy that withdraws itself and then with a warm impact disappears into your chest caleb i'd like you to roll a perception check with advantage with caduceus's aid welcome back in 18 okay as you progress for the first couple of days heading south along the road camping without issue at the beginning of the third day when you've begun taking your camp and reassembling it making your way back to the road-- that's right yeah which is still visible but impenetrable and there has not been an issue you do wake up and notice that there maybe have been a few tracks that made their way towards your camp they appear to be hoof-based in nature but had wandered and circled around and made their way beyond your location probably just something natural in the vicinity that was curious about what this strange dome was in the space where you had made camp but you gather your things you make your way onto your cart and with the better part of the next-- the third day's travel right as the sun begins to set you can see ahead the small treeline that surrounds the now-glowing windows of the town of alfield as you begin to go closer you can see-- while there's still light in the sky you can see that there are a number of building structures that have been reframed and it looks like there was both a volunteer effort as well as a number of hired masons and volunteers that are in the process of rebuilding a lot of what had been damaged or burned down when the gnolls had originally assaulted it the last time you were here by the time you reach the actual streets making your way along the one central thoroughfare that cuts across the center of town you can see some of the folks who are finishing up their daily work as they're losing light some light up torches and continue to work and toil into the early hours of the evening others begin to close up taking their ladders down finishing for the day's work and make their way to local tavern or homestead to make food and bed down for the evening but as you pass by a few folks do notice your presence look over at the cart and recognize you and wave in your direction they wave and seem almost nervous excited but both not quite sure how to act in your presence you see one familiar halfling who had previously lost his entire inn who glances over in your direction mm-hmm he runs up and you can see there's a lot of dust and bits of wood splinters on the shoulders and edges of the sleeves as the halfling runs up and glances over and goes i wasn't expecting to see y'all return things are going along well we're doing what we can well we've gotten the basis of the bottom floor mostly restored structurally we're going to try and fill in the walls and then we'll head on to the second floor there i surmise we probably have another four months or so before we're up and operational well i can lend that to most of these fine folks who've been so gracious in helping he points to a few other people who have either left or are in the process of packaging up their tools and materials as well they kind of acknowledge and glance over i wish i could give you a room to stay in i'd do it free of charge but-- wow whoa i'll get right on it well anyway i don't want to take any more of your time i just saw you coming through and wanted to say thank you yeah they should be i haven't seen them around very recently but if you're going to find them somewhere in here they're probably-- probably at the broad barn or-- actually bryce would be-- no candleglow was the inn that he is currently-- bryce would probably be over at the salt trench yeah that's where they've been keeping their attention as of late look at you taking notes i'm so proud that's important too so heading over to the eastern side of town you start finding the edge of the forest where the street of alfield comes to an end and the furthest building towards the forest-- you've passed it before but not spent much time in its proximity-- is a dark grey stone building with a dark weathered wood frame set around it torches set exterior and it has the simple sign that says the salt trench jail there is one crownsguard who's kind of leaning against the wall it looks like they're not asleep but definitely not in full energy per se long piece of some sort of a wheat dangling out of their mouth they're chewing hey can i help you i'm going to go see if they're available i'll be right back make a nature check yeah you've heard of gnolls you've never seen one you've never encountered one but as far as your knowledge goes they're just nasty big dog people at this point the guard comes back pokes through the doorway may i ask who's asking actually that's where you coined the name all right let me go check and heads back in about a moment passes and you hear some footsteps coming and there you see coming through the doorway bryce helmet off they're still wearing their armor they look a bit overworked maybe not getting enough sleep a little bit of dark circles under the eyes but other than that healthy their blond shoulder-length hair has a soft curl to it is pulled up in the back and looks to be tied to keep out of the way as they come through the door frame a smile on their face i wasn't expecting company let alone such welcome-- it's good to see you i'm working wherever it's necessary i keep watch on here i help the starosta maintain general matters here with the crownsguard but stationed wherever it's necessary we're a bit light on manpower given the bulk of it is required now to the eastern side of the empire in theory which is why i'm not sleeping as well but it's good to see you jester both none thankfully we took them down last week but it was decided that recovering some of these gnolls that you had slaughtered and-- as garish as it was-- placing their heads as a warning on the outskirts of town prevented for a while any sort of incursions seemed to be a decent deterrent however the smell got a bit intense for the farmers and we decided to dispose of them but everything seems fine we're far enough from all that chaos to the east how's everything been with you last i saw you you were heading to zadash i apologize it took a little bit with the chaos here but i just sent a report up to the lawmaster up there orentha should know of your deeds soon i gave a brief description right what's your name bryce bryce feelid that's all right pleasure to meet you you are very tall and strange well welcome to alfield any friends of these are friends of ours of course are you passing through or you've come to stay for a bit well of course of course you need not worry about finding lodging we can have that arranged we've done that before we can do it again well i have a little bit more business to attend to and then i'll be off my shift and perhaps i'll join you for drinks just a moment if you wouldn't mind go ahead and let crute know that you've arrived at the feed & mead tavern and i'll meet you there in an hour or so it's lovely to see you all me too bryce turns around and then comes back there's one your other friend with the– right at this point they nod their head say no more we've all lost our share of loved ones this world can be a dangerous one at times i'm sorry for your loss well come i'll meet you soon and we'll have drinks in his honor then bryce makes their way back inside the building you guys are welcome to do anything else you wish to prepare for though it is starting to get into the evening hours and based on your previous experience in alfield you know this is one of those towns that primarily shuts down post-sunset this is mostly a farming town you guys make your way to the feed & mead crute recognizes you as you enter it's good to see all of you again welcome please sit down i will prepare food i suppose for many more than i was expecting good to know (crashing) all of the windows slam open loudly there's the sound of breaking glass on the far side as one of the windows is shattered from the impact wind swoops in and you watch as crute-- who's faced away making the way to the kitchen-- stops and goes (groaning) makes his way into the kitchen to finish the meal an hour or so passes a couple other folks come in some of them don't seem to recognize you or didn't interface with you directly a handful do and they come by and offer to buy a drink crute returns with some basic foods– most everything here is everything from lightly cooked vegetables or boiled vegetables to some treated and salted meats they don't have a wide variety of dishes here but it is still delicious and very classic home-on-the-road food bryce eventually comes and joins you the first time you've seen them out of their formal attire and armor bryce comes in with a light blue soft tunic over some light brown leggings and comfortable boots very relaxed and casual as they sit down at the table and take an unclaimed tankard and leans back in the chair well i think we've all earned this cheers sam travis and to friends here and not and nott the normal recovery thankfully only one and a half fields were torched in the gnoll onslaught so hasn't been a huge detriment to our farming schedule other than that it's been the righteous brand passing through there's one of them right over there one of the individuals that came up and offered to buy you drinks earlier you can see it's one of the older bearded gentlemen who looks to be a little-- you recognize him now once it's pointed out ey told you they remembered me they never forget a face the mighty nein they all do if you're not paying attention bryce continues on a bit and tells you about how there's word that the ashguard garrison has fallen i've been doing the best i can to keep my ear to the ground on things happening east it's far enough away where no one here's worried but i have friends in bladegarden and who were stationed at the rockguard which is the other garrison if one's fallen i worry for the other but i know they're sending all of their forces that way and-- you did hear about this from one of the town criers a little over a month ago when you were leaving on the gentleman's errand probably i have to look back at my notes again it's okay the time period in there-- it's somewhere in that space from what i've heard they've kept it at bay and there are intents to retake the garrison but there were well over 2000 lives lost and i don't know how much there is specifically to say about but the rumors are that the sky over that pass over the garrison itself lie as dark as midnight throughout the day even oh that makes sense if you're leaving zadash well in times of warfare– and i know we've been notified of this via the information routes to the rest of the crownsguard and the watchmasters to keep an eye– but i do believe entrance to the empire is being very carefully inspected you shouldn't have an issue leaving – it's coming back in during a time of conflict like this might take a while i can try and write you something but once again we're a bit podunk here by comparison i can't say that those at the wuyun gates are going to be more partial to what i have to say but i can try the starosta here yes but if i recall the last time you spoke wasn't on the most positive terms either some tricks you may get one shot with i'd be worried he tends-- i haven't heard any of this no keep talking please just know that i've heard nothing as they put their fingers in their ears wait till after i leave if you don't mind you know protocol exactly a little plausible deniability doesn't hurt either always but he does good work and he's spearheaded organizing many of these reconstruction efforts and maintaining a means of getting influxes of gold from rexxentrum the crown has been very good in sending money as necessary because the starosta has been so diligent in the connections he has so yes he's a prick and he's a bit of a pain in the ass on our end but i mean he's not terrible at his job so what can i say (singing) da da da da da da i have to work with him often call that the continental (laughter) bryce at this point goes well folks i think this is my cue to get some rest it's been great catching up a bit with all of you stay safe you as well cheers again if ever you find your way near this podunk side of the empire again you'll always have a place to stay in alfield heck maybe if all this business to the east is finished before long and i get some time off maybe i'll come visit you up in zadash it's been a while i haven't been there since i was a child there's too many people here that depend on me i can't i appreciate that they stand up leave a few coins on the table right okay all right they take the coins finish the drink walk over to the bar and set them on the counter anyway and then walk away good night and they walk away yeah here yeah yeah the room is already provided your delightfully pleasant evening purveyor of down pillows and blankets crute is ever eager to show you where you can leave him the fuck alone you manage to find your rooms and rest for the evening the following morning you gather your things the cart has been taken care of indeed you can all right in the morning breakfast is provided for you there are a few folks that are in here finishing their breakfast before going out in the fields going about their daily business and as you descend to your breakfast meal you watch half the room go quiet as they all watch you throughout the rest of the meal they lock eyes in a very i don't know how to act kind of a way but not in a bad way pardon some of you especially aren't used to being the person that walks into a room and being stared at but the energy is different here there's definitely more of a reverence it's kind of a nice change of pace some of the zemnian critters out there will tweet you the pronunciation yes trostenwald that's the next one on your trip it's the final town to the south all right you guys gather your things back up into the cart it's been brought around front you get your horses ready for the next leg of your journey if you want to collect feed for the horses along the way since you've been traveling for a few days if someone wants to mark off-- i'll say another gold worth of feed that you-- all right all right continuing south caleb are you maintaining your position on the cart okay all right caleb takes a break at the back as caduceus makes his way to the front of the cart grabs the reins jester you go ahead and plop alongside you eventually turn your way heading westward which you can do okay but you go ahead and ask permission of the horses you watch as caduceus comes and quietly talks to each of the horses and it seems ridiculous at first but as he finishes talking to the horse the horse nudges alongside him and gives a hoof clop on the ground with that caduceus gets up onto the cart next to jester pulls on the reins and with that you guys begin to make your exit from alfield a second time i don't know if you can just now do that or if you've always been able to do that and then ronin's your eventual payment of the contract i know exactly as you guys are exiting alfield a few more folks come out to the street to watch you leave some faces familiar a child a woman people that you recognize as individuals you had helped make their way out of the mines long ago and you see them wave and they all say goodbye a kid quietly raises a hand smiling too shy to say anything and with that you make your way past the final buildings out of alfield and back onto the road south two days' travel to trostenwald from alfield so which one of you wants to helm the first watch all right so roll with advantage on your perception check please towards the end of the first day's travel around what would be roughly 500 530 in the afternoon as you're keeping an eye out you glance over what looks to be-- and you do find a few clusters of stone and rock that break up the rolling hills and tall grass that make up a large part of the southern part of the marrow valley that you're used to you who come from a very northern borderline tundra north of the savalierwood-- yeah taiga in places you can see this very green and open field is a whole new experience to you and you're enjoying the details of it as you pass by the field mice that occasionally scurry across the road and get snatched up by a hawk and you're like yep that's how it happens as you're glancing about you can see a lot of these natural stones placed and you see one cluster of stones that doesn't look naturally placed they're leaned at an odd angle if it had been placed at or if it had been at that angle for a while it would've eventually settled as you glance over you can see three stones and one of them is about this big it's a pretty heavy stone and two longer slab stones and they're all leaned against each other to look natural but caduceus doesn't seem to feel that way it's about from where you are now as you've traveled closer it's about 80 to 100 feet to the left off the road make a strength check 11 it arcs falls maybe about ten feet short in the grass no reaction okay so as far as thaumaturgy you can't throw your voice so much as you can amplify the volume i'll say you can throw it a little bit you can't flank it per se but you can give it a little more of a force from one side i'll say yeah if you want okay it shakes a bit and you can see some bits of loose rock on top of this weird stone construct begin to vibrate fall off the side no reaction the rest of you keep looking at this pile of stones and it just looks like a pile of stones you're like really so frumpkin's heading up (meowing) frumpkin gets low to the grass-- make a perception check for frumpkin frumpkin does a little pass around the side and there doesn't appear to be anybody in or around them from what frumpkin can see sure frumpkin leaps onto the top and perches up there (meowing) it's a strange view to see yourself walking towards yourself it's like playing resident evil 1 where you have the locked camera that's technically how shakäste sees the world when you think about it it's all of existence through a series of resident evil camera angles the duchess man well he can turn a lot better you all slowly approach this strange pile of rocks settled here no it's an open field there are some trees maybe 300 400 feet off this part of the field they're small clusters four or five at a time it's mostly open rolling hills no you're days away that was east of the city you guys are heading south all together probably about four feet tall make an investigation check if you want to as you get down inside-- okay 25 as you get down to the stones there's the one larger central stone and there are the two ones laid against it there's a very small space in between there and you get inside and begin to look around the ground and you feel down and there's nothing it's mainly dirt and dry brush and dead grass that's been pushed in that centerpiece you reach up and your hand touches something it feels like a satchel or a leather sack frumpkin crawls inside and looks up and there is indeed a leather pouch roughly the size of a baseball that has been jammed up between the rocks to the point where it's being held up underneath out of sight okay as you pull the bag out from the rock it comes free as you open the bag it's fine i don't know let me have my little fun you open inside and you already hear the impact of a bunch of tiny stones and as you look inside there are gems in here it is a collection of cut jewels it's mostly emerald and ruby there's a lot of them and they're jammed up in here you get the sense immediately that this was a drop spot someone will probably be coming by to try and pick this up okay you fill the small leather sack with rocks follow your nose that's a ten minute casting time to cast as a ritual okay make a survival check nice i believe it's wisdom that's true yeah it's not charisma thankfully you feel pretty confident that you've managed to erase most any sign of any tampering or movement by human beings or adjacent entities what are you trying to do jester someone over here was trying to do something perception check beau he's focusing okay keeping an eye out it doesn't appear that there's any immediate sign of anyone approaching by the time you finish completing the ritual you do a quick pass over there are many magical auras around you but they're your friends the various objects they're wearing and equipped light up but there's nothing beyond expected you guys jog back to the cart get up inside and start making your way south along the trail again with-- if someone wants to write it down-- approximately 500 gold worth of gems rubies and emeralds because of a really high perception check on caduceus's end you make your way south along the trail you have one more day of travel before you get to trostenwald caduceus are you still leading roll one more perception check as you guys are heading southward on the second day caduceus you notice coming up over one of the hills a single horse with a single rider moving at a very quick speed heading towards your direction heading northward so caleb the two of you are at the front of the cart everyone else everyone in the bed is not visible they are held behind the illusion as the rest of you head back into the illusion you continue moseying forward on the cart and you hear the hooves getting louder and closer as they go screaming by you at the side there's that moment where time seems to slow as you see that individual their face mostly covered by a dark red or purple bit of cloth like a facemask a hood that is up but slipping back and a little bit of tousled black hair with a little bit of salt and pepper on the sides a large cloak underneath with a cloth mantle over that's also blowing behind slowly darkly dressed like a highwayman that is in the process of trying to get somewhere quickly whether it be with a delivery or trying to meet up with somebody in that moment you watch them glance out the side of their eye at the two of you in the cart and then race off not slowing not stopping i put travis in the game meta no the hood was starting to come back from the wind as the rider tried to keep it down no from the little bit of face showing around the eyes it looked like it had been fairly tanned probably from sun and a lot of travel out in the open they took one quick but very detailed glance towards the two of you and then screamed on ahead northward past the cart then you continue southward for the better part of the next day you eventually can see as you come around one bend where some of the larger hills are beginning to weave around the road as it begins to curve left and right in the distance a number of birds are starting to fly in larger flocks and encircling what now reveals itself to be the familiar sight of the ustaloch below you can see ahead of you the city of trostenwald where a lot of your crazy adventures together began it's not quite dusk you're about two hours from dusk you begin to make your way down towards the city itself it's as busy and lazy as you remember as you reach the outer streets of the township there are people coming up and down the various streets with carts and wares you can see folks that are passing through hopefully on a trade route some folks that look like they're stuck here a lot of carts that are built up on the outside that are either waiting for some sort of sign to continue travel or are still packing up before they leave for whatever their next destination may be what would you like to do if anything you guys make your way to the nestled nook you come upon the familiar tavern entering inside you can see the familiar face of yorda the older woman who runs the tavern and glances up from wiping off a table in the far corner before her eyes peer over towards you from her tousled blond hair oh hello there it's some familiar faces it's been some time welcome well do sit down drinks rounds what are you asking for trost it may be all right but you're in trost there's quite a few trostenwald brews von brandt it is all right table of von brandts milk for that one of course all right i'll be right back yorda makes her way to go fill the rest of your order you guys take a while here and rest in for a bit you see adelaine who's the other barmaid that's helping with the tavern in the process of going around and filling the few orders that she has to at this hour kluss the clerk the reedy-looking young man is in the back currently going through paperwork and trying to keep tabs on a number of ledgers and business elements the evening is yours do you wish to do anything or are you going to bed down for the evening and continue the following day adelaine adelaine makes her way to your table hello you looking for something i'm sorry i don't think i know a gustav he was working off his debt you don't know the specific circumstances of it of course sorry would you like anything else right away i'll see what we have in the back adelaine goes off and does return with milk and-- it's a little old it's starting to get some of that white powder fringe to the chocolate but it's functional a bowl is retrieved for you quite easily as yorda throws it on the table would you like something in the bowl dear milk it'll be and she goes and returns with a bowl about half-filled with milk you look down under the table at frumpkin sitting at the bowl going-- (unwilling groan) as frumpkin begrudgingly at the command of his master enjoys a bowl of milk-- it's fine frumpkin can drink milk frumpkin just has no need for it it's a placebo for the master it's like if it makes the master happy i'll drink this milk for you yeah exactly and you get the sense too that the entire time that frumpkin is drinking from this bowl frumpkin is making direct eye contact with caleb right now it's about dusk by the time you've come in the city you've come to the inn you've got food and drinks and you settled for a bit it's about dusk now yeah you guys have bought everything for nott frumpkin side-eyes you while you both drink the milk together okay so where are you guys headed it's the stockade the stockade here is where you had previously-- yep just to fuck with you all right so you guys make your way to the stockade and it takes a brief intro to the crownsguard outside before you are brought back in one of them recognizes you from your previous encounter a few months back and brings you to norda's office a familiar place you've been norda-- you can see the dwarven woman with very a tense and tired and just kind of over-it expression on her face glances up at you all all right so it's been a bit well the good news is nothing else died since you've come back that's-- --positive so when are you leaving sam and great news that's wonderful why are you in my office at this hour you want to see gustav (sighs) fine she gets up from behind the desk and goes and reaches into this cubby and pulls out a ring of keys and follow me leads you back down into the familiar stair down below to a cell where a couple of you have been held before and there you can see on the far end there is a cell and within this dark subterranean interior with the faint burning torchlight gives this ominous red-orange flicker to the normally shaded interior you see there slumped against the wall enjoying a bowl of some sort of gray mushy substance a not abused-and-filthy but a-little-rough-around-the-edges gustav not chained not shackled and there is a chair and there is a bed you can see of the jail cells here which are designed to just be abysmal this one-- some pains have been made to make it a little more comfortable roughly about two and a half months yeah best estimate even a little longer i'm sure critrolestats will let me know but in the proximity there norda comes up hey gustav you've got visitors clinks the keys against the bars and oh um sorry that's embarrassing he finishes a spoonful sets it down oh my my my i was not expecting this at all and you can see the lanky elvish gentleman his hair pushed back a bit greasy a bit of dirt on the edges of the face wearing the same nice long coat that you remember him wearing when you last saw him off looks like he's been doing some hard work probably a little thinner than even his previously thin form was but he's there he approaches the edge of the bars by what might i have the pleasure of you all coming to see me that's all right i myself have as well don't worry oh it's not preferable by any means but it certainly beats going in here against my will oh at the rate we've been going and he looks over towards norda norda's like if he keeps working as hard as he has been he's looking at another seven eight months maybe i have to go look at the books but i can go check what you going to pay him off liam laura gustav at this point leans forward and goes you are all very sweet and i greatly appreciate it but this is my debt to pay not yours laura and norda goes you two keep an eye and the two crownsguard approach and get a bit closer while norda heads back upstairs gustav still pressed against the bars his head peeking through the two sides bit of scraggly hairs falling in front of his face no but i'm completely serious this is my burden i chose it you've all done good work here and-- make an insight check 27 but sincerely i am very appreciative each and every one of you well-- i'm just musing on how we found him and how we left him a brief star burning very bright but twice as short but no when we found him outside of the forests up north he had no memory no voice no words he was basically a vegetable but over time he came back to his senses and yeah it's a shame he was a good one well that's the dangers of the world we live in i suppose this is me paying my debt i don't know who you are friend but you've stepped into a space where you have no knowledge and trust me this is my debt to pay this is my responsibility anyway i should finish my meal he goes over and grabs the bowl and quietly while looking at caduceus begins to eat his gray mush you can move out of earshot you bump into the crownsguard behind you oh excuse me at this point norda returns coming shuffling back down with a small leather-bound journal or book of some kind all right looking at this one keeping tabs on what he's able to make the reparations he's made the amounts of money he was able to have brought in from friends to help pay the debt we're still sitting at about 2100 gold pieces 2645 are you asking what are you-- a buyout he's fucking weird i'll tell you that make a persuasion check tell you what you go ahead and toss down about 1700 right now i'll kick his ass out gustav has come back to the bars and is like you all are being absurdly generous-- --and this is not necessary at all i mean it i mean it you were one of many there's at least at any given point in time 17 headaches in here so yeah that's one of them the crownsguard to the left of you goes you should listen to her those bedpans are pretty terrible make one last persuasion check this will be at a higher dc what do you say to assist her you watch as the lawmaster's eyebrow raises to the-- for the first time since you've seen norda you see a smile curl across her face she goes if that's not the weirdest thing i've seen in some time make your check with advantage 1500 and we'll call it even i know isn't it that's a thousand 300-- so you only need a hundred nott threw down a thousand the crownsguard begin gathering the money from you guys and bringing over small chests to put the large amount of coin over as this is happening gustav leans his back towards the stones at the edge and his eyes are just wide in disbelief i don't know what to say thank you what's the dc on that is it a charisma save that's a natural eight he sits there eyes wide norda takes the keys and heads over and opens it up all right punk you're a free man congratulations for some odd reason these folks decided that you were worth a lot of money to not be here so be thankful that somehow the great gods have looked down upon you and erathis decided 'you know what fuck law you're free' so the guards escort him out you guys all head to the outside you all get led outside of the stockade and norda says all right well that's been a pleasure i'm going to go ahead and go home have a drink and get some fucking sleep don't get anyone else killed she heads back inside gustav is stepping out there his hat that he just had retrieved and given back to him he puts on steadies his coat grabs the small sack of his personal belongings and turns around to the rest of you i-- (laughs) thank you this is more than i would have expected i don't know i mean the circus is scattered i would ask where yasha was-- she would be a good right-hand man-- but i don't see her around did she also-- huh menagerie coast haven't been there in a long time oh i'm fine thank you i appreciate it i should probably tie up some loose ends now that i have availability to do so thanks to you and your generosity mm-hmm make an intimidation check it can ride a line i appreciate your candor and advice tall furry man maybe i'll find an ear to bend one day until then let gustav fletching be forever your humble servant sure i've got nothing else going on come find me well then come find me i'm sure well good night he walks off on his lanky legs almost bending with each step he's such a strange gangly elf you've never quite seen an individual of his physicality yeah sure bless you it's more of a-- you have to save it but you catch it as you guys make your way back to the nestled nook inn having seen what has become of gustav and changed the trajectory of his journey as well you all ruminate on the rather large sum of money you've given for what you hope is a good cause have another drink and find your way to bed and that's where we'll take a break that was really interesting i wasn't expecting that that was a 27 insight fair enough i had to go to the wiki to find out how much money he still owed (laughter) we have tonight as part

it so so after taking the evening at-- (laughter) totally got to keep it going upkeep it's important for a monk there you go different kind of working out let's see here so yeah indeed there is natural remedies there is the lochward general what are you looking for specifically it would be tar and other-- well it's a series of chemicals tar amber resin and things that are pulled from tree sap there are other processes where you can distill that down along with some more crude clays to create this kind of adhesive if you'd like to okay so you can go ahead and do that go ahead and make a general deception check okay so you-- so negative one (laughs) it's not high stakes here not high stakes here you go ahead and meet with simon earth of the natural remedies shop you can acquire the goods you need at the cost-- specifically the materials that you're trying to make if you're trying to do something alchemical-- at the cost of what it requires you get through one round of discussions with him before you begin to notice crownsguard getting interested in your presence one of them for some reason his eye caught you strange and he noticed something odd about the illusion and your physicality and seems to be-- you and this shop don't have a very good history you say loudly as you exit the facility the crownsguard are keeping a distance but they're definitely trailing you from about 25 30 feet behind they walk a little brisker keeping pace with you okay make a stealth check 17 okay you dodging into the alleyway using what looks like one of the open window sills on the first floor and the edge railing of the rooftop of this building that's immediately there you dart up and manage to get your small goblin form up onto the roof out of the point of view you hear the crownsguard round the corner and run inside and begin looking around you see them pushing barrels over and one of them who seems to be leading this charge is like well fucking hell where the hell did she go it's probably just my brain playing tricks on me and you hear them slowly walk away they weren't fully invested in a chase they were more just mistrusting and curious so you're back with the rest of the troupe you guys have all your stuff gathered together to continue the rest of this journey if you want to do anything alchemical it will take time with the kit to do so so gathered up back onto the cart who is leading this next leg of the journey is it continuing caduceus all right so the two of you make your way to the front of the cart and get heading southward it is four days of travel to the wuyun gate to the wuyun gate it's the southern gates that mark the very edge of the southern portion of the empire so go ahead and make a perception check since beau is helping you with advantage 19 okay we'll say for the sake of brevity here the first two days of travel thanks to your tent as well and staying off the beaten path during times of rest you manage to find some good hidden areas and no issues happen at night during the restful period the second day goes by without issue you do see a small grouping of merchants making their way northward with largely what is a chain of oxen it looks like they have about 12 or so of them that are chained together and they're heading northward having made their way through the gates for some sort of a sale or trade it's a curious spectacle as they come by it's one cart and just a lot of oxen giant horns slowly making their way northward as you pass around for the third day and fourth day go ahead and make another perception check mm-hmm damn apparently which brings you to a total of 28 okay as you get to the very very southern side of this valley you begin to see as the cyrios mountains and the ashkeeper peaks begin to come and point together towards the actual wuyun gorge which is this central ravine between the two mountain ranges that heads southward and exits the marrow valley entirely as you approach you begin to see the actual wuyun gates which are these tall 50 foot high--- can't quite tell the width of it you've traveled through these before once with jester before coming into the empire you know the width of these walls is at least ten feet to 15 feet wide at its base the central gates themselves are not stone but they are two very large iron reinforced wooden doors that stand about 20 feet tall and are opened and closed by chained based wenches that rotate and open and close from each side of the interior of the wall your vision catches a troupe of about 50 or so soldiers not dressed in the same bits of armor as the crownsguard that you've seen as you've traversed most of this countryside but a different set of armor largely bright red maroons and golds looks like there are some tents and there's an encampment set on this side off to the eastern edge of the gate they are the righteous brand as you guys get closer and closer to the gates you can see six crownsguard that are painstakingly inspecting every cart and travel wagon that is making its way through the gate they are stopping one by one and going through and poking and prodding and moving things in the carts to look for any stowaways looking for hidden materials in this time of warfare it looks like there is a very thorough process and you can see the gates are open-- you guys are about 300 feet away he caught a vision of it very distantly and you guys are-- they haven't quite noticed your presence yet or if they've noticed it they haven't taken stock of it because they're focused on their task nope it is-- well the mountain range has come together into this central gorge what was previously tall grass plains with rolling hills and bits of rock has thinned out to be bits of scrub and then hard rock floor you've left the central valley and you're hitting more mountainous terrain make an arcana check you're the one who had the question you contemplate over this enchantment that they've told you about the cart you guys watch as caduceus stares out into space a bit before this trickle of blood begins to come of his nostril it's hard to-- make an arcana check yourself actually it depends on the basis of the enchantment if they're very powerful items then there are sometimes means of temporarily subduing the enchantment objects that are a little more common or the enchantments themselves are not as thorough it is a dispel and gone type scenario on this side of the road you're the only one there is one that is in the gates right now that's full inspection and you can now see from this distance that caduceus has pointed out beyond the open gates you can see a cluster of other carts there's a line trying to make their way-- their arm would essentially vanish as they put their arm through the illusion in that brief moment fjord-- --you feel this momentary release like a tether that previously had gone unseen is loosened and there in that brief bit of unexpected free-floating freedom amongst the darkness that warm gray centered energy drifts towards you your fight-or-flight kicks in momentarily but you consciously recall that your friends have been through this seems safe and with that it drifts towards you and in this weird familiar sense you've had more than one object just enter your torso as it warmly touches your chest and dissipates within the inside of your body your consciousness shifts back out of your concentration mode on the dodecahedron and you can feel that lingering warmth still around your sternum beneath your armor as you release your hands from the object all right so as you all-- walking alongside your cart towards the wuyun gates the crownsguard begin to take notice of your presence and you can see the one cart that was being inspected at the gates is given apparently the clear they load their materials back into it and begin making their way northward passing you as you head south of which sort you begin to hit a point-- and there's enough room for maybe three carts to make it through here but they're keeping it a two-lane scenario here this pincher point there is a cart now that's begun inspection and about three different crownsguard are going through and rifling and lifting things out of the way as you begin to approach the crownsguard put a hand up and guide you over with hand signals to the area to the immediate right of it around ten feet to the west of the other cart the captain approaches you can see a woman in brownish red hair a bit sun-bleached at the tips pulled up into a soft ponytail high on the head and the crownsguard armor itself looks well-kept you can see from the decorations as you've seen it before this is a captain approaches halt what is your business and where are you going very well and what are you carrying across the border please (whistles) two of the crownsguard come over towards the cart and goes but what is within these sacks and small boxes you emptied the cart but the illusion-- i've explained multiple times-- is an illusion of standard sacks and boxes make a persuasion check all right appreciate you being forthright the two other guards come forward and you watch as they place their blades into and watch them vanish and go like-- looking back at the captain and begin to poke forward and you watch as their torsos vanish beyond the veil of the illusion and pull back dualla the captain approaches and herself leans in and pulls back you are not incorrect you carry nothing on your carts this is a curious nature of an enchantment indeed and you said you're heading to nicodranas and port damali to acquire goods what are you looking to acquire make a deception check she gives you a close look not leaving direct eyeline to your pupils and hers and watches you through the entire statement and then very well move along well the inspection will be far more thorough that time all right stay safe the boundaries-- who knows what's wandering from the dark side of xhorhas there eyes on your backs go and the crownsguard pull away and the ones on the opposite end open the space for you guys to move your cart along with that you pass through the gates of the wuyun gorge make a perception check no it doesn't look like there's been any scuffle no attacks they haven't taken any tear from any sort of conflict it looks like from this end but there are more guards up along the top along the walkway above the wall previously you guys had seen two crossbowmen that were there there's now ten the righteous brand themselves while about 30 or so of them have been encamped in that one encampment the rest of about 20 or so are scattered amongst different points on the mountains around the gate and are all scouts keeping eyes out for anyone trying to circumvent the pinch point there's pretty heavy interest in keeping watch on these borders given the current conflict to the east but you pass through safely allowed by the crownsguard and within a few moments you pass into the wuyun gorge proper and a wave of acknowledgement hits most of you that for the first time you are no longer in the dwendalian empire so you pass by the six or seven carts that are in line and there's arguments and frustration some of them are currently very vehemently arguing with the crownsguard who are holding them to wait their turn you keep your heads down and continue forward there you start heading into this large mountain pass extremely steep at certain points where the mountains seem to be have been carved down or bisected by some ancient cataclysm whether it be the calamity or some great natural disaster long before that it seems to be a very unique singular cleft down in the center of these two mountains that breaks the mountain range between the cyrios and the ashkeeper who's keeping-- you're at the front of this go ahead and make a perception check for me please as you're stalking ahead riding before you can see there's bits of rock formations that have been pushed through by some sort of ancient seismic activity there are pieces of rock that are platformed over and there are outcroppings and caverns that have naturally been pushed out of the sides of this large ravine it's quiet here with the occasional echoing sound of birds squawking and cawing to each other there's a faint wind occasionally drifting through in pulses it's warm the sun is above and whereas previously you have been encountering the colder winter especially further north of the marrow valley where the snowfalls have been rather consistent the warm clothes that many of you have been wearing in that weather are beginning to capture the heat of this southern area and as the sun is now high in the sky cloudless the blue above you the beads of sweat begin to form across your back beneath your clothing caduceus you hear this faint guttural muttering of some kind what languages do you know (laughs) with that roll yes you would looking ahead-- and you guys have traveled a number of hours past the gates-- about 30 feet ahead of you behind one of these rock formations you can see the vague outline of some sort of large hulking figure leaned against it you see the outside of a humanoid shoulder and the back of a matted bit of greased hair maybe standing 15 feet tall it's about 30 feet ahead of you and to the right okay yep so it's a charisma saving throw it's a natural five with a minus one that's going to be a no the tension-- and you guys can as caduceus has pointed out this figure you can see it tense against the stone and you see it was reaching down just out of sight there was some large rocky formation that it had its arms on and it leans back a bit and shakes its head and as it pulls just beyond the outline of the rock you can see a second head right next to the first two heads on one set of shoulders they both shake away from each other then together and away and one looks to the other and just waves in your direction mostly no clothing other than a bit of tattered leather and hide and furs that are matted around the midsection and dangling almost past the knees as the cart moves past another voice also in giant comes across the way you guys hear (yelling in giant) you look over to the other side and from around another rock you see another one of them who's looking livid at the other one go ahead and make an arcan-- this would be-- technically it's a giant-- make a general intelligence check if anybody would like to make a general intelligence check on this yeah these are ettins ettins are large giant-kin two-headed beasts and they don't normally work in pairs-- you know this instinctively-- because they argue enough between their two heads to have two working together is already a very strained relationship and the other one who's yelling at the one across the way as you guys are in between you recognize it as saying what why stupid right there don't wave and the other head goes what he said i'm going to go ahead and just for the sake of this to give you some visual perspective-- it may not come to that but i want to give you a visual so you guys would be right about there all right so general positioning caduceus would be in the front with jester there or no was beau here in the front there you go that'll work there we'll say you're in the cart there haphazardly and so this is the one that came around this end they literally have two heads so this one currently under the calm emotions which you're concentrating on the other one is yelling at it (monster yelling) pointing at you and the other guy is like (confused monster yelling) okay pushing slowly forward trotting along that way this guy comes out and begins arguing loudly with the other as he comes forward too shouting at him and they're both yelling over both of you now you shut up you no hun-- you speak same and the one who you didn't cast it on is like you so dumb you two not listen ruin this you push ahead a little bit further and what's the saving throw on that one that is a natural 13 and what's the wisdom save it's a wisdom save you said yeah that's a failure so that one-- --goes from arguing and goes like well fine you won't finish this we do it ourselves and they reach over and grab this large boulder and begin to pick it up and at that point caleb finishes his incantation and they go (boulder crashing noise) drop it (monster screaming) and just start running the opposite direction as the cart begins to slowly roll forward begins charging off this way this guy just turns around and begins to like-- waves back to you and heads around that direction calm emotions is that's okay it also only lasts a minute so these guys both run off the side there-- so as you guys continue running-- kind of yeah so as you guys continue pressing forward on this path-- sam and the rocks destroy you so the horses moving forward at a-- all right so make an animal handling check because you're now going into a straight-- just go for it yep without issue you horse speaker caduceus clay give them the intent to go into a gallop and they begin picking up loudly and you hear the kind of soft neighing as they begin galloping forward the cart taking up speed at which point you hear a voice behind go hey wait a minute and you see as the one with calm emotions begins charging forward is it a saving throw on fear every turn it's concentration-- right so it fails the first one succeeds on the second one so it'll be three rounds in it gains it back which is just about the time it would take for the calm emotions to fade at this point so at this point as you guys are running forward at a double-speed here moving forward horse speed-- pulling the cart though it's only going to be about half of that actual horse speed here okay so beau's now charging alongside there the rest of you are pushing forward kind of going in that realm at which point this ettin comes charging around the corner there no longer affected by the calm emotions and you can see the other one is rushing up behind going you stupid we're supposed to work together and the one to the left goes like i told you we shouldn't work with more than one and he's right off to the side here beginning to give so i need everyone to roll initiative now (groaning) oh wow and (sharp inhale) they're rolling good initiative on their end all righty so 25 to 20 20 to 15 taliesin & all righty and then we have-- all right 15 to ten oh no sorry jester all right so nott you're up first they're now like (heavy footfalls) running they have a battleaxe in one hand that's half made out of stone with a giant piece of splintered tree wood that's been wrapped around it with rope in the other hand they have this giant club from another piece of what looked like a dried and dead tree that still has bits of root and chunks of rock jammed in the side of it and they both (heavy footfalls) charging towards you one head's looking at you and the other's just looking up at the air at a bird that flies overhead it looks a little spooked (scared grunt) so what are you doing the closest one to you because you're technically in the back of the cart right here-- yeah he'd be about 35 feet from you as far as you know yeah they don't know you're in the cart fjord's in there as well you are so it doesn't know you're there so you have advantage so it's just a single roll ten misses it goes wide out of the side and the head that was watching the bird goes (growling) and peers closer to the cart with an untrusting eye its chin tilted to the side this is a terrible look now you see these very bulbous faces that are a combination of muscle and fat pushing into the eye sockets they have these tiny beady giant eyes you see these round-ish pushed-in pug noses and this large gaping jaw ogre-like with two big tusks that protrude from underneath long scraggly dark beards that pour down the sides of their face and over the front of their chest mingling with matted bits of chest hair over this tanned and sun-weathered flesh uncovered made of sheer muscle and anger you can see each head has its own series of scars and weird personality and as they're running they're still arguing with each other as they're in the process of getting to you we need to go from the side no direct attack on this end the other one goes like budak don't be stupid the other head's like but budak's our friend shut up that the end of your turn nott 17 that hits the guy over here yes yeah he still hasn't quite seen you it shot out there but he's not quite sure what's going on they're not very intelligent creatures you get the idea 25 points of damage nice as they're running the bolt lets loose and goes right into the lower jaw of the one on the left the one that was being referred to as bodak budak as it hits goes (gargling) and starts reaching up with the hand that's holding the club to try and pull the bolt out while the other head goes come on put your weight into it and just keeps charging forward that end your turn nott all right beau you're up the horses move at initiative count 20 just for ease of maintaining it which is right after caleb and caduceus i believe right what did you roll for initiative 17 so it's right above you it's before you guys so it's before caleb sorry so after your turn the horses will move beau what do you do possibly your movement's 45 feet yeah you can definitely get to this guy the cart's moving regardless what are you doing right here oh there patient defense or dodge action no it's holding your action holding would be doing that and bonus action-- you can do that all right bonus action patient defense okay so you're readying an attack for when one of them gets close enough to hit you got it all right that ends beau's turn the horses now move all righty that brings us to caleb yeah it does has its own narrative with the death of the minis all righty oh snap where's the mini i painted it but i'm trying to remember with the move where it got put i know i'm so angry it's been a couple hours oh yeah from the jewels yeah it's been a few days from that fuck this would be the time to unveil it but nevertheless here we are with the chaos of the past few weeks of moving next time there's big beau taking up all that space all right and for the remainder of your movement caleb you can get up against the cart but not into it that ends your go caduceus oh that's your channel divinity yes what's the range on it yeah you'd have to get closer okay against which one all right left one over here you mean all right that is a natural 19 wisdom save dex save oh that's a 18 still makes it though so no effect unfortunately it sees it coming and ducks out of the way and the burst of divine energy explodes in the middle of the air to no effect that's your action okay it's now their turn the two ettins rolled a 15 and a 14 initiative this one here is going to go ahead and just run past it's going to go over on this end that's (counting) 40 and then dash (counting) so much better i love it now that's swoleregard right there i worked so hard to paint it and then it never came up and the moment it did i was so sad thank you max travis and this guy is going to go ahead and just go back and forth on this that one over there makes no action but it's coming right up to the cart and it has both of its weapons out all right yes you can you get two attacks ten does not hit ducks out of the way what was that okay so now you do actually make impact and your fist hits the stomach and it hits what feels like solid stone with a layer of blubber as you watch it kind of ripple around the tummy one head goes (snarling) and the other goes (chuckling) and they both focus on you and then both heads go hmm and look momentarily insecure before they go no we don't and they're going to take two strikes at you with disadvantage because of your patient defense that is a 15 to hit which does not hit your ac the other strike does not hit that's a 14 to hit so you just deflect them out of the way stop moving lady bigger lady is what you hear while you hear (gibberish) that ends their go fjord you're up it's like right above you you look up on it-- it doesn't see you it hasn't focused on anyone in the cart yeah and it's looking right down at caleb one head's looking at caleb and the other one's looking at caduceus and both weapons are raising up one for each of them what are you doing 13 hits they're big they don't have a lot of armor both hit go ahead and roll damage 13 total yes you may so as you reach out (slashing sound) the blade emerging out of the weird illusion and you can see him look confused leans forward and the head peaks past the point of illusion to see all of you in the cart (yelling) sure that ends your turn fjord jester you're up all righty where are you putting it there's another critter-made gift here it's another of the floating lollipop go ahead and make an attack with it that hits go ahead and roll your damage on that five points of damage with the spiritual weapon (smacks) on the back of the shoulders and you still have your action to do a cantrip that's two spells in the same round you can do a cantrip okay that's a-- what save wisdom that is a nine he does not succeed so go ahead and roll damage on that 18 points of damage so after getting slammed in the back of the head on the left side-- they both (groan) and you watch as dark brackish blood pour out of the ears of each head as they rear back from the impact that end your turn so jester leaves the cart and then join the horses there (counting) so you're now-- you might want to be there so you're not going to be trampled by them i know that ends your turn back up to the top of the round nott you're up beau you're on deck no he just looked in and saw you even though you're hidden in the illusion it's aware of your presence and your basic location fjord is engaged technically so are you if you manage to hit you don't suffer ranged in melee yeah that hits that hits 21 to hit or 21 damage yeah that does it all right cool as it's pulled back the impact of the bells it's almost reaching up instinctually though it's holding weapons it can't really plug its ears so it kind of uninstinctually bashes into each head a little with its own fist and as it pulls back you see that one little exposed bit of the throat on the one on the right and you release it and it (gasps) that horrible sucking sound as it's jammed into its trachea it's (gasping for air) and the other head's like (gibberish) which you hear as stop complaining so that's your action that ends your turn beau you're up caleb you're on deck go for it roll first attack 17 hits all righty eight points of damage and it's a constitution saving throw that is an eight he does not succeed he is stunned you can grab one head and then with the other head grab the other and pull them down like slapping two heads together in the three stooges thing but into your knee they both (groaning) and one of them like drops the club on one side and its hand reaches up to try and grab the face and it's just all sorts of discombobulated so continue your round you have advantage on your attacks now don't forget to roll your extra d4 for damage because you're big nine better than eight all right okay yes so you're using an action to try and shove natural two natural two even then he's stunned so he would have-- it doesn't say anything about athletics or trying to escape it yeah it doesn't matter he's down so you trip the legs out from under him with like a low sweep and a shove (crash) onto the ground weapons clattering to the middle of the ravine to each side of it (counting) 45 you get right there go for it travis and so glad we got to use big beau yeah that'll hit there you go so as you rush up the first one slams against the jaw of the left head like slow-mo jaw spinning the other one you go to strike the other head and this one the actual hand that's holding the battleaxe drops the battleaxe to catch your large fist in its hand and lean over so one head is pulled back and another head peeks around the other head goin-- there's nothing that says you can't you would have to spend more ki points to try though okay you can but you weren't aware of it so we can try that is a 19 that's a natural 16 plus three it has a pretty good constitution modifier so it does resist the stunning strike but good try that ends beau's go caleb you're up and then caduceus this way over here all right it is not stunned it does get a reaction so as you're pulling back it swings high with its club as it's currently dropped the battleaxe that's going to be a natural 15 plus eight that is a 23 to hit all right 19 points of piercing damage as this club swings over with its jagged rocks and bits of stone and root no he's swung back and-- you do yes yeah monks with sentinel they're nasty nine points of damage nice with this one you crack again the hit slams into caleb's back sending him flying and shoulder-rolling sliding onto the ground and barely getting back up knocked a bit for a loop from the impact you don't notice that as you see the swing hit caleb instinctually you slam your elbow right into the ribcage you hear multiple cracks as you get a good solid six or seven inches into the torso with your elbow as you shatter parts of the ribcage there (groaning) this guy's looking pretty rough no it's at disadvantage because he's prone ten misses that hits two hit go ahead and roll 4d6 14 points of fire damage as one of them fires off to the side and hits a stone (crackling) sending bits of rock and dust off to the side the two other ones slam into the sides of the ettin who's currently trying to find its way up but it has no ability to move its muscles its body still tense from the stunning strike which actually would have given him advantage on the attack because he's stunned yeah i forgot that so roll one more roll for the first one first one still misses there you go as the flames burn and begin to ignite elements or at least singe bits of the furs and leathers that wrap around its midsection it's still desperately trying to get back to its feet that ends your go caduceus you're up caduceus from the back of the cart riding it slams his staff into the top of the cart and beetles begin to swarm out of the staff-- they've been living on the inside-- and then (fluttering buzzing) scooting over and begin swarming and biting and attacking the side of the ettin as it's currently being consumed by the shadow and everything around it go ahead and roll an attack for the-- should be in the staff that's unfortunate here i'll find it swarm of beetles go ahead and roll a bite attack it's a d20 plus three ten total that misses the beetles are climbing up the side of its body but they're unable to penetrate the thick giantkin skin it doesn't seem to mind so much as they haven't been able to get into any sort of sensitive tissue but you can see this dark cluster as the beetles are beginning to form up the right side of its body oh all righty so the three creatures in range 30 feet yeah it's only going to hit the one guy charisma saving throw natural 19 minus one i know i'm sorry it succeeds you did oh you avoided this this ambush could have been a lot more harrowing they were going to do some actual carnage that ends your turn caduceus now it's their-- oh actually and the horses are trying to push forward all right this guy is no longer stunned oh no-- he's stunned until the end of your turn i remember that so he's still stunned he can't do anything no he's just on the ground stunned prone and like (groans) the other guy is going to go ahead and move-- no they do not he's going to move forward so you're going to use a ki point to buy an extra reaction make an attack that's one of the abilities of the class yeah 16 hits go ahead and roll damage he doesn't get to move past the melee range he gets caught there from the sentinel feat sentinel and this class in particular is a really good synergy do you want to make a monk tank nine damage how do you want to do this (cheering) onto the ground both faces (crashing) into the stone and rock below you that's it (laughter) he hits and he stops moving and you're like why is-- like how bad was it you kick the body over a little bit with your large beau form pull it back and there is a cluster of sharpened stones in the ground that both faces fell onto and pierced into the skull there's a trail of crimson coming out of the gap end of beau's turn that guy's no longer stunned all right that brings us to fjord well no beau's reaction that was the ettin's turn one of them got unstunned and the-- i'm sorry it wasn't beau's turn so it's still stunned actually that's right all right go for it that's just a straight roll 22 hits 12 just hits 16 points of damage it's like (groans) and the other face is like (speaks giant) which you recognize as being suck it up (laughter) fjord's staying inside jester you're up that's as close as it gets it hit one guy though yes you are (laughs) all right go ahead and roll-- it's a straight attack roll thanks to him being stunned and prone so they cancel out the advantage and disadvantage that's okay all right roll some damage that was five yeah 24 points of damage nice jester pulls back clutching the symbol of the traveler around her neck-- on your waist sorry you pull it up from the waist and (gentle high-pitched explosion) release the guiding bolt as it shoots out as a singular beam you watch as it swells with energy and intensity and slams into him it actually pushes him back five feet (yelling) and any movement all right hop back up on the cart top of the round nott you're up he's big enough to still be in the battlefield there's not a corpse to hide into but there's a wound that you can-- okay gotcha that ends nott's turn beau you're up roll a stealth check got it beau your turn caleb you're up next with caduceus on deck what's the range on that yeah is that the minimum range what's the full range it's not a very long range on them it's 20/60 so 60-foot long range with disadvantage it's stunned which is advantage and it's prone so it's disadvantage but guiding bolt so it's advantage so it's just a regular roll okay (thuds) caleb you're up oh shit it's the first fireball of the campaign oh that was the end of beau's turn you're right yeah that consumes him he has disadvantage no prone doesn't give any changes to dexterity that's a natural five minus one for his dex save so 8d6 fire damage to him caleb sends out this tiny bead of red energy quietly streaks over and then (explosion) detonates this loud explosion that rocks the center of the ravine it echoes out through the mountainous area (explosion echoing) as the flames die down you can see the ettin on the ground (groaning) its outside is now charred and burnt it looks very hurt you did i believe you did that ends caleb's go caduceus you're up him no you are not you are more than that away no he won't even at his full 30-foot movement he'll be just beyond the 60-foot range okay they slow down they do they begin to consume the eyes and the ears and whatever immediately soft available flesh is there the beetles begin to dine on it that ends your turn it is now the ettin's turn the ettin (grunts) okay so you've moved over to this position there where jester is at this little stone the ettin gets up and sees the beetles eating his ally one head goes (laughing) the other goes (growling) let's see nope they go (grunting) pick up one weapon pick up the other and just bolt away just book it out of here self-preservation has kicked in it just starts running away that is an 11 minus one does not make its next dexterity save it's running up the mountains and like (grunting) looking over its shoulder like mmm (laughing) how do you want to do this you watch as it laughs and laughs and in the distance (boom) and pieces go (whoosh) (laughter) ten so as you're all like that was incredible you look back and caleb's still standing there hands extended yeah you're still concentrating on the spell unless you choose otherwise actually hold on does stun break concentration i imagine it would yeah so beau you go pick up caleb as you do your form shrinks down but he's a wispy fellow you (whump) over your shoulder fireman's carry you could probably still curl nott while holding caleb you're pretty strong all right you walk over and cast decompose the beetles have made rather quick work of all of the eyes and elements of softer flesh and as you cast decompose the body softens a bit and the gaps in the back where the rigid structure had left air between itself and the ground come to close as the body sloughs a bit off of its tightened structure you watch quickly as where it normally was very rocky terrain bits of green begin to emerge vines seem to slowly wrap up over parts of its dead form and within bits of the wounds that you guys had left in it from your various hacks and attacks against its body you see bits of reddish fungus begin to pop out and fill the various wounds nothing too intense it begins the process make an investigation check 24 you loot through his body you find eight gold pieces 34 silver pieces and half of an eaten goat that was dangling from the back of its belt well it's great when it's fresh you can smell the week of ripening that this half-goat has been through the beetles eventually recoil back into the staff so you guys gather yourselves back up into the cart keeping a very close eye on the rest of the walls of this gorge as you continue your journey you push beyond this brief encounter so it's about four and a half days of travel to nicodranas from here you're traveling a long way man it took about a minute you guys rush up and hop into the cart continuing your journey for this next day or so caduceus make a perception check for me please with advantage with jester's aid yes all righty keeping an eye out you peruse the interior of the gorge for the remainder of its length eventually the mountain gives way towards the end of your day's journey you don't notice anything waiting in the wings on par with what you had seen before there are some mountain wolves that wander down in a pack that notice your presence but don't seem to bother they tend to avoid the main road at this point eventually you make your way past the dry rocky plains just as the sun begins to set you can see to the left of you the ashkeeper peaks that continue to curl off to the horizon the hills growing taller and more scattered across the plain in front of you to where you can't see beyond the first set but the landscape seems to be dipping a bit beyond that so each hill itself marks the horizon ahead of you for however long you have to travel first night rest as you were keeping watch no major issue as the morning comes to you all begin to wake up to the sound of approaching hoofprints easy enough as you guys come to and wake up off the side of the main path you glance over to the right and you can see from the sound of hoof prints two carts 30 or 40 feet off the side heading up the road at the front you see a-- i wouldn't say cloaked but hooded man with a head wrap that falls into a scarf over one shoulder a long gray-and-gold set of comfortable travel robes sat at the front who's looking over in your direction in the back of the cart you see numerous sizes of metallic cages of some kind make a perception check 19 no people you do see a number of creatures little animals at this distance you can see a number of small feathered winged creatures on perches on the inside of one cage you can see on the back cart-- just from this distance you can't make out too much from this but you can see two small furred creatures that are both circling each other in the cage in the back he's moving just glancing over and noticing this weird green dome off to the side do you emerge from the dome good morning yes they are very nice they are very young and they are ripe for finding someone who would wish to give them the attention and training they deserve no but you may look to purchase if you're interested you all begin to walk over as you all begin to approach he's like whoa pulls on the reins and the horses come to a stop you look and it's one man this gentleman as you approach he's heavier-set with very tan sun-weathered skin the folds of his neck just barely peering past the wrap over his neck but he seems relatively positive and jolly when you approach he's got this smile and his eyes are very welcoming there are two other figures that are walking alongside the cart that appear to be keepers that are just keeping an eye on the creatures you can see there are a number of small bags and things that contain food and general means of keeping these animals and as you approach and look these animals are kept in fairly good conditions they're not-- they don't look abused or anything they're just being brought he as they're stopping the horses steps off pulls back the wrap from his head and it's a smooth bald head with a little bit of stubble coming in around the sides you can see he's mostly gone bald on the top he smiles well it is a pleasure to make your acquaintance i am kestiff drudy i am a handler of creatures of fantastical possible talent and we travel along these routes to find homes for these majestic creatures if you are looking to purchase we can give you a quick view of our wares kestiff drudy oh well i had previously been traveling from port damali and making our way from port town to port town we had just left from nicodranas and are making our way upwards hopefully to rexxentrum with the various creatures we have why would they block it i heard about that but do they not want commerce we are carrying nothing illegal we have been very particular to make sure the creatures we bring across are within the legalities of the empire should not be a problem but appreciate the warning well and giving a display the two other helpers begin opening one cage in the far back and you can see the two creatures they pull on the side as they walk over with two very young tiger cubs marisha laura and orange and white with black stripes across their back these are twin cubs the last of their litter to be given birth to naught but about six weeks before if you would like to make a home for either of these they are 70 gold apiece or if you want to buy them as a pair merely 120 gold but of course here takes one cub and hands it to you and they look like they had woken up not long before and they're like (tiny growling) big paws that are kind of oversized for their physicality hands the other one over to you and as he hands the other one over this one is kind of climbing up your shoulder gets a little rambunctious and is across the back and shoulder area they look very happy with you i'm not going to lie we have jamyela who is in need of a home and some care and he points over to another cage and you can see an older baboon you can see the orangish-red fur fading to gray it looks older you can see the drooping skin it has one arm up holding onto a branch in the cage and looks over and it's like-- (raspberry) (laughter) 45 gold for her we have and he turns-- and you can see two of the helpers have gone into one of the larger cages and pulled out these leather cords they keep wrapped around a finger with these little loops that are affixed to the legs of these three smaller kind of parrot-like birds this is a blue dollop and sets it over onto the edge there on the horn this is a purple-feathered joppie and hands it over to you this is a yellow-white kurat and the third bird is placed over onto your other hand these run about 20-- no these are 15 gold pieces apiece for these birds he takes the cubs from you and puts them back in the cage we also have-- and points over to an owl-- you see an owl a large owl in one of the far back cages that is kind of like curled up you can see in the daylight it's now hitting the end of its conscious cycle the head (ratchets) and just stays in the cage the owl is 20 gold pieces you hear this (sharp call) from the back cage and you can see this vibrant green peacock that is in one of the further back carts thank you you see it kind of sitting in the cage-- yeah they're dicks it's sitting there in the cage the peacock will run you 40 gold pieces to purchase we have in that cage over there-- and you see this long branch twisted up the side eh he's not awa-- come on show yourself he takes a little stick out of the side and pokes the log you see (scramble) up on the log this tiny crimson-colored weasel this long weasel-creature this is a crimson weasel this is 20 gold pieces for the crimson weasel-- they go ahead and take the bird off of your horn and begin to retrieve the other birds off of beau and take them back to the cage he goes over and opens the owl cage gets a heavy leather glove on-- gets a heavy leather glove on and then reaches in to get the owl and it takes about three or four minutes to eventually nudge it to get onto the arm and the owl is just fucking not having any of it and is like (growl) no there is a reason we keep them in separate cages yes that is up to you i cannot guarantee success in this endeavor but you are welcome to try being a natural predator of the crimson weasel i would not recommend it but it is your purchase brings the weasel over there is a leather leash on the weasel hands it over to you the weasel climbs up your arm immediately it hits you the smell is not pleasant but not terrible either it's definitely-- definitely a smell of of creature is the best way i can describe it yeah it's almost citrusy but like fermented citrus similar to a ferret smell kind of it makes its way up the arm and curls up and nestles into you it's pretty soft we have one more this er this is a trained creature because we have to train them initially or we cannot keep it with us he turns around and pulls out the side a tiny little puppy it's like a soft kind of brown puppy with a bit of full-- he goes this one is 100 gold pieces well it is trained to stay within its cage because when it gets excited-- and he pulls it over towards you and the tail kind of wags and then it (poof) vanishes from his hand and then (poof) appears on the ground next to you-- appears on the ground next to you and is like arf arf arf and kind of curls up and starts nibbling on your boot it is 100 gold pieces no the dog is too-- the dog will get larger i will warn you it gets to-- probably not unless it-- the crimson weasel is 20 gold pieces the blink puppy is 100 gold pieces that's a very good question you know exactly why because it's funny (laughter) yeah make a nature check 12 looking over all of them all the animals are well-kept yeah oh you asked them we are very particular to make sure the creatures are well-kept and comfortable well-fed and are of the utmost quality of presentation these are not— oh you were talking to the animals i'm sorry the best that you can make out from them they— no they're enjoying the fresh air and the attention mostly the owl doesn't want to fucking deal with any of you yeah no he didn't give you the glove yeah well you have your bracers make an animal handling check that's cocked yeah roll again 16 you go to pet it and as your hand gets close it rears back and opens its beak a bit and you pet it and the eyes squint very tightly and then eventually it's-- the feathers furl up a little bit and it tends to poof it seems like it's enjoying it begrudgingly like it's really trying not to but it's like oh this does feel good if you are not interested please let us know we do have travel to get— weasel owl all right 20 gold pieces from each of you all right that is 140 gold total that's 70 gold each 60 gold each no wait hold on (counting) so it's 140 so it is 70 gold each yeah yeah i did all right so jester has a crimson weasel whatever you want to call him he'd be more akin visually to a great horned owl except for because it comes from a more temperate region here on the menagerie coast the feathers are more lithe the body is less large and it's more elongated and thin and the tail feathers are a little longer and the beak itself has a very very sharp-- like more than usual sharp you watch as he pulls up and goes (inhales) all right so that's 140 gold away and i'm going to warn you-- --this puppy is rambunctious and-- as he's making the transaction he's not going to tell you after the fact like a tool you must be diligent and begin to train it to know who is home or else you lose it so begin training it now nugget the blink dog all right so mark that somewhere you have your crimson weasel you have your owl there is no rush thank you very much for your commerce if there is no other purchases we will continue our journey northward all right you as well tall friend all right put it up everyone gets back into the carts puts the rest of the creatures away the carts roll to a stop and (whistles) one of the hands comes over and this younger woman the one who's been helping with the birds comes over with two small satchels one hands it to you and it is filled with about ten dried-out rat corpses the other one is filled with what looks to be bits of dried jerky and dried fruit for the dog and/or the weasel based on what you want to do the cart continues northward and is out of your periphery make an animal handling check on the blink dog 12 okay it blinks out of your hand and you feel this weight up in your horns you look over and see it's slipping off of her horn trying to hold on as its hind legs are kicking up trying to get leverage (dog barks) all right as you guys— yep yep (laughter) nothing in the valley coming to your attention all right so as you guys gather your supplies and continue southward along the road for the sake of brevity we'll say for the next few days you travel relatively uneventful passing the odd traveler and/or messenger riding their way up or past you at a much faster speed to your left you can see the massive green jungle this tangled jungle forest to the east that consumes the base of the ashkeeper peaks all the way just out of sight to the horizon known as the cuarasca jungle the fields and hills you follow grow darker and more dense with greenery the sky is more clear and a more vibrant blue than you're used to in the northern lands and the grey skies of the empire you follow the road over a series of rising hills until you eventually crest the tallest your eyes catching a beautiful-- and for some of you an entirely new-- sight beneath the cloudless blue the horizon comes to meet an endless stretch of deep cerulean scattered with thousands of tiny sparkling lights the sunlight dancing across the distant waves giving the illusion of a million scattered diamonds glinting across what is the lucidian ocean to your left the dark green of the cuarasca jungle still dominates the countryside along the ashkeeper peaks the now hundreds of miles of lush tangled vine canopy stretching to the shore and stopping at the southern cliffs and beaches that give way into the endless waters a warm breeze blows from the south as the faint scent of salt water tickles your nose due just south of your hilltop southwest the road continues to wind through the green hills and patchwork rocky mounds dotted with trees and overgrowth eventually leading to a rather large city that sits on the coast dozens of boats large enough to see even at this distance cluster around the bays and docks while the colorful rooftops and towers vary in height and design giving an eclectic visual of a jumble of cultures having built this space without unified vision to fjord this is a familiar sight and to jester this is home welcome to the menagerie coast and the port city of nicodranas and that's where we'll finish tonight's episode (cheering) nott now has a full-on alf dynamic with some of these creatures i'm pretty excited about that that was fun i'm
