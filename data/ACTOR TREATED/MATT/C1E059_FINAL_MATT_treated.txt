that's what energy drinks are for all right guys let's dive in here to the proper part of tonight's episode of critical role welcome back so we had a week off last week where the amazing liam o'brien there ran a one-shot game of absolute chaos and did an amazing job if you guys haven't had an opportunity to check it out you should it's up on geekandsundrycom it's amazing and made me and marisha very jealous that we couldn't play it but we were here in spirit and obviously motorcycle and sidecar so that was fun we'll show you some of the fanart but anyway back to this game vox machina the group of adventurers who had found their way now seeking the vestiges of divergence ancient artifacts of power to help them in their struggle against the chroma conclave the collection of chromatic dragons that have razed the entire countryside of tal'dorei they've acquired a few of them but the most recent one sends them to the feywild in search of fenthras a bow which seems to have acquired the eyes of vex upon it you took care of some business managed to ward off an assassination attempt by a rakshasa and found your way through keyleth's plane shift spell into the feywild somewhere in the vicinity of the portal where the nymph in the frostweald upon meeting vox machina years before supposedly lives so to bring us back in as you step out into the temperate air you're struck by the vibrant purples blues and pinks of sunset that envelop the skies and the clouds above the tree line the smell of fresh morning dew and poppy upon the breeze fills your head and your feet wade through tall thick grasses that tickle your knees with each step vine-covered tree trunks rise all around you curling as they stretch upward like a bending dreamscape and hundreds of small bobbing faerie lights glow in the shadowed distance of the forest looking about you you can see what appear to be clusters of mud and small pools of water that are scattered in your vicinity some ten 15 even 30 feet apart small little pools that dot the landscape almost like pebbles scattered across a small field what do you guys want to do make a perception check 26 okay as you guys are taking in the vicinity percy glancing around you see no signs of civilization the only thing that catches your eye is a little ways past the immediate tree line that meets your eye the fairy lights seem to be caressing the outside of some sort of older stone structure and that's about as much as you can make out looks about four or five feet tall and it's only barely visible between two of the trunks okay you make your way across these extremely thick moss-covered tree trunks you push past the two and eventually come upon the structure and as you get closer the fairy lights dim and vanish as soon as you get within five or six feet of them and they seem to only appear at a peripheral point you guys approach the stone structure not particularly nothing about it strikes you as part of the general feywild lore there are structures that have been built throughout periods of time some of which have fallen to ruin nature in the feywild tends to reclaim things that aren't natural if left to their own devices i would say have both of you guys roll history checks for the both of you vex and vax you would not you learned elven but elven culture and the feywild are two entirely different things 13 okay best that you can ascertain the first worry initially and you have encountered something like this before will-o'-wisps entities that were the lost souls of individuals that died under tragic circumstances in swamps and bogs and in heavily wooded areas however those entities are usually larger and are drawn towards sources of life the fact that these are much smaller and tend to fade at your arrival means either they're not will-o'-wisps at all or a different kind you haven't encountered that's as much information that you can deal with i'd like you both to make stealth checks if you could anybody else going up with them or is just the two of them make an athletics check roll athletics with disadvantage just because i'm giving you a chance yes okay this is the one time you've bartered with the dm this session you do manage to leap across because these trees are thickly wooded and the branch line starts at about the four-foot mark anyway it's fairly easy for you to leap up the top of the tree without an issue you vanish up into the canopy you two what'd you roll for stealth and liam what'd you get 11 feet okay you approach this stone structure which you see now is the corner part of a wall it looks like there was some sort of a small structure here best that you can make out all of it's heavily covered with vine and ivy and all the places where the stonework is broken looks to be through natural erosion or claimed by actual roots and you can see now part of the tree roots have actually risen up and tore down elements of these walls and you can see broken rubble barely poking through the very thick underbrush of this forest whatever was here was built a long time ago and has been mostly reclaimed by the forest the corner is facing you guys so you're on the outside of where the structure would have been this is a ruin but most of it's been torn down and it's not visible sections of walls available the largest piece is currently the corner you're facing make a history check you have no idea the planes you've studied are the planes of the elemental form the feywild is a little ways outside of your realm of any training or storytime you've been given growing up most of what you've gleaned about it thus far has been based on the conversations you've had in recent weeks it ranges from at least in this forest a very deep lush dark green like a heavy winter's pine green the forests are more vine-wrapped mossy willow-ish trees that hang down no however the evening sky is very purple and orange like around a very bright dusk and that colorscape does contrast with the green of the forest quite beautifully it looks to be getting to dusk yeah not from ten feet away no the vines that are there do have small whitish flower buds little flowers that have been blooming in a small scale across the vines not particularly they look like white flowers from this distance you'd have to get closer to inspect directly sure the canopy is very thick and only in these small little patches of meadow like the one that you entered and had all the little pools in it and the one that you're entering now which has the ruin have little breaks in the canopy where you can actually see the sky otherwise it's very thick so actually flying through the canopy unless you're going very slowly is going to be whipping you and probably knocking you off you can make your way up there a little bit make a perception check keyleth you approach the ruin to get a closer look at the plants make a nature check okay these white flowers resemble a form of daisy that exists in tal'dorei however they grow there in flower clusters out of the ground you've never seen them sprout from a vine and the shape's a little different and you don't actually know this form of plant from your personal experience but you can ascertain a similar nature to it they don't appear to be toxic no as you reach out and touch it with your finger i need you to go ahead and do nothing because it's fine okay as you rocket up past the boughs and begin to emerge from the edge of the canopy over this opening you do see a very large water pool on the other side of this ruin you can see where this ruin used to be most of it has fallen and then sunken into what appears to be a very glassy pool of water a still surface untouched there's no wind in this area it's a perfectly reflective surface to the opening above it you don't see any life forms you do see a bare minimum hint of movement if you will beneath the water you can't make out the shape but you do see something moving beneath the water it's a pool it looks like water and you've seen a number that you've come past in this way this one's larger than the others you pluck the flower as you pluck it the vines begin to writhe and pull away from the stone actually releasing the hold on the ruin and as it does you hear what sounds like some movement some shifting of water on the other side of the stone wall the vine has retracted and as you set it towards the vine it tumbles off and actually the flower you see now as you reach down it has turned from a beautiful white and has immediately withered into a black dried husk where was once silence you hear the rushing of leaves as the canopy's beginning to close over like the trees are leaning in and the actual branches themselves are starting to close up the gap in space on the sky stealth check on both you guys okay okay both of you guys-- you go back into the branch and you can feel the branches pushing behind you and you have to actually get low to not be dragged away with the rest of these extending branches that are closing off the opening in the canopy vax you make your way towards one of the tree trunks and dart out of the way percy you're watching this in horror okay it's at this point you guys see a hand creep up over the stone a secondary hand pulling up from here you now see what appears to be a humanoid female form lithe hair wet and slicked back and as the head peeks over-- okay the moment there is any movement she flickers and moves back from the wall looking already very perturbed by this whole circumstance i need both of you guys to make constitution saving throws natural one as you're shoved ahead and begin to go into a bow percy you bow but you can't take your eyes off of it as the creature pulls herself up over the wall an extremely beautiful impossibly beautiful woman nude steps up over the edge of the wall and as you glance forward everything goes dark blackness you bow and he appears to be bowing he's still standing he's fine as soon as you say that the creature darts backward and you see it take a few steps and then leap and dives into the pool and vanishes beneath the water's surface although you see that keyleth percy you do not you just hear footsteps and you look at percy eyes wide open glancing about the pupils moving about were you paying attention okay percy crawls onto the ground and begins rocking back and forth okay make a perception check okay as they're having this conversation you-- you find your way over and sure enough no person has the leg density that grog does and you're pretty sure you have your mark okay trinket (whoosh bear noises) jowls shake as you rub your fingers into his fur no that's okay all right so you feel the somewhat damp cold nose of a bear nudge under your hand and then (bear noises) and a shoulder lunges into you okay it takes you a little while but you get up onto the bear eventually you have to right him because he's facing the wrong direction a little you land feet go (squelch) into the muddy outskirts of the pond it's about up to your ankles but you can see the water is now rippled and disturbed smells like probably the freshest poolside mud you've ever come across no none yeah it's about maybe ten feet from you roll a stealth check you put it in the descriptor man okay (squelching) you make your way as markedly quiet as you can okay you come up to the edge of the water and you can see some of the ripples are starting to lap across the mud the mud and silt continues downward into a perfectly clear pool though the light source has been cut off from the sky now as the canopy has closed and what little bit of light happens to find its way through the forest ceiling-- other than that it's pretty dark however you do have darkvision a few of you do have darkvision so it's not a huge hindrance within a certain distance you do see what appears to be clouds of silt on the bottom of the water that have slowly found their way close to resting no immediate response no yeah go ahead and make a strength check okay 23 you lob the egg with perfect accuracy directly into the center of the pool it hits and floats on the surface semi-buoyant with a little bit of the shell revealed on the top a few moments pass before a few fingers curl up and grab it and pull it down below make an intelligence check (laughter) you were distracted for the brief time you spent over here but it does appear to be similar make a persuasion check you watch as suddenly there's a burst of bubbles under the surface of the water another burst of bubbles comes up on the surface as the water begins to break and you can see a very beautiful water-covered nude female form that is laughing uproariously in the pool (laughs) oh it has been some time (gasping) and she takes her hair off to the side and gets the water out of it and shoves it over her shoulder she steps up and this time her feet touch the surface and she walks on it like it's solid as she begins to step carefully towards you i apologize for being well-- and she points over towards him i would recommend in the future perhaps a more respectful means of arrival if i recall your name was grog is that correct nala i watch over this glade it is bound to me as i am to it i would hope that in the future you'd be more gentle with that that resides here as you're talking at this moment there's a sudden sparking sound like a heavy log has fallen in a forest with a crack and a thoom there's a flash of light and she instinctively turns and then dives beneath the water once more as you guys glance over there's a somewhat shimmering form of light that congeals into a small gnomish female flickering in and out as pike after coming back from your goodbyes and walking to the temple of pelor now constructed to take at least a moment to begin building a bastion for sarenrae worship here as well you miss your friends so hard in that moment that for a brief moment the divine energies give you one last brief moment to walk beside them across the planes with that nala steps back through the water taking invisible steps up to the top of the surface where you're pretty much up to your waist in the pool at this time she's now standing directly on the surface about ten feet from you she looks out and looks towards you i remember you as well she met all of you guys it's all right not many things happen in this glade these days so when they happen rapidly it tends to drop my heart a bit speaking of which do you still carry my heart with you grog she turns her head i don't sense it on your person glad you're safe i shall begin the process of creating a new one then i'm glad it served you well she puts her hand up and nods she nods and laughs she brings her arm up and as she does a singular vine seems to grow up out of the muck and curl up and take the daisy from your finger and drag it off into the forest that's a hard lesson learned it doesn't work that way i'm sorry for the most part those that fall under my protective gaze they've earned it don't consider past that and my innate talents do not reach beyond that striking so i'm sorry yes not around my glade no i'd know we've met yes there are trees that fall under various states of corruption time and time again in the feywild light and darkness stands eternal here the shademirk bog duskward is towards the dusk she points as she puts her finger up you can see the trees relax now and open up the sky above you and you can see the direction where most of the setting sunlight is being cast into the sky and she motions in that direction this is my glade we are one i have not i stay here this is my home and i am bound to it to not wander too far what i know of the shademirk i only know through individuals who passed through and kept me up to speed with things that may or may not be transpiring in this landscape but those meetings are tens of years if not more between not to my knowledge no my understanding of realms beyond this wood and beyond this glade are fairly limited beyond what i've been given by passersby and it's been not since you grog stepped through with me i've not had another cross my path it is my life the trees keep me company the roots they speak the earth itself is sustenance and the voice the timeless voice of this land-- well there are many stories here everything gauge with care that which you tamper many things lie and live in these lands that could be of aid and many your own destruction words spoken by many who live and call the feywild their home are in themselves riddles deceit is their common form of time passage and those that wander from beyond well some would consider you more of a toy or a plaything than a visitor or passerby (laughs) bring me some books i'd like some books pictures are always nice but things to tell me of things beyond my sphere perhaps the world you come from beyond the frostweald i know very little as well take whatever you wish to say goodbye with she takes it and thumbs through closes it thank you depends on what you seek and what your reasons are trust goes all ways the difficulty is finding who is aligned with your ideals your intentions and your goals and who isn't i trust practically no one sorry oh feyspecks they are small entities that care to the underbrush of the forests here they're not dangerous i'm sure they lead you many places though none of them may be where you're trying to go i wouldn't trust them to guide you they themselves are very deceptive and trickery-loving entities but they help me keep the glade in the forest make a persuasion roll she thinks for a moment holding the tome under her arm well i have minor magical capabilities perhaps i could harden the physicality of one of you in a way to aid it won't last long but it's something she steps forward and as you're having this conversation she puts her fingers towards the front of your forehead and touches your skin you feel a surge of warmth through your body though blackness still takes your vision the rest of you watch as his skin suddenly turns to a dark brown and crackles for a brief moment you fear but notice it's like his physical form all parts of the pinky flesh of the human percy become hard like tree bark it's like a fine cedar well keep your wits about you that's the finest defense you have against this uncertain landscape i appreciate that it is good to see your faces as brief as it is good luck and safe travels so you bow she turns around and begins to walk back down the invisible steps you see her taking as she drifts deeper into the water and actually before she disappears beneath the surface looks over her shoulder and smiles at you grog and then disappears beneath the water below as you guys are having this conversation there's a brief sound as percy even amongst his blinded state catches keyleth's finger in midair all right flanked by wet willies percy one is halted but in the distracted moment and the stealthy rogue being what he is you feel the slimy insertion of a single half-elven digit into your ear canal yeah there's plenty of stone debris make a perception check he catches the pebble out of the air it gets really quiet suddenly percy yes trinket stops and (bear noises) all of a sudden trinket lurches forward and starts dragging him trinket's been dragging him away from you towards her okay so as you clutch your holy symbol your flickering divine form drifts over towards the side of trinket you reach up and touch his leg and the warmth of the divine energy surges through his leg you can see it almost like a sparkle up his chest little light rays peering out from beneath the clothing it comes up his gullet up the side of his face and his eyes flash white with beams of gentle sunlight shooting out for a second the darkness becomes blurry and your vision over the next 15 or so seconds returns to normal yes you guys catch up with the rest of the party who's now moved on ahead making your way through this thick forest i would like you all to make a perception check what did you get liam 24 okay 25s or higher which i think is keyleth and vex you guys push through the forest for about another two hours or so all right two hours of travel towards the direction of the dusk keeping tabs on it the best you can you being the tracker you are you notice that the night hasn't come the light in the sky itself has not changed the dusk hasn't waxed or waned there's been no change in the sky light or color whatsoever the dusk seems to have for the last couple hours been perpetual and unmoving you're moving towards that that was the one direction you were given by the nymph yes make a perception check yeah okay you glance up at the next opening you have in the canopy and you see occasionally a flock of birds go flying by there is definitely vibrant wildlife and you've seen throughout the forest here skittering squirrels and other creatures that live here though themselves being skittish and running off as soon as your footfalls begin to hit that portion of the forest there is a very vibrant critter lifestyle here within this part of the feywild okay you come up above the canopy have to maneuver around some of the larger branches and these trees are tall you probably get yourself a hundred feet up before you finally break the canopy and as you coast over the top you can see now before you this forest is vast the majority of it behind you and you can actually see what appears to be the edge of the forest's line maybe about ten miles up and past that you can see rolling grass hills before a mountain line you can see in the distance a very far distance-- make a perception check this would be looking beyond the forest so yeah it would not have advantage 17 you see a faint glimmer of some kind something that stands out it's like a reflection or bead of light amongst the grass fields beyond the forest you're unable to really tell the distance but it does stand out as it occasionally flickers not from this perspective no mostly it looks natural from this view also the clouds in the sky are slowly moving like normal clouds and you can see in the distance what appears to be a sun that has passed beyond the mountain range but there is no change in the light same it was since the moment you arrived okay you guys push on for another three or so hours-- at the pace you guys are walking you just begin to push outside of the trees it was hard gauging the distance from that period of time that was the rough estimate based on the perception roll you begin to watch the tree line thin a bit there's still many trees around you but the density's beginning to scatter and you're beginning to see more and more light let through from the treetops and the trees themselves are not as tall as they were towards the central bulk of the forest vex you do catch to your left side something that sounds like at first a little hiss but instead it comes to your ear as a chuckle make a perception check natural 20 you glance out of the corner of your eye and you see about four trees behind you some outline of a shaded figure that darts behind a tree in between no response you guys continue making your way towards the edge of the forest and shortly after the tree line does come to an end there are small clusters of trees but beyond that you're now opening this nearly-endless grassland the grasses themselves swaying with the breeze that is starting to catch up you can see the waves that curl over these low hills and this beautiful deep verdant green-emerald color that shifts and cascades over and over and over as you begin to step into the grass it's high it's chest-high to the half-elves a little below waist-high to you and the gnomes are swimming through grass at this point you hop on trinket (bear noises) he reaches up and gives you a lick but it pseudo-passes through your form and trinket looks really confused and tilts the bear head to the side it's open field directionless and before you there is still the dusk ahead of you that's the best directional point you have right now but there is no worn path there is no road or street there are no signs of civilization it looks like an endless field shoot the bush you will get near it you want to take it okay as you guys begin to walk through the field you begin to reveal some of the druidic secrets of animal communication to vex and over the course of the next hour of travel-- she bestows upon you the elements of it it's less about vocality it's about being able to connect on an empathic and emotional level where creatures can speak to you less out of words and more out of the idea of emotions and thoughts which our human minds-- or in some cases half-human minds-- accept as words there is no actual speech that they're talking like hello my dear she does it for a while do you cast the spell trinket turns to you yes you grab him trinket doesn't seem to realize any sort of difference yes okay it's a little lonely i haven't been in there very long i love you too vex'ahlia a big lick upside your face and nudges his head against you as trinket nudges you he says it's okay i can stay in there all you need i can watch you through there i can see you yes grog you've actually been in there so you have an idea of what he's talking about boom what you guys do and he talks about how he hated at the time but has in hindsight enjoyed the memory of the pie contest in whitestone he tells you that was fine but you can tell through the subtle bear undertones that he wasn't too happy about it but everything has this tone of basically whatever you need and anything for you there is an undying loyalty and love from trinket that you've always felt but now to hear in language form is very moving you guys keep walking and you keep walking you're past the tree line you're in the grass but it's hard to really gauge since you have no sun in the sky and you don't have a central timepiece of any kind no none no trail it's like you never stepped through behind you the grasses parted where you walked through and then looking behind it's like you were dropped in the middle of a field make a perception check you can make a perception check as well yeah glancing about a smooth grassline from where you guys left it's visible but it's quite a ways away yeah it's the rolling fields and hills it's comparable to the width of the valley between the cliffkeep mountains and the stormcrest mountains on tal'dorei it seems like such a vast space with no immediate scattered landmarks in your head which is used to gauging your position from small changes in the scenery it's mind-numbing it feels like it's endless she said two days duskward she said two days duskward only at times because when you go below the hills into these deep valleys before you come to the next hill line it cuts off your perspective but as you get close make another perception check vex as you're keeping an eye on the back of trinket i said vex 18 the source of the glimmer is becoming larger but you can't make out any details there are actually a few glimmers clustered it's one of those things where it's not perpetual every now and then you see it it seems erratic yeah you push on for a few more hours and trying to think back how long you've been here the time passes in a strange way to the point where you have no way of understanding how much time has gone by but you're starting to get a little tired like you would towards the end of a day's worth of travel you come up over a large hillside and you can see now there's a base of a mountain range that you can make out a little bit in the distance that meets up where that flickering is you can see what appears to be now the source of the flickering there looks to be some sort of a civilization there are towers there appears to be a stone ring around it it's hard to make out the details from this distance but it looks fairly large it's in the side of the mountain range just grass fields as far as you can see and then the hill line eventually gets so high in the distance where you can't see past it you see the mountain range and whatever the source of this glimmer is this strange city-like series of structures at the base of that mountain range go ahead and roll a perception check on your end as well vax as you're getting up sure go ahead and make one because you get a better view as well 25 vax it's hard at this distance to make out much of the information especially with the grass being as high as it is and the hill beyond it for the most part the folks that can get a clear bead are those that are above the grass line and keeping a keen eye which vex is from what you can see every now and then you see tiny little bits of movement in the grass maybe a quarter mile one way you can see a similar type winding shape in the grass a mile or so the other way it's even further out there are other things moving in the grass but none of them are breaking the grass surface but they appear to be singular at least in the shifting of movement you do catch a smaller source of movement in the grass no more than 30 feet off from where the rest of your party is currently walking yeah you swoop down and over view of that you can see what appears to be a small humanoid that is curling through the grass line looks human big thick curled beard very coarse dark hair a muscled torso stocky but strong what appears to be a light blue vest that's covering the upper part of the torso most of the buttons missing and the bottom of it tattered and worn the hindquarters themselves are fur and come into cloven hooves and you can see a small pair of horns hooking off the back of the head this individual is skulking through the grass carrying a small book and a long quill and he's occasionally leaping up over the grass line landing and then drawing something in the book he does not see you at the moment no you're overhead as soon as you come down and whisper the tome slams shut the figure stands up straight slowly turns the eyes towards you and you can see the dark and ruddy skin the sun-touched nose and cheeks a darker more leathered texture to them but the eyes are piercing ice blue as he looks back into yours nothing just taking notes yes because why not you see if you're worried it's not me you need to worry about it's him and points past your shoulder make an insight check yeah 16 he seems like a slippery person in general though he is caught off guard and right now is in self-preservation mode it's hard to gauge if he's telling the truth or not i don't-- i'm not a biter i'm not the biter in this area and he starts backing up towards the grass you grab his wrist and fly up (whimpers) i need you to make a grapple check go ahead and make an athletics he pulls away and as your hand grabs his wrist he attempts to slip his hand out fingers pull through from your grasp as you double over your other hand and grab him by the elbow you lift up and pull him out of the grass field now dangling his little feet in the middle of the air as he's being dragged up the quill gets dropped and he looks for it and the book's tumbling out of his hand he grabs the book and clutches it to himself what are you doing there is nothing visible in the vicinity please this is really high (whimpers) you drag him down the broom coasting right over the grass line presenting you and your new compatriot to the rest of vox machina dangling from her grasp hey friend you look like a smart fellow let's have a conversation i am but a simple wanderer and an individual who enjoys learning about things that are new and different garmelie garmelie i'm-- nothing no reading he tries to wiggle out of your grasp but it does nothing you're concrete around him (giggles) no it's a very finely bound book the leather is impeccable it's oiled there's a brass metallic trim around the edges of it and the binding there is a thick piece of red velvet strip that is set as a bookmarker in the center of it (whimpers) (laughter) there's really nothing going on i was curious and taking notes you wouldn't understand by the way he's being held up by grog right now what's the dc okay as you touching his leg and looking up at him there's that shimmer of purplish energy in your eyes and he gives you a look right no worries no problems whatsoever whatever you need you don't know about the quill you know the book that he had do you want to try to open the book yes it's quite safe it's where i'm currently making notes all right the picture you come to as of right now is a very finely detailed sketch of grog very well drawn but he has bulging eyes big buck teeth and a very tiny penis (laughter) many so many that's one of them there are drawings of the entire party but with extremely exaggerated cartoonish parody features for pike her head is extremely large yeah with a hint of mad magazine it's essentially a book full of dickbutts it's him drawing and vandalizing the image of a number of you guys there's a picture of vax and keyleth that are both covered in poo and slapping it on their face written in elvish i love this with a word bubble it's essentially a kid entertaining himself with a bunch of stupid pictures no no record keeper you start seeing a number of elven individuals you see people in really nice regal armor but all of them are pooping themselves there's a bunch of elvish ladies with oversized floppy boobs smacking each other in the face it's truly childish but they're really well drawn and well shaded there is a serious talent to the artwork his skewed intent of imagery is fascinating that that is the elven city of syngorn they've been here for a little while and they've been a gracious source of subjects i live wherever i please i choose my place to rest i've got family and friends all over yes they're just a ways away i know it well yes it's hard to guide when you're being crushed by a giant green-gray man thing chicken where do you want to go make a perception check that quill fell in the center of a tall grass field you spend the better part of the next 20 minutes realizing that there is no way you're finding this quill amongst the grass this is the needle in a hay factory make an investigation check best you can find throughout his body the only thing that catches your attention is a now-crushed ocarina that he had on the inside of his pocket that did not survive the grasping of grog i understand look if we are to strike an accord here one of friendly trade of services i would greatly appreciate it's done without this very handsome muscled--  you see it (drip) off his nose without this man trying to smash my innards please as you finish the incantation the shimmering doorway of scanlan's magnificent mansion outlines within the grass field only emerging about a foot beyond the actual tallest part of the grass you have to bow down to get into it but you guys all enter along with your new friend garmelie into the mansion itself we'll take a break there and we'll jump back into this crazed circumstance here in a few minutes we'll see you guys shortly [break] i'm talking about it they have a critical role panel that they've announced in the thing they put out-- yes one of those emails newsletters thank you critical role stuff happening i will be there all four days so panels and stuff coming up cool we'll have more info as that's unveiled but those of you going to gencon hopefully i'll have some cool stuff ready for you then that's one mention also want to give another thanks again to loot crate for being our awesome sponsor (cheering) i've just been notified that once we hit 25k subscribers that goal whenever we reach that will be 25k and a talent show i guess a lot of the hosts and people involved with this show and others have a lot of random weird-ass talents that they want to reveal on the internet because what could possibly go wrong so that's something to look forward to and we'll have other things intermittently giveaways and other goals but that's the next big goal that's been put out there as far as i know so i want to let you guys be aware of that is it the otter taming finger 22k and a red panda unofficial badly poached there you go affectionately all right guys so back in the game as you guys find your way into the interior of scanlan's magnificent mansion the individual the fey creature known as garmelie nervously walks along with you what do you wish to do before an evening's rest is taken a bunch of the servants (whoosh) shimmer out next to him and he's like (nervous whimper) hello hi a little winter-- seasons-- it's not really a thing here they grew yes please you pass the ale around he skulls it (gulps) he greedily drinks it down so if we're here to talk and make this deal we're discussing what is it you want from me a slight slur it's a busy place right now we haven't seen the city of syngorn in close to a hundred years at the very least and they have an entire army building up right now it's hustle and bustle hell if i know i just wandered through and used that distraction to acquire a few things and make some fantastic notes things i don't steal i borrow indefinitely i take things that look nice that i think i would want i am no simple street thief i am a procurer of wayward items and objects that need a better home make a deception check oh i'm sure it does big man well good to know look i'm not going to take anything from you you've already proven far more of a match for me than i had ever anticipated and what was meant to be a simple fun game of follow and-- follow has turned into a much more complicated circumstance so i'd like to get it over with as soon as possible my quill is gone you've threatened me and my life it had sentimental value i can get another what do you want from me you want to go to the shademirk whatever for why would you go to the shademirk yes why to stay the hell out of it certainly want to go to the shademirk be my guest he takes it from you he sloshes it around and makes wild gestures it's a dangerous place it's been a source of vileness and ichor here in the feywild for hundreds of years it's a terrible horrible cesspool of nothing i'm so sorry this is getting everywhere both all of it creatures things trollish slime creatures i sketched a thing or two you take a moment to scan through and there are all sorts of creatures all drawn stupidly many with extra private parts coming out of shoulders and stuff around page 163 164 and you see and there are creatures all throughout but at that page in particular you see a lanky tall humanoid that is oozing black thick viscous tar it's shaded in a way where it looks like it has that glaze that only thick oil-like substances really give off and it's dragging this absolutely unnecessarily large dong behind it about four feet every picture looks pretty good to a point and then you're like aw really it's a little bigger than you gestures and takes his drink back i haven't gotten close enough to it i know how to get there but it's not an easy let alone safe route so you're saying that as part of this agreement i will be your guide to the outskirts of the shademirk because i am not going in there the land there is poisoned i haven't gone in there myself i'm sure there's many poison trees day and a half maybe duskward-seaward maybe then let us make the other side of this agreement you want me to be your guide you'll give me back my book he sets the drink down back my book and-- he looks at the rest of you you seem to speak like you know thievery yes there's a few things in that there dreary elvish city that i haven't the skills to procure but if you wouldn't mind maybe borrowing them for me in my stead well we've a done deal if you will we make the agreement first we make the agreement first consider it a bit of trust nope no no shademirk i'm out sorry if it's that important to you to go to this dark place then keep the book all right i can draw more yes it's that simple we both go our separate ways and good luck finding the shademirk on your own you can make an insight check but he's not acting too far out of his normal place here it's an interestingly tense conversation it's hard to ride one way or the other but it's a valid point if worse comes to worst and what he's asking for is beyond your grasp or something that you wish not to do then the deal is off and you go your separate ways they did it wasn't a huge army per se but they had trained forces and they had a means of defending their city i like this one take your d10 mending spell do you have the cantrip mending is a cantrip right so you have the spell correct cantrips you have at all times what cantrips do you know how would you use druidcraft actually it's made out of clay yeah okay using what materials are within the workshop that you had before there is a very mild adhesive paste that you construct go ahead and make a tinkering roll this will be with your intelligence modifier very rapidly with the things that are given at your disposal not even needing the materials here but what you have on you as part of your traveling tinkering kit you piece together a nearly unnoticeable binding agent for clay and dirt and earth-based materials you manage to fix the ocarina rather quickly in a period of maybe 20 minutes and with the help of keyleth's druidcraft dry it and manage to get it fixed thank you that's one good deed you've done me today i appreciate that (whistles) it's awful he doesn't really know how to play and it's like (off-key singing) if i can find my quill i like you well are we at an agreement whoever your leader is shake my hand before you got your hand there vax vex put her hand in and both of you guys clasp both sides of his hand at the same time a trio handshake all right so you guys shake hands with him you feel this shiver on your back as you shake hands and he smiles very well now we've properly gotten acquainted my sharper introductions are in order he stands up and wobbles for a second a little drunk on the ale my name is garmelie i am a simple joy finder of the ever-shifting grasses and i am happy to be your guide for the remainder of this journey to the outskirts of the shademirk and no further three things you wish you avoid as you progress further as we are traveling through the moonbrush alongside the green sea-- we could take one or the other your choice eventually finding our way to the gilded run and from there on to the shademirk itself i'll be leaving you at the outskirts of the gilded run but it should suffice for the journey you wish to have ahead things you wish to avoid one the hut of wodenna she's a terrible woman you see a hut don't go you may smell enticing things wodenna delightful smells sounds of soft music a gentle light across the shade and sea two words at once i'm drunk but do not go near the hut avoid the hut no hut two avoid the last campsite of sorudun the happy avoid it trust me avoid it if there's a campsite that's empty looks happy avoid it and three avoid the theater avoid the theater in general i hate all theater let's avoid the theater please do it he seems pretty perturbed by the idea of theater she's been around a while that's a name best to avoid trust me great wondrous and who are you by the way vox machina slayer's take very well pleasure to meet you all vox machina slayer's take he holds his drink out for you to fill again i don't care thank you now the deal is made drink's been had introductions have been properly given i think it's time for bed he takes two steps forward (thud) face-first in the center of the main area and starts snoring loudly make a sleight of hand check make a sleight of hand check you sneak forward and in a move that would've made vax proud you pull the ocarina from his grasp show it to the rest of the party and tuck it away roll a d20 and add your wisdom modifier okay you cast the spell you didn't feel anything in particular as they're being cast so you still can't use it (laughter) and the 20 guards lift his form and carry him off perfect everyone else go to bed it's pretty coarse all right so this is your second level of exhaustion oh that's right you did sleep correct so you do take another point of exhaustion now so you're back to one point of exhaustion so all your ability checks are at disadvantage all right anyone else doing anything there you go all right percy as you're getting ready to go to bed you feel this strange tickle at the back of your head that dissipates it is the fading of a charm person spell as you're going to bed okay scanlan is reading in his room with the door slightly ajar right now keyleth is at rest grog is at rest vax is at rest vex is still up cleaning your garments you said right and pike you went to bed but are waking up early correct so essentially it's just vex who's awake that's entirely up to your opinion you know the attire she wears you've traveled with her it's based on what you want to base that judgment on whether it be pure looks the person inside it's whatever percival thinks she would be in his eyes so you guys go your separate ways you find yourself eventually to bed as the rest of the group is asleep vex you take a bit of solace in the conversation finish cleaning your things though it doesn't seem like the incessant scrubbing you were driven on has much purpose nor the impact you thought it might at this point and you resign yourself to sleep for the evening as the evening comes to a close pike you wake up early as you come out of your room you struggle with the view of 20 guards slowly shifting through the foyer as a very hungover and groaning satyr begins clomping through the main foyer going breakfast please please breakfast yes someone they listen to thank you rubbing his eyes as he follows you into the kitchen he comes up onto one of the long benches in the center of one of the main dining tables are you poisoning me what is this i don't like coffee something that's not coffee the servants look at each other confused and wander off and come back with a carafe of an apple juice that is familiar thank you he takes the carafe okay yes what do you mean well it's hard to do without seeing the subjects but if you want to fill in the details all right well i need a quill or some charcoal he gave me a feather it has to be refined into a quill there is no quill in the kitchen but glancing around and asking the servants there are pieces of charcoal there is charcoal available sketch charcoal of course all right you first all right you hear the gentle lyrical stylings of celine dion swell in background as the satyr quickly begins sketching your charcoal form i don't know what that means but i'll do my best in rapid time faster than anyone you've ever seen sketch his form almost becomes blurred with the haste in which he draws and within the hour he has completed an extremely well-detailed portrait and i mean portrait as everyone is standing shoulder to shoulder like a family above a mantel and it is grotesque horrifying you look like perhaps the trickfoots had been keeping the bloodline strong for a very long period of time droopy face one eye sinking below the other you don't even have the right number of fingers you see grog in the back who is as wide as the rest of everybody is behind them this giant wall with this tiny little head with a tongue lolling out to the side it looks like he has one finger as a thumbs-up and the other one's up his bum in the front you see vex and vax the twins are furiously making out in a really horrible display clutching each other it's terrifying keyleth is currently clutching the side of a tree happily and as she does her eyes are going in different directions and the tree itself is trying to push her off the branch you see percy who is extremely tall with this squat thin head with these giant glasses that make his eyes bug-eyed and strange you see a little bit of scruff on the chin that's actually turning into this long awful matted dingleberry mess of a goatee and he has both of his guns pointed at his head next to that is a perfectly defined unchanged portrait of scanlan shorthalt okay eventually you all come to consciousness brought to the wonderful welcome morning scent of once again a chickenful breakfast you find yourselves down to a once again passed-out satyr slumped over the breakfast table with two plates of mostly devoured chicken mashed potatoes and a couple other side elements there above on the mantel across the room is a glorious sketch of the family of vox machina yes what what hi it's a gift make a persuasion check he goes i thought i'd leave you a little present eat up and we'll be on our way he notices the tension from percy and grog defending myself as was warranted i'm certain that was a necessary precaution wondrous i had hoped as such because we have much to gain it is a little late i'm going to show you something like that good that's not the first time i've heard that make an intimidation check (stuttering) i hope it never comes to that i can make addendums to the art piece if you're unhappy many times no i'll show you as part of the agreement it'll be unveiled upon arrival great now finish your food much to do much to see much to take (off-key music) where did-- what they giveth and they take away well then eat well and he makes his way toward the door and the guards stop him there i'll just sit here then and sits on the floor waiting for you guys to finish what do you mean deals are meant to be kept should you go against a deal that you've made especially in here these realms there are consequences so don't stray from the deal sure make a performance check 13 in a very rudimentary kindergarten recorder way (off-key music) it's a little shaky but you get the hang of it it's the only sound in the room it's dead quiet as you do this in the middle of breakfast with food being brought to the table she has my ocarina eat your breakfast he sits there and pouts as you guys finish your meal laughing and enjoying yourselves he somehow recedes even further into his grumpy self his neck disappearing as his head pulls into his torso you guys finish your breakfast the guards come with you and escort you and your ally outside the door as you exit the-- you've tried taking things out of the mansion and they've turned to dust you take it down talk put it back up no worries as you guys exit the mansion the dusk light of the sky has not changed you get the idea here at least since you've arrived that there has been no movement in the sun you haven't even seen the sun the light source of dusk beyond the distant mountains and horizon is stuck in the dusk hour with the threat and curl of midnight in the opposite direction the dark blue coming over the horizon unmoving it also is raining gently there is a rather heavy cloud that has come over and it's not a terrible downpour but a gentle rainfall has been here for a while and the floor between the grasses is quite slushy as you step out (squelch) no that faded with the night's rest a few hours maybe okay you guys would have to get close together to do that but it's doable as a cantrip she keeps this general revolving sphere of wind above that scatters most of the rain to the sides for the most part grog you still get pretty damp because of your size and difficulty but most everyone else can stay pretty dry as you cluster together walking through the grass you travel for another hour or so before the grass towards the outskirts of the mountain range in the city begins to slowly subside it grows thinner and shorter and you come to a bit of marshland almost treeless open marshland with little bushes in clusters anything you guys want to-- okay perception check okay as you guys begin walking into the marsh you can see there are areas where it's elevated mud patches where it's very shallow water maybe an inch at most and there are a few different areas that get noticeably deep and murky you watch to avoid those elements you're not sure what might be beneath if anything but you naturally move through this terrain carefully you do notice that occasionally upon this walk you see different from the rest of the bushes and pieces of terrain these deep bluish purple sprout leaves almost like carrot tops very leafy plant top emerges in places occasionally clusters of two or three there aren't a lot of them but many of them occur throughout the walk in this swampy landscape oh these are best to be avoided they're mandrake don't disturb them don't pull them out don't do anything with them best left to the side you guys make your way through the marsh occasionally passing by the mandrake tops until it begins to subside the marshland itself and you come towards the base of the city before you you see a massive ivy-covered wall of jade-like stone surrounding a dense cluster of towering trees unlike those in any of the surrounding forests or the one you left it is an open plain and then within the city walls there are trees emerging many stories into the air trees that you guys recognize have always been there these trees came with the city and they're actually from the verdant expanse where syngorn usually resides as you walk closer you can see large sealed gates every so often along the outer wall every so often you see these gates embedded in the wall housing a massive emblem of a crescent moon flanked by two trees over a deep cerulean stone about two feet across twins you know these as the threshold crests these are the enchanted crests that enable the city to travel back and forth between the feywild should it be necessary they're powerful and they're rarely utilized as the journey is not always accurate it seemingly did so this time make a perception check guys everybody who's paying attention just past marsh into flatland 20 okay you guys continue towards the front of the gate there's nobody on the outside of it it's a solid outside city you can see white and gray tower spires that streak up from inside some of which are entwined by trees that wrap around the base and cluster around the center of the tower's height like its own canopy belt if you will as you get even closer still you can see the white walls themselves are replaced with heavy gold and brass gold-leaf edging across the top and at each one of the various nooks where the solid stone walls are adjoined this is a very intricately carved and well-crafted wall probably as part of the enchantment that was placed on it amongst others to keep it defended you get about a hundred feet from the wall before you vex hear (scrape) a quick sound you leap back instinctually as all of you watch a series of bolts and arrows (arrow impacts) across the floor right in front of you you all stop in place you can now see up on the wall dozens of figures atop with longbows and some with crossbows drawn and nocked trained on all of you there's a pause and they're still 100 feet away from you one of the voices says who is us if i might ask there's a little bit of a conversation you see a couple of figures disappear behind the wall about five minutes pass and as you guys get a little fidgety or one of you makes a swift movement you can see the drawn bows tense up they're trained on any movement you guys give at this moment as time passes an individual steps up to the top of the wall adorned in similar syngorian armor but the helmet is taken off and you see a woman with deep crimson hair braided to one side and shaved on the other she steps up and looks out vex'ahlia vax'ildan the vessar twins return do i know why what is your business here in syngorn and the rest of your company make a persuasion check both of you come forth to the gate relieve your arrows please the guards all take their bows off of you and release the tension in the strings the woman turns and steps off the wall again you can see the very front gate the front of the wall opens ever so slightly about a five-foot gap left as you guys walk single file continuing towards the city your satyr friend stays in the very back behind you clutching (whimpering) as you glance back grog he's not there still tugging he's holding on to you but has lost visibility as you guys approach there waiting at the side of the gate within are about ten guards and this individual she looks a little more battle-hardened and wasn't elevated before was just one of the guards when you were children but this is iova now watcher iova the watchers which guard the wall she appears to be of an elevated status within the watchers of syngorn as you approach she lowers her head in a respectful bow but still not breaking eye contact and has an aloof and distanced expression time has passed since you were finding your own path surprised to see you return here especially so far from the material realms is your father aware of your arrival he is now you and your guests will be watched you will be followed until otherwise given proof and permission from individuals higher than my station within the city preferably your father now go and welcome to syngorn she turns around puts her helmet on and half the guard walk away while another six remain behind keeping watch as the rest of you approach and find your way within the city walls you're met with an astounding cityscape hundreds of homes and buildings and sanctuaries formed with a natural grace and keen architectural mind as to seem almost grown from the trees and earth themselves upon closer look and a nearby inspection you can see the craftsmanship but from a distance it's almost like they were born from the materials than they were built or crafted you can see distant magical lantern light shines all across the city like the start of a glittering snowfall as the rest of the streets themselves are ever lit by these little shining beacons the center of the ageless place is divided by a grand lake of pure blue water a roiling mist drifting across the surface obscuring the view of boats currently on the surface of the water you do notice a large military presence within the city as the armored guard of syngorn these individuals the armored military force known as the verdant guard are walking throughout the city not with a hurried pace but there is a general tension in the air far more than you've ever seen in all the years that you did spend in your youth within syngorn that's where we'll finish our session for the evening it's 1030 though as i look down and once again notice my tick spoons shirt i've had on the entire evening my overshirt seems to have been shortening it to-- or even better-- spoon it's intended to be it all works fine both ways it's the new scanlan shirt poon and poo scanlan shorthalt autobiography well great guys thank you so much we'll be picking up the next length of this journey in the reunion of vex and vax with their father syldor vessar and you did notice that they were referred to as the vessar twins whether they use the name that's up to them and i don't think that they do but that it is all right folks we'll see you guys some of you live at the-- well we'll see you all live next week but some of you we'll see at the actual venue in person you guys are awesome that's okay ashley i'm glad you could join us
