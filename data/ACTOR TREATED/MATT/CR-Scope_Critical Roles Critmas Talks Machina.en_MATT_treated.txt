older than you and i hope you'll get some joy from this oldtimer's first dice thank you for making my hobby so loved from david carter who has-- oh legit original when you had to fill the numbers by scratching in the crayon dice let me tell you these have seen some rolling because when these first came out of the box they were jagged as shit they were pointed and could take out your flesh that is

generosity that this community continuously perpetuates and helps support each other with and us we have the pleasure of being able to do this every week and have people care that aren't just us and that's really cool we constantly get letters and emails from a lot of people in this community saying how much this means to them and i want to reiterate on that part we're so glad because it means so much to us and it means so much that other people care about it as much as we do-- and i'm partially rambling now but i'm really humbled and touched and proud proud of everything that you guys have done we're such a small part of this now this is so much bigger than anything we ever did or now do on this show and that's what you guys continue to carry and make your own adventures your own heroes

extremely grateful and thankful and humbled by all of what you guys continue to put out there and thank you thank you from the bottom of my heart and our hearts are we going to cry forever i was
