your game okay let's play some d&d (laughter) hello and welcome back (laughter) welcome back everybody (laughter) banyan it's a bangin' tree just want you to know of all the trees i've seen it's pretty bangin' after investigating the scene and trying to pick up details about what had transpired you found a number of bodies that had been put up left to bloat and die as a warning for those who had made their way in on the inside it looks like the interior of the safe house had been cleaned out and summarily dragged through a subterranean tunnel following this tunnel down below you found strange twisted-looking merfolk called merrow that seemed to have been living in these partially submerged tunnels this system beneath the swamp you engaged in battle killed a number of them and upon sifting through some of the remnants of what was dragged out of the safe house you discovered cali's quarry which was a bowl that could speak to the scaled tyrant tiamat you decided what to do and after a brief confrontation the bowl was handed over to yasha who attempted to sunder it using her magician’s judge which succeeded the item was left shattered into pieces cali with her quest complete and not wishing to put herself into any further danger decided to leave bidding you all adieu and clambered back up through the strange dug tunnel that leads to the surface you guys were left to think about what the next course of action was before fjord made a brief swimming excursion into one of the far-off tunnels that led to a larger chamber and a base of operations where more of these merrow live from the outskirts of what you could see more remnants of what was taken from the safe house existed further in mighty nein you've seen cali clamber off you guys have taken down from the heat of the moment what do you wish to do kiri pipes up (like jester) bird-eye fjord (like jester) bird-eye fjord (like fjord) sticking okay as you guys are making your way up and climbing using the roots and the rope and the interior you begin to now that you're not focused on what’s below notice that a lot of the earth in this particular tunnel-- that isn't too wide necessarily it's about three feet wide in most places-- you can see the claw marks where it's been dug out the softer portion of the ground where you landed upon emerging from making your way down you can see a lot of the earth and chunks of root that have been carved out it wasn't a natural tunnel or something they discovered they dug up into the safe house to retrieve whatever was inside nevertheless you all make your way up into the hollow base of the safe house tree you guys can set up camp if you'd like to (like jester) mimicking things (like jester) long time (like jester) i am kiri (like jester) yes i'm very sweet (like jester) go fuck yourself (like jester) go fuck yourself (air horn blaring) at this point it's probably just past dusk there's a little bit of blue cresting into night time light's coming through the trees but it looks like you're about half an hour out from a pitch black sky okay make an arcana check okay assessing its design paying attention to its construct and the handles and the edging of where the different facets of it are affixed to this cage-like exterior to it you really have no idea what material it's made from the faint magical essence that comes off of it and with the training you have had across the various schools of magic this seems hard to pin down you're not sure the source of its magic but it does seem very old it seems like it's been shaped or it's been polished from whatever its raw form was at one point in time okay yeah using it as a pillow all right the rest of you find yourselves to sleep or is there anything else you wish to do before the night’s done any order of taking watch or are you all just resting under the protection of caleb's silver thread okay we'll say that was for your first watch while you guys are having that conversation one of you roll with advantage on your perception check or you can both roll separately your call oh leave him hanging that's true good in-character moment there as you guys are finishing your conversation your watch comes to an end without incident you rest so easily with the blood leaking out you finish your watch you wake up nott and jester and you guys take on your second watch do you want to both make a roll for perception or-- okay worked out great last time okay while you guys are taking some time concentrating on listening out for anything and feeling pretty solid in your ability to maintain vigil across this dark eerie night in the center of this hollow tree you don't hear or see a goddamned thing but a little twinkle hits your ears caleb as suddenly something down below by the pool on the opposite end of that kidney-shaped interior cavern seems to go off yes you come to consciousness they are awake she's all curled up in the corner like (trilling) with her feathers all poofed up okay roll a stealth check for frumpkin cats can do some pretty crazy shit okay frumpkin drops down onto the soft and makes it around focusing on it you can see that another merrow has emerged into that chamber and-- nope goes around and sees the bodies there lying in the middle of the space he (growls) he goes and drags him back a little bit begins rifling through whatever it might have had and looks over right at frumpkin grabs the trident spear and throws it you weren't close enough to do that i don't think 100 feet to snap him back or is it shorter than that double-check on that real fast as an action you can temporarily dismiss your familiar it doesn't say range you can cause it to reappear within 30 feet of you that's what i forgot so you can do that the last thing you see briefly before frumpkin vanishes is this three-pronged trident rocking through the darkness with what faint little bit of visibility that frumpkin has not even being able to see much down there in the darkness before disappearing (chirping) (like jester) go fuck yourself holding your action if it comes back around the spell is either fizzled or released so you can wait for something and then cast the spell as an action if you ended up holding it for a few minutes yes because the idea is that you're casting the spell and then holding onto that last piece of the incantation no you pulled the rope up you guys take a moment in silence two minutes pass three minutes pass then you hear this ever-so-faint grinding of root on scale this merrow sentinel slides slithering like a snake out of the curtain of roots that currently cover that one portion of the wall that leads further beneath the safe house all of you guys take a surprise round as soon as it emerges to go ahead and inspect it's like huh yeah it emerged and jack-in-the-boxed out towards you that is a four nope ten radiant damage good to know oh buddy (whoosh) nothing for the purpose of it all happening at once just one attack two strikes it's whatever your attack action is misses both miss unfortunately because you guys don't have any light in here when it emerges you're all swinging in the darkness hoping to hit it in the direction of where it is you would be yes is this magic missile that misses all right both hit roll damage all righty on your first attack they are considered monstrosities so consider that for any damage you deal to them with your sword you're not raging so you don't have the plus two nor do you have your-- correct because you're not raging that's enough even with all of your misses you watch as it emerges and then (multiple impacts) and slumps yeah as you grab it it starts sliding back into the tunnel you grab and lift him-- he's heavy as shit-- and you all together manage to slip it into and onto the floor fair enough what little bit of light you have in the chamber right now is a little faint radiant glow from the sword that molly currently has that is like candlelight if anything frumpkin emerges you send frumpkin back down make a stealth check for frumpkin the loudest cat you've ever heard frumpkin is the neighborhood cat in heat at this point he makes his way down through the tunnel make a perception check with disadvantage for frumpkin because he’s now coming around the edge would it cancel out i would ask you to keep the stats of your cat on you for future reference they have advantage on wisdom perception checks that rely on smell i'd say sure yeah it'll cancel out so a straight roll okay frumpkin heads on down keeps an eye out on that space does a little pass no sign of any other emerging or present merrow slowly lowering the rope back down the tunnel which one of you is taking point on climbing down you make your way down the rope aiding you in the process you get to the bottom you as well i'd like you both to roll stealth checks please as you emerge in the lower cavern you two gingerly step your way around the edge back to the site you can see of the three corpses of the merrow there in the center of the opposite side of the cavern as you make your way around to the other pool you can see the water disturbed relatively recently isn't perfectly still but it's nearing there it's coming to rest no sign of anything down there five minutes go by yasha you begin to drag the bodies back into the central pool they sink all right you complete the latter half of it okay you finish the spell you sense the arcane unseen net of the alarm click in and it's prepared and set to keep watch you guys make your way back climb back up the rope and make your way into the interior of the tree seemingly without incident yasha takes final watch go ahead and roll a perception check for me both of you guys make perception checks for me please as you guys complete the third watch for the evening you sense the morning come as the temperature which previously had gotten quite chilled is beginning to rise a bit though now you can still see your breath in the air a faint bit of bluish light begins to appear at the outer edges of the driftwood piece that is wedged in the doorway to make it look flush with the rest of the exterior bark you all complete a long rest you have your abilities back your hit points full and you are ready to continue sure okay in the early dawn hours of the new day as the blue begins to slowly become brighter in the distance-- i would like you to roll a dexterity check please take advantage because he's not moving maybe it's the tensile strength of her arm muscles but such a large instrument seems unexpectedly delicate across the features of your face it's not a complete shave there are areas that get missed because it's not a very fine implement but for the most part the stubble gets closer to your face there are a few sections that are unevenly smooth but it's an improvement from where it was before it's as good a shave you can get with a greatsword manages to avoid nicking any major arteries and as you complete your work you're proud of it the sweat on your brow-- caleb has no idea of how it looks other than you reaching up and touching your chin as it finishes the rest of you come to consciousness (chirping) pulls the knife out (like fjord) it's an amphibious assault (like jester) yes i'm very sweet all right so pass without a trace it's true pass without a trace what's the range on that so you may want to go next you may want to go next then if you want that to affect other people okay you for the moment wade into it and (burbling) you guys watch as fjord once again disappears beneath the surface of the water now with the confidence of knowing that there is a breaking point and air ahead that fear doesn't creep up into your brain and you rush for it making your way through make an athletics check 12 okay you manage to find it through and then come up quietly just-- yeah apocalypse now and/or the descent you slowly emerge from the water yeah glancing up your range of darkvision is 30 feet or 60 feet 60 feet okay racial features it should say 60 feet great that gives you enough perspective for now as you come up and look you can see this chamber and you got a brief glance at it before most of it is natural rock but there are elements of it that look like it was once an old bit of mason architecture you can see edges where there are actual stones stacked and placed walls that have seemingly been partially reclaimed through the ages you can see two large central pillars where stalagmite and stalactite met eventually and created a structure in the center a large portion of the floor is submerged in water and you see different paths and avenues of it that curve off and vanish probably openings to other tunnels beneath the pool you're in right there looking up you can see there's that weird set of natural stairs that step up in front you can see four of these merrow creatures two of which are in a conversation off to the left two that are currently rummaging through what looks to be piles of things that have been pulled up and placed toward the top of the stair you can hear the clinking of metal and things falling and tumbling down the stairs you see a fifth figure that's at the outskirts of your visual range that's currently faced away and looking at whatever's on the other side of that upward pillar but nobody else seems to have noticed you emerging at this point you haven't made any shifting or movement it's possible if they were looking carefully for you you don't know how far their darkvision extends looking around you can see there are small mounds of various minerals that have long dripped from the ceiling from condensation and various water flows that have come through this interior cavern and built this hard rocky platform that's emerging just outside of where the pool ends so you can bring the rope around and affix it to that make a stealth check as you do so please he is yes that's a natural one you lucky son of a bitch through whatever grace your patron has granted upon you-- the merrow are too distracted with whatever they are in the process of doing to notice you slip and hit an elbow send a pebble falling you get low and finish tying it off they don't notice no it seems pretty solid easy enough so after a few moments fjord emerges back where you guys are waiting your swim speed is half your movement 15 feet oh right with that it is yes from where you are to the-- make a survival check 13 best you could estimate it's close to 40 or so feet he's back coming back on the rope it's a lot easier your first dive down took a while to feel your way through (chirping) kiri leans into you this means we are friends she woke up early okay all right you're casting pass without a trace first all right you finish casting the spell the shadows already super dark in here with almost no light source beyond what caleb's providing they coalesce around you and the rest of the members of the team as you all dive into the pool of water it's black to caleb okay blessing of the trickster on you that's advantage on your stealth checks i need everybody including fjord to roll a stealth check please plus ten to your stealth score they rolled really high that's some vax numbers right there you guys all quickly emerge from the water below your eyes focusing there is no light source in this chamber so for those of you-- you have your darkvision on you guys all have darkvision i am pretty sure except for you caleb so you're relying on the rest of them to give any sort of presence-- yeah so i would need you guys to place yourselves amongst this pool kiri and nott exist on the outskirts as you guys glance up the first thing you see is there is one merrow right there who's currently talking and discussing with one right here place yourselves where you want to be there's one at the base of this right there up at the top facing away is the one that you had seen at the top of the stairs fjord as you guys all emerge headfirst from the water everybody gets a surprise round except for yasha and molly unfortunately you two did not roll high enough to beat the stealth they rolled pretty high everyone roll initiative but you guys will be out of this round 25 to 20 i know 20 to 15 15 to ten ten to five okay hold on nott you're not engaging just for the sake of it wow guys that's still better than fjord you all emerge from it yasha you would be first but your stealth you did not surprise the individuals from this round point he doesn't notice you guys that's a seven beau you're up first now that you're getting a better view of this you can see a low mist is pouring down the stairs and is filling the space around them all of this is water yeah (counting) easy enough you get right to him you'll splash in the water you won't make it all the way to the opposite side or you may but he'll get an attack of opportunity on you as you dart out of his melee range actually if you wanted to jump across i will say because he’s surprised and he isn't aware that you're there quite yet if you want to leap across make an acrobatics check if you still wanted to try and do so you will land in the water you'll be about waist-high in the water if not more correct 20 hits first one hits nope 24 hits roll damage for that fourth attack natural 17 it resists the stun i'm sorry but it's doing damage to it as you slam into it again turns around it looks like it's surprised and reeling from the impact of it gills flaring angrily towards your face some spittle flies out of its growling mouth that finishes your turn beau jester you're up right here or this side floating in the air oh snap all right go make your attack roll nope swings wide however it has apparated and is useful in future rounds that is a natural three seven points of necrotic damage to him got it not too bad that finish your turn jester you're going to stay where you are that finishes your go caleb you're up how big is the cube wait you mean from you possibly you would for you molly that's to signify your haste keep that in mind you're still in the water thrashing trying to make your way to the edge molly you're up but you lose this round because you were not part of the surprise you were lagging a little behind as yasha-- best way i can do this quickly because they're losing their turn as well that brings us to-- nott isn't even paying attention fjord on the edge there no you can go into the water if you want to go further you want to get up to him you can get melee range you're in the water and you're swimming in the water but because of your armor it doesn't reduce your attacks so you're not taking disadvantage on your attack rolls fjord take your one attack 14 hits it is 18 points of damage on that guy if he moves at all on his next turn he takes an additional 2d8 good to know this guy there he's been hexed does that finish your turn as you pull back the energy sparks around and there's this weird movement in the water like it's thrashing the booming energy keeping that one merrow locked in place as the other one the hex coalesces around its chest and holds it wisdom checks got it that ends top of the round now yasha you can take your turn the ambush round is over 18 hits nice you rush up next to beau cleave down with the blade it carves through part of its torso and it retracts and tries to pull itself lower in the water to make itself harder to hit what are you going to do you have a second attack right go for it eight misses unfortunately next one swings and a miss now the merrow all go together because you guys left a big old gap of initiative there correct first part i'm going to say-- let's make it fun this guy here is going to take his trident and chuck it right towards beau they have the cords still attached that's a 17 to hit there you go with that to there first off beau as it strikes you in the chest you take ten points of piercing damage and i need you to make a strength check for me please a strength check it was a 14 you get pulled through right next to it there in the middle of the water as you fall to the ground it's going to attempt to bite at you since you're in the water outside of your terrain i will give it advantage on the strike because you're now thrashing water and swimming and it's in its own terrain that'll be 18 to hit with the bite on you there you take an additional eight points of piercing damage at that moment this one here is going to turn around onto fjord and is going to shift this way and unleash both bite and claw attack against you fjord 17 to hit for that claw attack it's going to be 2d4 seven points of piercing damage against you fjord it's going to pull back after it finishes clawing into you it's going to try and bite down with its jaws that's a 19 to hit you take another seven points of piercing damage the one behind there who sees its friend digging into fjord's torso and body watches as it finishes its round of strikes and then under-handed throws its harpoon towards him that's another 18 to hit with that you take ten points of piercing damage i need you to make a strength check as it pierces you grab it and it manages to careen into the side of your hip and it hits bone you feel it grind against the inside with the pain you beat it rolled a 15 so you do not get pulled it does not give him his follow-up attack however he's going to move forward to get his follow-up attack anyway with the rest of his movement and is going to attempt to bite you and is going to miss that's a nine he goes to bite and as you pull the harpoon out and turn back your shield you bash the side of its face and it manages to pull back it scrapes across its fish-like face but no impact or damage all right that's going to finish his go the one that is right next to you yasha is going to shift around not leaving combat with you but going behind the pillar to give itself some cover from anybody who's out in the vicinity it's going to attempt to make two strikes against you yes you do three yep roll higher than a ten constitution saving throw 15 works all righty that's good on your end for you yasha you didn't use reckless last turn right that's a natural 20 on that first strike with the claws at you that is going to be 14 points of piercing damage reduced to half so you only take seven because you're raging and the bite attack against you is a natural two plus six no that misses you with an eight however that finishes their round and this guy up here who now spins around and sees the rest of you come inside begins shouting out in a language you don't understand (snarling) as it's holding up this staff that has this almost crystal spike of natural crystal at the end of it it begins to chant something under its breath and as it spins its hand in the air you watch as the ceiling above you in this chamber begins to grow into this low cloud that spirals out encompassing the entirety of the interior of the chamber you see little sparks of lightning arcing through the cloud as it spools above beau i need you to make a dexterity saving throw since you're the one closest to it correct you suffer 16 points of lightning damage as you get struck by lightning in the water which you watch as technically now yeah if any of you are in the water when the lightning hits you you have disadvantage on your saving throw because you are in the water didn't matter this time because you failed anyway but you watch as the bolt strikes beau and she starts thrashing in the water as the muscles tense there's a giant burn mark on the side of your head looking pretty rough on that one and it's going to go ahead and spin itself over to the edge this way using the one below getting itself between the rest of its merrow compatriots and you guys that finishes their turn beau you're up go for it if you want to move around to get onto land otherwise you're going to be having a hard time in the water here attacking them because you're constantly swimming you still have movement yeah so you can move five ten 15 20 25 there so you manage to whip around get out up onto land and not end up with a disadvantage on your attacks 15 does hit yes 12 does not hit unfortunately but the first strike as you pull up cracks it right in the jaw the next one it manages to bash your arm out of the way and it deflects off the side-- no impact all righty the first strike okay so as you get up on land you focus and looking around side-to-side make sure that you're aware of everything around you and get ready to defend and deflect okay that finishes beau's turn jester you're up go ahead and roll the attack for that guy okay all right what was the number 15 is its armor class so yeah that's fine well 13 actually so that definitely hits seven points plus your wisdom modifier there you go 11 points of damage to him all right how do you want to do this (cheering) yasha as you're engaged with it both growling at each other you watch as suddenly its body crumples into the stonework it slips into the water and vanishes beneath the waves so that's your bonus action you still have your movement and action right there all righty cure wounds is touch so you have to be right next to him okay what's the range on that caleb you're up next so be ready right now none there is no light 60 feet all right yeah so you can do it from there if you want natural 20 travis and no that's disadvantage on wisdom checks not wisdom saving throws hex doesn't affect saving throws yeah but for instance if you had said strength checks then every time it tries to pull somebody it would have disadvantage on that but now you know going forward with hex going to stay where you are all right that finishes jester's turn caleb you're up the one that's attacking beau or the one at the very top all right go for it disadvantage on all the attacks 15 just barely hits 14 misses so one of them hits the two other ones careen off and you watch as they streak out into the darkness past this merrow what looks to be a priest-like entity up there that's commanding the storm exploding on the rocks behind it one hitting this piece of long-lingering temple-like interior and one finally strikes it in the chest go ahead and roll damage on that one it does make a concentration check natural 17 plus two it does succeed in maintaining concentration that's your turn caleb's done molly you're up the other one or do you still have the one activated from before which one here okay that will put you right there so you rush up to the edge there you used your bonus action you have your two attacks and your hasted attack so two attacks go ahead and roll damage on that eight points of damage nice all righty you're using the d6's for your-- cool so as you rush up you swing the scimitars in this blast of speed two of them manage to strike true to its body cutting out a piece of it it's looking pretty hurt now starting to bleed out where the wounds are hit but it's growling in your face as it spins around its fins curl up from the side and you can smell this awful swampy almost sulfurous smell from its breath in your face is that your turn all right that brings us to nott who is waiting patiently with kiri is that your turn that brings us to fjord okay and blink is not concentration correct yes all right so with that fjord vanishes from the battlefield we'll use this as a spatial positioning device of where you were before that ends fjord's turn that brings it to the top of the round yasha you're up fjord vanished you see two now turning their eyes towards mollymauk who's right there there's one across the way that's currently barrelling on beau and there's the one at the top of the stairs right now that looks like it's commanding a giant storm over here so that's five ten 15 20 25 35 you're in the water swimming so your attacks are at disadvantage right now if you wanted to do reckless you could counteract that but you'll be taking-- wait so that was disadvantage got you so the first attack was what that hits so your first attack hits go ahead and roll damage on that 19 points of damage nice all right and you have your second attack with disadvantage 15 hits go ahead and roll damage on that this is-- you only do five additional damage on this one right so 15 damn nice roll as you in the water cleave out once with the blade in this giant splash arc of water from the middle of the pool in the center it carves across the side of its back (snarling) it turns around towards you right as you bring the second strike up into its abdomen it pushes off the blade and it looks pretty hurt it's bleeding out of its wounds in the middle of its stomach and its back that finishes your turn that ends your turn it's their turn so i will need you first off to make a dexterity saving throw as you come up and carve into the back of it the one on top hisses and directs its finger down towards you as a bolt of lightning arcs out of the-- yeah saving throw plus that does not succeed you're in the water so it would be disadvantage anyway that is 25 points of lightning damage which is not halved on you because the rage doesn't affect it it only affects slashing piercing and bludgeoning so you're blasted in the middle of the water you sink for a moment as your muscles give out your sword almost falls out of your grasp and you manage to right yourself as you're treading water here your feet can't touch the bottom of this pool and your eyes go flashing white for a second and for an instant you see the face of kord the stormlord there from the vision your recently had then clarify and shake it out of your head and carry yourself back into place that's going to finish this guy who's going to move around he can only move ten feet so he goes five ten he's going to stop right there this guy right here is going to go ahead towards you beau as you're right there he has disadvantage on the attacks against you though he’s going to go ahead and make its claw attack against you with disadvantage that's cocked you saved yourself from a natural 20 with that one it's a 16 which i believe misses right so as it claws toward you you being prepared for it dart off to the side it's going to go ahead and take a bite at you with disadvantage another natural 20 averted however that does come to a 19 so i believe that does hit you that is 11 points of piercing damage as it bites down onto the front of your clavicle and face beau falls to the ground as she sinks from its jaw under the rock there it spins around towards you right in your face its gills flaring up that's going to end its turn the two over here this one's going to move there and they're both going to flank molly they are both going to harpoon you-- jam melee at the one on this side first attack is going to be an 18 to hit what's your armor class plus two because of the haste oh buddy that does hit you so the first harpoon strike against you-- that's eight plus four 12 points of piercing damage it jams you into the abdomen from that side the other strike-- this guy's finishing his round he's attempting to bite you that's going to be a 15 as he bites down towards you this time as you pull the trident out you jam it up and it throws him off and clips him in the side of the chin breaking off one of his teeth at that moment the guy behind you is going to swing in with his harpoon as well okay reaction to that that's cocked so he has a regular strike on this one so the attack with the harpoon is going to be a 21 to hit unfortunately well he had advantage because he had you flanked so it just made it a general roll so that is going to be ten points of piercing damage as the other harpoon jams you in the back as you're arcing upward it's going to attempt to bite down at you but its eyes have gone dark and it's just biting wild in front using the thrashing of your body to guide itself that is going to be a natural seven plus six 13 misses so it bites down you manage to duck out of the way and slam the hilt of your scimitar up into its face and knock it off to the side that's going to end their go that brings us to beau i need you to make a death saving throw please that's one success mark it on your tattoo jester you're up it's a 30-foot range right so it'd be right there she's gliding on the water tiptoe 11 points to beau you come back to consciousness on the ground your body was just starting to roll and slip into the water you catch one of the rocks and keep yourself from going back into the drink well your action was to-- right that's correct that finishes your go there caleb you're up over here you can get partway into the water possibly he's here that's (counting) 30 so most likely (counting) just outside of 30 for the range looking at that i believe the level is level three or lower it's a 3rd-level spell the storm immediately with one final crackle fades and dissipates above the cavern above now just the empty dark roof it was before the storm no longer present that ends caleb's turn molly you're up 11 does not hit you have three more attacks with your bonus action if you want to 24 hits roll damage on that nine points of damage all righty barely 23 hits that'll do it how do you want to do this a whirling dervish of blades as you carve through you start biting through with the blades carves one part of its chest part of its arm down on its chest looks up and right through its face go for it that finishes molly's turn nott (like jester) wrapped around his weenie okay you cannot see kiri just vanishes amongst the visuals of the illusion all right finishing nott's turn fjord where do you want to emerge well technically that was the other guy yeah they shifted around they did if you'd like to-- fucking stay if you want to you can appear up top there and get a flanking bonus you can use it against them they can use it against you as long as you are directly across from an enemy with an ally you can give yourself flanking benefit on this one okay there you go go for it flanking it's advantage on your attacks 15 does hit that hits roll damage for each how do you want to do this you fucked that guy up molly it’s pulling back ready to leap at you and as it lurches towards you it stops you watch as the upper half of its shoulders and head slip and slough off into the water you vanish out of the space that's a hell of a round yasha you're up right now no beau is not threatening you have to be on the opposite sides yep because you're in the water 13 just hits nice it's hanging on by a thread yeah that'll do it how do you want to do this so one-handed wide swing with the same motion you reach up right into the wound tear it through and maintain eye contact as it tumbles over into the water and disappears beneath the surface that ends your turn you still have your movement you're right next to beau on the ground you got out of the water all right ends your turn there's a sound in the nearby water as emerging from one of the other caverns on the side another merrow emerges from that side and another emerges from this side the one up top here that sees everyone closing in is going to back up into the water and is going to cast call lightning again it wants to bring it about use the other level three spell slot with that as the cloud forms up in the sky again seeing you step out of the water you do not have disadvantage on the saving throw but i need you to make another dexterity saving throw it is a 13 dc so you only take half damage which is good because that would be 24 damage so you take 12 points of lightning damage yes 12 points of lightning damage he's going to dive into the water you know where he disappeared beneath the surface as you see the water rippling out but you're not sure where he is or how deep he is these two have emerged this one's going to move through the water to there and is going to make a harpoon-- let's move over a bit further because it can to about there it's going to make a harpoon strike towards you yasha throwing it in your direction that's a 20 to hit all right you take-- that's a bad roll eight points of piercing damage reduced to half so you take four points of piercing damage i need you to make a strength check so roll a d20 and add your strength modifier as it's attempting to yank and pull you towards him you have advantage on your strength checks because you're raging he pulled a 13 natural nine plus four you get yanked beau you watch as yasha gets yanked over you as you're lying on the ground and it's going to attempt to bite you as you're down in the water once more natural 19 that's 25 to hit so with that the bite attack let's roll damage on that that is going to be ten points of piercing damage reduced to five 'cause you're raging this guy here is going to go ahead and move up right next to caleb rushing out of the water from underneath with the harpoon in its arms and jam it towards your torso that's going to be a 15 to hit all right you watch as it deflects off of your body it's going to angrily attempt to bite down on you that's a natural 17 plus six as it attempts to bite down towards you there's a brief moment where the bite sinks into your shoulder and there's a brief burst where time seems to dart back and you step out of the way as its bite hits air with no effect all right that ends their turn now it is beau it's half your movement to get up so you have 20 movement wouldn't she though you can certainly try you should do you want to try all right so five ten 15 and then go ahead and make an athletics check to make the leap i'm letting you see if you can make it across the water without losing your movement 15 yeah (counting) you're just outside of it to be within melee (counting) actually 35 40 you can do it with just one if you're there so you manage to spin around using your bonus action for step of the wind so you still have your action 18 points of damage on that one damn nice ten misses however the critical did-- as you run up from the side you parkour off the wall the side of the pillar there leap whack slam it with the staff you see its head get pushed underwater again it turns around its eyes are adjusting like yours were a moment ago and as you go to swing a second time it does manage to deflect it with the side of its trident no impact all right that finishes beau's turn jester you're up caleb you're on deck at the moment this one's been hurt this one has not been and this one is not visible it is beneath the surface of the water okay so go ahead and roll a melee spell attack on it if you want to move here you can flank it all righty so you're opposite of beau using that flank maneuver so don't forget you guys can flank on direct opposites they can also flank against you oh natural one and a natural four so as you swing out with your hand your foot catches the edge of one of the pebbles and you stumble for a second and your hand goes wide off to the side hits some of the stone on the wall behind you and releases the spell's impact against lifeless wall unfortunately no that's pathfinder rules that it can do no not technically a creature all right so 2d8 plus four 11 points of damage crack the giant lollipop swings and hits the side of the jaw it dislodges for a second then for a moment it's trying to hold the trident with one hand and the other's trying to push it back into place (laughs) awesome that finishes your go caleb you're up all righty nope nope you get scared in the moment because you're still thrashing in the water and you put the hand up and go (effort sound fizzle) you were aiming six feet from it it goes up like a firework and hits the roof that ends caleb's go molly you're up you have 60 feet of movement are you running through the water or going to make a leap across (counting) if you want to flank you'll be in the water which is disadvantage on your attacks it's a straight roll if you stay there or a straight roll if you end up flanking it yes so make your four attacks on it if you want okay yeah that'll do yep just roll the dice 11 points of damage and then your third strike with your haste all right so that hits on the third strike there ooh 31 points of damage in one round as you're carving through it rapidly it is looking pretty hurt it's not on death's door but you singlehandedly carved it pretty hard in one round you already used your bonus action all right that ends molly's go nott that's amazing okay fjord you're up as you reapparate within ten feet of where you were-- just remembering why did you drop hex again it was because you cast-- all righty so first strike was 18 that hits 12 points of damage nice that works seven points of damage that'll do it how do you want to do this (cheering) both (impacts) on its side you watch as one of its arms gets blown off and flings landing on the top of the stairs before rolling down a few steps and coming to rest it slips down into the water yasha you take one swipe at it for good measure as it sinks below all right and roll your d20 to see whether you stay or go yasha you're up right now you're in the water so with full speed you're probably not going to get to it unless you take an action to dash you have 30 feet of movement there's the guy who's underwater over here somewhere and there's the guy that's currently assaulted by most of your team on the other side (counting) there okay so you reach down and touch the front of your chest-- oh shit so that ends your turn emerging from the water the water splashes up as it glances up on the other side that one merrow's right there have him surrounded is going to make one strike again towards caleb that is a 23 to hit okay that comes to 12 points of piercing damage i need you to make a constitution saving throw you can because it's attacking someone that's not you 12 i believe your constitution is 14 if i recall which brings a +2 to what you rolled yeah 14 failure haste wears off because you lose concentration when the spell ends the target can't move or take actions and to follow that up it's going to bite down towards caleb seeing that you're probably the easiest meat around here unarmored that's a natural 20 i'm having really good luck all right so with a bite attack against you that is 14 points of piercing damage to you caleb oh my god okay ending that turn the other one standing there emerges the storm in the sky it sees you standing up again and goes (growls) sounds like some horrible curse i need you to make a dexterity saving throw thank you taliesin a great gift i'm glad i've been able to use finally 18 okay so half damage we'll see what it rolls that is a nine a one and a three 13 points of damage lightning damage halved to six not even joking you can look at the dice i can't fucking believe that sam and you are a fucking warlock is what that is you know that but-- god damn it and is going to vanish once more beneath the surface of the water you don't know quite where it is that’s where you last saw it disappear that brings us to beau you have advantage on these because you're flanked currently with jester 14 hits him armor class of 13 18 hits roll damage for the second strike whack whack you hit both sides with the staff it's being knocked around spitting blood out of its mouth it's hurt it's hurt pretty bad make two more strikes against it marisha and 12 does not hit but one of them does seven points of damage how do you want to do this (cheering) whack right across his face the impact throws its head with such a speed down onto the rocks right at the bottom of jester's feet crack it slowly slides gurgling into the water sinking below jester you're up right there good to know finishing your turn jester caleb you're up you can just barely get onto land if you want okay okay you step back that ends your turn caleb as you're holding your action molly nott with your movement you get most of the way across on the rope but you can bonus action to dash with that nott just barely emerges from the distant pool of water you don't see any monsters nott's splashing behind you perfect fjord whereabouts good to know roll your dice held actions and blink can be a really tricky thing it's like an ethereal-- like frodo with the ring on this is what ripley used on you guys last campaign that finishes fjord's turn yasha you're up hold your action in case something shows up that ends your turn that brings us the merrow shallow priest's turn as you're all focusing on this element a small ripple of water emerges over here as it has swum down below the water cat's paw what does it have to roll for it 16 strength does it get a saving throw you mean a strength saving throw that is an eight no it is currently restrained right go for it yeah it's gargantuan all right how much damage was that six total damage at which point it's holding its staff still and (hissing) spins its arm around a level two thunderwave bursts out in front of it in a 15-foot cube hitting both beau and caleb i need you both to make a constitution saving throw please no a constitution saving throw that is a success so you take half damage nope that is 17 points of thunder damage you take half of that so you take eight you're still up cat's paw's gone caleb's unconscious easy come easy go beau you are thrown ten feet back into the wall there as the smoke dissipates from the thunderwave wham into the wall and fall to one knee let's see no that's all of its movement it took all of its movement to get there so that's where it stands that's going to end its turn beau oh it has to make a constitution saving throw to see if it maintains the thunderstorm above which it succeeds go for it you're technically in the water so the attacks are at disadvantage 16 still hits ten damage got it all right that hits again second attack 12 damage two constitution saving throws that's a success and a success so it's still maintaining concentration on the lightning storm it swings wide it's laughing under its hissing breath as you're punching and it's starting to try and slowly submerge into the water that brings us to jester right here over here you mean (counting) that's where you are but you're in the water right now you're (splashing) yes you would go for it you have disadvantage you're flanking it so it's a straight attack yes you pull back (energy crackling) (fizzling) you reach up and right as you-- the dice are not with you i'm so sorry laura i'm so sorry as you reach out with this crackling bolt of looming necrotic energy it manages to spin around and a burst of wind immediately pushes your arm just off course and it releases harmlessly in the air i'm sorry all right roll for the attack on it you cast it at level two earlier though i'm so sorry no it was level two at the beginning i trust you guys sorry jester that finishes your turn caleb i need you to make a death saving throw please that's a failure first failed save on caleb make an athletics check no you go (splashing) (counting) 30 (counting) 20 you get up there combat range yes you can only use your bonus action to attack if you've used your action to attack that's what i'm thinking but i'll double check what the rules are there every now and then you need a reminder folks “when you take the attack action and attack with a light melee weapon that you're holding in one hand you can use a bonus action--” if you don't attack you cannot bonus action attack is it an action or a bonus action to use because you've used your action this turn i believe enthrall as a spell is an action vicious mockery i believe is also an action but you're in melee that ends your turn molly nott (counting) it's within 20 feet as you're running out of the water (screaming) (splashing) that hits roll damage with the additional burning bolt 24 points of damage it has to make a constitution saving throw to see if it maintains no it does not it drops the lightning yeah next attack that hits roll damage the shallow priest is looking hurt it's a merrow shallow priest does that finish your turn nott fjord ten feet right there taliesin and goes wide strikes a nearby rock 14 misses this one has higher armor than the rest as you release both bolts it's flailing around hurt after taking the impact from the bolts you can see the burst of flame on its back from the shot it took from nott and as it lurches forward it manages to arc out of the way of your bolt no impact roll to see if you stick around lag spikes are rough when you're on a raid guys top of the round yasha you're up right now no the space right there where technically it is-- i'll say you can get up on there sure using all your movement you can get on there it's a little wobbly no hold on beau was in the water this technically is not a space you can get on you would not be able to flank with it you can get there if you want to because this is in the space no because you have to be on the exact opposite that space is currently occupied by the stalagmite you're in the water so disadvantage on your attacks 18 hits nice 20 hits roll damage for your second strike 12 points of damage it is so close it is hurt so bad as you slash twice in the water you see these large arcs of stale stagnant cave water splashing in the air with this gleaming blade as yasha's tearing into it the pool around it is turning dark purple as its blood is seeping in and it's looking desperately around for some means of escape that end your turn yasha it's now the shallow priest's turn yeah that's what it's going to do level two thunderwave hmm it would have thrown you back into the wall there's nowhere more for you to push this way the placement here makes it a little hairy it's going to go ahead and-- it's a fifteen-foot cube in front of you and it's trying to-- yeah you guys are positioned in such a way where it-- well yeah but you can't be part of a cube and i'm trying to figure out what would be the most optimal way for it to use it i'm going to say-- no the ones who are hurt the most are beau and yasha and they've been the biggest problem for these guys it's not too worried about the other two 15-foot cube okay all right you know what it's going to go ahead and attempt to shift this way one square into the space with the spiritual weapon from yasha and from jester both of you guys make an attack with disadvantage for you yasha it's risky on its endeavor but it's what's going to give it an opportunity to try and get out of this lockdown what'd you roll okay 16 hits yeah regular attack 15 just hits yep it can't move so with sentinel it does not get a chance to move as you arc towards it how much damage did you do nine five how do you two want to do this (cheering) okay so as you swing with the handaxe and you swing with the sword as it backs away charging the energy of the thunderwave in its hands it tries to slink through the water the blade of your handaxe carves into its throat from this side (painful grunt) at which point the blade hits from this side (slurp) and like a terrible scene out of riki-oh because i have not used that reference in this campaign the body gets split in two sides and you watch as it falls to the ground in three separate pieces (thuds) all sinking beneath the water below yes you do caleb that's cocked okay right now at this point there is no threat yes you drop the spell okay go ahead and heal up for that the last slab of its flesh that you had carved from its head and shoulder area you push into the water kicking it forward so caleb you heal 12 hit points we'll say as you guys gather to go ahead and deal with the aftermath of this battle we're going to take a break (cheering) apologies for the humming of the motor from earlier this is the first time trying it out didn't really need it it was fine but yes so we'll be back here in a few minutes guys we'll see you in a little bit [break] hi everyone welcome back before we jump into the story real fast we wanted to say a quick hello from a friend of ours who stopped by the office and tonight's studio to say hello babs tarr the very extremely talented comic book artist for many different comic series incredibly talented and is very much a critter along with us and stopped in to say hi of course thanks for coming by where can they find you thank you babs picking up where we left off you guys rush to pull caleb off the ground you're all beaten battered-- laura eight points of healing no we need her for as long as we can keep her anyway your wounds close up a bit through the incantation you see remnants of crates and broken goods littered across the rough staircase now that you take a moment to inspect it make an investigation check if you want to glance about the space yes because you are drunk you find some broken pieces of pottery it seems like nice polished on one side with a nice glaze you can write down in your inventory broken pieces of shiny pottery fjord if you look at the trident it looks like it's a very tightly woven rope but the individual threads of rope are treated like a leather-type stat so it's a really tight leather cord from what you can see where it was dangling from there they’re wrapped in a loose loop around the side of their armor and when they throw it they catch the end of it and pull it back okay it's about 60 feet of leather cord if you want to call it that sturdy leather cord it's heavy so it's about twice the weight of hemp rope it's stronger but it's heavier yeah they're pretty strong if you guys want to take a short rest if you guys are inspecting the rest of the area jester as you come back into the next chamber you're looking around and there's no sign of kiri you see natural stone the pool a piece of wall to the side and there's no sign (like jester) i'm kiri you look around and you don't see anything (like jester) yes i'm very sweet (like jester) warmer you slowly start making your way towards this weird cylindrical stone wall that you now realize wasn't there before you reach through and your hand goes right into a tuft of feathers (startled chirping) kiri reaches up and grabs your hand and you pull her through the illusion she steps out and goes (like cali) i killed people kiri points to one of the bodies of the merrow that you had killed the night before that's barely visible out of the water there it looks like it has a couple stab wounds to it and kiri's like-- (chirping) (like jester) okay okay okay (like jester) “okay okay okay” make an investigation check jester as you spend a moment searching around in the middle of the dirt with no luck there's a little knock on your shoulder with a pointed finger you glance over and kiri has the book bundle the leather strap-- (chirping) points to the side corner if you want to start inspecting the area up the stairs there's a platform above where there's more of the boxes and crates and there's piles of things gathered around some sort of rock formation where that mist seems to be emanating from which is still loosely drifting off of the surface of the water okay make an investigation check 14 okay you can see scattered bits of gold and silver and copper that have been lost amongst the steps here some of them covered in dirt or mud and can be cleaned and pulled out of there as you ascend the steps if anybody wants to join fjord as well you go with him as well you also see there's a bunch of silverware thrown around very nice fine silverware that is in many cases partially packed with more mud sand and whatever grime is here it looks like everything was brought here and largely a number of it has been discarded or left with no particular purpose as you begin to pore through some of it you see there's a crate that's partially open there's a cache of weapons in there that are bound in clusters with leather straps around them looking there there are four well-made longswords four well-made shortswords two battleaxes and two halberds that are part of this cache they're resting open on the inside of this open crate there's a locked dark wood case about four feet across and a foot wide that is currently closed and latched there's also a locked iron box that's flat a foot and a half by a foot and a half it's simple steel iron look to it then there's the stone formation that's about six to ten foot at different places it's a bit oblong and strange it's not a perfect oval but it's made to be this pool of water where the mist is rising and sifting out of it around the edges of it there are dozens and dozens of metallic objects of different shapes and configurations and designs make a religion check you recognize a majority of the iconography here it looks like one of these bundles-- one of these boxes that was gathered here-- was filled with holy symbols and religious iconography most of which appear to be deities that are outlawed by the empire you see symbols and worship idols for the archeart you see some for avandra the changebringer you see a number of moonweaver holy symbols with the two crescent moons across the silver cross you see the hook and the wreath of the wildmother melora a number of those scattered about some in disrepair with actual pieces of dried barley and other grains around it you see a number of symbols of kord the stormlord you see a handful for the everlight there are a few more dubious symbols as well there's one that looks like a dark horned crown that you recognize that is used to invoke asmodeus the lord of the hells you see one that looks like-- you only see a few of these but it looks like a series of chains and shackles that are across a coffin-like box and you know that because you rolled super high to represent bane the strife emperor who is a deity of conquest there it is as well as the clawed hand on a number of items that resemble tiamat the scaled tyrant jester you return did you take kiri with you at this point you hear a distant sound that echoes through the wall (fluttering) you spin and look over and you can see jester emerging from the water and a little black bird that is currently fluttering to try to get the water off the feathers they're dry nott what were you looking at yeah there's two boxes okay as you focus there is a-- as you look over there is a faint magical aura from inside the pool where the mist is emanating and the long wooden box emanates a magical source from the inside you'd have to try and retrieve the body it sunk into the water the staffed one okay as you pull the staff over the staff does not have any magical properties it looked like it was just a focus for whatever spellcasting it was doing make an investigation check as you were going back to the body if you want you feel a magical presence within the pool not the pool itself but within and the mist is still pouring over the edges of it yeah the upper platform yes enchantment (exaggerated cockney accent) enchantment hi yuri make an investigation check as you pore through and find as many as you want to are you glancing through as well okay make an investigation check this is the pile of religious iconography 11 okay because-- all right you find-- and there's a number of these you see probably in total well over 100 to 120 various holy symbols idols small representations pressed into metal or clay these are all means of worship from a grand scale to a pauper scale that seem to have been part of what was moving through this smuggling path which you find two (gasps) no response make an investigation check yep you give a solid glance through and it looks like no ioun the knowing mistress is one of the approved religions and you get the sense that all the symbols that are here are religions that are unapproved by the empire or considered betrayer gods and are not approved anywhere oh plenty of moonweaver symbols there's probably a good 12 or 13 asmodeus (singing) asmodeus asmodeus go ahead and make your-- with disadvantage oh look at that even while drunk little nott's able to-- the latch spins off and a blade fires out from where the lock was shoots across the room and vanishes into the darkness before it scrapes off some stone in the distance it appears to be open there's a slight gap now where the lid is now open you lift it up looking inside you see this beautiful jewel-inlaid curved golden blade of some kind with what little bit of light that you guys have at your disposal now you can see it shining and it's this pure gold color as you swing it for a moment it seems to bend with the movement before flicking back into place it would constitute in the vein of a scimitar it's pretty well-balanced lighter than you'd expect and gold is not a good metal for any sort of combat it's a soft metal and you see the flexibility seems such but yet it'd probably hit pretty hard but you're a little worried about using gold for any sort of combat scenario swings pretty solid yes and you managed to find it you find probably about 6 or 7 different variations to the archeart's iconography marisha and you find one that's pretty similar to the one that you saw you pocket it a 13 to-- you find about four of them two of them are medallions and one of them looks like a ceramic marker that would be hung on a wall one of them looks like it was part of a latch on a small chest and was torn from it you see bits of rotted wood on the back of it where it may have been previously pressed in and bolted against the outside of a chest sure make an investigation check okay while you guys are having this conversation beau is casing the joint here there are no hidden exits in fact you get the sense that all the entrances and exits here are through the various pools of water you begin to think based on placement that there's probably a network of caverns here and possibly more merrow that exist in the vicinity of the lake of the ounterloch beyond here yes actually i can show you an image of it that is what you see it's like an upside-down coffin-like design with these chains that cross over yes it's roughly a little larger than your palm sure it sinks down and for a moment it obscures but you see this very faint yellowish color on the bottom it disappears into the pool sure you reach in and you scour around and your hand touches and finds the symbol next to it there's a polished stone about that big that's resting in the silt at the bottom okay you pull out the stone and as soon as the water emerges from it it's smooth it looks like a cat's eye it has a yellowish color to it and there are striations that refract light around it at one end it looks like there was-- an impact carved a line about three inches across on one side it has a very faint yellowish glow it's not a school of arcane magic okay symbol there she sets it down and rests it there next to the other symbol at an angle it doesn't look like it matches the sword the groove that's hewn into it what at first looked like it was impacted or wounded by some sort of damage upon closer look it looks intentionally placed or carved in so you have this cat's eye yellowish sphere with this three inch-wide pointed oval line in the front they're just well-made like freshly made and were being sent somewhere you cannot that's where you guys are standing right now that's where you've removed from the pool yes fjord something about that orb is very familiar okay so while you're doing that there is one more metal box that's not been opened make an investigation check with disadvantage because you are drunk okay seems fine all right disadvantage to try and open the lock thieves' tools so it's dexterity plus your proficiency bonus 17 that'll do it you needed a 16 the iron box opens nothing goes off no blades no traps on the inside you see a beautifully smithed sword handle and hilt made from silver with an acorn-sized emerald set on each side of the hilt right in the center the blade extends for an inch before it's broken off at a jagged angle there's an inch of the blade it seems to have broken off at some point right you did not sense any magic from this you attempt to cast mending on this strangely it resists it there's something about it even though it didn't emanate a magical essence from what he was requesting the mending spell for some reason is unable to grasp the nature of this object to complete it no magical essence from it but as you're looking over it beyond just the beautiful make of it you do see runes carved across the hilt and at the pommel it looks like at one point it was an enchanted blade but was sundered and is missing the rest i'm sorry what was that what was your question oh fits the-- no the carve in the sphere is about three inches long the blade looks like it would've been about two inches wide and it's broken off at a jagged side angle okay investigation check either both of you roll or one of you roll with advantage up to you 15 looking around you see no sign of any other half of the blade broken or not okay anybody else okay so you finish casting identify on-- all right the sword is not magical and so it does not give you any essence as to what enchantment it is looking at the runes you could see that there was once held magic-- oh the finished one sorry i misunderstood that yes i'm sorry that you do have immediate grasp of what it is capable of okay so you begin concentrating another ten minutes on the cat's eye you choose one object to cast on so wait another ten minutes sure as caleb's concentrating on it you reach out and touch the stone your body immediately goes cold your vision vanishes from your eyes as darkness fills your world your lids itch like some sand or dirt now scrapes the inside of the skin and you rub them with your wrist your eyes open to find yourself somewhere else the sky is moonlit and cloudless the starry night looking down at you your clothes are not your own nor is your body a thick brown leather overcoat lined in buckles wraps around your torso while sun-weathered human skin marks your flesh you notice your hands are dirty and thick with calluses as you clutch the very same yellow polished stone in your left hand looking down you see the body of the individual who was its previous owner now still in a pool of crimson dark you glance around the place some jungle-grown natural landmass by a pond the smell of seawater is strong on the wind in the middle of the night flash-- in your right hand grasps the familiar falchion water dripping from the blade a voice booms into your mind potential a sudden uncontrollable hunger overcomes you as you instinctually jam the stone into your gut it slowly sinks into your human flesh painlessly as it's being pushed into your torso consume as it quickly vanishes within your belly the hunger subsides as exhaustion takes over you fall to your knees and look within the water your reflection familiar but not your own vandrin reward just as quickly as the vision came in the blink of an eye it's gone your reflection now that of the familiar half-orc looking into the pool where the stone was found but the stone is gone the rest of you guys watched in the middle of this concentration while fjord touched the stone grabbed it and jammed it into his chest before all of you could even react and push forward it had already been thrust through his armor and into his body you reach over and try and grab him and with a strength you've never felt in his body he lurches towards the pond and thrusts it fully in seemingly under some sort of uncontrolled force his eyes glazed over and staring forward suddenly he comes back and as you glance around you feel tension on your body as all your friends are grabbing onto your body and pull you away from the pool it's gone exhausted you actually take a point of exhaustion there's no damage to the armor and as you pull back some of the leather plates there's no sign of a wound you don't feel any strange spheres in the inside of your abdomen don't spoil the surprise travis no nobody you'd seen before all you recall is seeing the orb and the same sword that you have in his hand no weirdly there's a strange aspect as you focus really hard to remember but the face that you saw in the water was definitely vandrin maybe a little younger than you remember him faintly less gray to his hair and facial hair the water is salt water the pool water is salt water all the rest of the water in this cavern is fresh yes yeah and you get-- make an intelligence check for me looking at this and looking at the way things are spread about you get the sense that something drew the merrow to the safe house they took whatever they found in the safe house below tore through it and placed whatever was important to them in this area make an investigation check it's roughly five to eight feet in diameter okay you look in the well the water is moving in there it's you (splashing water sputtering) salt water you start coughing for a minute and come up you are drowning you pull him out of the pool he starts coughing up the water as you're doing that you do get the sense that the longer you're here in a nexus between these numerous merrow tunnels the higher your chance gets of having more arriving you guys gather up as much as you can take your way via the rope through the water kiri in tow you make your way back up handing things off up into the tunnel eventually over the next hour or so get most of what was down there that you could back up into the safe house i mean they're all what they are no quarterstaffs they all appear to be steel weapons that are part of this cache there is a long polearm-- a halberd there’s two of them-- that does have a shaft of wood but it's designed for the weight of the bladed edge you could break it off and make it a quarterstaff if you really wanted to but it would be comparable to what you already have they're well-made and fresh they're less worn but they're not deadlier per se yeah make a history check sure doesn't jog your memory it looks old looks like it's been around a while unfortunately you already aided somebody with it you guys are back in the safe house now yes amongst you you have two of those whoever has them you're fine what are you guys doing you guys get up you all get ready to go you gather your things (lighting dynamite) watch it sparking it disappears you begin to leave as you guys are all walking out of the storehouse from behind you off to the left there's a dull sound and some dirt and water from the left side of the tree in the middle of the hot afternoon (muffled impact) the still water that currently exists around begins to slowly drain as a part of the swamp off to the side sinks down about ten feet or so the water level drops a solid foot but it comes to rest you're sure that whatever structure that remained down there before is now filled with dirt sludge swamp water and rock kiri is with you okay is anybody helping you with that jester and yasha start taking down the bloated bodies what are you doing with the bodies are you leaving them in the swamp to fester (singing) circle of-- you take them and pull them off-site and leave them in a pile to become one with the swamp over time it's pretty gross work (like nott) welcome to the mighty nein (laughter) that is now my new favorite-- i think salt bae cleric is my new favorite idea for a character as you guys gather your things and begin to trudge southward back into the labenda swamp to make your way back to the city of barleben a bit wounded but you've succeeded in your first task for the gentleman you begin to make your way through the reverse guidance of caleb in the direction you were traveling backward guidance we'll put it that way as you're all taking a moment to look through keeping your eyes peeled weapons drawn fjord your eyes catch the summoned falchion in your hand and there glittering in the center of the hilt where there was none previously is a single yellow eye and that's where we're going to end tonight's episode (cheering) on the hilt of the blade that's materia slot it's like it's the basis of his class
