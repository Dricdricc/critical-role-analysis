shopcritrolecom speaking of which laura how's that merch coming thank you laura welcome back to the table on that note guys we'll have our wyrmwood giveaway at the break i'll have all that information for you and a reminder at the time but for right now i think it's time to jump into tonight's episode of critical role [groovy critical role theme] you know that part in the game where you don't understand why you got so many points into renegade as opposed to paragon (laughter) i'm not going to be able to run the game tonight i can't focus take two oh i will never live that down it's great when you're a new actor in la and everyone says yeah you got to get some head shots and i know all about it you got to get those costume and character shots in yeah you need some archetypes come with a doctor outfit come with a regular business suit i've done a lot of doctors no all that photo has done is this that is literally the most it's ever done that would have been about ten years ago yes we'll go with that one anyway back to the story at hand upon completing your journey checking in with the gentleman you were paid the ripe sum that you had discussed after taking your newfound friend from shadycreek run ophelia back to the evening nip you exited with your new gold and platinum in hand after a celebratory drink to the memory of molly you grabbed caduceus and led him into the city of zadash-- the largest city you've ever seen by leaps and bounds-- to see what kind of ways you can corrupt this new fresh mind free out of the savalierwood that is where we left off in this case guys we have roughly two weeks of downtime i'm going to go around and ask what you would like to accomplish and if moments require rolls moments require roleplay anything like that we'll jump into it i would like to say who wants to go first okay i will say you could purchase all of those things-- and you're buying these yourself okay yeah i'd say you could buy all of those things with let's say a single gold because your charisma isn't that high a single gold piece for all of that that's priced up a bit sam and yep i have that no that was on the way out of hupperdook they weren't there for that well first off do you have or own tinkerer's tools this next expense will be 50 gold pieces for the set of tinkerer's tools i would need you to make a tinkering check to see if you can successfully disassemble the gun without ruining elements of it you're not proficient in tinkerer's tools so it's basically a straight intelligence check add your intelligence modifier to see if you can figure out the safest way to do so it takes you a little bit of time but you manage to very carefully disassemble the entirety of the pistol without any issues through the words of the man responsible for inventing these things naught but 20-plus years beforehand if you would like to explain make a tinker check i'd say it'll cost you an additional 20 gold in materials because you fail multiple times going through and end up wasting a lot of materials until eventually you get it right and you're certain that this would be the one that would function properly so you have one explosive arrow you're not entirely certain what it does yeah they're separate individual pieces you can certainly try you reassemble it it looks to be functional for show or comfort (laughs) all right so you have this commissioned because it is a commission and it is specific it'd probably be at the similar store to where beau got her reversible cloak made earlier in the campaign it would only take maybe two days to get the materials together to match the color you wanted and then the embroidery and finishing the gloves for your size specifically since you'd be a smaller frame all in all i'd say five gold pieces which is pricey for a set of custom gloves but not based on the money you had made okay so mark that off soltryce that's a good way to remember it okay two things one i would like you to roll for your forgery are you proficient with your forgery kit i think you should depending on your-- yeah go ahead and roll a d20 add your intelligence modifier and your proficiency bonus actually no let's make it dexterity proficiency bonus and your intelligence modifier dex i'm sorry you manage to forge the letter in what you believe to be a fairly decent forgery you're not matching somebody's handwriting per se it's more about getting an officious look to it with little flourishes of calligraphy at the beginning of sentences exactly i would like you to roll a general dexterity check for me okay there's a difference between sealing wax and candle wax how do i know this because i've made that mistake before sealing letters for previous d&d campaigns you manage to press your ring into the wax and pull back and now there's mush on the end of your ring and there's a circular piece of mushed soft wax where the seal should be sealing wax it's not too expensive we'll say two silver to get you a chunk there you go you finish the letter you seal it best to your ability you hope it seems official enough and you send it off towards its destination in rexxentrum end scene all right is that the extent of the things you want to accomplish nott okay all righty who wants to step up next that's true so caleb so the four of you jester caduceus caleb and beauregard are going shopping okay all right well what are you guys looking for okay midday you make your way to the pentamarket to the very vibrant center area of the marketplace there there's a number of intersecting pathways that help divide between all the various carts and tents that open up at this point i'd say it's maybe late morning or so a lot of the curled up curtains in the front are being affixed to the top or have been for a while the smells of fresh baked goods cooking stews and various other treats and snacks that are being presented as part of the shopping experience catch your nostrils as you move through you hear music playing in the distance for all the chaos that life has thrown you in the past 30 days it feels nice to step into a place that's so filled with life and lack of understanding of how dark the world is at the fringes of this empire both with the war going on and some of the things you've encountered it's nice to step into this space and you catch yourself instinctually smiling and finding it infectious to brighten your mood you turn to see the darkened green wood with gold accoutrements that marks the exterior of the invulnerable vagrant the front door is closed but appears to be not locked for any particular reason now that we've physically built it yeah it's a little larger in-world than the one that we did but the aesthetic is there yeah as you step forward the door opens up and leads you inside and there the same warmly lit interior with the glowing chandelier above greets you across the way sitting behind the desk face down in a book one of the various pumats who looks up and oh why hello there yeah oh it's been a while sorry took me a second to recognize you you're very silhouetted by the bright sunshine outside you right now and it's a bit dark interior so come on up another pumat comes around the corner and goes oh do we have folks in here yeah don't worry pumat i got them taken care of oh there's even more coming in caduceus why it's a pleasure to meet you as well don't see many of our kind wandering around these large establishments well it's ours well it's his hey prime you might want to step out of the workshop for a second you hear some rustling and grumbling in the background and the curtain opens and you see a third one of them step out goggles affixed to the head a little bit of smudges of dirt on the edges of the chin what are you talking about oh my goodness where are you from to be perfectly honest we haven't really run into any other firbolgs really since we came here wow well thank you at this point the fourth one comes down from a ladder off on the right side chamber oh is the order getting-- oh it's a whole party over here is that another firbolg comes down and the other's like yeah there's one over here the other pumat's like i'm impressed i like the color tones it's a great arrangement visual perspective the one with the goggles in the back goes sorry about that i should clarify these three are arcane-based copies of myself we are all collectively pumat but i am the original one of the other ones speaks up and goes we absolutely take no offense because it's true the three simulacrum all go aww at the same time well i greatly appreciate that we put a lot of hard work into it and it's hard to come across folks like us that would appreciate something on this scale well unless i am mistaken from my previous memory of times outside of zadash when's the last time you had a good bath this one knows what he's talking about listen to him follow that around oh sorry did you come here to do business prime goes all right then nice to meet you-- caduceus clay pumat sol pleasure of course you got gold we've got things to purchase anyway other pumats take care of these folks i've got to get back to work good to see you all again he exits to the back room the two other pumats step back and watch and they're both looking at you with this kind of-- not too bad people say you want to be your own boss well-- (laughter) unfortunately we don't really sell much in the realm of food items we do actually to be perfectly honest you mostly cleaned us out last time you were in here but we've got a few more items in here we got the bracers here if that's what you're looking for no yeah and six weeks later you're coming in and asking about them still but yeah price is still 1200 gold pieces these bracers enchanted by our fantastic boss pumat sol allow the bearer as long as they're not wearing any physical armor to impede the enchantment and/or a shield on their body helps protect them by deflecting incoming blows and giving them a better sense of avoiding physical atrocity onto their person how about we meet in the middle and we stick with the price provided all right we'll put this here waiting for you right there yeah you can look at it but you don't own it that can be considered depending on how much of a purchase you're looking to make what are you looking for don't think i've forgotten that silly string if that's the case if you don't mind waiting pumat iii could you go to our storage facility and get some more of that wizard paper and ink it looks like he's buying out our stock here at the moment yeah not a worry i'll be back here in the better part of 30 or 40 minutes if you don't mind being patient that one pumat takes a little cloak and throws it over his shoulders see you guys in a little bit and exits outside there's three in the room left behind one of them had drifted off to the side for a bit but seems to be still listening in so you still have the one that's dealing with you we don't have a whole lot of incense here i can probably provide about 20 gold worth of incense but there are incense makers within zadash that i'm sure can probably help you out with the rest of it we can definitely look to ordering more incense if you foresee this being a consistent thing we normally don't get that much of a request for it feel free to ask and i'll go ahead-- and he grabs this small wood front wood back with leather edging binding ledger or catalog that he pulls out and opens it up yeah let me know what you're looking for i'll tell you if we got one in stock takes a little set of glasses and puts them on the edge of his nose all right feather fall we got that sure all right there's a few options there for lower level enchantments we got an expeditious retreat spell that'll help get you out of the thick of things all right that's putting that down as well as a possibility those prices here because they're both relatively simple spells so i'll put them at about 100 gold apiece that's 200 gold total for those two spells yeah well here let's see in the realm of what you're looking to accomplish here-- so you're going directly not messing around just a straight catapult it's a straight up catapult catapult yeah we do have that as well that is 300 gold for the batch of three any more spells you're inquiring about here i'll show you what we've been able to accomplish since your absence weapon-wise this wasn't enchanted more than it was something that came into our purview from somebody that was looking hard for some cash and we offered them a bit of an exchange as it was promising and intriguing he pulls out this longsword but beyond the hilt the blade is snapped and gone it's a broken longsword it's got a silver hilt and a silver pommel wrapped in red leathers around the handle and there is a very fine filigree across the hilt and around the base this silver loop on the bottom of the pommel but it's a broken sword you've got about an inch of blade there and it looks like it's still sharp in places if you get real close you can probably make someone have a really bad day well looking it over it looks like there was some sort of enchantment embedded in it but since the blade has been broken there's not-- it looks to be very old looks like it probably was a relic from pre-- he goes and looks at his notes real fast yeah this would be pre-divergence from the age of arcanum the reason we took it is the historical significance we could probably fetch a pretty penny should we take it to the various lyceums the academy would probably be real interested but if you want to take it off for sentimental value or go get it repaired some time it's 300 gold prime finished up some of this dust here and he pulls out a small sack that looks to be a red-brown dust he says he's proud of this one i'm going to be real honest with you if it's sprinkled over any edible substance it greatly improves the flavor to the point where it's downright distracting it's the dust of deliciousness last thing we've got here and then we're pretty much out at the moment you guys have become our number one customers which is really appreciated just finished this cloak last week here he steps around the edge and you can see while as well decorated as the place is it's pretty bare now you guys have come through and grabbed the necessary bits and what else was in there has been picked up as well you guys aren't the only people who shop here but you've been the most recent intense customers he pulls this fine bluish purple-tint cloak material that as it flows as he lifts it up from behind the small locked box it ever so faintly gives off this shimmer this is designed to obfuscate the movements of the person who wears it to where it makes him a little more difficult to pay attention the enchantments here and he looks back and you can see it right along the hood of it there's these faint little runes he goes this is some-- these are sylvan i don't know if any of you read more the classics well there you go this is specifically a cloak with an elven enchantment designed to help make things difficult to see so there's that one as well that's all we got laura and yeah an answer unfortunately enchanted weaponry is a very specialized-- oh i'm sorry about that if you want to commission an axe we can start working on enchanting one for you well it depends on what sort of enchantment you're looking for if you just-- okay the other pumat is now looking over from the other room and going like-- he's like we'll have to talk to prime about that prime comes out yeah he's like she wants to see if you could enchant an axe that hits really hard and is really cool and wounds don't close and-- you watch as pumat prime is actually in his head doing math i could probably manage something like that i got about an eight-month window for completion and it would probably run you about between ten to twelve thousand gold oh i can guarantee it won't find anything better than that for a specified number of enchantments this side of rexxentrum so you want a weapon that when it hits somebody they start dancing all right so the only enchantment you're requiring is the possible ability of making something dance uncontrollably all right welcome back man there we go that's going to be-- it's doable it's pricey that one will put you about 8000 gold sorry if you want just something that's pretty sharp and helps you hit a little better i could do that for much cheaper let's see that one will put you back about i'd say maybe 400 gold could finish that in about four or five days yeah all righty just provide the weapon and we'll get that taken care of for you okay what kind of axe is it handaxe okay so it can be thrown as well all right we'll go ahead and we'll get right on that for you not a worry so that'd be 400 gold for that put that in the pot right there since you're looking for possibly other purchases that's 400 gold pieces what else you looking to buy yeah all right so that's-- make a persuasion check with advantage since everybody's helping you you see the pumats talking to you kind of let me go ahead and have a conversation with the boss man hold on just a second turns around the corner you hear some hushed voices yeah fine sure he comes back out all right we got ourselves an approval for a discount there we'll be happy to knock about a hundred gold off that total price for you if that's amenable to you all right so who's buying what sword and the cloak all righty well here well here i'll do a total price here and then you guys can-- it's 400 for getting your handaxe enchanted well i'm doing a total amount here first don't-- you guys can decide how to divvy it up for you so that's 450 for the cloak that's 1200 for the bracers that's 300 for the handle no dust and then you got a-- and then 300 for the spells hold on a second there so it's 300 worth of spells and you said 600 worth of paper and ink right at this time you guys have been discussing the other pumat comes back with his cloak with a big old crate in his hand and goes got the rest of the paper and ink hold on sets it down then that is 20 gold for your incense all right are you guys all marking off your amounts based on how many pieces you've thrown at me it's probably better to have you all just deduct what you've spent individually i was going to try that but then that got a little chaotic there all righty so there's your sword there's your bracers there's your cloak six servings of dust in this all right well there you go go ahead and mark off that amount there as well when all is said and done when you've marked off your amounts here's a hundred gold back you may redistribute it as you see fit well that was what you haggled them down travis and it just makes it easier than adding make a persuasion check well only because you asked so nice but don't tell the boss all right so i'll see you back here in about five days or so there jester and we should have a fresh new enchanted handaxe there for you all righty well it's been a pleasure oh it's-- he pulls it up again it's that taryon fellow or whatever but i'm most of the way through it kind of a slow reader yeah we've been kind of passing it around as we each finish it i'll ask him really appreciate the suggestion most of the weight is the materials that contain the paper the paper isn't very heavy but because it is specifically designed and made for the uses of inscribing and enchantment and other things it is contained in very very careful protective wooden boxes they're all stacked repeatedly within this crate hey caduceus pleasure to meet you we'll hope so brightened up the room aww you're too kind yeah there's grace of the wilds which is in the pentamarket district you find it you in particular you find it very quickly because you're attuned to the smell of some of the herbs and various mosses that they're been cultivating and drying out there you're like (sniffs) that's familiar (sniffs) yeah and so much like toucan sam you follow your nose-- --to grace of the wilds and there you see a female woman 50s with kind of wild big black curly hair who's just sitting there nobody else is paying mind to the front little tent that she has set up that is attached to what appears to be the rest of her shop which is mostly closed-off and dark as you approach she glances over and goes hah hi can i help you what do you need what do you need what can i do no i'm jesna bree but this is grace of the wilds this is my shop but welcome welcome welcome welcome for training you want to train of course of course just give me your list i'd like to see i know i figured oh ah okay yeah and as she's talking to you you watch as her other hand takes a piece of chalk and is writing on the wall behind her i'd be more than happy to help and i can help a lot of things i can help you with too and i'm happy to and then in kind of crappy handwriting underneath all the various prices of the herbs and things that are provided you now see 'training' she's added it to her list of things that she does as talking to you oh oh yes oh yes oh yes i can help with the tea the tea i can help with so training what do you want to train in please tell me okay okay okay that can be done it may take some time little bit of time give me your time we'll make it work the herbalism kit for this is-- it's five-- you already have one yeah you would be purchasing proficiencies the training is what you would be doing this would be the bulk of your downtime because it will take a while for you to really get-- but the full training for this will come to about i'll say 200 gold and you are now proficient in the herbalism kit oh i misunderstood oh i've got you well if that's the case buying the materials-- you're essentially buying them at half-price you can make healing potions but you get to make them at 25 gold apiece as opposed to 50 okay yeah cooking spices will run you a gold for the full set you can find a whole bevy of beverages all throughout the pentamarket okay so at 150 gold (counting) that's six healing potions that you have the materials to make but you can spend your downtime during this week to make a few if you'd like that'll put you at about one potion per day of creation so you can easily take this time to make all six they're baseline healing potions level one but you should be able to do so cool and you made a friend with jasna bree she's a little sad that she doesn't get a chance to teach you or train you but she's like that's okay next time next time whenever you feel like it you come on by i'll teach you no worries a tea kettle you can get i'd say you manage to acquire the cooking supplies the kettle some fine teas that you can acquire and altogether i'd say-- i'd say that would put you back about-- with the hat four gold you weren't asking for anything too crazy all right so for that let's see here make an investigation check well if you're both looking for it you can aid or help so advantage on that 11 asking around most folks-- well diamonds as a rough raw material is hard to find usually they're already embedded in jewelry and most jewelers are out there eventually somebody points you to a place like (dismissively) if anyone will have it it's probably over at suvo's secrets laura and suvo's secrets and they point you over to this large gray shop tent that has an ominous feel when you look at it as bright a day as it is it's like the addams family house in the pentamarket it looks it looks unwelcome yeah it's a very drab very coarse material that the tent is made out of outside it looks like the ropes that are affixing it down are rotted a bit and you can see that some of the ropes are starting to pull and tear on the edges it looks closed except for there's-- where the flaps come together in the middle it doesn't look like anything that you should buy from all right as you enter suvo's secrets-- (laughing) you're hitting the tent front you're not walking in yeah it's open it's an entrance you go inside and the interior-- it's maybe 20 feet by 20 feet it's not a very large interior space and it looks like there are some tables set up on the far ends perimeter to the outside of it and on the back there is a very very large custom rocking chair that is just like (creaking) and sitting in it you see an older very intense-looking female dragonborn bronze-scaled but in the age they're starting to turn a bit green at the edges kind of patinaed a little she sits there in the rocking chair hands kind of crossed on the chest just rocking and looking at you as you enter thank you very much welcome to suvo's secrets yes who are you jester what are you looking for that i might be helping you with taliesin and she leans forward and her hands hit the front of her knees leaning back she looks very small but once she steps into the little bit of light that's coming through the front of the tent suvo's a fairly large dragonborn and even just leaning forward sitting is almost as tall as you are jester diamonds you say how many diamonds are you looking for maybe 12 she reaches back and there's this large-- it looks just like a sack just a general sack and she reaches and grabs the edge and scoots it over without breaking eye contact it scrapes across the ground and you hear things clattering around inside like she's carrying a large pouch of various pots and pans she reaches in still looking at you one two and eventually counts out 12 varying-sized diamonds they all look-- some are cut it looks like one of them is a little rough and just hasn't been cut by a jeweler yet but sure enough they're-- make a perception check you have you've seen some fine jewelry especially from your mother's chests (laughing) it's the tassels (laughter) (whoosh whoosh whoosh) it's sharp and dangerous yeah we are exactly these are all legitimate diamonds with varying degrees of worth but looking at the batch there's probably about 700-- we'll say rounded off about-- roughly 750 gold worth of diamonds of the group that she set that is all right they will still be here when you come back drops them into the satchel pushes it away (creaking thumping) so you each have 300 gold worth of diamonds on you there are many things grabs and pulls the sack back over yeah the tables are all empty there is just a sack where she keeps all of the goods reaches in and pulls out what looks to be a mummified creature's hand you can't-- it's not quite humanoid it's got fur on it sets it down this is a treated owlbear matron hand 25 gold it's a good keepsake reaches in pulls out a big batch of garlic just a big old batch of garlic in a small netted sack she goes garlic good for cooking and also for keeping away vampyr (laughter) make a religion check jester this plan sounds perfectly sound (laughter) so for the sake of brevity-- it's a whole slew of strange knickknacks-- yeah it takes the better part of 30 or 40 minutes or so there's an iron mask where the mouth should be it's just these two metal tusks that stick out almost like a cast-iron orc mask oh my god there are-- there's half of a chess set carved from jade when i say half i mean not like one side or the other half of each side so it's completely useless there is a single vial that has a familiar red medicinal liquid in it it looks like there is a healing potion should you be so inclined to purchase it and the rest of it is just absolute junk very well two gold which is really expensive for fucking garlic make a persuasion check it is yours it's so overpriced for garlic it is actually pretty artisanal garlic all right so yeah this would be a greater healing potion no for this she's like this will run 250 gold pieces but it will keep you from dying in places where you will probably most likely be dying pulls it back and puts it back in the satchel then you will not have it (laughing) she seems to nod like well done no mask five gold make a persuasion check five gold be careful they say the curse lasts for whoever-- i don't remember the rest of it it's just a mask there's no enchantment it's just a very scary mask but congratulations it's yours it's all bullshit well most of it's bullshit from this individual very well is that the end of it be safe and come back again i am very interested to sell to you what else might come my way you step out the bright light of the midday sun-- the clouds of the previous storm have parted a bit and there's actually bright light and your eyes have to adjust you're like aah ah ah all right who else we've done a few things with you guys we've done nott's stuff fjord anything you want to do sailors not so much the empire is landlocked aside from the very far north and those waters are in the frigid depths it's a lot of ice floes and treacherous water up there so there is very little passage up north the menagerie coast as you know is where all of the port towns are and that's the relationship between the empire and the menagerie coast that agreement is based on the fact that essentially the menagerie coast holds all the long-term imports and exports in the palm of their hand that would be nicodranas nicodranas from zadash it's a little over a week to get there i'd say okay make three successive investigation checks for me please you make it as far south as trostenwald before the frustration wells up inside you it's been a series of dead ends you've asked around and listened and anyone who would've crossed paths with some of the shipping lanes that you're familiar with and that sabian was familiar with none of them are passing this far north you assume that to continue this you would have to go to the menagerie coast and that would involve a thorough passage through nicodranas and the various wharf taverns and seeing what old connections you might be able to dredge up in that time but that's going to take you a little while by the end of the week you'll get not quite to nicodranas if you want to you can traverse the wuyun gorge pass through the wuyun gates and head into the menagerie coast you will be alone and it isn't a not-dangerous road so just be aware there are some possibilities you sure okay after this unfortunately not-fruitful travel south in seeking out any possible word of sabian you shift your attention back and decide to rally with your allies perhaps that's the direction you want to go in the future okay what else would you like to do okay very well anybody else all righty cat frumpkin has returned okay we'll get to that first you guys make your way to the archive and you enter there and the following morning caleb is very tired-looking but also hard to tell making your way into the archive it's fairly bustling in comparison to what you know it's either dead or there's a handful of people going through it today it's a handful of people going through you're like oh wow there's four people in here researching right now within a short time-- what are you looking to do beauregard one of the monks goes let me go inquire i'll be right back and wanders up the stairs you see them descend the stairs with another figure gray robes with blue lining hood pulled back and there you see zeenoth he steps down and goes beauregard i wasn't aware you had returned hi dairon unfortunately is still out on the front lines well she's been sent to assess political threats beyond the eastern border been gone for about 30 days and is said to return in the next 45 before we send anyone after her but i'm sure she's fine well things change when they're at that moment of conflict no she progressed behind enemy lines and then wrote to us that she was staying for an extended period she's impetuous i think you may know something about that anyway i'm sorry dairon is not here what are you inquiring about ah well there is tubo tubo is quite an accomplished monk of the cobalt soul and might be able to help you whereas dairon could not you've seen tubo you've not directly interacted because tubo much like dairon works on a higher level you hadn't quite garnished the attention beyond just being that brat for a while tubo is this very dark-skinned halfling with very short widow's peak-type hair and this very calm smile about him very well-respected but you haven't really seen him move or do anything other than walking through the archive and be present you don't know all right i shall return good seeing you again zeenoth's patient smile fades as he turns within a short time you see coming from down the same staircase tubo his arms folded in front of him as he descends and turns toward you so you are beauregard correct and you're looking for training while your expositor is away correct follow me zeenoth who's a little bit behind goes i'll accompany him in his reading if that's all right we've met in trostenwald hello please lead the way to where you'd wish to read all right tubo brings you to a chamber you haven't been in in a while which is the formal training grounds beneath the archive there is a set of double doors in the far end that blend in mostly with the dark wood that a lot of the bookcases are crafted out of it leads you down a set of stairs into what is essentially a training pit with very heavily packed sand and dirt and there are a number of wooden poles that emerge from beneath that have all sorts of skewed extensions this is where a lot of forms are practiced and a lot of defensive maneuvers are utilized you were brought through in this area for training in waves time and again but it's been a while since you've been down here since you've been abroad and there's no other people there training currently tubo brings you down very well show me what you've got for the sake of brevity-- yes roll up a new character tubo splatters you across the wall you spar for a bit showing him the limits of your capabilities and he's deftly with a smile on his face dodging parrying you get a few good hits in and he backs away very good and then begins to overwhelm you with his assault but never enough to inflict pain just enough to throw you off your guard until a moment he turns around and puts his hands up into a cross once more and goes four days i need four days with you and then your training for now is complete day one begins time to read he takes you back upstairs and begins to collect books and throw them into a pile and sits you down you begin reading and it's getting frustrated but as you're reading tubo begins to lean in and say as you're reading think carefully about what you're trying to find what you're trying to learn what are you looking to research for the portion of this day tubo begins to instruct you on how to not just read and research but in focusing your spiritual energy on the specific things you're searching you begin to find quick ways to johnny 5 through tomes to find what you're looking for with this comes your ability to spend a ki point to gain advantage on an investigation check day two comes around and he brings you down to the subterranean chamber for more training this time he begins to show you how to use that same internal spiritual energy or ki at the moment of impact to give off this very localized wave of spiritual energy he begins to tell you how this can break through defenses of things that are meant to not be touched with a mortal hand this is intended as a way to bypass sometimes the mundane protections through this training he teaches you how use your empowered strikes where now your physical fists and attacks as a monk are considered magical yes you can now punch ghosts day three he brings you down to the chamber with a chair and says sit tell me tell me a secret kind of do you want to tell me a secret no he looks frustrated turns around does a little loop comes back and as you're about to speak up again he does a series of quick hits that hurt a little but that catch you right in the clavicle the side of throat and then right under the chin as you pull back make a saving throw for me please this would be a charisma saving throw i believe he begins to ask you questions about your youth and your family history-- things you don't normally talk about with anybody outside of stopping yourself from speaking at all you're on the verge of constantly giving up the information he teaches you this is a technique that allows you to pull the truth from those that would not be so forthcoming it is situationally very useful and i will show this to you and so he teaches you the extort truth ability on the fourth and final day he leads you down and begins to show you how to use your ki capabilities your spiritual energy to blend it with moments of adrenaline bursts to give yourself a moment of reactionary time where previously you would have expended any capability of preparing yourself for an assault as he puts you through hours of this rigorous training he goes very well the time to show what you can do has come claps you watch as two other monks come down (laughs) but they have bows and arrows and they have a third one they hand to him they all nock the arrows and aim them right at you yeah tubo goes fire all three arrows come toward you that's a 19 to hit okay that's another 19 actually and that is a 23 so all three hit you the first arrow is ten points of damage yes you can ten you catch one arrow correct okay you take one point of damage you just barely catch it it manages to nick the side of your shoulder the two other arrows are coming at you as well okay you can do that now if you have another reaction you don't have to spend a ki point to reduce the damage you spend a ki point to throw it back you spend the same ki point roll for damage reduction on the next one that's 12 points of damage you catch both arrows the third one is coming towards you spend another ki point that's two ki points now you get to roll to reduce the third one yeah that one does no damage you catch one arrow out of the air it just barely nicks your shoulder the other one you catch just as it scrapes past the side of your arm the third one you catch in the middle of the air with no impact in the blink of an eye you've deflected all three arrows shot at the same time i did and with that your training is complete no he hands the shortbow to the other one and they all head back upstairs impressive dairon was not wrong about you that you are an apt pupil now our time is done i have things to do and four days with you has been more than enough he makes his way back up and escorts you out of the training chamber so during this time caleb make an investigation check with advantage to find all the right information so on that specific thing you learn about the kryn dynasty which is the xhorhasian society that exists in the ruins of ghor dranas you know that most of them were drow dark elf from what you've heard and the ones you've interacted with now the drow were brethren alongside all elves in the past history until their minds were corrupted and swayed by the terrible silver tongue of lolth the spider queen one of the betrayer gods under her will they became deceptive cruel and violent when the betrayer gods were defeated and banished during the calamity and the divergence that separated the mortal realm from the gods that once threatened to destroy it entirely the drow returned to their subterranean cities to rebuild their power far from the burning light of day much of the recent studies into current drow society across exandria speak of growing paranoia and madness that's seeping in with the believed influence of tharizdun the chained oblivion whether it be by proximity of remnants of his power deep beneath the surface that have grown close to these societies but there is whispers and research that say that some of these dark elf societies are being driven slowly mad by this influence strangely what studies you've been able to find that talk about penetrating the kryn dynasty's intense boundaries-- i fucking looked at you immediately laura because i knew where it was going of course as soon as i read the word i was like-- without fail we missed you but for those who were able to move past the boundaries to research more of what little is known of the kryn dynasty there is little in iconography under lolth or tharizdun and what remains of that is ancient and crumbling and largely ignored by the society there's nothing about beacons nothing about reincarnation however it does speak of the dynasty worshiping something other something that is new and dangerous as far as the cobalt soul is concerned with what little research they have they refer to it as the luxon and seek to bring all under its burning banner they've rallied to the surface of ghor dranas casting the skies in eternal midnight that spreads with their dominion they've begun taking the ravenous hordes of beast-men and terrors of the xhorhasian wastes and indoctrinate them under this new false god you also learn that a number of people mostly children of adolescent age have been found abducted in the night by the kryn on occasion though the number has steeply grown this past generation years after the first open conflicts with the kryn began the last thing you discover is the leader of the dynasty is known as empress leylas kryn she is called an umavi by them though the word's meaning is unknown by current research accounts of the empress speak of her as a powerful and dangerous warrior on the battlefield and well over 600 years old or more as records date back that far since she arrived in local history that's what you've discovered about the kryn dynasty and xhorhas make an investigation check the things you discover from what's available to you in the archive time is a constant the motion moving forward unyielding some powerful arcane influences can accelerate or slow the rate at which time passes locally even stop it there are some stories from the age of arcanum that speak of the greatest of sages experimenting with reversing the forward momentum of time and supposedly with some success but the process apparently was so taxing and the energies required so extensive that it nearly killed those who passed through this natural flow that's as much as you can pick up on the specific research involving that shift of time they're more footnotes and like a we don't mess with that because those who tried have mostly been disintegrated or destroyed in the process yes but they existed close to 1500 years ago the names that were in there are none that correlate to anything you'd recognize i'll send you those notes later you do pick up because of your very high roll there are apparently some newer arcane experiments regarding time and reality being fielded within the soltryce academy in rexxentrum a newer magical energy seems to have been discovered or rediscovered that can seemingly adjust such properties with ease it's being referred to as dunamis but other than that there's very little information because all that seems to be proprietary within the academy okay fjord what else would you like to do i was like are you sure that's all you want to do the eye where it sits in the hilt-- and it only sits on one side it's not both sides that contain the eye because there aren't two pupils there is a singular eye that is embedded in it that is looking out what would essentially be towards the left no it's near the crossguard in the center of the hilt when you look at it it doesn't seem to move or shift or pay any attention practicing the next few days and trying some things out you focus some of your arcane gifts towards an object casting witch bolt towards a nearby rock or low dried and forgotten trunk of a tree at the moment the incantation begins the eye shifts to look towards the target of the spell the spell explodes and you look back at the hilt and it's already reverted back to where it was before but it did seem to react to when the spell was cast sure all right so you make your way to the evening nip by the time you've returned it's been the better part of the two-week period of time and you guys are also generally worried the fact that fjord just vanished during this time period big surprise (poof sound) you make your way to the subterranean basement of the evening nip the gentleman is not currently present but upon asking around and you wait for about 20 minutes or so he does return from the storage room to the side where you had previously been led down and through the underworks as he comes in he sees you and sits on the other side of the table throwing his leg over one side and sitting at a very comfortable and casual way across from you fjord i'm being told that you're looking for me i have some reaches in places yes that's quite a scope you're requesting i would say it's a good bet that most criminal elements you would encounter there are not at my network except for a handful it might be more useful to you to know the ones to trust okay port damali you say really the jewel of the coast i've been a number of times though it's been years since i've been able to leave my work here alone so if you're looking to expand your portfolio beyond zadash that is commendable the one contact i could recommend in port damali would be father dwondaff pierce dwarven fellow scraggly in the face dresses well he helms the pearl shrine a house of worship to avandra the changebringer tell him that you bring many gifts should you not work with father pierce and his network be careful you could easily find yourself on an opposing side to my business and i do not take kindly to betrayal that i do if something comes to mind i'll send it your way and if anything comes to mind that would be of interest to my ears business or otherwise please keep me informed of course then he goes off to get a drink at the bar as you turn around right there at the steps is cree the dark-furred tabaxi she approaches and goes i'm sorry to bother you i noticed you descend here i have heard since your last arrival that there were losses in your journey i have had a number of uncomfortable dreams in the week and i cannot sense lucien make a persuasion check they are cold and sad i just see him alone and i've tried to focus he is not nearby i have a very hollow feeling about this that was what i was fearing that is all right thank you for your honesty it is hard for him to be gone for so long then come back and so swiftly go again maybe i had put too much faith we of the task takers we were undergoing a ritual that he had orchestrated with an ally of his a woman of magical renown he said that this was something that was meant to lead us to this city he promised a place where we could learn of a great many powers and secrets we believed him he was very charismatic in his cruelty at times but he did not survive two years i wasn't expecting to see him this last time i feel like whatever grace brought him back to us maybe it was your carelessness that took him from us again it is all right i have started a new life here and it has been serving me well such are these days thank you for your candor she turns around and walks away okay you guys have all gathered up at the leaky tap all right what do you want to do roll a wisdom check for me okay you've spent so much of your life in the tranquility of the cold and quiet savalierwood and even in the most nature-based portion of the city of zadash the general din and chaos of the city is too distracting you're unable to reach that meditative state where you're able to feel connected with nature and with the wildmother so melora's guidance does not come to you you have to continue to throw your lot in with these strange folks that dragged you out of your home all right okay you're able to attune to it and gain the benefits of a cloak of elvenkind well you'll have to decide which ones you're going to do there is the raven's den which sits near the ossuary gates-- all righty there is the hearth of the allhammer which you've messed with as well a little bit during the festival there's the valley archive of the cobalt soul while it is both an archive it is also a temple to the knowing mistress there is the king's hall which is the center of law and of course that's where the law master is you've spoken with a couple of times that's where you've done your jobs off the taskboard yeah there's a lot of guards there there's the platinum house which is a temple to the platinum dragon that also exists in the interstead sprawl not too far from steam's respite which is the bathhouse the platinum dragon there's also in the signet wall which is the military district there is the shrine of the dawn which is to the dawnfather it's up to you okay platinum house it is as you approach this beautiful but small white building is draped in deep blue tapestries while a reflective mirrored sphere sits atop the roof during the day i think you've passed by and seen it before when you were traversing the city are you going at day or nighttime okay the inside is open archways and floor spaces they're made available for worship but also used for meditation there are a few folks in there that are quietly eyes closed taking in the atmosphere of the interior there's areas for reading and there's areas for napping and sleeping of the bahamut worshiping that goes on in places you've seen on the menagerie coast this one is a little more new age-y than you're used to about noonish when you arrive there is a sermon beginning where there is the herald of the house which is a silver-scaled dragonborn in his older years he looks very tired and as withered as a dragonborn can through their silver scales he's in the process of giving this very deeply empowering speech about the majesty of bahamut bestows upon us the knowledge and the grace in which we can be beacons of truth and justice in a world that wishes to swallow all with chaos but yeah the midday stakeout appears to go well what do you wish to do he's there most of the day and in the evening he appears to go nap somewhere within the platinum house okay make an investigation check sure sure there's a couple entrances some hallways there is in the center yeah it's not built on the floor it's actually held aloft in the central domed archway right beneath where that glowing dome at the top is at nighttime as you've seen it it emits this faint white glow and is this beacon in the middle of the darkened city aside from the various bits of torchlight that hit the streets beneath this dome you see the large carved-- looks like a pure platinum but it's probably a polished silver-- statue of the dragon wings outstretched looking down over the chambers and hovers about 15 feet off the ground where all the rest of the folks gather for this sermon and/or sit there to meditate and pray and worship yeah at night there are less people what do you disguise yourself to be you guys approach in the evening together are you disguising yourself as well okay jester now taking the elderly form of a silver-scaled very well-respected herald of the house kumas you approach the temple a few hours after sundown to where the interest in worship tends to fade as folks go back to home it's mostly just a few caretakers that watch it through the night and some lost souls that have found their way there in the evening and they need guidance make a deception check with disadvantage because you didn't even use his name that i've said twice deception okay of the six individuals that are here there are two that actually are of the temple there are four that are here meditation one looks like a young man looking like he might be on hard times and has tear marks on his face where he may have been looking up to the statue and revelling the four people that were attending see you and oh and they get up and start gathering their things the two that work at the temple are confused look at each other and look at you and begin to walk towards you no they're wearing tabards that are mostly a silver-white color with the symbol of bahamut the blue with the silver dragon they're simply dressed they're the caretakers of the temple low-level priests of the platinum dragon as they approach one of them looks to be a mid-30s human male male-pattern baldness taking a large portion of his shorter blond hair the other one appears to be a half-elven man as well he looks younger but looks can be deceiving with half-elves they both approach with a somewhat concerned look and the half-elf speaks up first and goes i'm sorry you said that the holy father needs the room cleared make a perception check looking around there are bowls throughout the room most of them appear to be empty a few of them have a few knick-knacks thrown in there they may have been things that people left as a gift or an offering a few copper one of them could even have a silver you don't see any other boxes it looks like they're cleared out fairly frequently okay triple-checking if mage hand has-- well disguise self remains cast however mage hand if i recall may have-- correct but it's verbal and somatic so as they're approaching you look back and forth and begin casting a spell as this is happening they both go uh-- i wasn't aware you had an assistant make a deception check one of them goes oh of course my apologies your grace and the human leaves the half-elf still seems dubious your grace you seem to be rather weary perhaps i should stay and make sure you need help i'll be quiet of course your grace the half-elf leaves but his eyes don't deviate he appears to leave the room there's open archways that lead down long hallways and they all appear to have left the hallways okay so your invoke duplicity's there and you-- the platinum dragon's about 15 feet up make an athletics check using very minute ledges that are carved out of the various temple pillars that hold up and maintain the weight of the beautiful archways that mark the top part of the temple you tiny rock climb with the finger strength that only jester has in this whole group setup and make your way up carefully-- one two-- leap and then grab onto the platinum dragon it hangs back and forth a bit and you can now see-- what you can't see from far down is there are two sets of chains that hold it aloft up in the temple it is free hanging and now you're rocking back and forth make a stealth check okay you begin painting rainbow colors and pulling out all your various pigments and the platinum begins to give way to a technicolor vomit nightmare as you're getting to the mustache you hear many many footfalls approaching and a voice saying yeah just this way i-- okay as he's in the middle of talking (thud) make an acrobatics check because it's a 15-foot drop wow okay a three-point landing in the middle you're still-- but there's also the invoke duplicity of him there so there's one he goes that's the-- (thud) what huh they give chase they go after whoever that is there are now five crownsguard and two members of the house giving chase down one of the hallways make a perception check to look around you as this is happening rather rapidly as you're rushing down you look and there's two open doorways one of them appears to be a dark interior the other appears to lead to some sort of candlelight the hall's coming to an end ahead of you right or left which way are you going there's two open doorways one is dark on the inside the other seems to have candlelight from the interior all right you duck into the dark room yeah the footfalls are coming faster and faster behind you and nott you're noticing that they're drawing weapons and one of them appears to be pulling out some sort of a bead out of their pocket that's all you notice well they all immediately stop and look behind at you there's five crownsguard and then two members of the church make a stealth check please you think you may be hidden they turn and look at you what make a deception check as they're all looking the one that had the bead goes-- throws it your direction that's an 18 to hit okay let me look this up again i wasn't expecting it to go this way i'm going to double-check you make a dexterity saving throw okay so you don't take any force damage however this sphere of translucent force has completely encapsulated you and you're just slowly rolling back like (rumbling) two of the guards come over to flank it the other three continue their travel with the two members of the church so there's five they then duck into the dark room where you are as one of them lights a torch to light up the chamber now you quickly made your way through this is a storage chamber and on the inside you can see there's a bunch of candles there's a bunch of statues and things that are used in various ceremonies there's a number of wooden hanging rods that they place a lot of vestments on that are not used they're for more formal events and celebrations and holidays you have put your way into a corner between one of these boxes and some of the raiments in the hope that you won't be seen they are going to make a very thorough investigation of the room they begin to slowly look through one of the members of the church after the first 30 seconds of not finding anyone darts off so there's only four in the chamber he's going to look elsewhere the crownsguard begin to peek through lifting up pieces of equipment lifting up the tops of storage containers the room's about 15 by ten feet it's not a very large room okay so roll again oh you do you take 5d4 points of force damage five seven eight you take 11 points of force damage so this is equivalent essentially to an otiluke's resilient sphere you're in a hamster ball but the two guards that are right there are flanking it and holding it in place so you can't move okay as one of them turns and just manages to pull the raiments aside revealing your face uh i found them (whoosh) wait no she was right-- he was right i-- spread out and they all begin to scatter out into the hallways now you move-- correct so with blink at the start of your next turn you return within ten feet of where you vanished so go ahead and roll no thank you keep her honest on that one so your form flickers for a moments as the spell kicks in however you vanish spread out you're right back in place wait and they go ahead-- you cast charm person all right it-- okay so you can target three creatures at 3rd-level there are-- four in the room total oh no because there are two guards against him so there's three after her yes that's crownsguard and then one left so there are four in there there's three crownsguard and one member of the house who do you attack all right so they have advantage on this save because you are technically in opposition on this one so the first crownsguard with advantage that's going to be a 14 what's the dc 15 he fails other one two sixes in a row fail the third one two and-- no they all fail even with advantage so the three crownsguard come in and are like have you seen where this person went apparently someone's masquerading as you we'll go check sam and the three crownsguard turn around and rush off to find it while the member of the house the half-elf from earlier is like nobody that's-- that's him ugh and is going to rush to try and grab you go ahead and roll another d20 five no it's going to go for a full grapple it's an athletics check okay that is going to be a 16 i believe that's a success yeah 13 plus three however it does come in and go to grapple you and hold you in place so you're currently now being held in this form by the entity you can try and break free by doing an athletics check okay try it your athletics check 12 you are grappled however go ahead and roll another d20 because your blink spell is still active you vanish out of their grasp what the how begins to just-- pushing things over and looking around for wherever you may have gone next round you appear ten feet from where you were where do you want to appear you appear in the doorway the three guard are in the other chamber and they are currently-- you can now see into the other room where you didn't run and it looks to be the bedchambers of the actual kumas you can hear him like what's going on i was trying to sleep they're like ah sir there's a-- wait as you go running down the hallway at this point-- the two other crownsguard who are currently guarding nott-- you see now nott is encapsulated in this bubble and is like ah and one of them is pulling out chains and cuffs on them and they're preparing to essentially arrest nott once this bubble goes away they both turn around in the middle of this scuffle and see you running towards them with advantage one of them succeeds two 17's in a row the other-- the other one fails a seven and a one so one of them just looks at you and smiles the one holding the chains for nott the other one pulls a blade make a deception check with disadvantage the blade is pulled out and goes we're sorry sir we were called in here there was apparently a disturbance and we found this one we are preparing arrest well good hopefully they'll go ahead and catch them we have to wait for this one the one you charmed goes well i'll go ahead and find out and then walks over to help them while the one who resisted the charm just sits there and takes the chains from him and is now waiting for nott to get out by the way roll a d20 the other person from the house comes by the half-elf and says you fool that's the one that's been-- now the actual herald of the house comes out he's got his pajamas on and he's like what's going-- what's this go ahead and roll a d20 add your wisdom modifier bubble vanishes nott you fall to your feet the guy with the chains is going to go ahead and reach out to attempt to grapple you with them make an acrobatics check that was cocked yes 17 15 you slip out of it in time roll a d20 seven okay you guys start bolting at this point you can hear footsteps coming from the other entrance hall as more folks are coming in to join the chaos what are you doing just full dash all right laura roll a d20 as you are running jester disappears everyone behind you has eyes on you and you're about to come back into the center of the temple where there are two hallways that exit to the front and the back the right and the left both exit the temple but you also hear footsteps coming from somewhere what are you doing okay using your bonus action you scoot past turn left and see two crownsguard that are approaching now hearing this commotion and you scoot past them hey they're unable to catch up to you you're too fast but they're giving chase laura you reappear ten feet from where you were you are now again in the center of the temple and there's a wave of people rushing towards you there's now two crownsguard rushing towards the direction where nott is and you see nott tearing ass away yep okay now there are multiple copies of the herald of the house kumas it's an army of old dudes old dragonborns that would be to the right the opposite direction that nott went you charge that direction you move the rest of your movement that way 30 feet roll another d20 yeah they all do because you're not present nott you've managed to make it out into the street now you are now out of the temple make a stealth check to see if you can manage to lose the folks that are chasing you into the street you manage to dodge over a few rain barrels on the side dart down one alleyway and circle around once and duck beneath a parked wagon you're pretty sure they've lost you they're now starting to scatter and give orders off in different directions you've caused quite a commotion jester you've returned into place your first time using blink and you're like oh god what's happening yep that's a full 60 feet of movement as you're rushing down the other hallway you hear the voices behind you shouting there he is keep going how are there so many of him what's going on roll another d20 you keep running and make your way out now into the night air okay you drop blink spell's gone the guards are now rushing up and coming to the edge of the exit and they can see you now you could try but they still have eyes trained on you you've got to try and find a way to break eye contact with them but they're pretty trained on you right now you do get it twice you get channel divinity twice that's right the cloak of shadows thing all right cool as they're chasing you channel divinity you give a silent little whispered prayer to the traveler to give you the opportunity to escape you vanish you are invisible for the next six seconds okay and with that you duck around into a little nook on the outside of an abode or home that's placed here on the outside of the temple in that moment make a stealth check with advantage because you're invisible okay (laughter) with that you manage to slowly blend back into the night chaos oh yeah i'll say that within the next couple of days word has gotten around the city of zadash to the point where some of the town criers are talking about terrible vandalism platinum dragon nearly ruined by upstarts and secret cabal of anti-religious hate as your evening comes to a close and you go back to the leaky tap to go for a rest you have a moment to yourself to think and have a moment to breathe and gain a little bit of calm you sense a presence sitting on the bed next to you you see the familiar dark green cloak i did i was never disappointed in the first place jester the hood still obscuring most of the face just the lower jaw and mouth visible i did you don't need to see me to know that i'm with you and you're free now as long as you continue to be that wonderful little seed of joy and chaos in the world i'll be walking behind you the entire time not within my power no i do appreciate your artwork you're improving keep meeting new people tell them of what we have accomplished we want more friends don't we do you think i could have a look at that strange relic the one that you procured from that xhorhasian warrior he extends his hand and takes it and looks to it you see the side of the mouth of the traveler curl into an amused smirk curious curious indeed i don't think i've ever come across magic like that i don't know i've not come across it before i'm interested definitely be careful with that things that are unknown are notably able to draw dangerous and inquiring eyes and minds i think you should there are more like you out there well i am worth worshipping after all but you are my favorite i hope that maybe you could all meet someday perhaps sometime next year for the day of the zenith in undillar yes i think that they all speak to me the hand reaches out and touches yours you can feel the contact but it's strangely cold you blink and the traveler's gone all right yeah

and beyond returning what do you wish to do you guys have regathered in the leaky tap the menagerie coast you don't are you drinking from a caduceus mug i love that that's amazing you see as the blade now is this unique merger of the falchion shape and size but now holds this golden tint of the summer's dance it curves towards the edge and has a slight pointed jagged arch in the back that the scimitar had previously held but still contains the barnacle-encrusted pattern across the hilt and there in the center still is the central yellow gleaming eye no that's what would have happened if it actually came out of your pee-hole anyway best use of sending ever yasha's somewhere just going like (sighs) all right have you guys decided to start making your way to the menagerie coast yeah easy
