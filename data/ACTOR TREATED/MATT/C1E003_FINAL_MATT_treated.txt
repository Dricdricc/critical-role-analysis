hey everyone sorry about that little issue there but thank you for your patience i appreciate that going back over what had transpired previously so the party was hired to go into kraghammer seeking lady kima of vord who is a renowned folk hero a halfling paladin of much renown following bahamut the platinum dragon of justice and good who went on a vision quest apparently seeing some sort of evil brewing beneath kraghammer and went on her own to seek it and destroy it hasn't been seen for many weeks-- months even -- since and so the party has then gone into kraghammer to attempt to locate her after some conversing some brawling some interesting circumstances they found information that she disappeared into the mithril mines just underneath the lower circle of kraghammer they've since battled a few creatures apparently these strange monstrosities are coming out of the mines recently and they've had dwarven miners being taken and disappearing they charged into the mines found one of the series of tunnels that had broken into the mines from some other source encountered a few umber hulks were ambushed by some duergar which are subterranean dark ashen grey-- -- messed-up dwarves and an intellect devourer which proceeded to blast grog reduce his intelligence to zero and leave him catatonic and brain-dead and that's where we left off but we'll pick up that in a second let's go ahead and continue our introductions we had taliesin now we have marisha-- mm-hm orion yeah esquire yes the third he's really really good yeah liam who is not here yet but will be here shortly but-- he is peeing and what's-- and when he returns we'll get to his introduction as well and ashley johnson who has missed the last couple of games because she's been filming when she returns will be playing pike who is a cleric our gnome cleric liam's arrived huzzah exactly it's okay we've had technical difficulties so before we start too just a couple quick announcements a couple cool games that have come out recently that some of us have been involved with today was the launch of pillars of eternity a completely awesome kind of successor to baldur's gate both me and liam are part of that as well those who are playing through i voice aloth and adair liam if you remember any characters you voiced in it the guy he voices the guy we're scattered throughout the game so just-- if you can't get enough of us here you'll be really hating our voices by playing through that and then also orion-- yeah yeah oh yeah it's legit awesome so a lot of cool exciting things yeah that's right congrats all right well guys let's go get down to brass tacks so last we left off in a subterranean cavern with a deep underground river flowing through it pitch darkness you managed to survive a conflict with two umber hulks thanks to polymorph and some good tactics however grog then charged headlong towards a light source-- turned out to be a campfire across the way-- where he walked into an ambush by a few duergar which began shooting him with crossbow bolts and an intellect devourer made him brain-dead you guys-- kind of that's okay grog owns it-- as you can see by his glasses so (all laugh) so we're beginning now as grog has collapsed face down on the ground drooling the last of the duergar have been blown off the cliff or destroyed you all rush in and find grog not moving not responding not anything you slap him you slap him you slap him no response okay a 19 on the medicine okay a thorough goliath cavity search later-- you find some stray gold pieces the goliath physicality's a little difficult looking over him and there's very little physical damage to him he shrugs it off pretty easily there's no notable sign or anything other than the fact that his eyes aren't reacting to anything it looks like he is catatonic nope all right what bits of the currently thawing chunks of it-- blasted apart by tiberius' glacial blast-- it appears to be tougher than normal but very similar to gray matter in appearance and texture other than these strange kind of reddish-brown bestial legs that were once attached to its mid-section are now blown apart and cast to the ground the whole texture seems very slimy and rubbery and it's much larger than any natural brain should be it's probably-- when it was all in one piece it would have been roughly about the size of a small dog do you it's terrible yeah yeah you're currently basically on the precipice of a large cavern that has multiple layers as the river kind of cascades off into multiple waterfalls as far as you can see-- which isn't far good because there's no other light source beyond you guys-- the cavern just continues indefinitely for a good 60 feet and then just vanishes into darkness well currently you're holding a barely alive duergar hostage it's a female you do you speak undercommon first thing you note too it is female and it takes a moment to register that because she is also bald on top nasty pale kind of sunken face eyes are completely clouded over and white no pupils teeth are kind of yellow and gnarled and sharp you guys are awesome thank you so much oh yeah bald yes (hisses) no she's got a huge shoulder wound i didn't do anything that was the brain's work (chuckles) took care of your friend he's gone now he's all dead inside kaputski just creating a mess bury your dead weight ugh gah she's got one hit point profusely from the shoulder okay so (gunshot) and the flash goes off the sound of blast echoes throughout the entirety of the cavern you can hear (echoing gunshot) cascade off he takes the barrel slams it into the shoulder and the sizzling sound as she reaches back in pain make an intimidation check 21 all right she's now like breathing heavy she's trying to move her face out of the way but she can't seem to avoid the mystical arcane finger pokes (all laugh) you fell surface-slime you've already fallen and the master's gathered the sheep you shall all be harvested for k'varn you can roll history if you like k'varn is the one that rules these caverns the one who guides us to take the surface back no k'varn likes to tinker with the fleshlings yes looks over her shoulder back towards the darker part of the cavern where you guys haven't traversed deep deep you'll see argh my life is already forfeit i'm just relishing your faces for they will be gnarled and twisted soon enough you break her-- (laughs) you see a moment of recognition in the female duergar's face and it's-- there was a halfling aye she was foolish enough to come down here alone she's dead now we've taken her life and it was delicious make an intimidation check (laughs) go ahead and roll dice you yes 19 okay go ahead and roll again i'm giving you the advantage on the roll because he has a blade to her now still 14 she laughs and says your friend's dead all is lost you came for nothing make an insight check you can also make an insight check as well 24 she is definitively lying through her teeth just to hurt you what she looks at you for a second goes regardless we have her she's down below and soon enough you'll see you'll see what shall become of this halfling an ichor spray comes across as the body goes limp in your hands you kinda let it tumble over the waterfall um now you guys are standing over grog in this kind of makeshift-- -- camp site the embers of the fire kinda going low at this point it's at some point in the evening yes all right from where you are (creepy music sound effect) there are where you came in through-- strange things afoot echo in the silence there's the entrance you came in across the way there appears to be another cavern that you can kinda see the entrance to those are the only proper openings into this giant chamber otherwise there's just the giant over-arching cave that you guys are just getting into just pushing through so-- duergar go ahead and make an investigative check okay glancing about you pull roughly 125 gold pieces between the three corpses of the duergar well two corpses because one of them is gone it washed downstream yeah you do however find on one of them a gnarled implement of some kind whether it be scavenged or not it's of a strange like almost bleached bone ivory that comes to a point at one end it is pretty go ahead and roll arcana scanlan it is a very pretty something 24 want to hand it over to him you go ahead and you eventually find one of the corpses of the umber hulk it takes you a good 25 minutes to eventually carve through its relatively thick hide chitinous exterior you put the head on a makeshift spike and it is now there on display you feel accomplished you head back keyleth-- -- as you are taking first watch you notice that the campsite that the duergar were using where you guys are currently resting for the evening it's been there for a while and it looks like the duergar have repurposed it the fire-- the stones that were set up around the actual fire pit have probably been there for quite some time and were set up very uniformly and very well placed right above you on one of the stone walls you see what appears to be a strange very well carved symbol hard to recognize it go ahead and make a religion check it's just a really interesting carving on the wall just right above where you guys are currently residing-- not quite catching your attention but it seems to have some significance and it's fresh it's not like an ancient symbol that's been there it maybe could have been there for more than a week or two okay okay it's very big it's like four feet by three feet all right all right all right you guys begin to set up for the next watch after the first hour-- yep anti-life shell eventually fades first hour without any impact or issue okay the next few hours go by without incident well there's a lot of mineral deposits this place in particular it's definitely because of the heavy river flow for a long time a lot of the area near the river itself very smooth stone a lot of kind of accumulated deposits of various elements you also catch the strange carved symbol right atop your guys' camp it's a very fancy symbol you guys finish your watch-- it's on one of the large cave surfaces near where you guys are camping nothing catches your attention-- --- at the moment no unfortunately you finish your watch without issue next up watch this is the last third and final watch you guys are now going through okay okay the three of you guys keep watch after they're napping occasionally you have to adjust grog 'cause you're not sure if he's still breathing to make sure he's still-- religion right now you just rolled oh okay you are familiar with this symbol specifically because of your background that is the symbol of bahamut it is the symbol of the platinum dragon and you ascertain it was probably-- yes and it was probably used as part of some sort of a protection ritual k'varn using the thing you wrote k'varn as you are having this discussion you feel a slight rumble in the ground some of the rocks nearby the loose pebbles begin to vibrate and move around you guys are all clustered in the small camp do you still have your light source up light or you just the campfire yeah you are-- outside of just maybe 15 20 feet you see nothing it's pitch black a few moments pass the rumbling has subsided okay all wake up-- you've all slept for the evening-- --and from the points of your unused-- -- healing dice you're pretty much all at max health so all right it is momentarily distracting but eventually you phase it out all right so as you guys-- (all laugh) you take a bit of earth from a pouch that you keep of your-- -- home tribe where you grew up you scattered some of it around grog who is now laid on his back whose arms and legs all equally stretched out no you're still clothed (all laugh) as this is the first time you've attempted a magic of this type you close your eyes and take in the earth's essence as a druid being connected to nature is where you draw your divine energy you kind of-- -- almost take from the vibration of the nearby caverns that you felt and come in tune with the way the earth the planet itself shifts and moves you-- you use that to give constitutional strength to the physical form of grog in hopes of restoring him as vex awkwardly fumbles over the-- -- the overtly sized goliath- go ahead and-- you do yes roll a d20 add your wisdom modifier no assistance on this this only affects a d20 roll what'd you roll what'd you roll it's a d8 as is yes yeah you have advantage on the roll yeah what's the total plus 12 29 that should be enough so (laughs) in this circumstance you complete the ritual there's a brief glow of all the-- the dirt that you'd scattered around grog and you can see his form kind of take in a deeper breath his chest expands and as it does his eyes which currently stare off in space begin to clarify and crystallize and his brow quivers for a second and you see a little bit of life return to his face grog your sight focuses as the party is gathered around you looking down upon your currently stretched out physical form in a cavern you're very confused as a note too just so you guys are aware 20 is the stat cap for normal physical stats however magical items can then bump that up higher just answering a chat room question that's okay don't worry about it it's back to normal (laughs) at which point you look over and trinket is there off to the side notably excited that you're moving again (bear noises) comes over and nuzzles up against you for a moment you guys all healed overnight you did not get an opportunity to use any of your stuff so you're currently still at the hit points you were plus you naturally healed just from the evening's rest four hit points you can roll up to nine whatever your level is that's how many dice you can use but that's for the day once you've used those nine hit dice to heal yourself naturally you are maxed out outside of magical healing or potions she pointed towards the rest of the cavern which you have just stepped into lady kima go ahead and make a survival check which you have advantage on simply for tracking depending on what you're tracking what are your favored enemies so you would not have advantage on this that's okay what did you roll okay all right for that i will go ahead and give you advantage on that this is technically considered the crust of the underdark yeah yeah i think it's chapter four 19 okay as you guys begin to move you can find like there is this waterfall which you can hear in the distance there are a number of cascading crashing water sounds so you imagine there are multiple layers as this cavern descends down into the darkness what are you using for a light source by the way the cavern comes alive with bright white light using that you take a while and you begin to just keep tabs on the surface area of this cavern as you begin to move further down you find some portions where you can climb down to the lower levels the first thing you notice is there are definitive signs of struggle or intense running towards the direction that you came from meaning things were seemingly either fleeing or heading that direction very quickly some of them appear to be more recent than others you also begin to see a few partially decomposed corpses of various goblinoid creatures you find two goblins just slain just cut open and off to the side you see some of the skin is pulled tight against the bone as a lot of it is just rotting from the cave itself not a very great smell there have been small pockets of struggle the more you progress down this way you also find some drag marks that are similar to what you saw back in the mines and as you move forward and the light begins to open up you can see small pockets of that red stone that's used to light a bunch of kraghammer you can start seeing elements of it embedded in the walls of the cavern ahead and just faintly giving this reddish glow and the outline of some shapes you begin to step into the outskirts about 60 feet ahead of what looks like a series of huts small stone structures cobbled together with small stone and stacked on each other simple driftwood and broken pieces of scavenged material put into small buildings it's a very kinda ramshackle village underground yeah it's a certain amount of crystal that this mountain range seems to naturally produce that just inherently it seems such at the point where you're close to it currently you have to use his light source to see much of anything this village doesn't have any but near the walls and the edges of the cavern you can see the gentle outline of this whole size of it it's immense from this view you don't see any movement that's up to you you guys stealth ahead the two of you follow each other and you get to the outskirts and you can now see in the center of this a number of the buildings and huts have been smashed or destroyed you can see more and more of these goblin corpses strewn across the ground you can see some of these tents seem to have rags or something stuffed into one that's not too far ahead of you there's two goblins near you apparently slashed open similar wounds it's just from the first glance stepping forward nope not from this perspective you guys moved ahead and you barely have any light source of your own you're having to deal with just the outskirts of his light spell not in the center of the village those are only towards the outside walls of the cavern you can walk off to the side so you take a few minutes to walk off to the very edge of the cavern the rock is less of an actual stone that you can pull more than it's a cluster of-- almost like a vein of the stone in the actual wall it would take a while for you to actually hack it out of the side it can be done but it will take you a while okay okay so as you guys are aware one of the magical items that was designed by tiberius early in the campaign are essentially these gem enchanted earrings that activate as a message spell between a few party members he made a few of them you're essentially whispering into each other's ears but it only works within a certain range a straight up with a big ol'-- 500 feet is the maximum length so you guys approach slowly the light source opens up and you see now a multitude of goblin bodies strewn about the open area of this village you can see there are actually piles of corpses stuffed into some of these huts in the sides that aren't goblin you can see what looks like a few small dwarven bodies piled up on the side as you kinda glance over you look some of them are partially eaten like they have been stripped for meat make an investigation check okay as you look through the building there are piles of bone sinew and metal at this point the dwarven bodies are mostly decomposed entirely what remnants have not been stripped off it for food as far as what you guys can tell you discover two things one of the dwarves has a set of very very finely crafted leather armor to pull it off the corpse is going to destroy it and going to be a not very interesting affair but it does look to have survived the horrible conditions under here you also note specifically vex that not the dwarven corpses but a number of the goblin corpses you come across some of them have a uniform wound a number of these goblin corpses have this terrible puncture wound in the skull in the forehead there just an opening wound about that big around and for each one of these wounds-- for as much flesh is on these goblins there doesn't appear to be anything inside it's very possible your finger goes inside you reach around there are elements of brain matter within there but even that has become very gelatinous partially decomposed in its own right almost like a slime but sure enough the inside of the cranium itself is mostly vacant trinket is back with the party you recall that lady kima was specifically a paladin of bahamut that camp seems to have been hers while she was traipsing through the tunnels fox's cunning would give you benefit i believe to-- i mean essentially-- it would be enhance ability for wisdom i'm pretty sure it's intelligence okay there you go right no you're correct so essentially it would be an enhance ability for intelligence yes oh for the potion's effect that would be anywhere from four to eight hours you're not quite sure so you leave behind the pile of dwarven corpses you leave behind the goblin corpses with the wounds and start seeing more of a pattern okay so you put the hood on and light that up very good leaving the leather armor behind no it would be nasty pulling it off a corpse it's dwarf-sized okay so you shake off the element-- -- the remaining elements of the dwarven corpse just falls off out of the armor you have to kind of shake it and eventually all of it escapes-- make an arcana check it does have a magical aura all right it appears to be a simple but powerful enchantment it is a pair of studded leather armor with a +2 enchantment to your ac it comes up to your elbow and then given a moment it fits to your form yes it is considered-- it works as studded leather armor but that gives him a +2 bonus to his armor class on top of that yes no not checks specifically i mean-- let me double-check it yeah we have enough food guys thank you so yeah unfortunately it helps ability checks those are not considered saving throws you cast stoneskin on yourself all right stoneskin's on you tiberius you guys keep pushing forward all right as you begin to press through the goblin ghost town-- which you do you catch off in the distance another faint moving light source everyone roll a stealth check yes okay as you all buckle down and be as quiet as you can-- you begin to see-- no noted that's okay that's okay it's a group check in which case people offset each other's difficulty so you seem to be comfortable in the stillness of the moment best you can see in the distance you see figures shifting moving away from you many figures a fairly large group of seeming to be humanoid figures moving steadily away from you yeah using your same stealth rolls you push forward yes best you could tell as you guys start reaching the outskirts of the opposite side of this small goblin village that has been completely sundered you see a cliff but a large cliff the actual surface here comes to a very direct end and seems to just disappear into a dark abyss there is a singular ten-foot-wide rope bridge that is bolted into the side of this cliff and stretches out across this giant crevasse for what-- you can't see the other side it very much has that kind of a feel it just goes on a for a good 60 70 feet and then darkness and you can see what looks to be a cluster of about 12 to 13 duergar-- -- making their way in lines of two across this bridge amongst them they have chained up three dwarf miners that they are also dragging across the bridge they don't appear to put up much of a fight in their current circumstance ten feet from what you can see it looks about 12-ish they do it's a very faint light it's like a small cluster of the red stone that's been mined and put into a spherical element and is hanging from a chain like a lantern make a perception check best you can tell and from your knowledge of bats and their existence they generally live in caverns that have readily available openings to the outside world where they do their nocturnal hunting this is a very very deep cavern that does not have easy access to the surface bats are probably not a good chance in this cavern a hand suddenly mysteriously reaches into the bag you pull out the carpet and lay it out at this point in time they're a little over halfway across the bridge which you can see it swaying in a very uncomfortable way you hear the stretching of ropes as you hear the rope just tense as the bridge is slowly swaying so you guys lay out the carpet the two of you get on laura and the three of you guys hop on and it's probably big enough for the three of you it's about the right size the carpet begins to lift off and you kind of will it towards-- are you going straight over the bridge or are you taking a side route okay so you guys you take up over first off the three of you guys make a stealth check maneuvering on a flying carpet is a different type of locomotion okay so as soon as you reach the edge of the crevasse immediately the air itself is warmer and there's actually a bit of a strange breeze blowing up from underneath this giant crevasse and you look down and you can see faintly light sources long thin trickling streams of what looks like molten rock way down below it's at least a thousand feet down don't fall it's very bad the air itself has a very sulfurous smell there's a lot of various strange chemical scents that's a bit pungent to the nose there's a lot of chemical reactions that are causing this atmosphere it's a little difficult to take any air at first you have to get adjusted it is a very very deep cavern below when you look behind you can see the river that's been cascading through this cavern goes rocketing off the edge and disappears into the darkness below are you keeping your distance or-- okay you guys push forward keeping at a safe distance you eventually follow them across the crevasse and you can see now them entering what looks like a shanty town of tents and small stone structures better built than the goblin village that was previously there but it looks almost like a temporary or pseudo-temporary series of homes for the duergar in this section there's a bunch of military tents and cloth pup tents put up in sections you can see some easy-to-construct one- or two-day constructions of stone buildings very square very rigid and dwarven in their design more for utility that any sort of visual presentation or beauty there are also a series of these- -- of these redstone-- yeah it's legit guys a series of these redstone torches that they were holding or these lanterns are hung up all throughout the village on these giant poles that have been placed in areas to give a little bit of an occasional light source throughout this entire camp how big the camp at a first glance you can only check out elements of it from your distance you're only making out shapes from how far back you guys are without actually getting inside you gather you've probably seen throughout just this portion that you've come into anywhere from 30 to 40 duergar moving through as well as a few larger shapes you swear you catch one or two other very large humanoid hulking figures just (thudding noises) stepping through the camp the range is getting a little broken you can hear-- the words are coming through but-- you've just now crested-- the crevasse the other side and you're feeling uncomfortable pushing further forward because you're now starting to get a lot more eyes in your vicinity looking around there are no side caverns this is actually a pretty smooth cavern that kind of circles around where this camp is built there is one large tunnel entrance on the opposite side that continues past you can't see anything beyond the fact that the tunnel-- the walls kind of convene you can see a little bit of a tunnel opening and just darkness beyond that a tunnel on the other side and where the land starts there's a giant portion of the cavern that continues and then closes off kind of pinches to the entrance to where the camp is the camp is completely filling this side of the cross it's blocking pretty much the whole not without going through or over the city correct do you want to swoop down and check okay you swoop down and-- --the rock there-- (whoosh) -- the warm air is still kinda bothering you in general you find yourself kinda taking your cloak and putting it over your mouth just to get the scent out the side of the rock surface is worn through what looks like maybe a possible river that also came from the other side that has since dried out so you can see there is while no water on this side of the crevasse a lot of the stone has been smoothed just through rapid water running for thousands of years possibly but there are no visible openings or other additional caverns on this rock surface okay they're long past the bridge they're inside the city proper at this point all right all right scanlan as you go ahead make your way in towards the city go ahead and make a stealth check with advantage 18 okay you push kind of falling behind the main group and they're heading towards this kind of more or less a loose thoroughfare in the center of this town you can see a few duergar coming out and kind of inspecting as they enter speaking in a language you don't understand asking questions some of them are coming out and slapping the dwarf captives as they go across or spitting on them the dwarves look very broken and unhappy with the circumstance but brimming with anger you see a couple of them are like true dwarves they haven't given in to it they're just looking for an option or a moment to get some vengeance they're stripped of all armor and weaponry they're brought through some of the alleys and paths between these pup tents and these stone structures you can see there are some of the hulking figures there are two trolls wandering amongst these duergar now you've encountered trolls before but these trolls-- -- also have a similar pupil-less clouded over white-eye appearance-- as you begin to follow them further in you manage to see two ogres that are currently stationed across this main open center location in this campsite and both of these ogres also have the same pupil-less white glazed-over look to their eyes and they're both just kind of glancing about the rest of the duergar are in the process of constructing other tents some of them look like they're actually in the process of forging weaponry it feels like it's a war camp it's definitely preparing for something however in the center of this main area you do see there is a wooden platform about 20 foot by 20 foot that is raised up and you see a group of about six duergar that are all wearing very intricate black iron plate armor and they're all just sitting on the outskirts of this platform all the duergar seem to have that natural look to their eyes as well as the party you've been following enters the center of this vicinity make another stealth check with advantage all right you kind of step off to the side a duergar steps out of one of the tents near you and you just barely manage to pull out of the way without making any sort of squeak or noise he goes by (sniffs) and begins stepping out looking intently for something but right past you by inches as he walks past you look over again to the camp and you can now see toward the very back end of this open midsection by this platform there is one large stone construct it looks like a makeshift barracks has been placed there with double stone doors that are currently opened and you can see two figures stepping out of the stairs that lead into these barracks heading towards the main platform they step up onto the platform one of which is a very very well-decorated duergar who's wearing similar blackened plate armor as the other kind of elite guard that you saw surrounding this platform but with gold and silver scrolling on it a long tattered dark dark purple cape and has a nasty scar across the cheek that leads into this kind of gnarled grey beard as it steps forward you can see sheathed off to its back in a large scabbard a gargantuan-- for a dwarf especially-- two-handed sword that should be unwieldy for a creature of its size but nevertheless looks dangerous and a creature next to it is-- -- not so small not dwarven actually very tall lanky long black and purple robes a hood obscuring its features stepping roughly two feet behind it as they both step on to the platform to address the rest of the guard and the approaching party of duergar dwarves you've been following you can see some conversation happening but you're too far away to really make out anything that's being said do you want to move closer do you speak undercommon then you-- it all sounds gibberish to you okay but you see some conversation happening this seemingly officious duergar this general that steps out and commands the attention in the room makes a few gestures shouts out to amongst the other nearby not quite sure but you get the idea he's giving orders or directions the war party then begins to pull the slaves back away and-- the captives begins pulling them away toward another section on the side as it does the tall lanky figure which you now get the sense that it's not really walking it's just kind of drifting-- -- holds its hand out this long long finger and lanky hand and as it does every single duergar in the vicinity whatever it was doing stops in place and all turn and look at it as one at which point this creature brings its fingers in a beckoning gesture loosely in your direction for a split second you feel your heart at your throat and the entire back of your body stands on pins and needles as one of the duergar carrying one of the captives begins to pull one of the dwarven captives back towards the platform as it does the dwarf who is giving kind of a fight and looks nervous looks over at the figure and its arms go limp to its side and it begins to walk out of its own volition taking two three steps steps onto the platform and approaches this tall lanky figure with the hood and long robes behind it as it does its hand reaches out and caresses the side of this dwarf's face this dwarf seems to have given up all sense of fight or any sort of conflict and just stares up into this darkened hood as the tall lanky creature reaches out with both hands and pulls the dwarf forward you see these terrible purple tentacles come writhing out of the front of the hood wrapping around the head of the dwarf pulling it into it as the hood falls back you see this horrible smooth purplish-blue hairless head these sunken yellowish-green eyes as the tentacles wrap around the dwarf's head and pulls it into its mouth there's a brief struggle and then the dwarf's arms fall limp to its side at which point the tentacles unravel from its head the creature pulls back a bit of ichor and dwarf blood dripping from what looks like a lamprey's toothy maw and then thrusts the body to the ground with a thud as it falls lifeless to the ground a horrible bored hole in its forehead the creature then draws its hood back up releases its hand in a cursory fashion and all the duergar whip back around and continue the motions they were previously going towards as the two dwarven captives that now remain look completely stunned their faces white with fear as they are being dragged off in this state the tall lanky figure gives a nod to the duergar general who gives a nod as well then to turn around and walk back the two other captives you follow them they both are pulled to-- essentially to a western side if you look overhead this is where the barrack building is this is where you entered and this is the main area they are pulled off to the western side here they are taken to a large tent as they are pulled in they close it behind them you can hear some muffles and some growling from the inside of the tent do you speak dwarven should be on the lower left-hand of your player sheet you hear what sounds like guttural dwarvish being shouted angrily cursing from the interior and a few other dwarven voices also joining in-- more than two you hear some horrible sick thuds and some impacts and some cries of pain and eventually the five duergar dragging the captives walk out carrying cudgels at their side still dripping with fresh blood they kind of go amongst their own business from there it's just an opening tent not on the street okay make a stealth check with advantage (all laugh) you maneuver your way out back the way you came best you can remembering-- you get disoriented in general trying to find your way out go ahead and make a survival check 17 okay you take a moment orient yourself looking about the cavern this is a very confusing network and the passages you've gone-- you paid more attention to what's happening-- kind of yeah you nearly get lost twice but eventually find your way back to the southern-portion entrance of this war camp you can just see the crevasse and you start getting the familiar scent of that sulfurous wind that was billowing out from underneath you step out a few more feet and you can see the edge of the bridge where the rest of you have finally come to converge on the other side of the crevasse you know what let's go ahead and take this moment to have a bathroom break guys as sort of the halfway mark we will continue this in just a moment in the meantime take a rest take ten or 11 minutes we are going to play our character backgrounds for those who haven't seen it we will be back here in about ten minutes guys -- for her as well so look forward to that some point in the near future as we left off the party had just reconvened on the other side of this gargantuan crevasse in the underdark after scanlan had stealthed into the duergar war camp witnessed a number of dwarven captives being taken somewhere however one of which was devoured by some strange creature left brainless and dead on the platform in the center outside of a giant barracks-type building you reconvened and expressed all of this information to the party intelligence you probably call it a mind flayer no roughly a little shorter than him but taller than most this would be an intelligence check why are you guys so awesome so best you can ascertain you've never heard the term mind flayer but in your people you've heard stories and tales growing up about something referred to as an illithid a nasty entity from beyond with a d as far as you know all that you've heard is that they were considered ghost stories as a kid to keep you from wandering dark caves and spaces they would take your minds and you thought this whole time that that was just a fable that it was just a tale but you do know that they normally aren't solitary they usually keep company of a colony the one lengthy creature the bridge now that you've traversed it it's ten feet wide and runs about a little over 200 feet or 250 feet in length you get on top of the carpet and you will it to begin to shift and the carpet around you lifts but you are anchoring it to the ground she can try it's a very big rug what's your strength it won't be cumbersome necessarily from what it looks like it is rope and stone platforms like slats slats of stone that then the rope is tied around it's a very very thick hefty twine well advantage on dex ability checks like acrobatics things like that sleight of hand stealth okay so-- all right so so inspiration dice to vax and who else vax and who else gets inspiration dice scanlan okay so both of you guys have a d8 of inspiration dice you can spend okay there you go okay so before this happens where's everyone placed you guys-- you guys are across the bridge where's the rest of you okay about 20 feet off from the edge on the goblin side there is one outcropping of like a large stalagmite that you could probably get behind on the goblin side oh do you wanna be on their side your side meaning the side that the war camp is on right there's the goblin side which is where you guys first went through there's the bridge and then there's the war camp side laura and all right so you're on-- goblin side for you goblin side for grog-- goblin side for percy setting up the bad news your crazy gun and scanlan as well you can do that it's up to you turn into birds she's a druid right okay so what are you going to make the terrain look like what is your alteration okay okay so like an additional 40 or so feet out from the actual-- okay the actual ceiling is maybe about 120 feet up so it might be a little hard to do that and cause a cave-in-type illusion okay cool so you go ahead and you cast hallucinatory terrain-- you now see an additional 40 feet of the cliff stretching out-- and you can actually see that the bridge looks attached to it it's a very very convincing illusion and you kind of have to remind yourself that it's an illusion just so you don't fall for it either all right so you're kind of chilling in the middle of the bridge all right the rest of you are-- -- on the other side-- outside of the bridge okay so you're off the bridge now all right so now tiberius vax you guys walk across the bridge keeping grip both side rails feeling it rock to and fro from the continuous warm bellowing of wind up from the cavern beneath you eventually you bring your way across what looks like you should be stepping on terrain is still the bridge and it takes you a minute to adjust to the fact that you're still going across the bridge but it looks like rocky terrain eventually you make it to the other side and you grab purchase on stone looking ahead of you you can see about 60 feet ahead of you the outskirts of the war camp all right both of those are concentration spells you can only have one of those up at any given point in time okay so you're now floating up okay okay okay all right so you're now just kinda hovering above the bridge now you-- you feel the sudden surge of magical energy through your body like adrenaline just pumping into your system all right been awhile since you've used those (laughs) all right oh okay you shuffled these right all right this will be very very interesting so currently one of the cards bursts and you can see rising up from its energy this awful-looking humanoid skeletal undead creature with long golden red robes with this gnarled gold crown and these glowing blue eyes and just pure arcane energy across this horribly gnarled skeletal face there stands this hideous-looking lich cackling to itself the other one (poof) and you see before you a kind of -- it's nice through the smoke you see what looks like some sort of a human kind of long long-fighting warrior grizzled ready to fight has a big old longsword out armored up in scalemail one eye is kinda wounded and he just kinda sits there and growls with his blade ready the third card from the smoke appears a red-skinned dragonborn with long blue robes and a staff with a glowing beam of light on it you see an exact duplicate of tiberius now standing there as the three illusions stand (all laugh) your cards are now spent correct right but i mean the actual cards don't go back in the deck they do okay all right never mind okay as you shout out the card illusion appears you see about five or six duergar kind of look out from a nearby tent and go-- and then start running toward the center of the town about 20 seconds pass and then you start hearing this (boom boom boom boom) it sounds like a drum beat at this point you now see about 16 duergar come running out from the center of town armored weapons drawn a few with crossbows two trolls and an ogre charging out you see the ogres holding this giant-- it looks like a stone slab for one of its clubs and the two trolls just come with their claws open rushing right towards you and the illusions all right as you're stepping back four of the duergar immediately take using their inertia pull and release javelins in your direction all right what's your ac all right you take two javelins-- all right good to know the first one strikes you in the torso for a total of 11 damage the other hits you for a total of eight damage no well you can choose to half one it's up to you you choose which one probably the higher one so it would be six 14 points of damage with these just javelins hitting you like oh that's right they have range (all laugh) you can immediately see one of the trolls goes and just lunges forward and slashes the lich just passing through its form yeah it went through it kinda loses its footing for a second stops and kinda looks angry turns and starts slashing at it again yeah right at the precipice yeah so the troll kind of steps forward-- -- and the troll turns around and starts slashing the other one goes right for the veteran and (laughs) goes running right off the edge that was the troll just (falling sounds) the ogre goes running forward right towards you just their speed they're just the first ones to get there duergar have tiny legs this is what i'm saying what are you doing this is your reactionary part we're just taking-- this isn't a battle this is-- all right so you go charging back onto the bridge as you go running all right both trolls and the ogre have just gone off the side you hear them screaming as they tumble into the darkness about four duergar also go spilling over the side screaming as they tumble into the darkness the rest of them stop kind of look around and-- okay as this is happening you can now see some of the members of the duergar that are now at the edge are some of the elite guard with the blackened armor you saw they both kinda step forward and put their foot out feeling for purchase give a nod pull out their swords and start hacking at the bridge immediately from this distance it's gonna be a serious penalty you don't because you-- go for it go ahead and roll as you-- you're at disadvantage as your arrow (shooting sound) off you (gun misfiring sound) and there's a slight delay and you wonder why isn't it working and this horrible explosion sound bursts out as you can now see black and red smoke pouring out of the front of the barrel of bad news and it burns your hands for a second and you're like ah shit take a second to-- yeah however because you are unable to halt that both of those duergar take shots at the bridge both hit with their swords as you're running and pulling the carpet out-- -- the bridge is cut clean-- -- and begins to fall out from under you you go pulling out the-- this is gonna go ahead and be a dex check now you do all right you pull out the carpet as you're going to set it down as you feel the bridge beginning to like give out from under you you feel this creepy sensation pushing towards the back of your head you guys looking across you can see now a familiar cloaked figure has emerged (all gasp) go ahead and make a willpower saving throw willpower save it's at the top of your sheet of your stats above your stats on the right of your stats oh it's your wisdom saving wisdom seven as you are running you get the carpet out you leap onto it and your whole sense and awareness of your surroundings just fades from you you just feel your entire body going numb for a second and you just feel yourself falling falling back you go and swoop down fly you manage to-- he is just staring up at this moment okay you cast fly on him all right he is still just kind of standing there not doing anything as you finish casting the fly spell your fly spell dissipates because it's a concentration spell and you can have one at a given time okay you grab him as his whole weight goes onto you what's your strength go ahead and make an athletics check 21 you rush down diving you grab the back of his armor as you yank up on him you manage to just pull him across and get him to the other edge the flying carpet however has plummeted down in-- however tiberius swoops up you guys just see them both plummet into darkness and then flying up at the edge of the crevasse on your side tiberius clutching your brother currently just staring off into space and dropping him down with a dull sound the bridge slaps onto the side of the cavern it just disappeared into the darkness below about a minute passes or so you come back to your senses you can see across the way that there are a bunch of them just standing at the edge okay go for it okay go ahead and roll the damage across the way you can hear the resounding (gunshot) 20 points of damage nice you just see this blast of red and flame across the way and the figure is just knocked off its feet about ten feet back (all laugh) at this point in time you can now see the duergar looking up and backing away from the cliff side you come to the bridge which is just dangling off the side now you're on the goblin side and the bridge is just dangling down into darkness you only saw the one after all that you saw a few more kind of filter out from the town you have probably about 25 visible at that moment that have all backed okay you can shoot him but it's at disadvantage to shoot someone who's prone yeah a moment passes and he kind of drifts back up take another shot 15 unfortunately it does not hit at that distance with the darkness it's very hard to get your bead on him at that point so you (gunshot) fires off you can now see it drift away-- -- and all the rest of the duergar are now retreating into the city if you want to okay so you walk over to the edge and you kind of look across to the sides make a perception check natural 20 natural 20 laura & plus-- you glance over the side-- (all laugh) -- wrapped up in the ropes of the rope bridge it's the carpet it seems to be the carpet mm-hm mm-hm so all right you glide down along the base of the cut rope bridge and there just barely hanging on by just haphazardly falling and tangling itself in the ropes is the flying carpet as you float down you now get a little bit of a better view as your staff is lit you can see about another 150 feet down below you a little bit of a reflection of your light it's currently just kind of rippling and shifting it appears to be some sort of water surface below you about 150 feet down there are streaks of lava-- -- pouring like from the ceiling and portions of the wall-- -- but it's all just kind of pouring down and pooling at the edges and then cooling and you can see the waterfall it's cascading over the side-- -- is currently rushing past you at about 30 feet to your right and it seems to be splashing into this pool below you grab the magic carpet you roll it up make your way back up to the surface all right so the two of you get on the carpet you drift down and you begin to make your way down this giant crevasse as you get down the air gets warmer and warmer and you begin to see as you come down a good 600 feet now at this point into this much larger space than the one you guys are currently above it's like a giant triangular open cavern down here it kind of funnels up into where the bridge was as you look down there is definitely a large pool of water that leads off into a few other underground rivers that spill off into the mountainside itself there are sections of the wall where lava is pouring out where there seems to be some sort of a vent or some sort of opening into some magma reserve and there are about three of them that are pouring out and kind of drifting down one of them is pooling and cooling as it hits the water and it's just kind of this perpetually glowing mass of slow-growing rock there also appears to be one that is just continuing to flow that leads kind of back in the direction where you guys came but underneath there's one big lava pool that is spilling and then kind of giving a little bit of light to the inside of a tunnel that continues further down at a decline the opposite side-- that's okay on the opposite side you can see there's a small outcropping and a smaller waterfall that is pouring out of the side of the mountain like another sea is now meeting the river underneath and that is just kind of cascading out from the side of the rock dropping about 30 or 40 feet and hitting the edge of the rock pool on cthulhu's side yeah okay just so you're aware the pool is about 600 feet across (all laugh) right so you can part elements of it but like it is a large large large body of water okay another thing you notice is there are two trolls and an ogre currently trying to stay afloat as one of them just (sucking sound) gets pulled under the water yes you begin moving the water to the sides and you begin to cool some of the lava flows you can see the glowing red magma begin to cool to a dark black and become solid as it does you can see parts of it crack as the magma's still pushing out but you're definitely staunching the flow yeah there is a tunnel that seemed-- the opening leads to the back and there's a waterfall that is pouring out from that side waterfall the lava flow is going down the opposite direction yeah like a large opening that continues further down okay so the best-- the water that you gather from this you force into a quick geyser in that direction as it sprays across the front you can see it begins to cool some of the magma it's a pretty hefty flow you manage to slow it and you do cool parts of it but it's gonna be difficult and take you a while if you're just constantly pushing water on it to give the flow any sort of serious stop you notice the lava flow doesn't coat the entire floor of the tunnel just a side of it it's almost like there's some portion of it that is walkable adjacent to the lava okay the other troll (sucking sound) pulled beneath the surface yeah in the giant water pool in the bottom you were on the bridge when that happened you were-- right you were about loosely 80 feet across when it got you to the ceiling it's about 150 feet yeah there is on-- okay in a giant cavern there is towards the side where you guys kind of entered underneath where you first came in-- -- there is a descending large tunnel of which there are a series of lava flows that kind of pool into one river of lava that covers half of that path down-- correct towards the other side the-- the cavern ends and there is a waterfall pouring out of the side of the wall-- -- that just kind of flows down-- no no there is a-- there-- well there is essentially a hole where water is pouring out of the flying carpet can't carry grog on his own all right so what you ladies hop on the flying carpet laura & (laughs) so as you guys are discussing this-- the two ladies have leaped on the flying carpet-- they shout as they disappear into the darkness below the cavern okay all right so you pull out your lantern as the two of you are going down towards the water-- -- the rest of you kind of stand at the edge of the crevasse going 'uh' all right so as you guys float down-- -- the two trolls that were missing-- the ogre is not anywhere to be seen -- there's just a slight ripple in the water's surface right as you staunch the water supply of this waterfall it just kind of holds it in place with enough of a force that the water coming out is being balanced by the force you're putting back on it it's just kind of holding it there however as the water vanishes beneath where the waterfall was you can see an actual small tunnel that's carved into the rock-- all right okay okay both of you guys roll stealth they have advantage on stealth check yeah plus your dex all right you guys move-- are you staying on the carpet okay so you go back down-- so as you guys are-- no you guys stepped off the carpet she said and you transformed began stealthing in as you're doing that you turn around and see tiberius had rolled the carpet and is currently taking it away so you guys are on the bottom of this crevasse and tiberius disappears into the darkness okay well go ahead and roll-- this would be survival for tracking just to get an idea for anything around you see you do see some scratches into the mud of the surface there that lead into a tunnel you see drag marks you see footprints and that's the best you can make out at this in this point in time but the footprints appear to be dwarven or dwarf-sized in nature the scratch marks are across the ground it looks just like fingers being pulled through no that you can tell no from what you can see there's no light source in there so you take a lantern and put it inside the tunnel goes back about 25 feet and then stops it's just a little alcove you see within the tunnel a series of skeletons or bodies that are partially decomposed and you see what looks like a pile of rags in the corner it's very-- well the actual tunnel is maybe about five to eight feet across and it would not be able to fit an umber hulk as you step inside and put your hands across the walls-- taliesin and --what you do notice is the walls are solid this appears to have been carved out over time and as you move in you begin to see the rags and the pile of rags is less a pile of rags and more some sort of humanoid curled up in on the inside unconscious asleep or dead not moving you can't tell from here it's just like kind of curled over in the corner i think you might you're not saved against smugness percy she can yeah a giant eagle i believe you can while you guys are having this conversation 'cause you're talking to each other-- -- the thing in the corner kind of rouses and shoots up out of sudden fear movement looking about you see dressed in rags-- you guys are seeing this for the first time but it's familiar smooth head purplish and blue in color a series of tentacles in its mouth a giant scar drawn across one of its eyes and it looks filthy and it looks desperate and just looks at the two of you and you hear a sudden voice in your minds no movement just conversation saying what who are you he puts up a hand like this and you see there's a flicker of arcane energy and a barrier appears between you and this creature and just looks make a persuasion check (all laugh) okay nine total it holds its place and the voice again hits your mind and says how did you find me what is your purpose here you will die if you try anything i will not fall here i will not die here you can see as you get a better look at it it definitely has a large scar across part of its face and it looks to be wearing remnants of a robe similar to what scanlan was describing however it is tattered it's dirtied sullied by the elements and god knows what other liquids it also has this strange kind of metallic skull cap that's currently placed around its head and it just leave me in peace then or give me a reason not to slay you where you stand there's a slight change in mood you just feel revenge make a persuasion check the barrier flickers and dissipates it reaches over and grabs what looks like a gnarled stick pulls itself up onto its legs now what looked like a small minuscule creature is now even in his terrible hunched form is standing extremely tall like scraping the top of this maybe eight-foot-tall ceiling in this tunnel it takes a step forward and says revenge you speak of revenge this is a language i wish to know very well it kind of gives you both a look and you hear this-- there's a slight lurching to it as it gives this horrible guttural-- (low chuckle) friends that's a word i haven't heard in a long time not one i take to heart but allies in time that i can understand take me to your allies you come down with the carpet at the edge of this opening you see keyleth you see vex both emerge with a horrible tentacle-faced gnarled being with a staff coming out with them looks about to you then looks at tiberius and says ignoring your question you have persuasion to the arcane we shall talk my name clarota no (all laugh) he carefully steps on the carpet once again like its tentacles are (slithering noises) moving around its mouth and its eyes are constantly darting it looks extremely nervous and almost like a cornered animal that's just barely being coaxed onto this journey you see with each step it takes there a slight flicker of arcane energy at the tip of its fingers like it's just prepared for anything to go terribly wrong it steps onto the carpet and goes take me to your allies it crosses its legs and sits on the carpet holding its staff to its chest on the far corner staring at all of you and says go now you guys make your way up to the top eventually you see the carpet (whoosh) over the edge of the crevasse come down to a rest as your party has now brought with you the stuff of nightmares (all laugh) at which point it's leapt off at this point hovering about and you can see this crackle of fire in its hand and it goes (panicked noises) ally he kind of gives you this keen look of huh the least person i expected to ask a question (all laugh) no you see the hive is sick the mind that keeps us safe is no longer its own one an alien one has come and taken the mind hostage it has taken my people as its own playthings i was able to escape its mental grasp it reaches up and taps the metal on its head my people will not so easily escape its grasp they are now under the control of this creature that would be why i wish to have your alliance help me free our hivemind free my people (laughs) you definitely can i would put this in a group sense motive right now everyone roll sense motive in this would be your insight sorry pathfinder to fifth edition okay through your intense grasping this creature's disposition best you can as alien and unfamiliar as its mannerisms and speech and interests may be you get the feeling that it's speaking out of desperation and it's speaking out of genuine interest you've piqued it with the hint of revenge you've piqued it with the idea of alliance as opposed to being alone you get the feeling that it speaks the truth it genuinely is asking for your help in freeing its people from whatever is influencing their current actions clarota he gives you the dirtiest look you've ever received make a persuasion check (all laugh) he takes a sudden step forward towards you his tentacles-- (slithering noises) play this song make a persuasion check-- no a performance check 18 (all laugh) it then kind of-- its tentacles withdraw in such a way that gets you kind of off-put and the song comes to a halt i'd not heard a song i shall call upon you for more in the future now we talk about how we can kill k'varn and that's where we're going to go ahead and end it for today guys (all cheer) you've acquired for the moment a very curious ally yeah this will be an interesting branching point for next week (laughs) i hope you guys enjoyed that no combat you guys avoided quite a few possibilities for battle and that makes
