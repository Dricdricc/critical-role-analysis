didn't know they were announcing it at blizzcon it was just like oh on the opening ceremonies screen we were driving at the time i was like what is going-- oh blizzard can afford it h-o-w-i-t-t i don't know you've only seen it every week for the past two and a half years any rules to go over i figured that way we can go right into the narrative i'm trying to help it's her first time-- i'll shut up you get more frustrated from jumping off a cliff you become more bear-like cliffs can't kill bears no they don't that's why he has to keep telling us to fight them nope well no it's my plan to die in the first half of the show (sad bear growl) where am i at right now so looking down at the city from a distance okay hey you what's your name all right you seem a little fish out of water they call me trinket i am a member of vox machina saviors of this land tal'dorei and beyond you show me some respect who are you untrustworthy lot too to be with this guy you guys are all hanging out here at the edge of the bramblewood for no reason you may have heard right all right three new bears three large-sized normal bears i look around and i only see the three bears i look out do i still see vex or is she far enough away i was going to say first and foremost like i said my name's trinket i'm an adventurer i've been through dungeons of all sorts and kinds used to scaring things off that are dangerous in my way i have no idea what the hell you're all capable of you panda bear peddy tell me if we're going to go into this city and we're going to reap the rewards of this honey festival contest and i know where it is what do you have to bring to the table anyway as a fellow bear who has immediately stared at my junk i feel it is only right and fair that i accept your challenge (collision sounds) no i don't i have a four all right we need some muscle you've proven yourself worthy do i move a point for failing the roll so we got muscle what do you two brothers got at the table do we write our roles down on our sheet so it looks like we got a nice selection of abilities here so let me tell you what i have to offer one i know where the honey is two i know the people probably around it three-- let me tell you i've learned a few tricks from the two that raised me so that honey's going to be as good as ours all them banners you see out there beyond the walls this is a goddamned celebration there's a contest in there my ears picked it up in the middle of that contest area i can smell it there's all the honey we could ever hope for possibly even some bamboo keep your eyes open now all we have to do is get inside so if you're the brains what do you suggest i'm going to immediately go i think you're onto something cookie waffle liam las vegas peddy bear let's go get us some hats okay do we want to try and quickly and quietly make our way up behind mr las vegas surprise us we'll call you vegas you're vegas i'm just going to say be careful about too much mayhem we don't want people to suspect there's bears running wild around the city they might shut down the festival then the honey is-- so if you're going to do a scare do it and get out a one and a two as they're approaching him i'm talking to peddy there's not a whole lot of space in the necklace it's pretty cramped at least i have a pretty good view it's like a tiny television they're here all right how'd it go liam and you got hats and you smell like shit taliesin do you want a fez and another hat then that's a willy wonka hat so you can put three hats on a fowler this is worth the price of admission right here hey vegas good job with these hats there's no way anybody in the town of westruun would think that we're bears haven't we all what you got cookie that's right we've got some honey to get to come on guys stand up on our hind legs as vertical as we can it's going yeah i hear it peddy people don't eat spoons off the floor we're people just grab them hold them and we'll find a corner for you to have a feast i can't pinpoint the source of the honey any of you boys nobody is eating the gnome she will destroy you trust me sure we'll go with that that one we could go towards i'm going to approach and tell the other guys to come along it's all right just suck on your spoon as i approach reginald's daughter-- i approach with my big bear arms at the side my cloak over my armor and my delightful cap get close to the honey and (sniff) (bear voice) thank you i took a bite of it a little bit i take the rest of it and hold it out and say one of you bears please find the source of this goddamn honey oh no how many people are in the audience oh no first and foremost considering the utility of that honey i'm going to take a sample and pack it under my bear pit for later (bear voice) thank you nobody jostle any of these townsfolk too hard they're probably a little sensitive at the moment you'll see we don't want that honey we have enough there the prize honey is what that little one had earlier or (squishing) where this came from i didn't think about my hat at the time i don't have pockets i'm storing it in my bear pit all right lead us on as he's putting it in his mouth i grab the edge are you sure about this more or less listen you guys we have to get those fire dancers out of here or get the rest of these villagers out of the center here or we're all dead that honey you got right there that touches any of that boom boom fire stick we all go boom i got a plan do you have a direction where the honey's from that i gave you earlier please for the love of god you guys start heading that way i'll catch up to you in a minute i know where the sun kissed tavern is i'm going to try to save some lives as the townsfolk are gathering around this fire troupe i'm going to try to step between the threshold of where the various honey-eating folk and the fire spinners are step into that central area i don't know where she is so we'll find out as they begin to encroach i shake my head for a second pull my hat and cloak off and (roar) towards all of the townsfolk away from the fire dancers attempting to use my terrify special skill two and a three i turn around to the fire dancers (growling) i throw the cloak back over my shoulder take one of the fire sticks bidet and start heading in the direction of the sun kissed tavern do i have to move a point anywhere for that i'm holding the flame stick with me now i get as low as i can don't worry about it we need to get to the tavern i look down and see the fez in the cart and i hold the fire rod away sam and safety tip this doesn't touch that i point again and say this also doesn't touch that remember that chicken don't worry about it sun kissed tavern keep leading us on with that beautiful nose of yours shit maybe it's got pictures here's my question how much like bamboo do those sticks look i lean over to peddy and say disarm them as she rears towards me i get down and be as imposing a grizzly figure as i can and give a very focused centered roar right in her direction (roars) yeah with a two i only have two bear right now take your wounded boy and don't cross a bear in a hat ever again do we also move a point into bear for using a special skill that's right that's not good as she turns away i take a quick glance to look at the back of her shoulderblades to see if i notice any familiar branding i turn to peddy and say wait i know these cows we've talked to these cows these cows are assholes finish them off okay i thought it was a stick that's on me does it involve honey i'm starting to get real twitchy more or less yeah looking as how i'm five points into criminal right now i start nodding slowly and go all right i hear what you're saying you all seem to be a fairly functional lot we'll see how this-- most of you seem like a functional lot let's see how this goes down when all's said and done and we've enjoyed our just desserts you might be onto something that's worth the risk i've got to keep my eyes focused my brain right now is caught up with the ideas of all the various other heists we could throw and i've been a good person so far a good bear in my life i can't deter too far from that path i'll be right back and i rush up to try and grab one of the canisters and bring it back i make it i'm jamming it into my mouth directly i come back and put it into the radio flyer dip your spoon in it try it focus we've got honey hiding somewhere right now i don't want you buffoons ruining our chance they know there's bears around now and i bought us a little bit of time but we've got to hurry it up all right you've got the nose you've got the brains i go to get the fire staff from the ground pull it back pull my cloak back up oh you have advantage because it's carnage i just sit back and watch with peddy smoking the cigarette that waffle gave me no right point of order no one flick cigarettes especially if there are kids with it smeared in their hair i'm so sorry which the kid sees a giant hat-wearing trinket going (bear sounds) i hold the torch away (grunts) kid wash your hair i think we can with the right muscle how many more servings of honey do we have in the cart is it a half a jar per serving all right don't eat the hat honey we only got three proper servings left so we have to be sparing we drink to your honor i'm so excited forgot to mention one night only on saturday we're doing gm tips me and satine are hosting a gm tips one night only this saturday at 8pm i believe they have to slam their way out of there it's the only way to do it so taking inventory here three sources of honey an explosive honey hat and a fire staff and a tree stick not a bad haul i'm thinking about it but still you've proved to me that you're useful and you've proved to me that you're partner material come on brains lead us to this tavern follow your brother there see if you can get us inside this security door yeah it's westruun it smells like piss everywhere i can't read but it looks like an inn sun's out feeling pretty kissy actually he's pretty much already almost killed one creature but i get what your point is it's a valid point i wipe the huff coloring off the sides of waffle's face careful it ruins your brain what's your idea tell you what if everything goes ass to sky that'll be our backup to cover our tracks but we can't start with that hold onto it it's not a bad idea exactly can we see possibly a stairway or entrance door to an upper level let's get in the alley success three out of five maybe it's an iron door on a building made of wood and plaster what's the rest of the building construct all right and that door's slightly ajar who wants to take a look at that door i don't know he's the brains you killed a cow back there that's why you're the brains all right cookie's got it are we all in on this cart stays here i loudly whisper are you in place that's a good idea shut it are you in place up there yes go on the codeword is dollars how about that i don't know figure it out i don't know all right (thudding) anything (thudding) i begin to move a little bit off to the side of the door where it'll be opening so only part of me is visible i keep knocking have you heard of our lord and savior of latter-day allhammer make some dollars make some dollars make some dollars dollars dollars carnal advantage that's a different skill okay if this is happening i turn to cookie and say hold him down he's got a kid we can't kill him yeah the kid that gave us the information i'm the only hero here apparently apparently yeah i'm going to pull him off of buford as he's slammed las vegas into the wall i'm going to pull vegas off while i slam him into the wall and get my bear snout right into his face and give him an intimidating growl to get him to stop thrashing i succeed with a one i look at him and i point with a bear claw and go (grunts) and i take some of the honey from my bearpit and go (grunts) where where i wipe the honey back in my bear pit and pull him off to where the door is where it's open make sure that all of us are inside-- do you want to grab the barrel and bring it in okay so as soon as we get our last honey jar the de rolo roller in i shove him back out and close the metal door and then try and find a way to lock it (laughs) is there any sort of locking mechanism or a barricade peddy knock him out i open the door is it honey mead i know but i'm a bear so i have to clarify can i take one of the bottles and drink it (gulping) (slurred) it's fine we're good oh you haven't been around the right people and enough mead in this room i'm so drunk and your cousin i'm a cousin who's drunk waffle waffle (laughs) hey peddy which one of these rooms has the tree outside of it all right we'll follow vegas lead us to the tree we'll climb down and go around to the inside of the tavern hey peddy take him out a giant tanuki flash it is boom good job peddy all right everyone down the tree come on make sure you don't leave it behind might be handy a valid point the body of the guy who's unconscious that he just crushed i pick up the body and look for the window of the balcony we were just jumping down from and try and ragdoll him up into it (laughing) arms and legs out that was a six close enough (laughter) it's fine sweet dreams goes back to catch up with them in the tavern you with the strange crazy eyes do you have any idea where the cellar is here in the inn while you're both probably on par intellectually i don't know if that's going to end as-- is he right in front of the door to the pantry we're going to keep this as plan c plan brains no i like the guy a lot actually but he might like destroying you too much we've got to sneak past stay nice and quiet-like small guy can probably get by fine when he catches up but we've got to quietly make our way i pull out a palm-full of pit honey that's been smeared into my matted fur i've got this all right my turn i focus really hard on the broken honey-- that's good (straining) okay we haven't walked past grog yet but you know what our conversation hasn't woken him up yet and the breaking glass didn't wake him up let's just walk through the room he's pretty drunk all right let's do that because i'm a thief could i consider that as a skill can i use my thief role to be stealthy (singing) super fail super fail no it just adjusts your skill points you still fail the roll what are you having a problem again trying to get into a place with a lock like i said the lady who raised me she's pretty good at picking this stuff too in fact-- and i reach over and grab one of the little side bags they usually tie to me to carry stuff and i pull out one of the lockpicks that vex keeps stored on my side as a backup and with my dexterous thief trinket giant bear paws try and maneuver these tiny little-- it's like trying to hold a cup with boxing gloves on (grunts) yes what did i tell you mommy taught me good wait what i go over do these still look functional do i recognize this (moans) the only reason was because of that ring you look good tova snazzy it's a celebration in the city we're celebrating hey i mean that's absurd i'm offended personally do you want a cut i barely know you we flirted in battle once and then you went away all right beary sanders that honey is for us and us alone we've earned that okay i don't want bears that haven't earned it getting a piece of what we've made can you give us a minute to talk amongst ourselves privately all right bears huddle up all right what are our thoughts on this do we want to share with her we put all the work in it's not a lot of honey we barely found that off your-- that'll last a meal i don't think she understands how hungry we are that one only eats bamboo i could always say there's five of us and one of her if she helps us make our way in there-- trust me i've seen a lot of battles and i haven't fallen in a single one (laughter) not harm just knock unconscious and tie up like you've done to every other thing we've come across oh god no unless they're evil or an asshole or hurt my mom are we agreed move forward as the squad tag her along and then when all's said and done leave her behind with a bit of honey and we move away with the lion's share all right break tova you've got yourself a deal do i look like an honest bear all right does this look like the kind of thing that a thief-trained bear who has seen thieves do their work would have an inkling of how to disable it the internet will barrage us with them when we're done i go back into the bag of thieves' tools left over from vex and pull out what i think might work i take a look at the mechanisms for the trip wire two and a one i turn around with a big goofy smile anyone have anything else they could help me with on this don't hack you're going to be hacking an actual tripwire all right i'll try for the third one get behind me if anything goes bad tell vex i love her three i turn around and look at the group with a terrible happy-bear smile what happens with the tripwires wait remember that piece of paper that we got from that guy earlier sure i can't read tova she's a partner in this she's getting an equal-- she's getting all the share we promised her all right should i read this out loud via tova reading this to me here you guys should do this you're the brains 'green pink orange and yellow not every fish is a friendly fellow green is mean and pink 'stinks yellow is mellow but orange is-- orange is-- screw it that hazel festival committeewoman 'can go to hell i'm not a fucking riddle writer here's the code orange is the best color so put 'one orange fish in each basket except for two in the pink heh that one was my idea' (laughter) 'then the stupid expensive door should open don't know why we're spending this much to lock up 'a few jars of honey anyway signed buford t justice head of security' an orange in each except for two in the pink taliesin i think you should only get them if you have the bear hands on an orange in each basket oh god one more orange for the pink is that all we need las vegas you can do this in the pink it might have been amelia the writing isn't very good the name begins with an a and then scribbles how are those sconces looking what's in them is it magical light do any of them look viably close to dropping embers code sad bear we've got to move now i turn around to her tova all this gray honey shit is explosive i know he's crazy the more you try and question his motives the more he makes you more like him keep going i immediately take the fire staff i've been carrying and throw it as far as i can down the opposite hallway away from this room actually while this is happening i reach over and go hey cookie if i buy you a new hat could i borrow yours i'm going to take the top hat and place it just over the heavy collection of victor's honey beneath where the sconce is all right moving honey as fast as we can into the cart i immediately glance around they came through the ceiling are there any of the sconces that look close to being-- we can't-- and i point to the ninja bears coming our way and the ones that just entered-- handle it and i go for the swinging sconce board to see if i can clap it out with my bear paws and put out the flame nope knowing that upstairs is grog two people that we've knocked out another drunk guy who's passed out in the bar and god knows who's nearby and the amount of victor honey that's in here i'm focusing on trying to put the fires out yeah i'm one of the few that hasn't peed so i probably have a full tank my paws are scalded from patting the flames out i lean back and try and get as much of an arc as i can that's a bear thing performance anxiety trinket apparently is pee shy sorry i have a question the trails of honey are they heading towards the large-- as tova comes back and slams into cookie i spin around now that i see this is my fault and i push the back of cookie to shove both of them back through the front doorway i'm going to try to use whatever bear strength i have to shove them forward success i close my eyes and in the back of my head go i hope you're within about a hundred feet of me wherever you are vex am i conscious which means she's not within a hundred feet of me for the love of god are the ninjas still around confused bear what's going on as a thank you to peddy as i get up i grab peddy by the shoulders and push peddy up onto the cart with everybody else no i look up and say my family's here a life of crime's not for me you go on ahead you've earned it i do constantly (moans) i fall on the ground and go belly-up and go (piteous moaning) trinket wouldn't leave thank you so much for running that thank you marisha if you're looking for extra content like that he offers that on his patreon you can find that theme on itunes for download
