hello everyone and welcome to tonight's episode of critical role where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors sit around and play dungeons & dragons and sam makes noise from his phone over there strangely so a couple things one you'll notice that we're down two players tonight that's because apparently some babies can't wait so there is currently a new addition to the critical role team right now-- (cheering) super excited we love you guys so much seriously you're amazing and we look forward to meeting the new one very soon i'm just saying then we could've shared a birthday so anyway let's get through our announcements real fast first and foremost a big thank you to our returning fantastic sponsors of this campaign d&d beyond sam if you don't mind thank you sam yep it is a thing congratulations no well thank you very much d&d beyond thank you sam a couple other announcements because we're doing this move there will not a critical role or talks machina next week so we'll be missing you guys that week we'll see you on social media and stuff and having chats to keep us all through our withdrawal that we’ll be suffering and some of you i'm sure will as well but we'll be back the week after that the second week of july we'll be picking up with the talks machina of tonight's episode then hosted by our fantastic brian w foster then the following thursday the following episode in which we will have a guest maybe two joining us no i'm not that good at teaching this game i think language is an important barrier in teaching d&d anyway just so you guys are aware also for those who haven't seen on social media welcome we just launched a kickstarter with our good friends at steamforged games so if you guys don't know we launched a kickstarter it's a short-form kickstarter for our line of vox machina and mighty nein miniatures for those who aren't aware or familiar we have an entire line of highly detailed super high quality plastic minis of all of vox machina including trinket and all of mighty nein there are stretch-- i was going to say stretch goals there are kickstarter exclusive rewards that include pumat prime for the mighty nein and his three simulacrum as well as a fantastic taryon darrington and doty for the vox machina side go ahead and check it out it's going to be up there for another week or so i believe if you can't afford it right now you can even put a dollar in there and we'll have opportunities down the road hopefully for you to jump in if you missed it the first round but when it comes down to it you get eight minis for vox machina you get the mighty nein minis as well another eight minis with shakäste involved in there all the pumats as well and the extra bonus features of tary and doty all for $60 which is a pretty fantastic package for the quality of these and for the collectable aspect of it if you like it help make it happen more it's already exploded it's nuts i haven't seen the boxes yet i should see that we're super excited about it you guys have already blown it out of the water if you haven't had the opportunity now's the time to jump in and i hope you enjoy them so i believe that's all the rest of the announcements we have so let's bring it in to tonight's episode of critical role [groovy critical role theme] that was great so last we left off the mighty nein in making their way northward towards their eventual goal of shadycreek run to complete their second mission that they accepted from the gentleman in zadash have been traversing the countryside and made their way to the city of hupperdook the largely gnomish cultural city there of industry and currently construction of war machines to send towards the conflict with xhorhas to the east there you saw the very hardy work atmosphere of the gnomes and then the evening very crazy party atmosphere in which many of you dove into a hard drinking contest you won the title of the blushing tankard tavern beating out their old champions and woke up with terrible hangovers and realizing that most of your gold had been stolen upon doing some sleuthing around the town you had bullied a couple of bullies that were pushing rissa around they had been a problem for a while sent them peeing their pants and rushing you spoke with rissa's father in his tinkering inventor's store in which you discovered a shiny object a fantastic experimental hand crossbow construct of his that he would be interested in relinquishing without payment if you do him the favor of correcting a mistake he made a while back apparently he crafted on the request of the starosta of the city a powerful gearkeeper a construct-like entity that was meant to help be a warden within the prison that went crazy killed a bunch of people and they sealed it off and it's been there forgotten ever since you said you'd take a look at this eventually you discovered that the money you had lost had been taken by four children who currently are without parents who have been living on the streets here in the city of hupperdook while their folks had been sent to the prison six months before for being caught worshiping unapproved deities within the empire you after having this conversation with them retrieving your money and leaving kiri with them for the time being for safekeeping decided to see if you had the possibility to prevent them from being sent to an empire-run orphanage in the hopes of freeing their parents in some way shape or form from their binds that was where we had left off you guys have stepped out of the butcher home leaving the kids behind with kiri and you are now out in the open streets of hupperdook late morning midday what would you like to do rissa is still with you no i am going to hold onto this why would i give it to you i'm not going anywhere why would i give it to you this is my bag i paid for it rissa goes all right i can go ahead and lead you to it can't say i've been too close to it personally so far follow me rissa guides you through the rest of the shelf back to the walkway that winds down the front of the mountain to the bottom half of the city of hupperdook lowerdook if you will they're with you guys you can go head that way if you want to call them off unless you want to send them on their own wild goose chase i could maybe send them a message i do okay she quietly tugs on the symbol of the traveler and goes like okay fitz this is the girl with the people that were making you angry-- we found it so everything is good i think that's all of it go-back-to-work the traveler is very forgiving rissa leads you down this path to the iron lot which is-- you're guided to the basement you've seen it as you approached and there was the large platform elevator that rose up to the second layer it's currently not being used it's locked on the upper floor as you head into that area the smokestacks are billowing strongly business is in the process of being done full-throttle in the understanding that this coming conflict or the now arrived conflict on the eastern side has put everyone into overdrive to prepare whatever sort of equipment or weaponry they can send that direction well from the outside all you can see because you haven't been inside any of the warehouses-- there is the iron lot and there's the assembly yard the assembly yard is the one that's the open space where they're building these large siege engines you see mobile carts that are either horse-drawn or powered by something you don't quite understand yet that have other large weapons attached to them mm-hmm yes so as you are being led down rissa's pointing out some elements of it she goes okay so over that side is the omnismelter she points over to a cluster of a dozen or so warehouses that are scattered in a spider web-like formation that are connected by a series of hallways between each other and then towards a central piece she goes that there is where most of the foundries of the city lie where all the various mined ingots or those imported are melted down and utilized the foreman there is a bit of a tool there's the armavault she points to the far northern side of the mountain base and you see a 25 30-foot tall by 60-foot across iron door that is solid and jammed into the side of this mountain it looks like it's very well protected from this glance at the distance from what you can see there's maybe two dozen or so crownsguard that are stationed at its base that's where most of the funds that are saved for the uses of the city maintain as well as a number of the not currently being used devices of war means of defending the city should it come under attack if you will points over there you can see what looks to be where most of this smoke and steam is rising from there is this one large two-story black tower that has a single column of fast moving smoke pouring out of it you can see areas where the smoke seems to be pulsing or darkening and widening at certain places she goes that there is the underbellows that's where they utilize a number of the forges and furnaces for the factories here they've harnessed some of the volcanic activity beneath the mountain and that maintains a consistent heat for the forges smells downright awful to be honest over there's the firemark facility she points over to a building that looks a little simpler it's not super tall and ominous-looking it's very plain made of cheap metals you notice all the buildings here are mostly metal probably because there's a lot of dealing with heat fire sparks and the last thing you need is any of these things to catch fire she points though to the firemark facility and she goes this is where they're developing a majority of certain explosive and black powder-based technologies it's called the firemark facility (chuckles) most everything is here then right over there and she points to the southern side of the mountain base of the iron lot to a smaller doorway similar in shape and construction as to the armavault but it's a little more localized maybe about 15-foot high and about 20-foot wide that is the gearhold prison the one you were asking about the one where my father done fucked up it's-- have you ever seen an automaton where they're made of stone or made of clay imagine one that's made of metal and gears and blades lots of blades blades it is covered in daywalkers yes they do the whole thing spins actually it doesn't have feet basically partially magical and partially clockwork the power source is magical but most of its actual locomotion is done through clockwork and various internal gears it's actually quite a marvel to behold it's just-- as far as i know it's not my mastery it's my daft father's he referred to it as the gearkeeper it was designed to be one of the threatening wardens to help quell any sort of breakouts of the prison meant as an intimidation device for those who attempted to rise up against their captors and possibly be its first initial run to be a defensive sentinel for the city if these things worked properly having five or six of them just rapidly on the outskirts of the city would probably keep anyone from trying to break in here or make any sort of lawless act in its boundaries unfortunately they've only made one and it went crazy and killed a bunch of people so there's that yeah that's why i'm trying to fix it they sealed it off they've been trying to get back to it but there's a lot of distraction and honestly it's out of sight out of mind i think as far as i know yeah they'd originally had it placed in the bottom floor in one section which had more of the very violent criminals and killed a bunch of them not too bad killed a bunch of guards that's pretty bad at the time they didn't have the manpower to fight it off so they sealed the doors and haven't had a problem since it's been there for quite some time a couple years at least i think two or three years so if anyone was they've expired i'm pretty sure sorry that's true jester leans in to rissa and goes rissa do you have any examples of your father's writing because i can copy it pretty well she'll be watching i can guarantee you they're not going to have any publicly available blueprints of a prison oh we can certainly ask you see that spark in her eye of a good idea and then thinking about having to go back to her father she's like (sighs) no it's fine i'll go i'm used to him it's okay come on i imagine he does i've seen him eat a few probably okay fjord kind of leans in and goes that's good jester has been i have too much in my head right now guys it's been a long day it's fine thanks baby willingham it's been the longest day all right easy enough as you're wandering through the street following the scents of food that are being cooked in advance of the current lunch hour happening you hear a few whistles go off in the distance and in that moment rissa goes we best be hurrying before the rush hits and you pick up the pace as you start hearing the different steam whistles go off and you watch a lot of the buildings begin to just swarm out with all their workers on their brief lunch break you manage to stay ahead of most of the wave making their way up to the top shelf of the city eventually coming to one of the vendors on the outside who is swarmed by about 12 or 13 different gnomes you wait patiently for about a good 15 20 minutes or so as they prepare and get all their meat pies ready sweet pies ready sell a few things a couple of their regulars cut in line in front of you not paying much attention or caring that you're waiting patiently but there is a large crowd behind you and you manage to get to the front and the two gnomes that are currently in the process of divvying this up look to the rest of you and go oh you're a right interesting team what brings you here you looking for pies we got pies you want pies single it's not enough to go around i can tell you all right turns around and pulls out three gnome-sized meat pies which are about that big six gnomish meat pies passes them over okay we'll say for the total of that it's maybe a silver because you were rushing to get the pies make a perception check with disadvantage at this distance seven you have no idea you have your meat pies you want to make your way over back to the tinkertop all right so you have one ready you guys snack as you walk along interesting point of noticing as you guys come by you do see a familiar sight for you and for those who've been in the empire for a bit you're familiar with this as well nott and caleb you see a crew it's two crownsguard that are flanking one figure you see wearing a black cloak with gold trim that goes just past the shoulders it's almost like a shawl or a um brain escapes the term but it's like a short cloak these are the tithe collectors they're referred to colloquially as reapers behind their back but you see them exiting one home and moving onto the next door and knocking a ways away but they're present it seems that the time of year has come the every-six-month window seems to be coming or has arrived nevertheless you travel with meat pie in hand eventually making your way back to tinkertop inventions the door still partially ajar you see the faint light of the two lanterns in the back as you enter and there in the back you see in the process of sketching something down your good friend mastermaker cleff tinkertop ah you've returned certainly good to see you what can i help you with oh that's so kind thank you so much rissa for your old pops did you she's like well it was sort of a group decision hope you like it dad it's cold but tasty anyway he takes it and starts eating it stuffing it in chunks through his gnomish maw getting bits of the gravy dripping off of the chin plenty i built the thing myself don't worry oh i've already got it don't worry there friend i'll be right back turns around and disappears behind a-- you hear some rustling and some things falling over a couple of banging noises and then you hear a (clattering) damn it yeah i can hear you just so you're aware i'm right next to you little one a moment later cleff returns clutching an armful of rolled pieces of paper and prints and parchment and goes here's about everything i've got on the thing throws it down in front of you some of it unrolls there's various stages of design the breakdown of the mechanics and the interior of this it's extremely intricate and very impressive clockwork roll an intelligence check caleb you are the one who is the most proficient with understanding systems if you could make an intelligence check for me as well both you and molly since molly was the first to grab them you both take a moment and look over it one it's all written in gnomish do either of you guys understand gnomish as a language secondly a lot of the blueprints are in shorthand and the design work-- while it's very beautiful to see-- the actual sketching of each stage of its construction and the interior mechanisms about it are very beautiful it is very intricate paying attention to it and looking it over the best you can ascertain is there is a core there is some sort of a device that powers it through the notes around it it's supposed to power for about 200 years before it needs replacing however around it is layer after layer of metallic iron rings that are joined at certain hinge points so they can spin and shift in the inside like a gyroscope yes it's not impossible if you pull enough of the armor away which is the next stage the layers of armor there's three different layers of articulated armor that can shift and move because on the inside there are about a dozen bladed arms that at any given point in time can fold out of the armor and strike like small scythes or sickles and then retract inside that's certainly not the first time i've heard that i mean that's possible oh curses i should've thought of some way of a fail-safe to prevent that from happening well next design next design it'll be dispel-proof thank you for that you're a good-- i imagine to a certain extent there is a base level of insulation from impactful or various magical intrusions that could affect the core that i did think of but there's only really one i should've put three he starts making notes feverishly the front and back is-- dervish that's a great pirate word dervish he looks to you and goes there is kind of he goes through one of the papers and pulls it open and there are plates of the armor-- certain plates that fold up from the inside they open and there is a small lens like a crystal-type lens that recesses on the inside when it's moving and then seems to push out from it to see depending on the terrain probably if it's flat-walled surfaces it's not designed for climbing it's designed for intimidation and slaughtering perhaps my design was a bit unfocused for the reason they asked me to build it but ah next time climbing i don't know probably not as far as i know no but it moves very fast maybe they're made of a very thick crystalline substance that had to be imported from up north from the remnants of one of the old elven societies there that specialized in making strong crystal maybe starts writing down more notes make sure lens can't be obscured in a future design no i built it here oh right no unfortunately they keep us away from all of that for security reasons so i couldn't help people break in or out like now that would've been very helpful sorry i don't think they're going to let me in maybe he looks at rissa rissa would you mind bringing your old pops with you she's like only to the door dad then you can come back she glares over the two of you if that's necessary fine come along then we'll close up behind get your keys oh i haven't been down for a proper walk with friends in some time i'm so excited he takes the last bit of meat pie and shoves it in his mouth real fast (unintelligible shouting) jester goes this entire time you've been holding out on delicious molasses are you sure (as fjord) yeah how much you carrying (as fjord) pie-chucker rissa goes i mean tar is not uncommonly used in some of the industrial districts down in the iron lot well the forge masters they're mainly in metalwork as far as tar use that's going to be down in the iron lot and that's going to be-- you're on your own there fjord goes if only we knew someone around here who is pretty decent with fire why thank you i appreciate you being so forthright and appreciative caleb i have no idea what the hell you're talking about you just broke the prismatic wall at this point as you guys are having this awkward conversation cleff is rushing around grabbing a coat and grabbing some other things filling the inside of his apron with various tools and utensils oh i can probably use that all right i think i'm ready to come with you you all step outside and you get about 30 or so feet before you see cleff’s pace is slowing he takes another step and keeps looking around it's been a while it's starting to get a little warm rissa is like he's kind of a-- what's the term agoraphobic if you will he's a bit iffy on the outside are you sure you're all right dad you can still stay no no it's fine i want to hang out with my friends here (nervous laugh) i don't-- i've never had a drink i don't need a drink but thank you well i-- and looks over you all get really close to him he's like oh this is really warm this is a lot of attention oh all right (muffled yelp) in a comforting way (laughter) he takes it and pulls it over his head all right and he let's go (nervous chuckle) and is like one step two step he's basically bill murray in what about bob at this point he's concentrating on each step he makes going forward it's slowing you down a little bit but he's making it forward rissa is like (exasperated groan) you eventually make your way further and further you know if i have learned anything it is that you are full of surprises so by all means rissa looks iron lot's most likely i'll keep an eye out follow me she leads you guys down the switchback path once more down to the iron lot the bottom shelf of the city there upon keeping an eye out rissa is looking back and forth on the outskirts of the firemark facility she's like no i don't think they're going to do much as far as tar goes honestly a lot of it's probably based somewhere in the assembly yard that's where they're making the bigger constructs and having to piece together wood exteriors no it's on the northern side of the bottom shelf she leads you guys over to the outskirts and there is a big fence that wraps around the assembly yard where a lot of these thin standing skeletal towers of metal are placed against some constructs that are in partial levels of construction others are empty and not currently in use other ones seem to have been near completion and they're in the process of preparing and breaking down the various siege engine for transport to the east who's keeping an eye out to see if there’s anything that could be used like tar who's looking for this all right make a perception check please 18 not too bad you take about five minutes or so to case the vicinity and looking between the gate you can see two towers over there is one partially constructed wide bolt-thrower cart that only has one that's currently bolted to it you see that they're taking leather elements and tarring them around the edges to prevent any sort of impacts from splintering the wood that's carrying it it looks like from there they go with a leather case and put metal over that and bolt it down but in the process they do have what looks to be a couple of small pails that have some thick black tar-like substance that they're putting around the edges there's probably within current view of the open portion of this side of the assembly yard about 20 or so workers that are in the middle of focusing on their work at hand but it's in an open space with maybe 20 to 30 feet open between each project tower so it's pretty open you'd have to be creative correct as you do so (vibrating ring) across it rissa goes ah and you look at the nearby tower maybe 25 or 30 feet ahead to the north of you one of the gnomes at the top of the tower is currently hammering away at one of the large constructs siege tower-like structures looks over pulls the goggles up hello piss off puts the goggles down (hammering) the nearest-- the one little part of the yard that they're currently using this material is about 60 feet away from you 60 to 70 from your immediate guess at a glance okay make an investigation check ten you take the ten minutes to look through but this part of the gate is pretty solidly locked in it's about six and a half seven feet tall and it's just metal bars with almost a cross-lattice of even thinner metal strips that are about a quarter-inch thick the openings are about that big so you can still see through like portholes but it's not quite large enough for most of you to slip through you might be able to if you're careful and squeeze since you're small enough gnomes and you see a handful of dwarves but the dwarves seem to be mostly doing oversight supervision so you complete your spell ritual you summon your unseen servant at which point cleff goes oh we're going to see a performance and the range on that is-- it cannot get more than 60 feet than you right okay so what are the two of you doing all right so-- there are large metal poles incrementally about every 12 or so feet in between there it looks like there are cross lattices of an inch wide and a quarter-inch thick metal bars that weave across to form the fence probably not all right you guys are prepared i would like you to make an acrobatics check with advantage because you're being aided by yasha ten as you reach down grabbing the foot of mollymauk with one big (grunt) you lift him and he tosses in the air gracefully arms out almost like a reverse swan dive into the air you land and (impact) (groaning) you manage to do so but it lacks the presentational and grace element of it make a performance check but with disadvantage from the impact 15 okay still pretty good so in spite of the (strained) impact you slowly stagger back up to the top balance yourself all right you're turning it around it's starting to work into your advantage as this is happening schmidt is slowly dragging on its own the unseen servant is dragging this bucket three feet at a time (scraping) none seem to be noticing the bucket at the moment but you do see about three or four that are looking over at this very colorful flashy performing nearly wracked tiefling who is in the process of juggling swords in the air and doing a series of completely spontaneous performance art for no reason you see two of the nearby workers start looking over confused start talking to each other you can hear the muttering one of them runs off to one of the supervisor dwarves who's about 80 to 100 feet off to go tell him what's happening he looks over and eventually you hear as schmidt is getting closer and closer the bucket of tar is maybe 20 feet from the fence-line and you hear a voice go hey hey what are you doing get down from there get-- go on get get get straight acrobatics for this (flipping) (impact) landing right onto yasha's shoulders she catches you there and you're still from their perspective you jumped off of the fence and landed behind the fence and are-- make a deception check nine okay it's not that they don't buy it they're just more caught off-guard by your presence and not listening to the words you're saying the one supervisor who keeps rushing forward goes you know lad you don't have permission show me your-- at which point you see cleff looking nervously steps forward and goes hello there cleff tinkertop we're all right they're with me the dwarf comes to a slow jog to a stop and goes cleff what the fuck are you doing down here schmidt drags the bucket about 15 feet off to the side and it is near the base of the fence okay yes they are looking it's about 15-20 feet to the left but they're currently focused on your group which is gathered at the edge of the yard where they assemble all of their very powerful military weapons right so it was about 30 feet we'll say so are you attempting to-- all right it's actually right now with that final scoot from schmidt it's right up against the fence on the opposite side okay at this point the dwarf rushes up to the edge and peers through and goes so strange arrivals you got here cleff and a couple of loonies diving off the outside of our very well-protected fence but sure cleff what's your business with these assholes he's like we're making our way to try and make right some mistakes i've made certainly hopefully he glances through with a bit of a tightened gaze and goes all right well just keep them off my fence turns around and starts walking back to his post make a sleight of hand check to see if you can make the right timing and do so swift enough to where nobody seems to notice with that as soon as the dwarf turns around and all the rest of the workers go right back simultaneously seeing that this encounter is over turn back to their work (whooshing) without a sound rises over the fence and is now at your disposal on the opposite end (laughter) rissa goes all right that's the first part of it what's next she takes it and slowly puts it inside it will fit in the larger one so it slips inside the bag she closes it okay are you sure it won't turn over marisha and i don't want to ruin my bag i paid good money for it and it's so pretty carefully hands it to yasha rissa continues pushing you now away from the assembly yard back into the iron lot and towards the exterior of the gearhold prison there on the outside of this doorway there's about a dozen crownsguard mostly gnomish two human it looks like they're both currently decorated with a bit more detail probably sent from the capital or at least are given a little more of import to the outside of this guarding post as you approach you can see these large metal doors there are two of them and they open in the center and there are a set of smaller doors built in the base of each of the sides as you approach some of the crownsguard look over curiously at this interesting wayward group making their way towards the outside three of them begin to approach and one of the humans in the more intricate crownsguard uniform approaches throwing the cloak over his shoulder and you can see his hand resting on the handle of his now-sheathed sword hey who goes there what is your business cleff pulls the hood back a bit and goes hello guy takes a moment and looks make a persuasion check with advantage because cleff is helping you the guard steps back a bit looks you over all right hold tight a second i'm going to summon the warden just a moment he steps to one of the small doors that opens and he disappears inside there's the two large main doors about 15 feet tall about 20 foot wide and then there's smaller doors normal person-sized almost gnomish-sized doors built into it from that point you actually watch as the human crownsguard has to duck a little bit to go through the smaller door frame he's gone for about five minutes or so and then returns and says the wardenhelm would wish to speak to you if you wouldn't mind stepping inside don't mind the escort it's common business it's wardenhelm poppin drokrusher poppin drokrusher he's like gnomish names at that point you guys are led inside the dark interior as soon as you step into the shadow of the entryway of this prison you go from the industrial and somewhat colorless iron lot that you've been traveling through to this very low-lit reddish almost oxidized iron interior that is just shadow and torches you can see these large support beams of metal put against the rock and stone that has been carved out of the interior of the mountain it's just one long hallway that splinters off into a number of hallways to the right and left before it reaches the outside of your current visual range to make any more detail out of it at this point as you enter about five more of the crownsguard follow behind you and keep you all as a small pack traveling at this point he begins to move forward and gestures for you all to follow saying this way leads you down the hall scooting to the right and heads to the right at the very first branching hallway of the interior of the prison heading further down there's a few doors that are open and on the inside they appear to be empty or there's a few other guards on the interior you don't see much in the way of crownsguard you see a different type of guard similar garb but more drab and you get the sense that they're-- this is an internal prison guard this isn't part of the paid trained citywide guard these are the interior hupperdook prison guards no more than maybe another 40 or so feet down there's a doorway that's open that leads into an office on the inside of this office which itself is also super darkly lit you see two ember torches that give this very dull red glow on the inside of the room so it has this somewhat ominous and dreary interior presence to it as you step into this chamber the desk is facing away from you and there you see an older and grizzled gnome who is in the process of wearing these series of robes and cloak over him with these gold-colored tassels and epaulets that shoot off the sides seems to be giving out an air of station and importance even though it's just in the process of filing what looks to be either prison transfers or people that have been arrested and figuring out who's to be put in here and why or whose business is going to come to an end soon he's in the process of shuffling through papers before turning around to you and goes all right so you have come to my prison stands up and turns around to you clicking his feet together as he does so at attention arms crossed hello i'm the wardenhelm poppin you have bothered me from my work and i would like to know why as you look at him you can see his hair has receded almost entirely to the back and what bits of clustered gray hair on the sides he’s currently attempted to slick and comb back and one large part of it is trying to cover the massive bald spot but as he spins around and talks to you with any sort of movement it wobbles and has to settle itself back into place respectful i appreciate that rissa has backed away to the doorway and is like-- and doesn't want any part in this wait what are you-- and he looks over towards the cloaked gnomish figure to the side what he leans forward and as the cloak is pulled back cleff reveals his face a bit he goes hello there it's been a while how are you doing poppin he's like interesting riffraff you're bringing to my home this day i was referring to cleff cleff why do you come and bother me with my day's work what do you want you're saying something about your little mistake your problem he looks at cleff is this true cleff nods actually yes i know it's been a problem for a while and i figured about time i cleaned up that mess myself if you don't mind the wardenhelm stops for a second and looks amongst the rest of you right okay you have what appears to be an interesting crew of exterminators you've brought to me what do you want from me i assume you have come here for trade or for looking for some sort of recompense i would like to know what that is before we move further into this no one steps inside here wishing to do us how you say charity work make a persuasion check with advantage with aiding from beau and a very persuasive argument actually oh buddy well perhaps we can discuss but i would like to see possibly this deed you wish to do done first i do not wish to talk contracts with those who are about to die if you know what i'm saying very well he looks past you to the escort of guards that have followed you in lead them to the subterranean sealed chamber allow them to encounter our issue and should they survive return them to me with proof of the deed should they not survive we will not speak of this ever again good luck i will be here waiting to hear of your successful endeavor now leave me to my work he goes and sits back down in his chair cleff and rissa balk there as you guys are having this conversation rissa goes if it's not a problem i'll stay here with my dad and we'll just wait to hear what happens we're not much in the way of charging into the fray of course cleff pushes past and goes but before you go i just want once more to express my extreme gratitude for your putting yourself out there for my well-being a tinkertop never forgets these deeds and should you return safely i will be in your debt he bows and the cloak (thumps) onto the groundand he goes oh he picks it back up and bows a little less this time be careful oh it doesn't have feet it rolls you guys currently have a group of six crownsguard from the outside and a couple of prison guards that will lead you there jester goes well don't die and if you fall over i'll try to get you not on the ground anymore how is she out of spells you guys took a long rest she used two locate objects i know that they're 2nd-level i think isn't it yeah locate object is 2nd-level she's used two 2nd-level spells so we'll mark those in there if she had another it's fine she's not here to keep track well it only lasts for a minute the guards have led you away from that end of the chamber down the hall back to the main hallway that enters deeper into the gearhold prison following that down for another 80 or so feet that main open hallway comes to an end and there are a number of other small hallways that protrude the guards lead you down the one on the left you can see two immediately that branch off on the far end of that main open way that left-side pathway leads to a set of stairs that spirals down to a second floor then a third floor then a fourth floor the fourth floor is the bottom of these stairs and you're now probably guessing from the time it's taken you to descend the spiral staircase maybe an additional 100 to 120 feet below the entrance and the actual level base of the mountain at this point you continue down a hallway and there are cells to your right and left as you enter the space the cells are very well-fortified and behind the bars in the dark dark red ember-like torchlight that faintly glows and lights elements of this hallway as you continue down you can see shapes humanoid shapes locked behind bars of all shapes and sizes as you begin to pass one on the right you watch as a figure lurches up to the bars pushes up to the edge and what faint bit of red light you can see illuminating a face that looks scarred by a large heavy clawmark down one side the eye glued shut from the healing process you see this toothy rotten grin underneath as a nasty smell of breath emanates from its heavy breathing and as you pass by it says hey are you going to come back are you where are you going where are you going come back and you walk past one of the guards takes their shortsword and clangs it across the metal and goes keep back keep back to what name schuster okay you listen make a perception check okay you listen out and you hear a few voices chuckle and some shifting of people that are now making their way to the front of the cell to see what this arriving group of strangers is but nothing out of the expected ordinary reacting to that name a few other figures push their way to the face and you can see men and women you can see decrepit half-elves that look poorly nourished you can see humans that look like they've smeared themselves with their own foul excrement you can see a whole nature of people that are in the process of dealing with being locked down here in the subterranean basement level of this prison and then at the end you come to what looks to be an iron door that is currently sealed shut with what looks to be rung after rung after rung of chains pulled through across bars locked with three padlocks the main guard sitting there goes aye it is he pulls out a ring of keys when we sealed it about a little over two years ago it leads down splits in the middle and has two more sets of cells in the back side i don't know damn right with that one latch and one lock comes free pulls it off and hands it to the guard second lock comes free you take a moment to concentrate on it all right so with that the bucket of tar is now being held aloft from the floating spectral mage hand that nott is controlling correct correct correct all right so being careful not to destroy the bucket itself which while it is made of metal you're uncertain of its structural integrity but you do focus on a little slow burn of this flame controlling the fire bolt to be a gradual burn as you do you watch as the metal iron of the bottom of this bucket begin to heat to a dull orange into a brighter orange and after a few moments of concentrating you can see a faint (bubbling) the tar seems to be heating and to a fairly more liquidy consistency than its rather cold and more solid form that you found it in (laughs) at which point the third lock comes off the guards begin pulling the chains through the various loops until eventually the door is exposed (creaking) opens and on the inside there's a few steps that descend into what looks to be a double door beyond that one of the doors is partially opened and it is darkness with a faint red glow beyond that there's probably some light but it wouldn't hurt to bring your own especially for that one and points to caleb so as fjord touches the front of his chest armor you watch as the cold air solidifies getting this mist and bits of ice crystal protruding from his leather armor you got it as all of you are ushered past the metal door the guards all gather on the opposite side and the lead guard of the unit goes very well may the platinum dragon guide you closes the door and you hear the chains on the opposite side being locked as you all turn back looking down the six or seven feet of descending stairs before it levels into the double doors partially opened and the darkness beyond and that's where we're going to take a quick break well we're going to dive into that just because if we go into a battle it might take a little while we'll take the break now before that and then we can dive into it immediately as we return perfect shiny blade balls are easy to talk to all righty guys so we'll be back here in a few minutes we're going to take a five or ten minute break to get ourselves comfy (like rissa) food water and other releases of functions and we'll see you guys here in just a moment so hang tight in the chat if you want to we'll have a couple of fun videos to watch and once again if you haven't seen the kickstarter of these awesome minis you can go to critrolecom for all that information they have the links there to the kickstarter the guys at steamforged have done an amazing job and we hope you like them all right we'll see you here in a few minutes [break] indeed so welcome back coming back into the game you have all descended down and reached the double doors partially open and stepped quietly into the interior chamber of this sealed portion of the gearhold prison there is what looks like a faint flicker of those same ember-light torches that give off faint bits of red glow but a number the walls seem to have been damaged actually as you step inside you get a quick look the doors that are behind you and the walls around you are scraped and gashed from hundreds and hundreds of blade marks it looks like whatever in here has spent a lot of time grinding around and looking of a means of escape or patrolling with its blades out over and over again parts of the walls have fallen in a bit and there is rubble in areas where it's starting to erode away the interior of this sealed chamber but everywhere you look to the right left and along the ground all you see are hundreds and hundreds of blade-like grooves in the stone without your massive intelligence roll you weren't able to discern that information unfortunately that is a 2nd-level spell if i recall both of them okay over here all right it is a set of prison bars there is a gate that is currently locked the bars themselves once again you can see rows and rows of gashes and scrapes across the metal they're bowed in a bit from impacts repeatedly it's slightly bent inward you can attempt to pick a lock if you'd like go ahead and roll that's proficiency bonus plus dexterity a 14 (clicking) it's not triggering the lock these are not easy locks to get through they're designed to hold prisoners unfortunately so they're fairly hardy locks you spend a while with it and are unable to hit those tumblers it looks like it's not going to open make a perception check as you're looking through the bars all right not with that perception roll no you see bits of rock you see some cloth on the ground that's it yasha you have the torch right no caleb has the torch start scooting this way yeah these are the painted prototypes to give you a little bit of a glance of what these will look like there are a few changes for the final designs of course but these will give you an idea all righty there's molly on that side caleb as you hold the torch up at the bars and look through make a perception check with advantage as you're following off nott's lead and it's small chamber you can make out quite a bit of detail good glancing inside you see that whatever scrape marks that mar the interior of this main chamber there are none within this cell whatever this creature this gearkeeper construct is it did not manage to breach these gates however on the opposite side you see three different bed set-ups for prisoners some that seem either they were trying to claw their way out or the impact of slamming on the other walls caused bits of it to fall in and collapse there are piles of stone and fallen earth on the other side you see three skeletons they look like they've been decomposing for quite some time probably prisoners that couldn't escape and had no other way out make a perception check your dark vision is 60 feet correct you can just make out the details of another interior chamber looking within portions of the walls inside are also equally scraped apart edges of the fine well-set stonework have been marred with repeated gashes all over it looks like beyond that there was another prison cell but those bars have been breached as they are currently bent gnarled and twisted and pulled out of place the cell beyond it appears to be open anybody else moving anywhere the door is open but there are bars on this yes and it's partially bent inward from the impact it looks like it sustained quite a bit of brunt force to it over time make an intelligence check caleb if you don't mind 15 okay you were referring i believe to the spell arcane lock right yep it can still be forced open it's just a higher dc to do so it's possible but it makes it a much harder door to break through you have a valid point to what you're saying yes go for it make a perception check seven unfortunately even with your darkvision it's hard to look past that way you can see another chamber at your current vantage point it's a little bit out of the way it looks like there's not enough information you'd have to get a little closer to make out the details there are some piles of rubble and portions of the walls that have collapsed inwards so what are you guys doing yasha where are you moving to right here beau you're moving over here as well it's going to be hard to hide and climb it as well we can do about there as good as we can get there molly are you staying there she doesn't yet so where are you sending frumpkin moving back in the corner with beau and yasha right about there we'll say you begin to focus and frumpkin heads to the right side of the fork into the chamber you've already looked into towards the open cell doors that are currently pried off that archway as frumpkin glances past make a stealth check for frumpkin that's okay rolled a 15 okay liam yeah let's go with that all right frumpkin glances inside this busted cell and sees-- what i’m using as an interpretation of-- a large spherical metal object that's about eight feet diameter on any side it looks like a series of overlapping metal plates that look clustered together at odd angles elements of it look scraped and dented it looks like it's been doing some serious damage to it over time as it sits there resting and frumpkin approaches you watch one of the tiny little metal plates (squeak) open a lens pokes out towards frumpkin withdraws back in the plate closes and about six of these long blade-like spider legs stick out of it as it pulls back and begins to roll forward at a very extreme pace it rolls forward frumpkin just manages to bamf out of this dimension as the object slams into the opposite wall you guys feel the entire chamber suddenly (crash) from the impact and you hear this scraping of metal in the distance it rolls across the way and disappears into the other chamber go ahead and make a stealth check please nott where do you want to go here you do hear the same object shifting on the other side 15 okay nott as you're there at the edge and beau's there you glance in now that you guys are close enough you can see shifting in there you pay attention and you can see this other chamber is open with another cell off to the side it slams into that door spins around and one of the lenses peeks around the corner right at where beau had just moved into the far corner where's fjord going because we're about to go into combat jester can back up there i need all of you to roll initiative you throw the ball bearings out clattering as that happens the legs which are still out rear backward and they retract as it runs itself rolling forward in your direction ricocheting off that wall the ball bearings as it grinds across the bottom get fired off like small impact bullets from the grinding of the metal plates and the force of it hitting i need both nott and beau to make dexterity saving throws 21 not with advantage just a single roll you guys both manage to just duck out of the way they don't seem to hit you it's only a handful of them that upon the impact of it hitting stone and being pressured beneath they shoot off in your direction initiative rolls guys roll for yourself beau and then roll for jester and fjord as well 25 to 20 25 to 20 anybody 20 to 15 15 to ten all right ten to five caleb and jester are in the same-- seven got it top of the round as you see it come riding and curve around the corner and slam into that wall the stone bends inward even further and bits of the masonry flake and fall off to the ground clattering and small bits of stone it turns and you can see now the six spider-like blade legs sticking out of it six more shoot out of the top of it and all begin whirling around and begin spinning there amongst this chaos you see the lens sitting right there just barely peeking through its armored shell yasha you're up first all righty (counting) you just barely get into its range with your barbarian speed you rush in anger on your face you draw your magician's judge blade in the air 11 unfortunately does not hit your blade scrapes across its armored exterior not finding purchase in any of its innards the first attack that hits correct yeah you get that every round 21 hits roll damage you roll 2d6 for the weapon 3d6 for the divine fury oh no it’s additional half your level 2d6 plus three right 12 and then your rage damage which is two well no it’s the first attack that hit that’s what i’m saying you get divine fury for this hit because your first one hit this one does get it okay with that-- the first strikes off the second one you bring down the blade carves down and one of its metal arms bends off to the side the blade digs into the gears yasha’s blade finds its way in sparks go streaking off and the blade gets jettisoned off you have to hold it before it gets shot off the side of it the clockwork pushing it out of its innards the armor plate clicks over and guards its space it looks like it’s bent back a bit that ends yasha’s turn fjord is up next the robit is a-hexed you have a concentration on fjord for this like a from-the-hip-shotgun i like it that’s two shots fire twice seven plus eight 15 you fire the blast hits and disperses against the armor it does not hit 20 20 does hit roll a d10 plus four plus another d6 for hex not a d4 plus four damage to whatever you roll on the d10 the second one does manage to pierce some of its armor within the interior of it there’s a flash of green on the inside you see it curl around from the interior looking like cracks in the armor are suddenly glowing and then no more that finishes fjord’s action and bonus action is fjord going to stay where he is beau doesn’t go yet because it’s now the gearkeeper’s turn that’s okay that’s all right beginning of its turn it’s going to attempt to roll over yasha to go into the chamber yasha you need to make an athletics or acrobatics check you’re raging so you have advantage on your acrobatics check no first off you suffer-- seven points of piercing damage as it rolls over and the blades kick into you it is halved an additional three points of bludgeoning damage as you are crushed beneath its weight and you are knocked prone it was seven before three so it’ll be ten halved so you take five points of damage it does roll past here stopping at this point it’d be about here i think as it spins in this direction the things that drew its attention originally which is beau and nott in that corner nott you do get an attack of opportunity with a melee weapon if you have one but you have your crossbow out so yeah you don’t do much of an attack there roll an attack improvised weapon for a melee 18 just hits you get a point of damage on it your hand crossbow as you slam into it you look back and it looks like some of the wood is splintered somewhat you’re like oh it’s not enough to the point where it looks like it’s not going to function maybe but it’s going to need some repairs well there you go as it turns around the front of it where the lens is the lens retracts in the plates in front suddenly open leaving this open black vacuous space like a mouth or a gate opens in front you hear this very high whirring winding sound you see sparks inside and a blast of heated shrapnel shoots outward in a 30 foot spray against both of you right there i need you both to make a dexterity saving throw please success so you take half damage that is 25 points of piercing damage to you nott correct now you know about the reactions of piercing damage and halved for you so you take 12 its shrapnel blast is done that’s the end of its turn that brings us to beau you’re up over this way yasha’s prone on the ground oh so around here you’re moving into melee got it go for it ten misses the first strike with your staff just scrapes off of its armor no impact the second one you strike again this time one of the blades swings outward and thankfully the blade doesn’t hit the staff to cut the wood however it does the backhand impact it and prevent the blow from actually striking its body that’s not fun you go and punch the armored sphere go for it it just misses well not so much a miss you hit it but you go (metallic clang) oh you can feel that from the knuckles right to the funny bone from there you have ten feet okay finishing beau’s turn that brings us to nott and molly-- its lens appears to be out currently just surveying the scenario yes i’ll say for the purposes of aiming on this with your intention go ahead and make a d20 attack roll adding your perception bonus 17 i’ll say for the purposes of that because it’s not armor you’re trying to strike through it’s just trying to aim for a position that will be enough the tar with a toss (splashing) all across the lens you see the sticky still warm thick tar spray onto it and get inside the interior of its armor for the moment the lens starts (swift movements) and you hear what previously was now that it’s close to you you can hear there’s hundreds and hundreds of small clicks and winding sounds on the inside there’s now a rapid (zipping movements) as the lens is trying to find some sort of direction it is currently blinded (cheering) technically you are ten feet from it the blades have a bit of reach so you are technically in melee you can use your action to disengage yeah disengage generally is an action which direction all right you can get there you can go one more if you want to all right there you go you can still keep it in your visual range but that’s 30 feet back now you spin around with your crossbow not suffering any attack of opportunity all right molly you may yes well you can try and inspect at the moment it hasn’t taken a lot of damage and it’s hard to see if any-- the only plate that’s open is the one that has the lens visible but it’s really close to the body and right now there’s blades spinning in its space at the moment not really it’s still fresh in battle and its armor plates are pretty much protecting all of it where are you going to attack its construction oh with the lollipop all righty you’re going to be right there on top of the door all righty take your attacks nice make your damage on that and roll the second attack that’s-- 17 points of damage nice correct 12 does not but first strike carves through and some of the armor bends inward as you cut through plates bend inward and have to try and retract to protect but they’re locked in place you’ve actually bent them to the point where they cannot reform this armored mesh it’s trying to correct itself but busted in place the second strike as you come down one of the blades catches and parries it off to the side no impact on the second blow go for it 14 does not hit this is a tough mother you go to strike a third time you do hit but it just doesn’t cut through the blade shakes a bit you pull back cursing yourself for those questioning even though it is blinded it lowers its attack because some people are like attacking things with blindness have advantage because it is nothing but a spinning whirring of blades and technically it has multiple forms of sight it is not granting advantage on the attacks against it all righty you try and move this way all right you’re hopping up this edge okay so that will be probably over here best you can for this you manage to scoot yourself up to that side and climb away it does swing out towards you it does have disadvantage on the attack because of the blindness that will bring it to a 13 to hit you manage to duck out of the way that ends your turn there that brings us to caleb and jester no it is surrounded there's beau to one part of it it's about ten feet from yasha and about 15 feet from molly strength save that is a 15 what is your dc five points of damage got it it is held in place that it does that ends your turn caleb are you going to stay back in the corner where you are you are backed up into the current corner as far away as you can get that ends caleb's turn jester's up what are you guys doing with jester that was 15 to hit that does not hit the lollipop swings down and then bounces down off the armor the spiritual weapon is not able to penetrate its armored hide that's your bonus action jester still has an action 26 definitely hits roll damage on that yes and the next attack on it has advantage 14 points of damage nice as the released guiding bolt slams into the side of it the blast of divine energy explodes some of the plates dent inward and now you see this glittering energy that's entwining its body giving you a glimmer of some of the weak points to help you hit where it'll hurt the most does that finish jester's turn she going to stay where she is or is she going to move okay so she tries to move into the doorway yeah sounds good so that finishes jester's turn top of the round yasha that's half your movement so you still have 20 feet of movement right there you are now flanking with beau your first attack has advantage anyway because of the guiding bolt you cannot discern any sort of rear end or exhaust port you'll find out i'm sure 22 hits roll damage on that first strike 16 points of damage cutting through bits and pieces of it nice that's your first strike on it as you jam down grinding off some of the metal plates pull away from it and once again lock unable to push back into place there's small places where you're starting to buckle parts of its exterior armor so its ac actually does go down by one that's your first strike you get a second attack you do because you're currently flanking with beau 25 does hit roll damage correct just 2d6 plus five 11 points of damage nice yasha busting it out all right that finish your turn oh because it's restrained right good to know that finishes yasha's turn it's now fjord's go go for it make two strikes with the falchion first attack with advantage all right that hits the first attack that's a d8 plus-- a d8 plus four plus hex no booming blade is a cantrip that only gives you one attack as part of the action that's okay all right that's 13 damage it's been a long day i know fjord comes up holding the falchion hand swings down carving through the shadows of the hex helping the blade dig in that much more you have a second attack yep 13 points of damage that hits again with that with fjord carving into it twice with the blade each time the falchion is carving through each section more and more armored pieces are pushing inward it's not enough to lower its ac but it is taking more and more damage slowly you're piercing its heavily protected exterior fjord would have yeah ten more feet one or two steps all right still in melee it's a ten foot range that ends your turn all right that brings us to the gatekeeper construct the lens has retracted back into its armor and you hear this sound (whirring) the lens comes out and it has cleared the tar from its lens the lens retracts and pops out the back side immediately scanning the source of what's currently clutching it and its dirt-driven arcane paw the blade arms on the top retract in and instead these two heavy iron spears lock into place and both go firing outward towards caleb they have disadvantage because it is restrained with disadvantage it's going to be an 18 to hit for the first one all right all righty second one 16 and 18 16 plus eight it's going to be 24 the first one the shield (clang) it ricochets off and floats off in the background spinning the second one however pierces through the shield and hits you in the chest that's going to be 17 points of piercing damage and you are pinned to the wall it actually pierced through your chest and is now holding you into the stone your movement is zero and you are considered restrained against the wall you do so go ahead and make a constitution check with the damage taken it has to be at least a ten or higher no and with that the paw is broken no it's gone you’ve lost concentration on the spell and it did recharge its shrapnel blast that being the case that’s going to finish its turn it's going to stay put because the blades now grind out again and begin whirring and spinning around its orb-like body that brings us to beau beau at the top of your turn because you are within five feet of it you automatically take whirling blade damage by being in proximity that was yes yes so at the top of your turn you'll take it as well that's six points of slashing damage to you beau now take your turn fuck you sam you do because you're flanking a four and a six okay that dice is weird for that because then you rolled the d20 twice all right so roll the second one for the second strike the first roll you had was a four on the top so roll for your second die just keeping it kosher 18 hits yeah go ahead and make your strike with your staff four points of damage so that's eight as your staff strikes across it the wood of it while damaging doesn't seem to be having as strong an impact as you’d hope against its armored form it seems to be resistant to something that is not magical sure let's go ahead and-- i'm pretty sure-- i'm so sorry by the rules as written because it mentions the ki of the inside of the body-- there is no ki but there is a magical core i'll say that when you strike the body intending to stun it while you're not affecting the ki of a soul the ki that you're expending might interfere with its central energy core so it has to make a constitution saving throw that's going to be a 17 what's the dc it's a 12 plus five i'm sorry you have another attack you do that hits go ahead and roll damage for that second strike with your staff all right six it takes five points of damage as the second strike is still somewhat deflected by the armor of its body you can you spend a ki point since we've changed or errata-ed it it does not make a saving throw you just get to learn-- at level six you get to learn two things the lowest saving throw ability it has would be charisma (laughter) not against some spells okay go for it yep that hits five damage reduced to two this time you hit with your fists again it scrapes through the armor and you're bleeding at the knuckles from the impact it's hard to break through its shell this is a rough fight for a monk at level five unfortunately that finish your turn beau okay that finishes beau's turn nott and molly you're up go for it that hits go ahead and roll damage it is eight points of damage reduce that in half because it's a non-magical source that's four points of piercing to it it gets stuck in some of the gears you see some sparks from the inside but it doesn't fully pierce its shell go for it that is a magical bolt the bolt doesn't impact it just glides off the armor it lands somewhere in the distance you don't know if it's retrievable or not yet molly you're up all right you move in go for it first strike it dodges it moves out of the way the second strike actually makes an impact so roll for that 12 points of damage all righty carves through with the second strike this is your off-hand so it's not a magical weapon correct so the extra rite damage is magical but the actual blade will be halved so roll the d6 for your blade five reduced to two so two damage plus this doubled well no sorry the two is doubled because it was a crit so it would have been four plus three which is seven sure it's five damage so 11 points of damage now the armor is reduced to 16 as you're carving away at its armored shell it's starting to look pretty hurt you see it shifting rapidly trying to figure out its situation and tactically maneuver best it can if you back all the way up to here you can or all the way up to the top at the moment no okay sure caleb and jester you're up next caleb you're currently pinned to the wall you're muted also i can't hear you yasha does yes yasha fjord and then the thing as the paw reaches out once more to grab it-- that is a 19 14 plus five sorry man you're still maintaining concentration but it did not seem to grasp it at this moment all right that ends caleb's turn jester's up okay so step back through the door a little bit there what level so a d4 plus four to caleb caleb you heal seven points that's a bonus action from jester what's next you can only use a cantrip since you've cast a bonus action spell spiritual weapon is a bonus action spell you've already used the healing word unfortunately it doesn't work that way no or a cantrip but caleb's healed a little bit constitution saving throw wisdom to toll the dead it is wisdom you are right so that would put it at a 14 because it has no wisdom modifier 15 so it takes the damage go ahead and roll you're level five so it technically-- it's a 5th-level character so it's-- matt and not bad for a cantrip it's not too bad all right that's going to finish jester's turn does she want to move back into the door you got it jester is just on the side there all right finishes jester's go yasha you're up at the top of your turn you take blade damage because you're in proximity to it that's ten you take ten points of piercing damage so reduced to five there are a couple of pockets where you can see inside of it but you don't see the power source it's risky so you're just taking a strike with it you have advantage because you're flanked with beau some fights aren't great for every class i'm sorry 19 hits roll damage yep 16 ac 17 points carving past with the blade you have a second strike if you'd like yeah it is because you're flanking yeah that hits roll damage again 33 points of damage in one round yasha doesn't mess around that finishes your turn fjord's up correct you can do that so an additional three damage per strike yeah but now you know no you're not flanking with anybody so first attack with the falchion that's two attacks there yeah both will hit so roll damage on each so a d8 plus-- d8 plus seven on each attack plus a d6 on each so roll that nice starting to look pretty rough now as parts of it are breaking down a bit it's shaking and you see little sparks on the inside as gears are starting to connect where they’re not supposed to and grind against each other that finish fjord's turn five feet or ten one more and it’ll take an attack of opportunity up to you technically if he takes it no he can move farther than that okay it's not going to take an attack of opportunity it's currently focused on everything else around it that finishes fjord's turn this entity is going to attempt to shift back this way which means beau and molly both get attacks of opportunity against it you do not because it's still in melee with you no because it's moved out of that range 24 hits so roll damage it does not move 12 reduced to six got it nope he gets stuck there the bane of all gms everywhere no he did not technically move out of-- it's sticky it's one of those weird things where he doesn't technically move beyond the range but he tries to i'll let you have it sure you have no advantage currently no you would need something right there in that corner to flank that hits roll damage it angrily is going to open to do its shrapnel blast it was that powerful i need molly beau fjord and caleb and technically jester as well she didn't close the door there she stepped into the space to maintain eye contact dex save please that's a success that is a failure success oh you're not there nott fjord and jester if you could okay so everyone saves except for fjord sorry jester 27 points of piercing damage halved to be 13 points of piercing damage to everybody you rolled a-- no you do not so you take the full 27 points of piercing damage no shit and still pinned jester took a full 27 she rolled low for her dexterity check 27 points of damage that's its action it is locked in place and it can't move its speed is zero frustratingly caleb i need you to make another concentration check please from the damage you took i thought your other cat hand it failed but can you still try it for every turn after or is it a one-time cast thing but you've recast it right but when you create it in space it stays there yeah and then as an action you can cause it to try and do things-- make a concentration check to see if you maintain the spell higher than a ten all right you succeed you maintain concentration that finishes your turn beau you're up first you don't have to roll you take damage from proximity to it so you automatically fail a death saving throw from the blades carving into your now-unconscious body nearby yeah whatever you rolled on your death saving throw yeah so that's a failure and a success that brings us to nott and molly that'll do roll damage with sneak attack five points of piercing damage on the first strike do you want to bonus action attack as well 23 go ahead that's 1d6 plus-- halved to three all righty sparks are flying it's starting to shake molly top of your turn the swirling blades spin around and you take eight points of slashing damage it's your turn at the moment for you if you move over beau's body it's a tough call i mean i'll let you do it if you want to you'll have to be standing over her unconscious body probably not it's up to you go for it take those shots molly that hits 12 points of damage all righty next strike yep roll damage on this one ten points of damage how do you want to do this the blades are spinning grinding around the edges of the armor scrape against your flesh pushing and cutting past skin causing blood to drip down your arm but this is a natural state for you as the arm pushes into the center there's a flash of blue light and the interior of its armored shell (electricity crackling) it's like a glow on the inside of a cracked dark orb as all the individual sections where the plate armors meet suddenly glow with a bright vibrant blue-white light and then go dark and the whole metal object hits the ground all the legs go limp and it rolls a little bit to one side now inert and no longer functioning as a construct the nega-snitch i love it we'll see how it fares all righty you all take a moment beau is bleeding out jester runs up yasha puts her foot up on the wall and with one big yank pulls it out of your torso caleb it was about two inches from the side of your body and thrust through your abdomen you begin to bleed but jester comes over and helps close up that wound before you bleed out too much further glancing into the chamber that is another closed gate that is bent inward from the repeated slamming of this centurion trying to make its way in looking past the inside you see four decomposed bodies make an attempt to do so these prison locks are a pain in the butt you haven't encountered something quite so heavily fortified as these cells okay make a strength check no you have to force it it is not budging you go over see where molly has failed and you go and try to fill that void make a strength check okay it's a little late but i'll allow it sure why not go for it 26 okay as yasha comes forward and slams her foot into it it jostles the lock just enough for you to slip past the tumblers and with a (creaks) it opens a few inches on the inside the bottom of it is scraping against the stonework the way it's been bashed and bent has actually forced it out of the frame of the door and it's going to take a bit more force to push it open enough to move inside but you manage to do so okay make an investigation check how many ball bearings did you throw out your entire bag okay you get your pouch back and you manage to scoop up-- you have we'll say 814 ball bearings (laughs) most of which because it's such a ridiculous item okay sure so you make your way to the opposite end make an investigation check you find-- at first you think it's dried compost but you eventually realize no it's just very old human excrement you found prison poop yes yasha you head off to the other side where the gate is open and as you go inside you can see the interior of this chamber is as scraped up as the rest of them from where this sentry was attempting to scan and break out on the inside-- make an investigation check first time for you 11 okay looking around on the inside you take a glance-- and there are these little pieces of things everywhere some hard some soft and you start pulling it up and you notice that a lot of these are tiny torn slivers of blanket or sheet or pillow and the other hard pieces are tiny shards of bone whatever prisoners who were in here who could not keep this at bay their remains have been time and time again ground battered and destroyed by this creature as it ran through it has torn apart their bedding and their bodies but beyond that nothing else of interest fjord pats you on the shoulder next to you and goes hey i just wanted to let you know i appreciate what you did taking the brunt of it because it didn't even hurt me and that's because of you i know all righty so what else are you guys doing okay while caleb's taking a moment to finish his short rest you begin to peer inside and pull back some of the loosened armor plates now that the machine is open there's not tension holding it together and you see that each of these armored plates on the inside are attached to its own arm-like pole once it collapsed all the armor plates went limp and fell open it's a tension-held bit of armor that it could expand and push out different areas to leave openings and then retract again it's a pretty ingenious design and you can see why tinkertop is a talented man though flawed sometimes in his designs this is pretty revolutionary similar to that i guess you could say looking inside it's hundreds of these little poles and gears and little servos and a lot of them are ground bent and damaged from the impact that you left inside there in the center you see a cracked open and partially destroyed bluish crystal sphere that was where your final blow impacted to destroy it it's yanking and bending pieces pulling them out and (pinging) on the inside with the damage you've done it's not too hard to pry a few off but you manage to get to it and there is the cracked and shattered crystal core that's just part of the miniature that was my representation for it i did not have a mini of a spherical ball made of armor i'm sorry that's the best i could do for size and intimidation i've been very busy didn't have time to make an entire mini of a tiny spherical metal ball covered in blades sorry no it's fine you do a scan of detect magic through the room over the next 15 minutes or so you do a thorough pass around nothing magical catches your attention most of the interior here is-- actually no that's not true very faint magical auras from two ember light torches that are on the wall that faint red light that you've seen is essentially a very low light everburning torch you pick yourselves up and make your way back to the heavy metal door on this side you can see the heavy scraping across it as this ball has also been pushing repeatedly into this one exit point as you approach it is still closed and presumably locked you hear some shifting behind it and eventually hear the familiar grinding of chains against metal (creaking) it opens slightly and the guards peer out you alive go check it out a few of the gnomish guards push past and head down another one of the gnomish guards goes well fucking a is it done the other gnomes rush past him and say sure enough they killed the thing he's like oh all right i'll lead you back to our boss come on follow me fireman carries you make an insight check okay go ahead and roll for that five make an investigation check as you glance around the space because it's a small space you do manage to recover it so you get one bolt back it did not trigger if it hits an intended target possibly or something hard enough you rolled low enough where it didn't seem to truly impact you guys slowly make your way guided back by the various guards of the gearhold prison to the office of the wardenhelm where both rissa and her father are waiting as they walk in you glance over and can see cleff he’s like so how'd it go any luck with the thing oh you broke it i'm simultaneously impressed and kind of sad but impressed mostly it's more for when it's raining i didn't think it would be for tar but good to know he takes out the note in his little pad at this point you see turning in the office vicinity wardenhelm poppin turns and goes it appears my guards say you are successful in this that is very good i am impressed what is your names if i might be of curious the mighty nein all right good to know that the mighty nein can be relied upon in such situations are you staying in town for quite a while right while you were down there i got approval for about 200 gold from the starosta for payment i hope that is enough i am curious as to what you are referring to oh of course great deal ooh sternum it's a bit pain-- go ahead and make a persuasion check with advantage a six why you keep leading these social encounters well you got a talker but that's okay he takes a keen look at you goes over and starts thumbing through papers goes through his books picks one and goes schuster schuster schuster all right i found the report here he turns the page that looks like they were arrested for false idol worship that is not a minor offense the schusters are still to serve a two-year sentence both of them to pay the amount to bail them out would be at this point about 350 gold with the 200 that were offered that would put you at a 150 bail amount should you wish to indeed pay for these very important friends of yours and they will because it's still technically commissioned originally by the prison so we own the rights to its carcass however the moment of negotiation is over this is my price as it stands either you receive the 200 and walk away or you can continue to pay the bail and they will be released that is up to you-- 150 gold that's true marisha fjord says you know what to keep them out of that orphanage look at that it's beautiful at this point he-- it's true he accepts the coin shouts out to-- he says micahl and this female halfling comes rushing in he says i would like for you to write a writ for me of success in clearing the lower regions of the prison under the watchful eye of the wardenhelm poppin drokrusher i thank you and also could we please have sent up immediately a he leans forward gilda and wallace schuster they are on the second level in cell 12b they have had their bail paid the halfling rushes off some of the guards leave with her and about 20 or so minutes later you hear the footsteps return and there you see this couple they pull forward dirty sallow not very well-fed but alive and they both look bewildered the man who's got a thick graying brown scruff and the hair a bit shaken from his form he glances up at the rest of you i don't understand what's happening the woman looks over she has this long curled and tangled brownish-red hair she goes is this true we're free with that you guide the now no-longer-prisoners outside of the gearhold prison and as the small door opens to lead them out into the late afternoon air the sunlight hits them and you see them blink and wince and then look up and smile as this is probably the first sunlight they've seen in six months you can see a bit of glimmer as tears begin to form at the edge of their eyes and the two the couple look at each other and smile and hold each other and look back at the group of you and say thank you but why are they all right where are they they look at you and look both frightened by the words you say and then equally frightened by the creature they now realize that is saying it and go right right thank you thank you very much can we go to our children please with that you guys all make your way back up the switchback path to the idleworks shelf just as the sun begins to hit the mountains the skies turning to the oranges and reds of the coming sunset at this point the people of the city begin to rise in energy once more as the whistles of a day's work come to a close the city beings to liven up once more into an air of celebration music blasting around you on all sides as you guys push through the streets now the celebration expanding and exploding throughout the vicinity your still-lingering hangovers from the night before mixed with your physically damaged selves make you less jovial in this space eventually you make your way to the back to the location of the previously boarded-up butcher shop it appears to be left alone closed locked and as you left it (whistling) (knocking) you hear some shuffling and the door opens austin and gail look past and open the door as soon as gail can say you're back-- they look and you can see their parents right there smile back at them with that they rush out gail and austin and wrap their arms around their mother and father behind them skittering layla and jude look past and they run up as well and hold them now this family unit of six all brought together again as filthy as they may be in their current garb and lifestyle hold themselves amongst the glowing of distant fireworks going off an unknowing celebration that the city holds for this family behind you see kiri shuffle out see what's happening then also come forward and put her arms around the family and looks back at you with a smile (like jester) yes i am a good girl kiri steps away from the group looks at the rest of you takes the dagger out steps forward and goes (like nott) the mighty nein (like jester) okay (like caleb) ja at this point they're barely paying attention they look back and say i'm sorry what fjord steps in next to you as well and goes look no children should be without their parents and we're happy to have brought you back together be more careful make sure that if you do anything that could put your kids at risk don't he looks over and defers back to you caleb the parents look at each other and down at the kids the little girl layla with her curled red hair goes does this mean she can stay and looks over at kiri kiri looks between them and you and looks temporarily conflicted and confused but you can see a bit of understanding wash over kiri reaches over and takes from her pocket the dagger steps forward and turns it around handle forward holds it out (like jester) yes i am very sweet she reaches down and pulls out the music box slowly opens it after winding it [music box plays] (like caleb) she's a pretty good egg looks up at caleb and rushes forward and gives a big warm hug she accepts it wide-eyed i don't know what to say she steps back and they look like they're in shock still from these strangers that have come to their aid so heavily kiri pulls back and looks to you (like jester) don't eat humans okay jester you see her arms twisted up and the eyes filled with water and she goes oh we're going to come back right she gives a big hug and goes kiri you're going to be so beautiful as you grow up and this family is going to take care of you and is going to be your new mother and father and you’ll have this whole family here for you remember that no matter what's happening and what you are doing the traveler is always looking over you and we are always-- always thinking of you with love jester turns around and you can see the tears welling up in her eyes she takes you in there fjord steps forward and ruffles the feathers on the head and says you're always a member maybe one day you'll be able to come back and use that dagger for something that's alive kiri turns back and looks to you (like nott) yeza was his name she gives you a hug looks to molly and gives this distant stare (like molly) take care of them looks to you and comes up and cuddles up against your chest where she had slept the night before and (chirping) the feathers fluff up a bit (like jester) okay kiri turns back and steps beside the kids the family looks out and goes if there's ever the opportunity to pay this back or forward we will thank you more fireworks go off and the whole family looks up again and there's a moment where the family as one single unit pulling kiri into it gilda looks at them all and says it's been a long time since i felt the need to celebrate how about we all wash up and go out and take you for flowers the kids brighten up excited and kiri looks up happily and curiously looks back they all shuffle into the house the last look as kiri looks back over her shoulder (like jester) i am kiri the door closes fjord as you're walking along back to your inn goes now i know y'all did this because i asked you to and you weren't sure if you wanted to i want you to know that's appreciated you went out on a limb for me and these kids i'll remember that anyway come on as you guys make your way back to a more solemn evening the celebration is wild the blushing tankard tavern is in the same crazy energy and music you possibly can expect but you are too exhausted emotionally and physically you get a drink find your way back to your room and crash out hard long rest to you all the next morning you come to consciousness your first morning not hungover for a lot of you here in the city of hupperdook now the city is yours to make your final business with well you haven't gotten back to tinkertop for your half of the deal as you hold it up it goes (snapping) all right you get another set of ten i think it was two copper that's amazing awesome as that's happening you guys have reached the exterior of the tinkertop inventions shop high-quality provisions for the rest of the trip if you drop a solid two gold-- you have good road meals that'll last-- oh for the whole group for the whole group put five gold down and i'd say you guys have some of the finest fucking food you could have on the road going north that is good eating on the outskirts of the tinkertop inventions shack you make your way on the inside and you see in the process of feverishly sketching out designs cleff tinkertop barely look up from his page oh hello good to see you all again thank you thank you for helping with that i think based on some of these new designs i'm coming forward they might be interested in a new version perhaps a new design perhaps an update if you will based on the notes you gave me so here's to hoping can i help you with anything ha ha right sorry i forgot entirely i'll be right back he goes back and rummages and pulls out the fantastic previously displayed tinkertop boltblaster 1000 and goes thank you for your help i hope it serves you well by the way if there's any problems if you wouldn't mind making notes and feel free to mail them off to me so i can perhaps improve on the next iteration if you don't mind that'd be fantastic of course and thank you as well wherever you're off to safe travels i think something can be arranged i'll be here that's a very curious series of words you've strung together but i'll keep an eye out for you course well if you're leaving you should say bye rissa behind him rissa sits up with her goggles on she was in the back currently working on something goes oh right you're off already you're leaving oh well it's been fun do thank you for showing me a good time and for getting this old coot back to some sort of interesting means of constructive work she goes well i mean drinking by proxy i'll certainly take that well next time i'll owe you a round well be safe take care and 'til the next time as you guys exit you hear her say i don't think this design's going to work dad he says no trust me and the door closes behind you at this point-- well no you slept through the night and you've woken up the next morning so it's pushing close to midday fjord musters the cart the horses retrieves them from where they were stored during your stay here looks like it unless you guys have anything else planned yes make a perception check as you make your way through the bottom end of the city 14 glancing through there are two crownsguard that walk by both gnomish one of them appears to be carrying a heavy sword on the back the other one does have some sort of strange contraption like a firearm pistol at its side make a sleight of hand check up to you all right sleight of hand so your proficiency modifier plus your dex well no sleight of hand is-- i'm sorry no it's a sleight of hand check 22 yeah my brain i was thinking of unlocking it glides past over you the guard’s none the wiser it is loaded with a single shot so you have a single-shot pistol with no ammunition yes all right with that-- in those final dark moments this campaign goes really dark suddenly with that you guys head out past the fences the artillery construction ranges the plumes of smoke and steam the dual-shelved levels of the gnomish city of hupperdook with the people adventures that you met and left behind and forge your way on further up the crispvale roadway heading towards the glory run road that heads north towards nogvurot and the shadycreek run heading on for the next better half of the day you make a fair amount of travel before the sun eventually sets before you can reach the crossroads eventually having to pull off to the side of the road to make camp for the first night there you head off your general curious range there you set up a small camp who's taking first watch okay nott and caleb if you wouldn't mind rolling a perception check with advantage or both of you roll it individually no he rolled and now you all right you guys take your first watch nothing though you're not paying much attention nothing seems to transpire during that first watch period you finish it without issue the second watch come up fjord goes ahead and says i'll take it you'll join as well yasha all right you guys take your second watch fjord and yasha are currently situated there two of you are up it's now pushing past maybe one or two in the morning the fire is burned low to embers at this point and you're both staying close for heat fjord's sitting there looking and goes i'm kind of proud of all this you know yeah a lot of these folks have surprised me a little voice goes like (as jester) some people are trying to sleep but i’m awake now fjord goes like let’s take a walk fjord stands up jester stands up and the three of you step away for a minute fjord looks up at the stars and goes dreams’ve been weird for all the visions the darkness out there it’s good to know that somehow maybe we're all putting a little bit of light in there too who knows maybe we’ll find ourselves a path somewhere along the coast in the long run could show you some of my hometown maybe some of yours but maybe not quite as well put together jester interjects at this point and goes well if we do go back i could show you-- if it is safe depending on what my mom says-- the places where i grew up the beautiful shorelines have you been to the menagerie coast before oh it is so beautiful it would be incredible her mouth isn’t making noise you go to talk no sound comes out of it either there’s a look of confusion amongst the three of you i need you to make a wisdom saving throw yasha what did you roll in that moment of panic you go to reach for your weapon and suddenly your muscles seize up and your body is unable to move your eyes glance back at fjord who seems to be in the same position the falchion apparates in his hand but he is unable to move jester is the only one who is like-- as she turns to run for the group and impacts the chest of a dark humanoid figure who’s standing there who grabs and holds her in place four other dark figures emerge from the shadows around and grab and immediately put their arms around you you try and resist from the spell in fact make another wisdom saving throw fjord maintains it but all this in absolute silence there is no sound just shadows and starlight as you’re now being grappled by two men the spell breaks from you however they’re still holding you as you feel a gag pulled over your mouth from one of them the other one begins to throw rope around you you’re looking over the side and you can see another gag showed into fjord’s mouth manacles are being shoved onto his arms and legs he's unable to move jester tries to break free off the opposite-- not with a natural seven she’s kicking and screaming but there is no sound coming out and as she’s pushed down another figure comes up and throws shackles onto her arms behind her and her legs she’s yelling and yelling and a gag is pulled over her mouth what are you doing there’s two people that are now coming to grapple you all right you pull your weapon make an attack if you want 25 hits roll damage on that 18 damage oof you have a second attack if you like your first one impacts one guy and there’s a splash of blood silent once again no sound here the second one swings wide and the other guy captures it he grabs your arm and pulls you in he’s going to make an athletics check against you make an athletics or acrobatics check to try and not be grappled that’s not going to make it he grapples and holds you in place the other one takes and slams manacles onto your wrists and pulls it back wrenching the blade from your grasp your arms are now locked behind you into these metal manacles you go ahead and scream make a straight wisdom check in that moment as you try and scream out your vocal cords strained by the sheer force of your voice no sound comes out looking up in the sky there isn’t a single cloud in sight probably for the first time in weeks since you’ve been in this side of wildemount it is a clear night no sign of clouds no sign of storm in that moment as you’re screaming out the gag gets put into your mouth and tied behind your head you glance over and you can see jester being dragged now the manacles affixed to the back of her ankles and she’s being pulled through the grass fjord a few feet behind her still unable to really make out the shapes of these hooded figures that are pulling them through and you are shoved to the ground your ankles are about to be manacled make another athletics check 25 all righty with that you manage to kick free and they can’t quite get ahold on it and one figure steps forward shorter than the others stout looking and goes oh for the-- and his voice dissipates as he gets closer i need you to make another wisdom saving throw you’re still kicking and breaking free they’re going to try to restrain you once more roll one more athletics check no that’s not going to do it as much as you struggle right now you’re by yourself now it looks like two figures holding you down and the third one that is frustrated that you have resisted a spell a second time they get the manacles on the back of your legs your arms are held behind your ankles are now pulled up towards where your hands are and you are face down in the wet grass in the middle of the night as you feel your body now being dragged by the chains dragged dragged your mouth is filled with the taste of the sweat that’s poured down that’s soaked into the gag that's now forced in your mouth grass and grime and mud are grinding against your face all you can see is the dark shadow there and the bits of star and sky ahead until eventually you’re lifted upright right back once more immediately you can see a series of wide carts large travel caravan carts that are low set covered with piles of goods looks like sacks and a couple of crates fairly sparse-looking for travel caravan crates but what you see travel up and down the roads all the time there are three of them with horses to the front of them you can see about eight other figures around these carts as you’re up held there with your mouth gagged and your arms and legs bound you look off to the side and you can see fjord and jester also struggling and unable to find their way about jester begins to flex against it and you can see her strong physique pushing against it and she gets smacked upside the cheek by one of the men that pulls her and holds her in place you hear a voice speak up and say hey look what we found eh you see a dark figure step closer to you glancing up through the minimal light a human man tall and brutish his head is completely bald on top revealing a scarred and tattooed design across one side that curls down into his lightly leathered armored chest his thick brow hangs over two cold uncaring eyes he nods in approval to these three acquisitions that you are revealing a number of golden teeth between his cracked lips his muscular body is mostly obscured by a cloak and hood beyond that armor the thug goes lorenzo your instincts are sharp looks like we found ourselves a sudden bounty the heavy figure who hasn’t spoken at this point kneels down and grabs the chins of each of you grabs jester who is now shaking with anger and fear in her eyes looks both sides of her face goes to fjord and lifts the chin comes to you and grabs-- the gag is right there so you-- (coughing) looks like this one’s got some spirit too (chuckles) our prospects are good with this find two divine-blood and one half-beast i’m pleased toss them in with the others we’ll head back our cages are at capacity now he stands back up and turns around and heads back to the carts as you’re all being thrown to your sides again and being dragged through the wet grass and dirt over rocks you can feel gashes being pulled across your face and shoulders as you’re being pulled through the dirt you’re righted once more and two more goons lift you up towards the back of this mostly empty cart it seems just small piles and boxes and then suddenly your vision shifts as if you’re being pulled through a curtain and these carts are piled high with cages and the opened one that the three of you are showed into clangs behind you this five feet by five feet box as the three of you are jammed into each other uncomfortably you look about inside under what looks to be a darkened tarp that covers the cages glancing out the side of your eye you can see in the one next to you that there are other dark humanoid figures quietly whimpering and not moving you hear heyup and the horses begin to pick up speed as the creaking of wheels turning get faster and the feel of the cart beginning to move and that’s where we’re going to finish tonight’s session (groaning) it’s possible there were some struggle it’s going to be interesting love you guys well she didn’t take her haversack with her when she parted with you guys you can take that up with laura oh boy love you ashley she goes back to new york you’ll hop in when you can he knows that i know i
