it's brilliant stuff all righty so without further ado let's get back into the realm of exandria yes in hobotown usa so last we left off vox machina having traversed many places in the world in hopes of finding a way to expel or destroy the chroma conclave a collective of four chromatic dragons that together managed to destroy large bastions of society on the continent of tal'dorei and beyond in wildemount thordak the cinder king the seeming leader of their group currently sits in the center of the partially destroyed city of emon the other dragons have scattered about and claimed their own territories from this the party has discovered the existence of these legendary magical items referred to as the vestiges of divergence that existed from wars long past they were carried on from generation to generation that contain power that may be sufficient to defeat these creatures you were sent to seek out the nameless sphinx that exists somewhere near the frostweald weeld-weld it's pronounced so many different ways-- it can be any of them it's a magical world the frostweald it's in that weird place frost brimley frost brimley is the most dangerous of forests by the way everyone gets diabetes sorry somewhere the sphinx exists in the frostweald which the nameless mate to osysa the gynosphinx you met in vasselheim sent you to go seek out this information upon going to the town of westruun to the north it had been partially destroyed by the black dragon umbrasyl and in its absence had been taken over by what seems to be grog's roving barbarian herd they currently sit on the throne of the town of westruun and have made some sort of accord with the dragon where they can both simultaneously rule that area as long as they continually provide goods gold and whatever they can procure from those who live within the city still deciding to continue south the party made their way into the ever-frozen forest of the frostweald you stumbled upon a small hive of basilisks that surrounded an obelisk of ioun which gave you your first clue as to the location where this sphinx could be found you battled the basilisks destroyed their underground hive or at least the exit from it via fireballs and other such stone wall endeavors found amongst the stone ruins of previous victims of the basilisks you found most of tyriok gadsworth the wandering cartographer now missing a portion of his right arm however he is restored and alive which is much better than how he was before and is currently leading you guys towards a camp of orcs supposedly nearby as some of the survivors of westruun's destruction were camping far south and some were being captured by this roving orc camp so you guys have just stepped away from the obelisk and the remains of these basilisks you've slaughtered as tyriok leads you guys from where he last saw-- at least where he saw some roving orcs before he found himself turned to stone in that previous area as you travel along the cold midday air of this forest there's no wind it's very still and very quiet which is unsettling in a place that's so out and open in nature your boots are crunching through the snow step after step but you're still being as careful and as quiet as you can moving along tyriok is shivering in the cold and one of you manages to pull out one of your extra blankets you have in the bag of holding to keep him from going into hypothermia you guys press on for about ten minutes or so and he's trying to look around and look at the placement of the sun look at different areas that he'd seen within the forest and he's thinking to himself all right so i recognize that mountain spire time of the day that way is north west follow me and he continues to lead you in that direction yes you're terrible the best weapon i have is right here he's trouncing through the snow little bit ahead stopping looking about before you realize that he's a huge target he's making a lot of noise you cast it before the battle i don't recall if you cast it afterwards okay yes why that's what i was doing perhaps i should stand in the back then if you guys want to go loosely that way about 300 paces to the right of the second stone you see with the large outcropping that looks like a gorilla's face and then continue i'll guide you from back here he steps to the back okay okay his eyes don't leave the blade and he goes okay make a deception check make a persuasion check he goes perhaps this is best suited for someone who knows how to wield such dark powers oh this is more my speed perhaps you have a third or fourth dagger i can try how about i take no dagger and i stay away from this you guys are starting to be a little weird and he hands you the secondary dagger and he puts his one hand up to say the least all right okay as you guys start walking his eyes don't leave the blade as he takes each step and (whoosh) okay so i'll have you guys all roll a perception check if you could as you guys are walking keyleth shoots her arms out in a stop motion and you look off and you can see past the clump of trees maybe 60 feet ahead of you guys two hulking-looking humanoids tromping through the snow dragging something behind them you hear the distant crunch of the snow and there's shape but it's darker in the area where they are in the distance can't really make out a form but you figure these are probably orcish in nature based on their gait and their outline eh parallel a little bit away have you guys all roll stealth now well you guys are in the center of the frostweald so it's relatively thick trees relative canopy so what are you guys going to do i mean you recognize the terrain it's a large forest not nearby none that you've seen at least if you want to go look for that you could but-- if there are paths they're under so much snow and relatively fresh snow that's perpetually piled on this region they're not visible at the moment you can occasional hoofprints in the snow from some wildlife that might live in the vicinity of the forest from what you can see around you don't see any tracks from them specifically in front of you from where they're travelling it appears to just be the two of them right now they're either scouts or hunters and the closer you guys as you slowly approach to get a better view they're both dragging what look to be like two boars that were killed are currently being dragged by their legs over their shoulders leaving a trail of crimson in the snow behind them so you guys-- okay you don't catch up you follow okay so you guys continue moving forward watching them as they go at a far enough distance pike's doing her best to walk behind in the snow but it's okay she's barely moving her upper body to make sure it's minimal amount of movement yeah listening out you can hear the occasional laughter too far away to hear any sort of language not that i think you understand or know the language orcish but eventually they come over a hill and down and you see it first as you crest over you can see there is a small clearing in the forest of this area where there are two tents what looks to be relatively filth-stained tents like they've been used for an extended period of time covered in dirt and mud and other things you can see a small pile of skinned bodies to a side of one of the tents there's a large stump next to it with a trail of blood that leads up to it you can see there are two small fires that are set in the center of this area where they're keeping warm to themselves and these bundled-up orcs are sitting around the fires drinking you can see some of them have random silver mugs or cups some have steins some have carved pieces of bark that are used as a means of drinking you can see outside of these tents what appear to be large barrels or casks of wine or liquor that have been probably raided from the camp they found outside of the lake you can see a couple of them are much larger than the other orcs one of them is sitting down by the fire and is chuckling with the rest you see to the back of the camp there is one that's taking javelins and chucking them up in the air and they're arcing through and every time he chucks one you hear a (scared noise) and as soon as you move to the edge of it you look over and there is a young man who's strung up by his torso from one of the trees and it looks like a few of the orcs are making target practice they've already hit him twice there's one that's sticking out of his thigh and another one that's embedded itself in his shoulder and little trails of blood streaking down but he is currently strung up like a piñata and they're having fun with him you take a moment as the rest of the group catches up to you on the edge and you can see there are a few other people being kept inside the tents right now one large orc musters out adorned in thicker armor than the rest of them he has a band across his head with a big old rough uncut gem on the front he starts barking out orders to a few of them one of the larger ones stands up and he's probably a good foot taller than the other orcs lumbers to the back of the two tents and you can see there are two bears that are currently chained up to the back he reaches over and grabs one of the skinned bodies from the side of the tent and throws it to the two bears and they immediately start tearing it apart and eating it at this point the rest of the party catches up to you yes in fact i could probably show you now since you have-- the barrels are right there right there and right there there there and there yes they haven't noticed you you are probably back here a good 60 feet outside of the outskirts of the camp they don't seem to have noticed your approach and this is entirely however you guys want to approach this it's mid-afternoon no you haven't rested since the basilisks it was a bump in the road the basilisks once it's cast it's 24 hours that door stays there you guys are probably about 60 feet away from the far outside of the campline so around this ring here just outside of where the table edges are you're probably closer to about 60 feet away right now you can move for-- so who all's flanking around all right so the twins and percy where are you guys going over here okay so all right are you going with him okay percy you're going with vax okay easy enough you get a bead on him in the outskirts there you're going to be right there so grog where are you going vax all right so you make your way around keeping your guys' existing stealth checks which were okay okay not stealthy okay then she stays there so pike's going to go-- scanlan you're moving back where are you going where do you guys want to go-- keyleth for this distraction where do you guys want to set up for the distraction all right so you guys are set up right about there you're further back i can only put you so far away from the table edge all right pike's going to stay up with you since you have the bead right now and if worse comes to worst she can help rush in and try and help at that point all right so who's doing what all right okay back far this way okay i'll put this little dice on the corner to represent where the door is these two right here are taking turns at this point you hear another (grunt scream) and then some (condescending laughter) oh moving up to here right there all right who's up next who's doing what for what percy's taking the bead waiting for the distraction what are you conjuring you have to know what you're doing i hate conjuration spells by the way guys so you all know the worst spells in the whole game does it really fuck that spell (laughter) fuck that spell conjuration needs to die no conjuration's great when you're not the dm how about some dryads we'll go see what their challenge rating is past the devils and no we're not doing the whole pixies polymorph that's so dumb not even going to lie challenge rating of one i don't think centaurs are fey two dryads you can do up to two challenge rating-- we will say here two dryads where are they going right there now suddenly the dryads pop into being and these two humanoid green nature entities that look humanoid but are covered with leaves and their skin has the texture of bark in places beautiful wistful both appear summoned out of the ether and land on the snow the ground gives out from under them they both go (screams) and fall into a pit here this whole section here has now crumpled below the dryads however have to make a save one of them saves that wasn't you guys like right there okay all right one dryad dies a horrible screaming death (screams) and the other one you hear is breathing heavily from the inside right now at which point a bunch of the orcs turn around i need both of you guys to-- let's see because they're making active perception what was your stealth check sam (chuckles) okay all right all 60 feet you avoid the pit you roll around all the orcs look over huh stupid gnome initiative has now kicked in i need everyone to roll initiative (laughs) jesus christ all right so-- initiative orders 25 to 20 whoa all right 25 so we have vax 24 percy keyleth and grog oh man 16 vex and then pike right after you 11 tyriok is hidden away as you guys begin to approach the camp he's like i'm going to stay back here so he's way out of the field now scanlan bringing up the rear as he would want to all right so that brings us to the top of the combat round all the orcs now have stood up grabbed their weapons and they see this giant hamster wheel of a gnome rolling into the camp they all look really confused but have their weapons ready to go vax you're up first you used them on the basilisk fight right there all right go for it 21 hits not surprise they have been made aware that there is a threat as scanlan rolled in you do have advantage because he doesn't see you so it would sneak attack 29 points of piercing damage the giant creature as the dagger (whoosh) through the air doesn't even notice it it's looking over where scanlan is and is grabbing the chains and breaking them from where the bears are currently bound hasn't broken them yet he's going in for the pull as the dagger (impacts) the back of its neck and it's looking over in the direction where it came from what are you doing okay go ahead and go for it roll for stealth 30 he glances over in your direction looks up looks in the other direction reaches up and goes to pull the dagger out but it's already gone (roars) and angrily yells out into nothing has no idea where you are awesome ends vax's turn percy you're up you do actually yes go for it correct how long does it last though i will check it's been about an hour or so since that last encounter as you were travelling through the forest so with hex up to an hour yeah unfortunately for you yeah 'cause it's the feat as opposed to an actual class feature all right taking your aim sharpshooter or not 24 hits heavy plate armor covered orc-like creature bigger than a regular orc that you've seen before yes he does that is going to be a nine 'cause he rolled really bad so with that (impact) 15 points of piercing damage as you (gunshot) rockets off the sound cracks through the air all the orcs now glance over in your direction as the bullet streaks past them tickling the bottom of the feet of the guy who's strung up and slamming into the chest of the armored orc lands straight on his back on the ground right there all right right there go for it you reload and then the third attack for the shot is that even with sharpshooter (chuckle) all righty 33 points of damage you blow that orc's head clear off its shoulder spray of mist comes out the top of his form as he slumps down into the fire in front of him two other orcs look over at you who are now clearly visible (grunts) (chuckles) all right that ends your turn brings us to keyleth they weren't coming and looking at the edge of the pit they all looked over in the direction of where scanlan was rolling in around the center they're all still in place watching this giant gnome roll in but some of them have looked over at percy who's firing a very loud weapon in their vicinity he's about 15 feet did you use your scorpion form you haven't taken a short rest yeah so you can't-- scanlan is right here between you know what you may have yeah if you want to do that i'll let you do it we'll say we allowed a short rest that way you were reviving tyriok and everything that's fine all right all right go ahead and make an athletics check you know what this would be strength yeah we'll make it strength 17 okay the orc looks as you (explosion) out of the snow and rock being thrown out of the area and huh looks over his shoulder at you with confused look goes to wring the edge of this giant club it's holding to come towards you as you grab both shoulders gives you this look of utter sheer fear as you lift him up and lob him over the side into the pit yeah he does not make his save 28 points of damage yeah you hear a (pained grunt) you don't know (high-pitched grunt) (laughter) the dryad was almost out of the pit climbing her way out (heavy landing) all right so keyleth does that end your turn all right grog you're up so i'll let you go to the back of the initiative order all righty vex what you got i mean no one seems to have noticed you at the moment six spaces yeah 'cause you don't have any additional movement from there you can keep moving if you use the rest of your action to move again yeah all right which one do you want to shoot the one right there okay go for it both attacks 18 just barely hits that hits roll damage twice on that yes on the first one so roll an additional-- 22 points of damage for the first arrow nice second attack no just the first one 14 nice you pull two arrows out and release them both at once as you duck behind the tree the guy who's pulled out this giant greataxe and is now starting to lumber in the direction of keyleth this giant earth elemental that burst out of the ground both arrows sink in go ahead and roll stealth again as both arrows sink into the back of the armor piercing through and embedding themselves a few inches or more into the back of this this creature looks over its shoulder towards you what'd you roll 36 glances back over doesn't seem to have any idea where the arrows came from but is grimacing in the pain end your turn all right pike now is going to-- as everyone's scattered about pike is going to move forward let's see here yeah going to do what pike would do guiding bolt (laughter) so pike is going aim it at one of the guys one of the guys with the javelins that was throwing at the guy to prevent that from happening guiding bolt on that ranged spell attack-- oh yeah that'll hit that's a 15 plus six yeah that hits all righty that's 4d6 radiant damage to that guy 4d6 15 radiant damage 15 points of radiant damage the next attack against that guy has advantage as he's now a giant beacon as the blast streaks forward from her extended hand smashes into the front of this orc drops the javelin in his hand spins around looking in the direction she came from and you can now see there's this glow pulsing off the front of his armor that's going to go ahead and end her turn bringing us down to their turn now this guy is going to try and get back up he's going to bring down his greataxe onto the chains he was setting up he was going to try and break them now he's going to smash it down breaks both of the chains and both of the bears are now free he got up he can still only move three more squares there that's going to finish his turn this guy here is going to lurch forward in the front of you keyleth and take two swings with his greataxe towards you that is a 17 to hit all right so that hits and then that is an 18 17 and 18 both hit you you take 24 points of slashing damage as each smash of the greataxe streaks across the front of the stony armor that you wear breaking off chunks here and there but there's plenty more where that came from as an earth elemental that ends his turn let's see this guy's going to rush up this guy's going to rush up this guy here is going to attempt to climb out he gets partway up starts cresting over the edge he's not up because he was knocked prone as he fell so he's over the side percy you see one orcish arm come up and start to pull itself out the side of the pit this guy here is going to move up grabbing another javelin this guy is going to pick up his javelin from the ground move over this way seeing that the earth elemental is being taken care of and they're both going to throw javelins at you let's see that is a 24 to hit yes you can go ahead and roll well what does it say on the gloves yes exactly so it is eight points of piercing damage as it chucks the javelin you catch it and stop it in midair stab it into the ground as you're thinking how awesome that was the other one rolled a natural 20 (groaning) however still rolled pretty low on the damage that's going to be nine points of piercing damage for the second one what does it say on the glove it's a reaction you only get one reaction per round so no you cannot that one was a 20 a natural 20 yeah so yeah you take nine points of piercing damage as the other javelin streaks past you it cuts past the shoulder nothing too bad but didn't quite take away from the moment that you just got to enjoy nine points of piercing damage all right that ends that orc's turn this one the one that seems more decorated with the gem-encrusted headband runs out and starts shouting orders he's going to come forward and begin to attempt to attack your orb as well all three strike at the orb trying to cut through if you want to make a deception check deception yes as they're all striking at this sphere sparks of arcane energy shooting off with each blade attack against the outside they're all getting winded you can see sweat dripping off their brow as they're not seemingly making an impact however with each pained cry you give out you see their grins widen and they realize no this is working and all three of them keep hacking at it as the one war chief is like (yelling in orcish) and they keep slamming at the sides of this in hopes of cutting through it this one two javelins there that's good there that's good there i don't think they have one in there-- nope so that is going to be the end of their turn now the bears are going to go the two bears are going to go tromping forward 40 feet 35 40 this one's going to go ahead and run past to there since they can't attack anything this one's going to keep moving around he uses his movement to get behind there and starts biting at the back of the ball this one will get over to the earth elemental as it is the biggest and most visible target all right that's going to go ahead and end their turn scanlan you're up okay the orb vanishes and with a flick of your wrist a goodbye wave you vanish entirely from sight which tent do you want to appear in so you appear inside this tent and on the inside you can see there are two people that are currently within just to mark where the tent is they are human and they're pretty brutalized one of them you see is this relatively well-dressed nobleman his clothing filthy part of his face is swollen and bruised from what looks like he's been beaten within an inch of his life the other one is a woman and you can see one arm appears to be broken and she's cradling it in her hand and they're both recoiling and holding to the back like the corners of the tent and when you appear they both gasp and begin naturally scrambling away before they realize you're not an orc yeah you don't have movement you can start to move over to start unbinding them if you want to okay so you go to the rope bonds and start helping them try and release themselves okay that's the end of scanlan's turn grog you're up 30 35 40-- 45-- (cheering) we'll say go ahead and make an acrobatics check to try and move between those two guys 20 okay you manage to in a rage as you're rushing through yelling they're all confused by the moment of the disappearing hamster ball of a gnome look over their shoulder and you dive into a shoulder roll like a bowling ball slamming into two of them finding your feet on the other side swing around and the two that you pushed past knocked on their shoulder didn't fall off their feet but you manage to push your way through land in place spin around you can take the rest of your turn if you want right there he's just out of range okay it'll be either one of those two guys all right go for it i'd say go for each attack just in case individually just in case you manage to kill one you can move on to the next yeah well no do the first attack 15 for the first one hits 18 points of damage all right does fail its save 24 points of damage 24 to hit 24 hits 18 the first hack cleaves into the side of his shoulders the second one you bring across his midsection and his whole innards spill out onto the snow crumples into the ground before you as a bonus action but you're already using your bonus action as a frenzied rage yeah so you can do that outside of a frenzied rage if you kill something he also did fail his save on that so you got another bonus to strength what's your strength at now plus three on top of that nice all right what was the attack when you take a short rest yeah yeah i believe for craven edge-- short rest yeah but you can say you don't have to take a short rest if you don't want to it's up to you yeah if you wanted to keep it you would have been able to walk around aggressively and maintain it that's fine okay 27 hits oh that's the damage all right well if you're rolling to hit right whoever you're attacking the ac differs so what was your attack roll on that one yeah no that hits the bear so go for it damage the bear 27 points against the bear got you all right so after completely gutting the first guy you turn around and slam the axe into the hide of the bear up close you can see the bear unlike trinket edges of its shoulders and parts of its spine you can see bone protruding out in points and juts it's different a little more dangerous than a regular bear you've encountered at the get-go however your blade does sink a good four to five inches into its hide cleaving a giant wound in its side it howls and seems very pissed off but so are you he did make his save at 15 that end your turn that ends your turn all right back up to the top vax you're up magic-using orc oh that one oh yeah right there to the damage go for it 17 hits 15 misses unfortunately yes it does 39 is that with the plus ten sharpshooter so 49 49 points of damage as you dart up along the side of the tent getting behind the barrels it sinks right into the back between the shoulder blades of the chief orc of this group you see his whole body tenses up from the severe amount of pain and he tries to reach at from the back and spins around looking straight at you all right okay ending your turn there percy you're up roll for an attack right no i understand i do not believe the javelin is finesse so this may be a strength-based attack let me double-check so it's your strength bonus plus five what's your strength modifier so plus six for this roll technically you get advantage because he's there technically prone as he's getting up out of the-- 11 your first attack you whiff he ducks out of the way actually pulling down into the pit and it misses his head and he gets up again and extends a hand to reach out towards your ankle that hits as soon as he reaches out for your ankle you pull a pistol out and he looks up at you the front of his head detonates and he slumps backward falling into the pit silently the two guys that were throwing javelins at you have watched this happen they seem unaffected they're just really pissed off at you orcs aren't-- they're used to seeing their friends die they keep coming at you so these two are like (growls) your left okay okay go for it 26 hits 17 points of damage got it this one is a gut shot hits him on the side of the stomach and you can see part of the back of the armor blow out and he grabs it for a second and keeps looking towards you seemingly un-fully phased by the impact of the blow going to stay where you are okay use that pit to your advantage good ending percy's turn keyleth you're up vex you're on deck (laughs) okay so you'll move one two to get into combat range with two of them go ahead and make a slam attack against each of them yes all right i'm going to say those both hit go ahead and roll slam damage ten points so you take the larger orc who's coming at you with full plate armor and this greataxe that it's bearing towards you hacked at you twice last round and the one that just got shot in its gut by percy you stumble in the front of them and they both look up at you for a second snarl before you go knock-knock (whack) crack their heads together the one that percy shot pulls back its nose is smashed and it's a smear of blood on the front of its face it's still standing but it stumbles back a bit the other orc however as you pull back in your hand you look down most of its face is completely caved in you hear a slight gurgle and a little blub of blood come out of what used to be its mouth before its body goes limp in your grasp sure you take it and throw it over your head it arcs right in front of you percy down into the pit you hear a (yelp) as the final remnants of the dryad are crushed by the fall all righty that finishes your turn keyleth vex you're up yeah he changed his initiative okay this'll be your action to do this over here okay so using your action and trinket's bonus action as part of the attack here trinket all of a sudden leaps out of the necklace slamming into the larger bear in front for 30 feet that's five ten 15 20 25 30 what's trinket's movement 40 you have 40 landing right there go ahead and roll three attacks 12 hits the bear it's a big bear what's the second attack 15 just hits the orc and the third one all right so go ahead and roll the cannonball damage on those two it should be on trinket's sheet as one of the attacks if you don't have it written down i have it in my-- okay (laughs) that's okay i have it here in my pdf it's fine as part of your beastmaster-- i will fight you all right 2d6 plus eight bludgeoning damage however the one that missed does get an opportunity attack against trinket okay 12 on the first as the bear slams into the larger bear like rolling over the top and then comes down onto the second the other target the orc smashing into him the orc almost gets knocked off his feet and then the third one sidesteps and swings at trinket so go ahead and roll damage for the second orc 17 trinket crushes the other orc who'd already been softened up from the blow from keyleth's earth elemental as trinket rolls past you can see this crushed form of the orc on the ground in the snow crushed in place most of the bones broken and turned to dust the third one however sidesteps and is going to go ahead and take a swing at trinket that is going to be a 19 to hit 20 right across the top of trinket's armor no effect that's going to be your turn though all right that brings us to pike pike-- sure you did not start your round hidden unfortunately or did you oh no you did you did you totally did yes so you can hide roll stealth you'll have to move back over here-- so you move back behind the tree so you can find a place to hide and then you go ahead and vanish cartoon-style like run behind the tree and don't come out the other side pike's going to go ahead and one two three four five with the view there is going to go ahead-- pike's going to go ahead and continue to run over here because she sees that the guy who's hanging up there who has three javelins stuck in him now is like passed out and bleeding she's making her way around to try and heal him all right their turn now this guy here is going to go ahead and converge well no locked in with trinket he's not going to take the attack of opportunity from him this guy's going to move here that orc's going to move around to-- i know this bear's going to go ahead and move in on you marisha big old dire-bear-looking creature bearing down on you all right so the war chief begins to scream out (yelling in orcish) pointing at you grog and you see the other orc on the other side goes (yells) and seems to be energized by the rousing cry that it's given so advantage on attack rolls for all within earshot this guy's actually going to move-- all right so since i moved him up last round because he was hiding behind a tree there so the other larger orc the one that was tending the bears rushes up alongside with you as well keyleth all right so the war chief is going to make one attack as a bonus action it can do that against you grog with advantage that's going to be a 22 to hit all right you take 16 points of slashing damage reduced to eight because you're raging so eight points of slashing damage as the war chief comes down with its greataxe it sinks a few inches into your shoulder and it carves it down almost matching the scar you have across your chest and grinning at you the whole time as you grin back at it his friend is going to come up with its greataxe and is going to come down this is with advantage as well that's going to be a 17 to hit that misses as it comes up overhead to try and swing down to go towards the top of the nape of your neck and head area you notice out of the corner of your eye bring up your sword and deflect it down into the snow behind you looking over your shoulder at it the bear is now going to come up alongside and is going to make a bite and a claw attack against you that is going to be a 19 to hit and that's going to be a 21 to hit so you take nine points of piercing damage as it bites you reduced to four we'll say four i'm trying to round down consistently going forward so you take four points of piercing damage from that and then you take 12 reduced to six slashing damage total of 11 points of damage or ten you're right from the bear bear attacking you actually no first the orc attacking trinket now with advantage oh man that's a 16 even with advantage just slamming a greataxe over trinket's armor trinket-- bear against you keyleth that's going to be a natural 20 with the bite and natural 20 with the claws two natural 20s in a row that bear wanted a piece of you 18 24 we're looking at 30 no 42 points of damage on you in your elemental form from the bear bear bites into you and takes a mouthful of stone and tears a chunk out of the front of your sternum area and then with its claw swipes across your face ripping part of your elemental jaw exposing a little bit of soft earth beneath the other large orc the larger one with its axe is going to take two attacks with its greataxe against you that is a 21 to hit and an 18 to hit yeah the other large orc there all right you take 24 points of slashing damage as both of the greataxe blows come on from the other side you're being-- --chiseled down now yes that's going to end their turn that brings us to scanlan we'll say as your action this turn you will have been able to get them both out of their rope-binds including the one that has the broken arm it's not-- the back flap is currently hit into the ground with a stake it shouldn't be too hard to lift it up if you want to try which way do you want to go so right there okay they come out seeing all the action happening looking really nervous give you a nod and the woman says thank you and they both turn and if you point out the shimmering light they (running) and bolt off spending the entirety of their round-- okay they won't quite reach the door but they're on their way out from there yeah tiny gnome feet you do you don't see-- well you see pike because you're running behind pike is not making any tink-tink-tink behind you you can see grog in a frenzy yeah you can't see percy if you've ever seen an earth elemental go huh but you take your d10 inspiration die because it was a catchy tune seems familiar all right that's going to end your turn scanlan grog you're up go for it first attack 21 hits roll damage 20 with that you take the axe and you swing it in a wide arc across the front of the bear's body as you hit the edge of the bone it splinters at the impact and its shoulder-joint is knocked out the sword continues and cuts right halfway into its throat and actually manages to cut through a very main artery and the bear begins to bleed out on the spot onto the ground with the constitution of the bear no it makes it 14 it is dead the bear is no longer of the realm of the living you still get it's your bonus action-- right so unless-- it's only helpful when you're not frenzying when you're frenzying you get it every turn yeah yeah regular one or the war chief sure all right regular attack or great weapon master go for it 22 hits go ahead and roll damage 18 makes his constitution save so already still wounded and bleeding from the dagger that vax left in him earlier you manage to take the blade down sweeping across the front of its armor cutting and actually destroying and causing this jagged edge to the front of its armored breastplate make your next attack okay go for it with advantage okay so roll damage so you multiply that by two right before the modifier 2d6 which you rolled what right so it's seven times two so 14 plus your modifier and your rage right so that's plus 20 is what you're looking at on top of that so 14 plus 20 34 and then roll 4d6 on top of that brutal critical how do you want to do this (cheering) so you throw the blade down handle-first it falls a little bit forward you reach forward and grab the war chief and pull him down onto the blade he looks up at you staring into your face the entire time as you pull him over each jagged inch of the blade the life expires as it falls forward on the blade let me go ahead and make a constitution save that is 18 makes it but he is done that war chief is done well done that brings us to vax all right glancing at the tent by the way you do see there are a few people in there that are still bound and shaking and trying to look out and see what's happening all right yes that guy right there yeah that misses unfortunately or it doesn't miss it hits him but it hits the armor plates of his full plate it's too or the plate of the armor it's wearing is too strong and the blade can't pierce it that does hit correct 25 with that the first one hits the armor and streaks off and vanishes into the snow the guy turns around and looks over and looks at you directly grins shrugging off the earth elemental to his side grabs his greataxe and begins to move forward in a direction towards you angrily however as you let loose the second dagger it catches him right in the center of the face embedding itself between his eyes and one wanders off as the momentum carries it forward three or four steps (thudding) and grinds its face into the ground right before reaching you into the fire the body catches flame as soon as it lands collapsing into one of the campfires and it begins to burn yep to the side of your blinkback belt all right do you want to stay right there you have more movement if you want to use it three more squares 15 feet through the fire you can if you want to make an acrobatics check go for it okay yeah you basically run and leap up over the body of the guy you just killed using him as a stepping stone and you see ash and embers (whoosh) out the side as the pressure pushes him further into the fireplace you leap in the air land next to the one orc that's attacking trinket and right next to where keyleth is currently standing as the earth elemental percy you're up that was way too good your turn percy's turn yeah there are two guys standing right now and a bear oh disadvantage on your next roll percy what've you got okay go for it 29 hits he does into the fire so it does 13 damage runs back falls onto the body of the other orc that's currently now engulfed in flames and catches fire himself he takes six points of fire damage on top of that and is currently in danger of catching fire yes go for it no sharpshooter is your feat trick shot you can't take multiple trick shots but you can sharpshooter and-- made a mistake once we learned 23 hits big bear it's not that hard to hit that is 11 headshot all right so you go ahead and roll damage for that 25 points of damage you-- after you fire the one orc stumbling back and catching flames you turn around and look at the bear fire again it strikes the front of its bony ridge on its head where the brow line is shattering part of the bone and causing it to rear back looks very disoriented it's still angry and ready to swipe but it doesn't really know where it's standing at the moment go for it against the bear go for it hits that actually with that shot you aim for the other part of the brow release it and with that it shatters part of the bear's face you hit a part of the bone ridge that causes the front of the skull to break and you can see part of its face collapses a bit as the bear in a pile on the ground you do yeah you have disadvantage if you do oh oh sorry to use a grit point i was going to say you could yeah so if you want to do that go for it with that you aim take a moment fire the bullet you catch it in a way where it doesn't completely cut the rope it's one of those rare perfect shots where it takes two of the three threads that holds the rope together as they untether it causes his body to (creaks) and it causes him to begin to sway a little bit as the counter-sway comes back it snaps and it manages to catch him to hit the edge of the tree fall into a few branches that break his fall and he tumbles out only taking one point of damage that was a one in a million shot right there one in 20 for you yeah one in a million for anybody else but you're percival okay cool that brings us to keyleth you're up there are two orcs one that's currently on fire and down in the flame trying to pull itself up the other is currently whaling on grog out of anger but is starting to look around and notice it's not a very good situation keyleth what have you got this guy here the fire guy he's actually on top of another larger orc so you burst through the fire is destroyed and you see a bunch of the stone is thrown aside what was the campfire has now been detonated in a burst of snow and earth you burst out are you catching him so you burst up the bigger orc body then rolls off onto the ground and keeps smoldering you catch the guy who's on fire currently holding him above you what are you going to do you're clutching him he's flailing about in your grip fire's out so make a grapple check it's an athletics yep roll a d20 add your strength modifier he rolled a one yep through the flames and the chaos he can't even resist and you have him in a full grapple he's not restrained he can still attack but he's at disadvantage on all his attacks but he can't move his movement is zero and you're currently holding him in place at half-speed yeah you've already done 20 feet to get there so you can move him ten feet one two that's as far as you can drag him there as you're pulling him back and he's like (struggling noises) all right that ends your turn vex you're up right here oh the one behind him is the one that currently is being dragged away after being set on fire okay moves around go for it this is your bonus action you're giving him the attack on the bonus action okay so yeah so you get one attack and he gets both attacks go for it all right go ahead and roll damage on that 12 all right okay so you dart out from behind the tree and release an arrow go for it 20 hits go ahead and roll damage 19 points of damage this arrow strikes him in the side of the throat he gurgles and falls on the ground as he's trying to grab trinket uses that and pounces on top and rips out tears its throat out laura and that orc is done currently at this moment the camp is cleared out except for the one that keyleth's currently grappling and you guys all turn around and you can see now there is the other tent still filled with people the other two here disappear into the mansion's doorway make an intimidation check because of craven edge yeah the orc's looking at you and while it was putting on a brave face as soon as you approach holding out craven edge your muscles rippling with the arcane strength of the blade that his fallen friends have imbued you with as each step happens the shadows that drift off the blade begin to drift up your arm and off your shoulder and from his perspective the whole world goes dark around you as you take each step and that grimace on the orc's face falls into fight-or-flight fear he says no we are the only ones i am the only one we don't deal with goliaths spits blood but it can only get with what little bit of strength it has left only dribbles down the chin in a not-very-aggressive way he goes no i should go to whoever made us i will die here with my brethren i will not run a coward rot in kord's prison half-giant it's a horrific display even the earth elemental takes a step back fails the constitution saving throw yeah pike has gone over to help and he's pretty messed up but pike's already gotten to him at this point while this is happening you come over and aid and manage to keep him from dying he's unconscious still and he slowly comes to consciousness-- yeah it's cyrus bloodied horribly brutalized but alive what's your strength at now what's your strength score at 21 nice fuck dude all righty yeah there's three more in this side over here you guys were-- you should have a higher strength than 20 if you kept it from the last basilisk fight because you're 17 you got how many bonuses from that combat you've got seven bonus benefits so you're 24 then aren't you okay so every time they fail a saving throw your strength goes up by one every two strength you get a bonus that's how it works so your strength is 24 which means your overall strength bonus should be plus seven because your strength modifier normally is plus three correct at 17 with every even number it goes up and it goes up one point by each time you steal a strength every two that you every time it hits an even number 18 20 22 24 the modifier goes up by one so yeah if you're strength's at 24 right now your overall strength modifier is plus seven so it would be a plus four on top of whatever your normal attacking damage was already plus four on top of what you had normally yes as you're untying them they're all thank you thank you so much they took us in the night we didn't know we thought we were dead and some of them start breaking down into tears there's a little girl in there that amongst everyone is probably the most stalwart and is trying to calm one of the men that's sobbing she's like it's okay it's okay and is patting him on the shoulder yes we were up by the base and they came in the night and they killed my wife and they took me they took everything thank you thank you the little girl pipes up and goes yeah yeah wilhand he was as tall as me i haven't seen him since we left town i haven't seen him outside of it vanessa thank you you're very strong too and you see she's a little-- bears are a rough subject for her she's probably seen them eat a few people she knew trinket breaks free and licks you right across the face your beard up to the side again she chuckles okay they were human bodies the rest of the people while you guys are doing this have been escorted into the mansion they're all in there being cleaned up the servants are tending to them and i mean they'll be shat out of there in 24 hours but-- at this point you hear a voice in the distance say hey is everything all right walking out from behind a tree a one-armed man he comes running over i heard a lot of craziness going on those-- you did good saw a little bit of it no but i kept it there just in case and he's still clutching it in his hand (yelps) spins around and swings it loses his grip of it and it (dagger flying) into the tree and he's like runs over grabs it okay thank you so you guys begin taking the bodies over and putting them into the pit on top of the orc that you blew most of the forehead off of well the dryads have vanished by now at this point the magic you inspect the circlet the circlet is more of adornment looks like it was a symbol of power does not appear to have anything magical about it but the uncut gem in the center appears to be a raw ruby probably worth about 150 gold in its current form you also find on their bodies overall from the ones that you have access to an additional 230 gold pieces and amongst the goods that have been gathered here if you should wish to return them or keep them for yourself there is roughly 700 gold pieces amongst the other bits of dried food starting-to-rot vegetables there are a couple boars that were dragged in that have been killed there is one unspoiled fire there are four casks of varying size there are two large large casks there's one giant grain barrel there's one barrel that appears to be of a standard ale and there are two smaller wine barrels only one of them appears to be labeled or at least hasn't been fully rubbed off they're nothing special these are probably grabbed by whoever ran a tavern in westruun and took what they could during the chaos fair enough you've done it pretty well you butcher the boar there's already a stump set up for you previously used for not quite as humane reasons but you manage to prepare the boar cook it over the area here as the sun slowly begins to set you guys take your short rest is everyone taking a short rest okay so you maintain your damage you still maintain your-- it's about five o'clock in the afternoon where the beacon is keyleth would be the one that knows since she's the one who marked it it's probably about an hour and a half's travel on foot to get there okay the door is stationary the door is on the outside of this camp not really i mean you will make a stealth check i'm going to put it at disadvantage because you are it's possible but you're also a giant rocketing half-elf in the sky roll disadvantage 23 all right cool don't forget your point of exhaustion grog from the end of the frenzied rage polymorph you follow her as a crow that's so creepy perfect so as you continue cresting over the top of the tree ridge heading towards the direction that keyleth points out to you you guys swoop down as the treeline comes to an end the snow begins to subside and you reach the base of the stormpeak there make a perception check both of you actually what you got 17 okay mountains does not pertain to the forest more of it's the mountain 17 okay as the sun finally hits the edge of the mountain range and begins to set and the light's starting to diminish you're having a hard time picking out details you know the general vicinity that keyleth pointed at you it takes longer than you anticipated but eventually you come-- and there are a few small caves and entrances to the side of this mountain but after you sweep past once or twice doing a couple loops one catches your eye you look at it from this vantage point it looks like a small inlet like a cavern as you get closer unlike the other rough entrances this one seems intentionally carved in the mountainside in a triangle directly about 30 feet to its peak there is a triangular entrance to the very very base of this mountain that is recessed into the mountain rock itself he cannot you can understand her yeah but she doesn't know if you understand okay as you pull down to the edge of the tunnel the cavern entrance you can see the relatively worn through time and weathering the structure of the tunnel even though it is intentional it has been there for a long time and you can see the effect that time has had on it from what was once a very pristine entrance looking inside it goes dark about 25 feet in do you want to step further into the cavern okay so yeah looking inside about 25 feet past what little bit of daylight that still exists disappears into the shadow of the cavern you don't know anything beyond that okay so you pull out your arrow the shaft ignites as you release it it arcs forward and it lights up a little bit of the tunnel around it tunnel continues-- decent aim i mean it's not a wide target she's shooting it into an open 30-foot space from the narrative standpoint it's fine she could take another shot and it would make it there anyway you can see it go through and it arcs and then disappears you see what looks like an edge and it vanishes past it okay you head down coasting into the darkness does your form have-- if you have darkvision but you crows-- i will look it up real fast hold on hold on no you do not have darkvision as a-- yeah essentially you coast into the shadow hitting a couple things you eventually hit ceiling and coast down and you land harshly taking three points of damage in your crow form as you hit and land and tumble down a few stairs at that point you're in complete darkness right now you can see a faint distant bit of light that's barely creeping in from the entrance you came from around you though nothing okay you come back as a gnome now your darkvision kicks in and indeed you can see there is a smoothly carved tunnel overhead that descends down a long flight of stairs make a perception check and you have 60-foot darkvision as a gnome okay i'm going to look this up real fast because this is important to know for this circumstance does it actually have one hit point then yeah there you go so yeah your vision just hits the edge of the staircase which stops and then continues forward the darkness beyond there is obscured or a hint of blue light that slightly shifts and glimmers beyond your vision it seems like the tunnel ceiling ends as the path continues beyond that and your vision is cut off beyond that you cannot see but you do see a very very faint blue shimmer coming from the tunnel beyond (echoes) scanlan scanlan scanlan (echoes) happen happen-- you can go down further if you want to you'd have to descend the stairs to because the actual tunnel continues down along with the roof and then as it continues past it levels off (laughs) okay all right so you take the wand and the magic missile which gives a very faint candlelight glow around it as it is a burst of arcane energy arcs down and slams into the stonework and filters out the little flash you see at the base of the stairway the stonework there is like a tiled square stonework it looks like the further you descend the more and more there is a constructed architecture to this place however the missile dashes against the stone tile floor at the bottom of the stairway no other seeming reaction that same blue glimmer unchanged okay so (hooting) an owl ascends quickly and spooks you (echoing) alive alive alive (echoing) scanlan scanlan vex takes off on the broom all right you guys head back to the camp make your way into the mansion and rest for the evening you don't rest for the evening okay at this point in time yeah by the time they've been gone everyone's been buried everyone's been taken care of and you make your way back waiting at the door for your sister to return yeah so yeah for not taking your evening's rest you get a second level of exhaustion and your speed is halved okay so we'll go ahead and take a break as the party is resting for the evening we'll be back here in a few minutes guys to continue this next chapter of vox machina's adventure all right see you in a little bit [break] yeah yeah yes i do i do he was a stalwart champion he kept me fed mostly doesn't interest me no just the hunger it's all there is is the hunger so close to being full i'm close feed me and you'll find out yeah it's hard to read the blade but the disposition doesn't seem to have changed any of your previous conversations so seems hard to read it's a sword if you insist grog strongjaw all right you all come to rallying your breakfast your chicken-filled breakfast and some boar freshly cooked by grog who has some dark circles under the eyes from a night of unrestful consciousness tyriok's like yes i can actually find our way back quite easily from this position as we've already traveled this way and i have a good memory for these types of things i have to all right then that can be done and can i take my satchel with me in case i can find some way to recover it all right and he takes the stone arm-slash-satchel and tucks it under his arm all right rest of you and cyrus steps forward all right well lead the way and they all give you guys a thank-you the little girl runs up vanessa and hugs you and hugs keyleth and cyrus and them pull a couple of the orcish weapons that were left behind and arm themselves cyrus actually takes a couple of javelins and is like (sighs) i think the proper way to make vengeance with these all right you guys stay safe really appreciate it yes (laughs) oh right right yeah certainly he pulls it out and hands it to you oh thank you thank you thank you so much puts it back away i appreciate that all right so we'll be off the rest of the people nod they take some of the supplies from the wagons they begin making their way back on the already treaded path you guys made that tyriok knows is safe to get out of the frostweald insight check go for it okay so what do you want to do you guys informed the party of what you saw all right you guys make your way southward to the frostweald frostweald frostwold i will smite you all right you guys continue to head south eventually following the path that you lead along with keyleth's directional-- indeed you do make a perception check being the scout person for this you're in the forest yeah that is true 25 with that you manage to skirt the outside of what appears to be another localized basilisk nest you catch it early enough and guide the party around it to avoid that on your way you eventually make your way to the outskirts of the forest the trees begin to thin out the snow begins to melt the temperature begins to rise somewhat it's still cold-ish but it's less freezing yeah there's been a long-term enchantment over this forest that has kept it the way it is you're not certain as to what the actual reasons are for it eventually as the sun reaches not quite zenith but later morning you find your way to the outside of this tunnel that you and scanlan had found the evening before there before you you guys see the 30-foot-tall triangular entrance to this passageway deeper into the mountain itself all right so go ahead and make an investigation check 17 okay make an investigation check perception is to notice various details in here if you're actually actively searching for trap mechanisms like that investigation is generally more used yeah i mean they're both pretty similar in some ways and it depends on the circumstances perception and investigation depending on the circumstance one or the other for the most part perception would be like if you notice something wrong about the room you'd be like that stone seems different then you would do investigation to try to find out what type of trap it is per se or if you were actively searching for traps that would be more of an investigation like knowing where you've seen around and seeing the terrain to possibly facilitate something like that i know it's all good what did you have again 22 all right as you guys slowly descend the steps as you get about 25 30 feet into the tunnel before it lowers into these stone steps and they're rather large steps each spread of your gait is wider than the common step and these have been around for a very long time you can see where the corners are they're rounded looks like at points in time there may have been flooding in this area that has caused that type of softening of the stonework at the tip though the little bit of moisture that's in this area seems to be from blown-in snow possibly or another source you don't currently see it is pitch-dark in here if anyone would like to-- he has darkvision darkvision darkvision darkvision darkvision absolutely blind okay so you guys have a low candlelight so it gives you a little bit of vision but it's still very very dim you guys make your way down the stairway step to step and you can hear each footstep echoes as you continue downward it progresses deeper and deeper and you begin to see this gentle blue flickering light at the very bottom of the staircase as it begins to approach and your eyes have adjusted to the darkness at this point in time it looks like it could be some sort of water-like movement and as you hit the bottom of the stairway and it evens out into these square stone tiles across the way you see ahead of you what looks to be a singular circular room with no exits from what you can tell at this point just a circular room that loops around and in the center there is a ten-foot pool of a still somewhat still surface of water there is a little bit of movement because there is some sort of a cold breeze that was ejecting out of the tunnel but there is no real source of the wind that you can pick up at the moment as you entered this room that was when you guys were going down the stairway go ahead and make the roll 24 okay 18 okay the two of you there is a very very faint blue glow that is emanating from below the surface of the water that is giving this very very tiny bit of light to the room thankfully because most of you are darkvision-based it doesn't impede you from seeing all the details in the room percy you'll still not be able to make out the fine details but between the two of you inspecting the edges there are no seams there are no doors there are no other passages you do however see script across the opposite side of the room that is chiseled into the stonework itself in elvish script oh sorry this is not elvish elvish was the obelisk what languages do you-- what languages do you know it is a language neither of you know run it across it is celestial are you the only one that knows celestial (laughs) that is okay all right so looking at this it reads and you read it out loud the translation the thing about celestial it's interesting it's a beautiful-sounding language that even the translation to common is built into rhyme it says knowledge dost billow all realms are the shore the sky a window the water a door knowledge dost billow all realms are the shore the sky a window the water a door it's about 30 feet across on a side and it's a ten-foot pool no it's a pretty tight space yeah in the middle so you move around so a ten-foot walkway around it okay go ahead and make a perception check 25 looking down into it you see no bottom you see the glow continues downward and it's almost like there is a very soft faint source of light in there but the water obscures it too much to see a bottom it doesn't disappear into darkness which leads you to believe that it's not endless but you can't make out any details of where it would end or how far that is from where you are you do see what looks to be slow shifting movement of aquatic plant life that is gathered on the edges about ten feet down and further make an intelligence check straight intelligence 15 there is talk of elements here very plainly in the translation it's possible however usually doorways to the planes have a very prominent magical signature to them one that is especially you are pretty sensitive to being an ashari and that is a large part of what your people's charge is you do not get the feeling that this pool is a gateway to another plane per se just a very deep pool hold it up and concentrate for a moment doesn't seem to spark and there doesn't appear to be a reaction drifts from side to side drifts down glimmers occasionally drifts and then is out of sight okay your hand goes in the water it is cold it is in line with most subterranean pools that you've encountered not freezing but very chilly reacts like any other water that you've encountered before it's not particularly murky either keyleth (splash) you dive in pulling yourself down sinking down and you can see the tunnel around you it goes from smoother stone to a little rougher and as you descend you can see the algae and various aquatic plant matter and life that is gathered around until eventually you go down about 40 feet or so your feet hit the bottom and you can see it ends behind you but then before you there is a tunnel there is a continued walkway underwater forward you feel the impact as grog lands right behind you let me see here what's your constitution modifier keyleth two okay yours is five right for the constitution modifier yeah so you can hold your breath for five minutes yeah one minute per constitution modifier for you it's two after you've landed here you're about 30 seconds in looking around grog's there make a perception check with disadvantage because of the water distortion with disadvantage (laughs) it's not hard to see the tunnel continues begins to curve upward about 60 to 80 feet ahead of you it is choked with that heavy algae slowly drifting there but there is a path you can see to swim through where it wouldn't really stop or halt your progress but it curves upward you're halfway through your breath by the way you're now at one minute i'll have both you guys make athletics checks no not athletics oh no you do because you have exhaustion 12 what 15 okay you guys aren't having a huge issue you get forward you can move about half your movement forward every six seconds or so so you manage to make your way up into the center of where the plant matter begins to grow darker and more apparent grog you start making your way through i need you to go ahead and make a dexterity save at disadvantage dexterity at disadvantage because you're swimming underwater in which movement is much harder as well 11 all right you take eight points of psychic damage as suddenly out of the greenish plant matter you see these red tendrils these red vines of algae that begin reaching out towards you one of them brushes against your shoulder and you feel this surge of shock energy almost travel through your nervous system to your head and it's like you have an instantly pounding headache and you feel your muscles begin to tense up make a constitution saving throw you feel your muscles lock up as paralysis takes over you watch as grog suddenly tenses up and the air that's in his lungs escapes in a big heave so do you you push yourself away you jet okay so you pull him back using control water to shove you guys yeah the water's basically pushing you forward like an ice man waterslide and make your way to the other side grog you that's the first round to get you to the bottom there your constitution modifier's five you have five rounds before you're officially drowning so she pulls you in grabs you to the bottom you look up using control water again to concentrate this is going to take you two rounds to get to the top because you're carrying grog's weight you do see the form begin keyleth's face begin rising to the surface eventually she breaks through the water carrying grog who's too heavy for her and then dips right back down in the water you grab and pull grog out and onto the edge and he's locked in place eyes wide yeah as you concentrate you pull this single strain of water out of it's the weirdest sensation you've ever had as the water is pumped instantly from inside your lungs (laughs) yeah it is and the water scatters across the stonework on the side of the pool it takes about 30 seconds before your muscles come back and all of a sudden you're-- control water lasts for up to ten minutes concentration where would you want it to go you can't make water disappear you can part it you can do all kinds of things with it the water still has to go somewhere or you can redirect the flow up to you what do you want to do the abilities you have to choose from are part water redirect flow whirlpool but that's not really in your realm or flood all the way across i'd say it's about 25 20 feet across okay so you dive back down when are you starting to part it all right so okay do you guys follow suit you're diving into water right now you float down because she didn't part the water of the top of the tunnel you guys float down at a natural pace eventually touching the bottom of the subterranean tunnel holding your breath keyleth moves her hands this way and the water in the center of the tunnel actually parts almost like a bubble in front of you you step into that open space now and you can breathe you all catch yourself-- there's still droplets dropping around you as you're holding it at bay and you push it off to the side elements a lot of the water has been forced out of the top for the time being wherever you're going-- yeah however the planet life that was currently drifting freely is all to the ground and is this giant mass of plant matter on the ground that is soaking wet and there i mean there is plant matter all over the entire surface it's thicker on the edges because a lot of it dropped down on itself yeah it looks like a bunch of wet fur on the sides you guys begin walking what's the marching order here who's going first okay grog goes first okay who's after that and keyleth's following up the rear okay has trinket stepped back into your necklace by the way okay just making sure grog as you step past and you're stepping with a squashing sound as your footfalls hit each of the sections of the dark brown-greenish plant matter it's really soggy and keyleth as you're concentrating it's a lot of water to part and you're basically creating this 20-foot tunnel as you begin stepping across you can see the red vines begin to pull their way out but without the water there they can't support the weight of the vine itself so currently they're unable to really shift in your direction you can see them trying you can see the vines (slithering) in the matted mass but they can't actually work towards-- so as you dart across you guys each individually make your way across the other side of the tunnel where the control water spell ends you can see the curvature leading upward there is still that barrier of water that's shimmering right there in front of you you all eventually make it past that big central patch and as it curves upward you can look about 35 feet at a diagonal that way you can see the surface of water that's where it breaks yeah so you guys all take a breath as the water wall collapses behind you rushes up and like a water jet all of you get jettisoned out and have to catch yourself on your feet (laughs) scanlan's more like a waterslide he comes out the end and feet in the air it's fun but-- yeah but you hit the sprinkler head you didn't know was under there (groaning) so you guys all emerge outside of this pool now you take a moment to look around as there is no light source in this room either those with darkvision you look around and you see what appears to be a smooth marble stone floor very intricately carved with four pillars surrounding the exit of the pool that you guys came out of you can see on each of these pillars facing inward or not inward sorry facing outward of these pillars what looks to be these stone lion heads they each face outward the chamber is also circular but much larger it's actually 60 feet across from the 30 feet of the first chamber you came to okay make an investigation check 18 okay as you glance around with the dagger and now that you have light as opposed to the darkvision that was before you can see now the room is a very deep blue cobalt marble and the edges of each of these intricately carved pillars where the base hits the rest of the structure and along the walls you can see what looks like gold and platinum filigree and trim it's a very beautifully very elegantly built room you look around the walls they themselves are smooth with once again no door no exit however you look around the outside of the pool that you came out of and there is a three-foot-wide gold loop around it almost like there's a big circular gold plate that surrounds the pool and inside it is carved a language that you can't understand you recognize it again as celestial all right this one translates to betwixt the chaos our order reigns the ones who made us refined the planes as ages die-- refined the planes as ages die their time an ember the four endure the four remember as you look up as well as you glance at more of the scenery and you put the dagger up right above where the pool is there is a beautiful circular mural the size of the room itself 60 feet across from end to end the ceiling is 40 feet tall glancing up across the mural this beautifully painted image shows flames twisting and writhing in an arced pattern that then twist into broken rock and soil and earth and mountains that then break once again sinking into an angry ocean and that ocean then begins to rise into clouds into the sky those clouds then dissipating and turning into raw flame and continuing the loop in the center of this loop there is a single dark hole in the ceiling make an investigation check scanlan make an intelligence check what are you looking for make it perception i'll say sure why not okay glancing at the circle i mean it has a similar small gold band around the outside of it but this mural is built around this central hole it's about three feet across it's not very big and it goes straight up into darkness correct looking around the gold itself no but you're looking at the actual mural itself this close up there is a texture to the painting itself and you can see embedded within elements of the actual brushwork and where the flames meet the rock you can see hidden lines with what appear to be very very faint runes it's a language you don't understand this is not a spoken language what languages do you know these are rooted in draconic very ancient this is the basis of what most arcane runes are created from as draconic is the base root of arcane writing none of them spell anything you understand with your knowledge of draconic however that is the base root of this writing as ancient as it is okay you have no idea what this is about yeah pike's looking up and says this is beyond me this is very old you know i'm going to make a religion check with her not bad she goes best i can gather these represent the elemental chaos and the center is the prime our world that was crafted out of that chaos when the gods came just like we were told at the platinum sanctuary that's what you told me you found there yeah they're all the same and they all have that giant gold stone lion head facing outward from each of the pillars make an investigation check nothing really catches your attention solid cobalt marble the mouths are closed you take the quall-- all right what are you doing with it okay you hold it up and you see the bauble glows ever so faintly and whenever you drift it over the mural all the runes that are within a foot of it slightly glow as it passes over them almost like a blacklight it reveals them ever so faintly okay you take the water-- you throw it on the column that matches the water overhead you feel this slight grinding shift of stone you glance around and the lion's mouth has opened same crumbling sound of stone and the mouth of the lion is now open as you brush it across the pillar once again the lion mouth opens on the outside of the pillar okay you create this little burst of soil this little knob of wet mud and clay and you circle it smear across the side of the pillar the fourth mouth opens there's a low rumble suddenly each mouth of the lion begins to pour a constant cavalcade of sand the pool immediately fills up you guys noticing this room as wide as it is across the way other holes have opened up in the side and sand is pouring in so you ride up through the top you go up about 60 feet to the very top before you get there you have to take a second to go ahead and rummage and find the rope the rope is on you at all times not in the bag of holding right it's a robe it's-- a pocket on the inside of the robe so you would have to get that from grog first it was probably in the bag of holding okay at this point the sand has now come up to your knees waist area and you're having to climb out and get on top the weight of both of you across it especially with your weight the broom (pff) right okay i thought you were trying to lift him up with you okay you pull up and you come off the top again into this chamber that leads into it you can see with what your vision is a tunnel that leads ahead to a set of double metal doors no from what you can look over there no they are solid metal at this point about half the room is filled now you hear that voice echo up through okay it is a three-foot-wide hole you'll be able to fit one person through there okay yeah so so you get up out of the sand now you guys have been climbing up best you can but as the nature of sand you're still pulling in as it's pouring in now you see now parts of the ceiling are starting to open okay you grab the rod you fly up you take the rod and you set it in place there tie the rope onto it all right at this point now the sand's pushed up you guys are on the last ten feet before it hits the ceiling okay pike goes thank you you grab her and she holds onto the edge of the broom and you guys make it up that way no since the hole is just small enough where you pretty much have to go through single-file so nobody else can climb while you're doing that you guys go through who's coming up first you fly up after them who's going up first okay go ahead and make an athletics check this would be athletics because you're climbing a rope a tiny-- no it's circular 19 okay making your way up it's a long pull all right who's up next okay okay go ahead and do that 25 okay that keeps you going so you guys get up a third of the way who's after you yep make an athletics check 17 okay you guys are all making it up you get about a third of the way up i need the three of you to make your checks again as it is a very tight space and it's a very very heavy pull up you're just like-- 25 again awesome 23 you guys make it up two-thirds of the pathway now you can see now the sand has reached the bottom and at this point you guys who made it up to the top you look up as you notice part of the stonework above goes (fwsh) and sand begins to now fall directly on top of you guys pushing past you i need you guys to make one more check with disadvantage because of the sand because that was what the time limit was going to do as soon as the timer went out that was when the top one went boom and capped off the top this is athletics yeah 24 right this is you coming up from the bottom so you make it up a third of the way now what'd you roll with dis-- 17 with disadvantage 25 you actually have to climb over percy to get past because percy's being held up from the sand that is coming down grog it's starting to catch up to you you i need vax and scanlan you guys make it to the top and pull your weight out of the sand that's now pouring down in that tunnel the top of the tunnel yeah you guys emerge from it and you're now inside a chamber along with vex and keyleth percy and grog pike was brought up by vex 19 total it's a lot of sand you might be able to help a little bit with your cantrip it's more of a puff of wind than a strong force and it's a lot of sand falling it's not going to help tremendously on this circumstance unfortunately as a cantrip sure go ahead and make a strength check okay pike's going to step forward i have to do it she steps forward and puts her shield out all right she manages to direct some of the flow which begins to spray onto the outside of the room begins to fill up one side however that does give a round of no disadvantage to grog and percy roll again yes you do you manage to make it up the rest of the way the rope percy comes out pull him up onto the side pike unfortunately it's too much and loses it the sand comes rushing down on top of you what'd you roll he's almost to the top because you made one check that's your second check now need you to make one more check now as the sand's pouring down it's now come up to you and it's starting to grab the lower part of your legs and you're starting to feel yourself being buried the rope that came down-- roll a perception check grog with disadvantage what did you roll with disadvantage travis and nice so you don't even see the rope that vax dropped it keeps in the sand but you grabbing onto the one that's already up there you hand-over-hand pull up you guys watch as the sand eventually stops and fills the entirety of the tunnel and stops and then (thud slam) grog pulls himself outside manages to brush the sand off it's all in his beard that was the time to do it man so you guys now see there is a long stone brick hallway before you it's solid behind you with a little bit of sand that's now coasted from the corner after pike had diverted it briefly beyond the way about 30 feet ahead of you you see two metallic doors that are closed investigation check you take a moment scanning the floor as you approach coming up to the actual doors you take a minute to look them over they are not locked nor are they trapped okay correct a hallway with two doors okay that would take a short rest to go ahead and set that okay you taking a short rest or no up to you no long rest cures exhaustion (laughs) all right you guys take a short rest you take a breather here if you need to use any hit dice now you can all right so finish the short rest you've reset your armor to fire resistance in the short rest in the time you've taken while there were no traps in the door you guys did notice that there is a very very faint symbol in the metal very large so at first it just seemed like it was part of the door's design but as you step back and rest you glance over at the door keyleth looking at it from this distance you can see the symbol-- --like this this is the symbol of ioun this is the ancient original symbol of ioun this is what is a relief in each of the doors ever so faintly where only at a distance would you be able to really see it yes no it is the exact same make a perception check okay looking about the stonework is pretty consistent here it's old but unlike the weathered entrance a lot of this has not seen the elements since it's fairly buried and even at its seemingly ancient time that it's been here it doesn't appear to be worn looks fairly fresh you don't see any weaknesses you don't see missing stones it is stone yes no actually this is more old classic granite or other deep-earth stones that are used for various forms of construction doesn't have any special properties that you can recognize both doors (creak) open you look into what appears to be a from what you can see because there is a very very faint bit of light emanating from his dagger but beyond that it is pitch darkness percy is the one who cannot see nah it maintains you move 20 feet ahead you enter the room and you can see this chamber is square in size but it is divided it seems to be in three halls there's a path to the right a path to the left and a path ahead of you you can't quite see all the way past the hallway continues to the very edge of your visual range once you enter the chamber however what you can see is to the right and left of you parts of the wall have collapsed like there's piles of rubbles and stone and earth make a perception check at this point okay she does as well looking to the edge of the two pathways you can see there appears to be a little bit of a shimmer or bit of movement like light silk almost like threads shifting entwined it looks almost like a large very very faint web that is draped over one wall on the right and matching on the left side i mean other than the idea of a glimmering thread maybe but it isn't glowing it's not emanating light and it's very thin very wispy and there are a few of them that you can see before the rest of your perspective on the two walls that break it into three passageways you don't see any currently at this position ahead of you in the central chamber you do see what looks to be a small pit like a divot almost like a cauldron about ten feet across similar in size and circular structure as the first water pool you guys dove into except for it comes to a convex end with nothing visible in it there's like stones built around the outside of it you actually do not sense any spiders okay make an investigation check and that is one of the entities that you can check with that okay what'd you roll taliesin it is a thread and there are multiple-- as you get closer you can see there are many threads that are partway through this 15 20-foot wide hallway on the far right that you've gone to and inspected this network of threads appear to be attaching at the halfway point and then draped against the wall what looks like a spiderweb made of this thread all converges in the center that's the best you can make of it you do not sense any celestials but do mark off your spell slot for that use i assumed you were keeping track of that well going forward-- that's okay yeah essentially it's a 15 20-foot wide thing the web only starts about partway and encompasses the side of it behind the webs the hallway continues and then ends and then continues right it's almost like it's a square room that has walls here that split it into three different passages and they all converge again on the opposite side make a perception check 16 you notice at the end of the two hallways on the sides beyond the spiderweb in the corner there are two small five six-foot-wide pools of water similar to the ones you dove into that are lined with stones and a little bit of gold trim similar to what you guys saw in the previous room so you have the rubble's on the side you have the spiderwebs you have the pools at the end there and you have the empty cauldron in the center piece but you cannot see unless you move further forward you cannot see beyond where those hallways converge on the opposite side nah it's 25 feet from the doors you guys entered in vax okay as you walk up make a perception check as they're having this conversation looking about and floating back i know your passive as well but even mid-conversation with him as you kept an eye out you see too that to the front of each of these walls that bisects the room what you thought was just a wall now as you've had time to study it in quiet as everybody else has been talking during these experiments-- scanlan you probably would've noticed this too-- the wall is the separator's actually a giant obelisk on each side just like the one that you saw in the frostweald on the way in that the basilisks were around you see they're much newer they're not as weathered by the ages and they're these two markers with the symbol of ioun carved into them okay looking at the base of it you see there is the same triangular symbol there you place the ioun stone into the recess in the obelisk as you do it glows faintly the obelisk itself tends to give off the same teal greenish-blue glow the other one also does the same at which point the darkness across the room is immediately dissipated as two previously unseen braziers across the way burst into flame lighting the opposite side of the room you can see what looks to be a series of heavy steps that lead up to a higher platform on the opposite side of the room you can see two pillars at the edge on the very top of this raised platform that meet the ceiling yeah there's all the stuff on the sides and the central room has that pit make an investigation check nothing catches your attention are you guys all moving in the different ways the same way which way are you taking you can move around the web on that it only covers half the path you still have about seven to ten feet of clearance between where the web starts and the wall mm-hmm okay you guys all quietly move forward stepping through these passages stepping around you can see like i said the crumbled walls in the far corner you can see the webbing there there are the small pools at the far end corners before they converge again into the central chamber where that giant platform is you guys are partway across now are you stopping okay you guys keep walking carefully scanlan are you doing anything okay you appear on the opposite side and you look around what you didn't see from the shadow that was being cast past the braziers to the right of you scanlan you see a large form that is there as a pile a crumpled pile on the top of this platform what catches your eyes and you guys see this too as you begin to walk up as scanlan appears and glances over as you get closer you can see there is what looks to be a cold blue marble that is right there and you see it being turned and held by what looks to be a very faintly lit giant paw you can see two eyes that glance up and glance over at scanlan amongst the shadows the same color as that blue marble as it glances at scanlan and it is massive in comparison to your tiny gnomish frame the marble is then tucked deep into what looks like hair of some kind before it disappears the eyes still glowing the blue color suddenly the form begins to move as two giant arms (impacts) and a voice comes billowing out of this entity i have watched you come the creature now stands on all fours a good 15 20 feet taller than you scanlan a body similar and lionlike to osysa's only thicker and rippling with muscle beneath the fur the face is masculine and human-like cheeks adorned with ceremonial marks head wreathed in a thick mane of red-brown hair two enormous feathered wings stretch out from its back with a giant whoosh a whoosh of wind that tends to cause the braziers to shift in place and it looks at you for a second expectantly then to the rest of the others it mounts itself there turns so it's facing both you and the rest of you as you all approach you you seek power glory retribution i know your quarry and i know your goal she has told me i can show you but all great knowledge should not be given you must be proven it must be earned it must be earned and as his voice roars the room echoes and you can see wind begin to whip all around you glancing over your shoulder you guys can see now the empty pit in the center of the hall behind you is now whipping into a whirlwind and what appears to be a small centralized cyclone that's now rising up meeting the ceiling staying stationary in place arcing there the braziers flame up even brighter now the flames you can feel the heat even from your distance at this point you can see now the sphinx is baring its gleaming white teeth there at the top what is my name roll initiative all righty all righty so initiative roll ooh okay all righty so 25 to 20 (laughs) damn all right 20 to 15 19 all right oh yeah we got flickering braziers guys dwarven forge has cool stuff thank you guys all right so that brings us to 15 to ten grog anyone else oh and pike is actually before grog all right percy you're up first make an investigation check 21 as you rush over you look down into the pool the surface itself is disturbed by the wind that's blowing in this chamber however looking into it below the surface you don't see-- it's darkness you don't see a continuation you don't see anything behind it the water doesn't seem natural okay you put the mask in and your hand moves into it your hand gets extremely cold suddenly you don't see it beneath the surface it almost vanishes below the water it's really unsettling you pull it up and the water is there in your mask you throw it and the water it evaporates and the flames flicker slightly but they's too strong and it doesn't seem to have much of an effect on the brazier yep that's your move and your action all right that ends percy's turn vax you're up teeth are bared and it's sitting there looking at all of you waiting you could yeah you can move and then hold your action to a trigger point if you want to you're right here around this way okay you can move there go ahead and roll for hide okay okay got you all right at the end of your turn the entire-- the wind that's blowing there's grains of sand that are picked up into it and you guys feel like there's something out of place this whole area like this sudden drift you feel like the air in your lungs gets butterflies for a second and something even though this place is stationary it's almost like the whole place shifts i need everybody to make a constitution saving throw yes constitution saving throw okay while most of you guys manage to withstand it scanlan and grog and vex the wind feels like it's knocked out of you and like you were suddenly stretched thin and you can't understand it you glance-- right now it's hard to really tell scanlan lurches forward for a second grog and vex you're right next to each other you both glance at each other and you can see it's like grog's skin has aged suddenly his-- around his eyes it's grown a little more sunken his muscles have sagged slightly he looks not ancient by any means but it looks like he's seen about another 15 to 20 years of travels you also have although due to your gnome lineage it has less of an effect and no one's noticed it at this distance but if anyone gets a quick glance you'll see a few grey hairs starting to sprout on the side of scanlan's head all right vex you're up you feel like you've been pulled through something but it doesn't have a mighty effect although grog glancing at vex you can see there is definitely a little bit more of a weathered look to her crow's nests forming deep-seated frown lines okay there doesn't seem to be a reaction pike goes no i mean the gods that were at the beginning there's-- there was pelor and melora and i mean they're the ones who cast away the elements the chaos that this realm was first i don't know and she seems-- she's bungled and unable to really formulate what you're asking make a religion check if you want to wow wow it's the reverse percy tonight you try and think back to the conversation you had with highbearer vord in the platinum sanctuary and your mind's a blank you can't recall any of that conversation it has nothing to do with dragons this is the creation myth of all of existence however you still have your action if you want to do something you're by the pool it's right to your right and there's this sphinx now rearing-- you what you put your-- you dip your hand in the water the hand once it breaks the surface it vanishes into darkness below the water you don't even see there's no visual on it no it doesn't hurt it's cold it's very cold pull it back out your hand is wet and it drips and you shake it free you move one two three four five six you're not going to be able to get completely out of sight (laughs) unless you want to jump in the water correct yeah all right so that ends vex's turn scanlan you're up the sphinx is still there growling at you she is beyond me what is my name little scrumptious one you can if you want to yeah yeah what do you want to hold it for okay remember you guys who are holding your action you can interrupt and release at anything if it doesn't happen be aware of that all right so it now goes to the sphinx's turn the sphinx takes a step forward to the edge of the stairway and (roars) gives out this earth-shattering roar that shakes-- a couple of stones and dust that are loosened from the ceiling falls down i need everybody to make a wisdom saving throw yes it is it's not a spell it is a magical effect what do you get advantage from from being a gnome let me double-check here just to be sure (laughs) okay against magic so yeah you would have advantage nope 17 grog vex what was it you rolled again 24 and you rolled 17 that's right all right so as the roar pierces through the hallway most of you guys steel yourself grog scanlan pike and vax you feel the sudden reality of how fearful and dangerous this creature is you stepped into the lair of an ancient powerful entity and you feel like your very life is at stake you guys are frightened for one minute frightened means you have disadvantage on ability checks and attack rolls while you can see it and you cannot willingly move closer to the creature so you have to either move adjacent like same distance from it or away you can make a saving throw every turn to try and resist it it is now going to stay right where it is that brings it to pike's turn pike doesn't quite know how to deal with this whole circumstance she is going to cast-- pike is going to reach forward to you grog take a step this way pike's going to reach forward and cast freedom of movement on you at fourth level so for the next hour you cannot be paralyzed or restrained you can't have your speed reduced via magical effects you're still feared but-- you can shake that with a rage yes but yeah for the next hour it's not concentration either she says go get him grog all right that ends pike's turn grog you're up straight-up all right you rush up the stairs with a precariousness of-- we'll say you rush up here for the sake of positioning 23 that hits it's all against him roll attacks you're not going to kill it in one hit 24 damage all righty nice that hits okay makes its first constitution saving throw fails its second so you steal another strength point and the sphinx's strength goes down to that you're at 25 now okay right but 25 is the max for this sword it says on the weapon it should be under ability all right so you run up and swing two heavy swings after going into a rage to resist the fear effect you grin and bear it go over and swing twice hacking into the side of it its hide is very strong and there's almost like this weird resistance on the outside of its body like its very force of existence and personality is keeping the blade from doing as much damage as it should but you still strike true slamming into it twice you pull the strength from it as you do a voice in your head goes yesss at this point as you look at the blade the blade now begins to emanate a shadow aura stronger than previously that begins to also form around your upper shoulders drifting the blade suddenly extends another foot the edges of it that were smooth project with a jagged thorny outside the blade itself now is longer thicker and far more dangerous-looking than it was before until your next short rest all attacks with the sword do an additional 2d6 necrotic damage okay all right at the end of your turn the sphinx is going to use its three legendary actions is going to use three of them to cast a spell out of order it's going to go ahead and call down a flame strike onto the twins you can actually yes correct 23 hits okay what was the second one it was-- 18 hits over here okay all right as you're doing that reaction shot it calls down the column hits both of you before you can burst off all of a sudden as you look over at your brother you feel this rising energy before all of a sudden this entire area is (boom) consumed in burning holy divine light i need both of you guys to make a dexterity saving throw yeah evasion happens automatically as part of your reaction to that so yeah you rolled a what 30 dexterity saving throw 16 for you okay right so vex you take half damage from this you take full damage unfortunately so that's going to be 21 points of fire and radiant damage to you 21 is the half you however have resistance to fire liam so the 22 points of fire damage you would've taken is reduced to 11 right so yeah so you would take so you would take the same but a quarter because of halving fire damage to take from that well radiant damage you're not resistant to so i'd say it would be 17 points of damage there you go you rush out of the flames and find your way around the obelisk however you have to wait until your turn before you can take a look at that all right now it comes to keyleth's turn it doesn't seem to have any effect it is (laughter) okay the water comes out as a column doesn't appear to be coming to an end you're not quite sure where it's being drawn from it's this constant stream and as it hits the flame (tshhh) but the flames aren't going out it's all turning to steam and it's filling the room with steam and the more and more it pours into it the more and more the room is beginning to become obscured and making it hard to see okay as you do the streams stop water the pools are still completely still where you've pulled it out of seemingly unbothered other than the little bit of wind that's blowing and have not lessened in their volume at all what this place you are make an intelligence check 19 thinking back about the stories you've heard which isn't a whole lot necessarily are we good on the stream we had a little flicker you recall go through poring through all the information that was given to you you don't know a whole lot about the history element it isn't a part of the druidic training experience but based on the discussion with highbearer vord no mention of a sphinx nothing like that i think that's your turn though unless you want to move okay end of your turn the shimmering webs on each side flash for a second and stepping out of them you can see a slightly translucent not fully physical spider on each side this spider immediately (skittering) up to percy and this one (skittering) up to vex versus you percy rolled a one completely missed it goes and reaches out towards you out of the way vex however that is a 23 that hits you go ahead and suffer-- (laughs) suffer nine points of psychic damage the spider upon biting you dissipates out of existence it actually bites you and then its form (shhk) into your head and causes this psychic backlash and feedback in your head the other spider misses you and remains in existence top of the round percy you're up you have not gone yet do you want to yeah okay what is the dc on the resilient sphere i believe if it's through the-- the hand cone i think is 20 now isn't it okay so it doesn't make its dexterity saving throw doesn't matter for this one that is 21 yep so you attempt to create the sphere around it as you can see it begins to encase the sphinx and the sphinx just-- its head after staring at grog goes (growls) and as it roars at you the sphere that's formed around it shatters and the arcane essence is scattered about the room and vanishes he sits there glaring at you all right so that's percy's turn now percy what are you doing sure okay you shout out and the sound of celestial being spoken has this echo to it this lux and it fades afterward it has no immediate effect the wind seems to swallow it around you from all the noise going around the sphinx has no interest go for it 19 hits a what (laughs) no there isn't it's okay it is a magical sword you're attacking with right this spider is scattered into ether okay go ahead and roll it's more about finding the right place to do the proper damage but that works go ahead and roll damage okay you cut through some of the threads it limps on one side but it's still keeping itself aloft all right that hits go ahead and roll damage 15 points of damage all right with that the second strike the thread dissipates and turns into smoke and vanishes from existence none of the threads remain it vanishes go ahead and roll an investigation check okay 19 glancing at the wall behind-- it says in celestial windows and doors it says windows and doors that's your turn percy's over vax you're up the obelisk in front of you this actually aside from the symbol of ioun there's no writing on it okay go for it all right what was it sorry it was all right the second two hit so go ahead and roll damage ten and eight all right you throw two and it cuts a few threads and the path of it falls limp but the web stays up correct yeah you can't move any closer to it right now but you can make a saving throw at the end of your turn to try-- one step to the right all right okay so you're still in the fear effect all right by the way grog go ahead and make a saving throw to resist the effect so it's gone even though you-- yeah it's wisdom all right you're still under the effect and scanlan actually roll it again right you resist i mean it doesn't affect you but it still persists if you stopped raging then the fear would kick in this is wisdom you would i'd say sure 12 yeah the fear still strikes in your heart all right vax that's the end of your turn all right i need everybody in here to go ahead and reroll initiative as the time flux in the room all of a sudden flickers and time seems to shift and move everyone reroll initiative all right so 25 to 20 20 okay okay 20 to 15 all right we got percy keyleth grog all right and then ocho pike's before you yeah man it sucks all right that ends that count it is now its turn the time shift actually managed to lose your turn both you and scanlan you guys shifted through the top of the order i know basically scanlan you can go simultaneously now you lose your turn i mean it's time it's shitty you know what it doesn't specify i'll say go ahead it starts at the top of the initiative round so you know what vex your turn go for it go for it doesn't specify i could be a dick about it but you know it's more fun to not have your turn lost what you got make a perception check 29 nope solid stone ceiling i mean there's the brazier but it's pretty close to flame and you don't know if rope will survive that yeah you retrieved it yeah okay you take the rod and you (click) in the middle of the air you take the rope tie it around real fast over everything and the sphinx now looming forward being attacked and flanked by the two of them you take the rope and jump into the water there's no splash you disappear into the water you guys watch her vanish into the pool yeah do you pull yourself out okay you guys there's a breathless moment and suddenly vex comes out from the rope drenched in water as you say k-a out loud the sphinx goes-- there's a glimmer in the eye at you and it continues on looking over at grog and scanlan all right that ends your turn scanlan you're up at the end of your turn the water that's around you it's freezing cold and you suffer eight points of cold damage from the process of submerging into it however once that damage hits your body heat manages to recover and it turns back to normal water temperature so okay the dc is 20 on that what is the saving throw for that one wisdom eyebite it is that is a 27 yeah it resists the eyebite okay go for it that's fantastic okay all right so you take your d10 inspiration die at the end of your turn it goes to the lair count lair count's already happened this turn so i'm not going to keep that going however the sphinx does take its turn it's going to go ahead and loose a claw attack at both of you against scanlan that is-- okay all right roll a d10 it rolled a 25 to hit so yeah so roll a d10 and that's how much it reduces it by by eight that brings it to a 17 what's your ac so it still hits you hits you for 28 points of slashing damage as its giant claw (whoosh) rakes across you the sheer impact almost throws you off the top of the platform and you can feel the blood beginning to seep from the wound under your armor it turns around and rapidly does a full-on claw attack towards you grog that is going to be a 27 to hit you also take 28 points of damage it is magical damage however you don't-- doesn't matter for you being it's a resistance against slashing so you take 14 points of slashing damage from the strike that's going to end its turn that brings us to percy okay what she hears you yeah okay so you take your action you start pulling the stones away as you rummage through you pull apart and you begin to see there is-- where there was hard rocks you're starting to find finer stones until eventually you find sand just like the sand that you encountered in the previous room okay you reach in and as your hands disappear into the sand there's no resistance once they hit the sand they vanish into the sand okay you shove your head through all right percy that's your turn you going to move yeah that's going to be the rest of it all right keyleth you're up percy you also suffered seven points of damage from the crushing and bludgeoning on your head as it passed through okay you put your hand in and your hand is still-- it's hot because of the flame that's on it as you put it in it is a scorching hot pain you take two points of fire damage just from placing it in there okay into the flame all right that's going to be your turn there at the end of your turn he's going to go ahead and use a point to do a claw attack against scanlan again hm that's a natural 20 yeah you take 38 points of slashing damage as the claw grabs you and slams you against the stone and you can feel the claw actually pierce part of your throat and as it withdraws you can feel the blood beginning to pour it didn't hit anything vital but it's a serious wound-- all right that ends keyleth's turn that brings us to grog this thing is tearing into scanlan (laughs) okay you leap into it pike looks over and sees you whoosh into the cyclone and vanish okay you guys get the idea of what's going on we're going to now bring this because now shit's happening so grog after seeing this though you cannot say to anyone what you found yet you having no tether are drifting away from the portal and seeing it disappearing slowly away from you what are you going to do you grab your earring you say it there's no response you guys hear nothing and you're about 15 feet away from it now you can go ahead and roll for an attack 23 whoosh you fling it through and it catches something you feel it's taut you start pulling your way in pulling your way in pulling your way in go ahead and roll damage laura and yep plus 2d6 necrotic damage 30 30 points of damage okay you pull the chain and you make your way to the portal you put your hands out pull through and as you do the chain in your hand-- you look and you can see now grasping onto the edge of the wall you see pike sweat dripping down her face as craven edge has embedded itself into her abdomen she's holding it and she looks at you with a gritted face and she goes it's okay grog you're back that's all that matters doesn't have a chance yet at the end of this turn it uses the last two points of its legendary actions to teleport okay all right so now we get to go ahead and roll for this i believe let me go ahead and check what level it is i believe it's a-- all right this is a 7th-level spell here hold on so dc equals ten plus level so it's dc 17 using an ability check roll d20 and add five trying to beat a 17 yes 16 one under you go to counterspell but the image of its head and seeing pike wounded it's too much for you and your hand shakes and you can't manage to clarify the dispel magic as the whole sphinx vanishes and appears right next to pike all right that brings us to vax at the end of your turn it's not in your sight by the way you don't see it you can yeah around the edge go for it all right 13 24 15 middle one hits eight points it does get sneak attack because it's adjacent to pike oh you're at disadvantage to all the attacks yeah wait i'm sorry i thought those were your three attacks right but pike's still adjacent that's one of the ways you can get sneak attack is either having advantage or an ally's adjacent 33 so one dagger two of them you throw and they vanish into the cyclone consumed and thankfully return with magic or they would be gone for good third one you throw it stabs into the shank of the sphinx who growls turns back to pike all right is that your turn 20 you manage to finally shake off the fear all right you can yes you're there all righty now produces two spiders jump out of the web both of them the only thing they see rush up to vex that is a natural 20 and a two (laughs) so the second one misses you first one you take 16 points of psychic damage and that one vanishes on the impact all right that ends their turn up to the top vex it's your turn i would say make a wisdom saving throw at the sight of what you've done to pike and all that is happening this is to see if you can shake from the stupor of what has happened he's not responsive right now okay so you rush over right there you can you can see grog as you rush around the corner you can see the sphinx there you see pike with craven edge partially embedded in her abdomen the chain now lax as grog is standing on the outside of the portal holding it in his hand his eyes wide the rage has faded now by the way yeah you could cast cure wounds if you want sword is still inside of her right now yeah you can try and pull it out if you want to make a strength check roll a d20 add your strength modifier and for the one who normally can't find the physical strength of activities like this through the inspiration of seeing-- yeah and that clear image crystallizes in your mind of when that glabrezu snatched her from you once and with that you find the strength to persevere you reach out and grabbing the jagged blade take nine points of necrotic damage in touching the outside of the blade but you pull you can see the blood forming at the edge of your fingers as you yank it outside of pike's body and it clatters to the ground at the base of grog's feet grog's still seeing this all before you eyes wide open mouth agape okay what level level three so 3d8 plus i think it's-- what's your modifier for wisdom so 3d8 plus three and that will end vex's turn scanlan you're up that'll be the end of your turn 17 okay good to know okay you dimension door into the cyclone you find yourself on the outside of the wind before it grabs you and pulls you in you step through a portal and you're now drifting out in an expanse of air and cloud there's no up there's no down there's no left or right you see various masses of land slowly rotating in place as you see different gusts of wind floating about you drift by and see a single stone that has carvings on it however you have no anchor and you are drifting away from the opening you came through correct so you were-- okay you do that there's it's air you're still drifting away all right that brings us to the top of the initiative round let's see for this one i need everyone in the room to go ahead and make another constitution saving throw 24 vex what'd you get keyleth 18 okay pike makes it okay so you rolled a 14 all right so keyleth vax and vex all three of you guys suddenly feel the wind pulled out from you once again and you all age and now i'm giving you the specifics here you're aging each time this happens ten years all three of you bones are starting to ache a little bit not terribly but a little more than usual your body's now starting to feel the wear of time passage yeah 25 for those who got hit before the first one was 15 now it's an additional ten to those who were hit yes it's not huge it's not like a major difference you know 25 years to a human to percy would be a lot harsher than it is to you guys it's minor differences it is now the sphinx's turn the sphinx is now going to (roars) roar even louder this time this roar echoes out with a shockwave i need everybody except for scanlan to make another wisdom saving throw ten and you were still frightened from previously right because you did not shake that you dropped the rage all right pike all right all right so vax suddenly as the blast hits the fear hits you again as the sound vanishes and you can't hear there's nothing you are completely deafened as are you and pike however because you were previously frightened you find your muscles tense up and you are both paralyzed as well you cannot move you cannot speak you cannot-- you are afraid and deaf yeah all right percy it's your turn this is vex here you do have freedom of movement so you are not currently affected by paralysis look at you remembering your buffs buddy so the fear still hits you and your muscles tense but you looking over at pike now frozen in place you remember everything that's transpired and that holy divine energy that she imbued upon you glows from the inside and your muscles return to you and you're still able to function percy you're up around here make another wisdom saving throw okay holding your action all right keyleth actually at the end of percy's turn the sphinx is going to go ahead it's going to use one of its actions to do a claw attack now against-- this is going to be against pike that is going to be a 15 which misses the claw even though she's paralyzed-- actually no he has advantage on the attack because she's paralyzed rolled a one on the second one manages to hit her but the armor and the shield takes the brunt of it not dealing any physical damage to it there's now frustration in the sphinx's voice as it's growling with each one of these screams now it is your turn keyleth does it say on the fire elemental it should say movement flight well for the elemental form here which i have a list of your elemental forms just in case fire elemental speed of 50 feet no it cannot fly it moves as a flame across the ground okay it's over there yeah the robe that produces the rope is on the ground right now next to vex what are you doing 15 20 25 30 35 40 and then you drop your form to grab the rope and you're grabbing the what the rod all right so you click the rod off you now have the rod with the rope on the end of it no you-- in dropping the form you've used most of-- i'd say you have one more square of movement left this way or this way okay so you throw the immovable rod to her make a dexterity check easy enough for you yeah you catch the rod no issue all right so is that your turn all right that ends keyleth's turn at the end of keyleth's turn it's going to use another legendary action this one it's going to go ahead and reach out and strike at you vex as you're now holding the rod that's going to be a 29 to hit you suffer 28 points of slashing damage as its giant claw rakes across the front of your body almost tossing you off your feet from the sheer force of the blow 28 points that brings us to grog you've gotten your senses back now at this point you look at her and she's still frozen in place she can't move and you can see the sweat's still pouring from her face the wound has stopped bleeding the wound is still fresh and visible anyway anyway before you guys start doing this whole thing take your turns to do stuff grog what else do you want to do on your turn okay craven edge is on the ground yeah okay ending grog's turn it is pike's turn pike cannot move fails the saving throw unfortunately is still paralyzed still frightened okay what are you going to do no response nothing you've got one more try before your turn's up this is-- nope that is your turn however in the six seconds you shout out you come up with and shout out those three things that ends percy's turn at the end of percy's turn it's going to use its third legendary action to go ahead and make another strike at vex holding the rod 25 to hit takes another claw and rakes you for 28 points of slashing damage vex falls unconscious on the ground from the blow the rod clacks to the ground behind her that ends that turn all right oh shit i did that out of order it's fine that's my fault percy shouldn't have got that turn but we'll say it happened it's fine vax you're up the rope clenches onto your neck and you feel like you're being choked suddenly without even realizing this as you shout this out all of a sudden a lasso is thrown around your neck and pulls back and cuts off your air supply and you vanish into the cyclone the rope goes taut pulling you come through the portal and you can see indeed scanlan's about 30 feet away and drifting right which is why you're gaining on him but it's still going to take a moment as you're both still drifting because he also leapt through yep all right so that's going to be the end of your turn vax this spider now is going to leap over as two more or sorry three more leap out of this they all rush up to keyleth she's the one visible person there and all making strikes against you that is 19 to hit eight 23 and ten all right so you take 12 points of psychic damage as two of the spiders dissipate leaving nothing but a psychic mist behind all right top of the turn vex i need you to make a death saving throw six mark off one of your failed death saving throws scanlan your turn you're floating out in space and you see all of a sudden through the portal vax come rocketing towards you hand forward clutching a rope in one hand arm outstretched towards you what do you want to do you dimension door and you appear right at the doorway you cannot dimension door through dimensions but you make your way to the outside of the door you are still drifting with the momentum you had going backwards so you appear back at the door and start going backwards again you can grab the rope you see him vanish there's the rope there that vax is carrying you can grab onto that and wrestle through with that scanlan manages to pull himself through the portal landing onto the side right there and you're fine now that's probably going to take your full action everything to get there but you're out-- i'll give you a bonus sure because your movement she's doing pretty rough yeah all right healing word what level are you doing okay so that's 3d4 plus five yes 3d4 plus five finishing up scanlan's turn-- all right i need everybody in the room to roll another constitution saving throw except for you you're not in the room oh sorry keyleth pike succeeds 17 21 all right so at the end of your turn you would yes actually no i think that's gone off of you now it's fine so vex you come to consciousness and you age another four years i rolled a four it's a d20 every time yeah it is now the sphinx's turn there next to scanlan and percy two claw attacks against you that is a 28 and 21 okay which reduces it to a-- right so the second one would miss so the first strike hits you for 28 points of slashing damage the second one scrapes across the arcane barrier that appears before you from the brooch and resist that that's the end of its turn percy you got your turn last turn when you shouldn't have but i'm letting that fly-- oh sorry you were holding it yes i confused myself so yeah now it's your turn you did nothing what have you said so far right okay so you have two more if you wanted to do anything taliesin you can move up to there i think not for your full movement unfortunately at this point all of a sudden the braziers flicker out you notice as the wind cyclone begins to slowly drift to a minor wind curl at this point in time grog if you wanted to pull on that rope it would be a good time with that you as you're drifting off you turn around and see the doorway where the rope goes taut and the door begins to close you're pulling yourself in and suddenly you're yanked through and come shooting out of it on the side with that-- --the angry demeanor of the sphinx has entirely shifted and now it goes from like this low feral position to a proud honored beast putting its paws forward its shoulders high you have earned a name it raises a paw like this at which point all the paralysis fades all the fear fades all the effects fade the age is not dispersed hold on a second let me see what it can do actually no it goes forward and looks at you who's looking the worst for wear comparatively and says i can help but one of you and his paw goes out and touches you there's a warm glow and the age vanishes from you however that is the extent of my magic this day perhaps the little one could help a few at this it is but a rather challenging restoration pike nods i can do that i can do that i apologize for the formalities but it is a pleasure to meet you vox machina kamaljiori he gives a nod looks to you and says i admire your impatience the vestiges that you seek some have been destroyed over this epoch others lie scattered across the planes some are sealed or hidden others have found an owner you carry one now i see the sphinx backs up and turns around on the steps and lays down crossing its paws glancing at you all shoulders high and a smile it's warm it's this interesting contrast to when you first entered well i happen to carry a vestige here if you will take it gets up and turns around to the back of the platform takes the marble from beneath its fur and holds it up to one of the doorways which switches-- it pulls something from within (shing) and you see this single thin blade that vibrates as he pulls it out the door closes it puts the marble away the blade goes into its teeth and it steps back down the stairs takes the blade from its hand as it stops and holds it out it's impossibly small in its hand it looks very dinky here i keep the mythcarver granted to me by the white duke himself before his passing we were friends long ago it is yours he takes the blade and sets it down on the stone but you seek the others that remain yes fenthras the wrath of the feywarden a bow that felled titans it was lost in the feywild in the calamity it now acts as the heart of a cancerous tree corrupting the verdant land there the plate of the dawnmartyr beacon of protection to the chosen of pelor gathers dust on a wall in the city of brass a trophy won by a fire giant in a card game from a suutan bloodline that once donned it don't worry i wrote all these down for you guys i know i got this for you guys cabal's ruin a magic-devouring cloak once used by an assassin to eliminate the unscrupulous den of druja it is now worn by a merchant-warrior with a missing eye in the walls of ank'harel the spire of conflux a staff born from melora's very breath was devoured along with its previous owner by a goristro named yenk in the endless maze of the abyss the titanstone knuckles were taken from the brutalized corpse of their proud owner now worn by a terrible half-giant turned tyrant in westruun i sense you know this tall one i can taste your fear from here whisper blade forged from metal pulled from the far realm was a center to many a dark ritual it now lies at the bottom of the ozmit sea sunken with the lost ship the shrew in a storm 300 years ago near an island of glass know that all life is connected on an impossibly small level beyond the mind's ability to understand on your level ideas transcend distance language many share dreams thoughts inspirations without knowing the fact that you are now aware of these others too may now be drawn to the search as well beware now go you have earned the name you have earned the knowledge the race is on and with that sand begins to erupt from the two piles of rubble swirling in a giant whirlwind of blasted stone and sand you guys have to cover your eyes as it begins to completely consume the vision around you you see the sphinx back up towards the top of the platform before the sand consumes even within 15 feet ten feet five feet of your vision you lose sight of your friends around you and for a second the panic hits you before the sand comes to a stop and drops to the ground looking around you stand at the base of the triangular cavern entrance by the mountain range where you first entered the temple and that's where we'll end tonight's game well done guys yeah there's a list for you guys yes actually in which case i will give this to you as you now have access to its capabilities no the mythcarver it's a legendary longsword this incredible silvered blade once belonged to the white duke himself and many more master bards before him it resonates with nearby musical tones it acts as a plus three longsword and the weapon deals an additional 1d6 force damage upon a hit whenever you use your bardic inspiration feature you gain advantage on attacks with this weapon until the end of your turn so if you were to give somebody-- use your bonus action before your attack you would get advantage on any attacks with the weapon and whenever you use your cutting words feature against an enemy the target also has disadvantage on its next saving throw as grog looks at his feet the blade that still laid there before you tethered to you by chain still remains at your feet as you see the chain amongst the sand still jagged still extended still in its full form all right so well done everyone we'll pick this up next week for the 50th episode so excited (cheering) i know it was long i wanted to try and get through this before we started the 50th yeah sorry guys so long hope we're cool all right you guys well thank you so much for watching have a good night and is it thursday yet
